After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I were not such a big Tina Turner fan, this piece could have just as easily been titled, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” Or, if I wanted to alert the headline glancers as to what this column was really about, “What Conservatives Talk About When We Talk About Marriage Redefinition.”
Contrary to what many had predicted, this summer’s historic Supreme Court decision on gay marriage did not put the issue to rest, as evidenced by the controversy earlier this year surrounding a Kentucky county clerk, Kim Davis, who refused to issue a marriage certificate to a same-sex couple. Because the issue continues to pop up in the news, and because I still hear many of my friends discuss it, I think it is a good moment to adumbrate what I believe are the two strongest conservative arguments both for and against gay marriage. In doing so, I hope to accomplish two things: one, to show my liberal friends that it is possible for a conservative to oppose gay marriage on non-religious grounds, and to do so without being a bigot, and two, to show my conservative friends that there is a genuinely conservative argument to be made in favor of gay marriage.
To understand either argument—as well as the title—one must first understand that the principled conservative objection to gay marriage, as it has been argued for in the United States, is that marriage should not be only about love. That is, the state’s interest in marriage is not love, but rather stability and continuity. The reason the government is in the marriage business at all, we conservatives say, is to encourage the creation of stable social units in which important values can be inculcated: Marriage partners learn to delay gratification, both for the sake of each other and for their children; spouses learn the importance of going without, both by promising to forgo potential future sexual partners and by obligating themselves with children. Taking care of a young child emphasizes the inevitability of monotony, and, possibly, drudgery, and thus tempers people’s more mercurial passions. It is not hard to see why the state takes an interest in promoting these values.
Of course, this is not to say that love is unimportant. Instead, all I mean to point out is that when one thinks of why a theoretical state got involved in the marriage business in the first place, the answer probably is not to promote ephemeral and subjective feelings, but to support an institution that can force young adults to settle down, perpetuate culture through producing children, and teach those children society’s mores and habits.
The conservative argument against gay marriage, then, should be that it redefines marriage not from a union of one man and one woman but from a union premised on commitment to one premised on love. Gay marriage cannot be about stability and continuity, a conservative with this argument would say, because, until recently, gay couples did not need to worry about having children; the union is entered into only for sake of the respective pleasures of those involved (love, of course, being the chief ingredient in that pleasure). As I will get to soon, there is a good reason for conservatives to expostulate.
The great danger of this reorganization is that love is a subjective experience, subject to change, and in great danger of dissipating. To ground a foundational social institution in love is to leave it forever vulnerable.
Honest conservatives do not believe that gay marriage is the cause of this marriage redefinition. It has been going on gradually, in culture and in law, for decades—no fault divorces (California passed the first one in 1969) are another culprit. However, many conservatives believe that nationalizing gay marriage under the slogans “love wins,” and “love is love” will accelerate this shift away from traditional marriage (that is, marriage for stability) or irrevocably end it.
The conservative response to this is that gay marriage, far from being the nail in the coffin of traditional marriage, reinvigorates it. What gay marriage does, this argument goes, is it allows a new population of people to enter into a life of commitment, responsibility, and stability. For the first time ever, gay Americans nationally (with the exception of those in Mississippi) are allowed to adopt children. Thus, gay Americans can now get married not just because they love their partners, but because they want to start a family. A same-sex relationship can begin, just like a heterosexual one, where the ultimate goal of both partners is a committed family life. In other words, marriage among homosexuals will serve the same stabilizing and traditionalizing role that it does among heterosexuals.
There is no reason to suppose that a gay union will be any more or less family-centric than a straight one. Gay Americans at least deserve the same chance at family based responsibility that straight ones do. In short, we should not support gay marriage despite being conservative, but because of it.
I do not necessarily subscribe to either of these arguments, nor have I created them. Robert George, Ryan Anderson, and Sherif Girgis in their book “What is Marriage?” have made the best articulation of the anti-gay marriage argument, while the best pro-gay marriage argument has been made by Andrew Sullivan (particularly in his book “Virtually Normal”) and British Prime Minister David Cameron. I have merely sketched the arguments these men have made, and could not avoid glossing over certain points or failing to address potential counter arguments. For a more complete and infinitely more eloquent presentation of these points, read the sources I listed above. Lastly and most importantly, this should be read as a labor for the sake of tolerance: It is plain wrong to assume that whenever people oppose gay marriage they are bigots, just as it is plain wrong to assume that whenever people support gay marriage they are not true conservatives. As we enter into a new election cycle where the rhetoric is unfortunately bound to get nasty, these are important points to keep in mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since a group of graduate students announced last spring that they would seek the right to unionize, their campaign has steadily gained momentum. At the first Graduate Student Council meeting of the year, organizers solicited new members. Last month, the students also partnered with the United Auto Workers Union, which has previously helped graduate students unionize at the University of Massachusetts Boston and Lowell. And earlier this month, the campaign launched its website, further increasing pressure on the university to recognize graduate student unionization.
But these developments have come in the face of persistent opposition from university administrators. University President Drew G. Faust has maintained that unionization would degrade the pedagogical relationship between faculty and graduate students into one between management and labor. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng has carved out a similar stance, encouraging dialogue but arguing against the “disadvantages of union membership” in a memo to GSAS faculty. For now, this position has solid legal ground: In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that private universities are not legally obligated to recognize graduate student unions.
Yet in the midst of this debate, Harvard’s moral obligation to better its treatment of graduate student employees is clear. As a Crimson scrutiny highlighted last spring, the more than 1,200 teaching fellows at Harvard are often tasked with a tough balance between their teaching roles and their own studies. These difficulties are particularly acute during shopping week, when teaching fellows scramble to find classes despite unclear enrollment numbers.
Graduate student employees have also broached other concerns, which they claim could be managed through a union. Teaching fellows are paid just $20,520 to teach two sections per semester. Furthermore, according to a 2014 Graduate Student Council survey, more than 20 percent of teaching fellows reported payment delays of more than two weeks. And GSAS students have also experienced difficulty in finding sufficient medical care services.
As the Crimson previously opined, unionization could facilitate solutions to these concerns. In the past, the University has had little incentive to better conditions for graduate students. But with graduate student unionization now in the spotlight, pressure for reform is increasing.
If Harvard administrators are so afraid of the idea of unionization in the context of how it would affect the University’s academic ideals and institutions, then that should be reason enough for change. Whether through unionization or a full reevaluation of graduate students’ situation, the administration must act to address the demands of one of Harvard’s hardest working groups, and in so doing strengthen our overall academic community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Wednesday afternoon. John’s glowing toe entices crimson-clad visitors outside, but shadows dim the wood-paneled seminar room. Already, the students are all sleep-deprived—the handful of first-years and sophomores, the senior, and Brown Girl. It’s mostly because this week’s hist and lit assignment has been a trying one: read “The Chosen.” The book, the students find, devotes 557 pages of research and 152 pages of notes to the Big Three’s “hidden history of admission and exclusion,” with Harvard consuming a substantial portion of it.
It begins by observing the writer’s task, something about making the strange familiar and the familiar strange. Then comes the description of a gray-eyed, “self-possessed” freshman with pince-nez glasses and “patrician features.” Soon, we see how the resentment that accompanies his rejection from the “venerable Porcellian” gives way to an “inferiority complex” that—his wife recalls some 30 years later while he’s negotiating the New Deal—“helped him to identify with life’s outcasts.”
It continues like this, reading like a series of Crimson headlines interspersed with fraying diary entries: anecdotes of FDR navigating the final club scene and President Lowell institutionalizing anti-Semitism, of Harvey Mansfield shuddering at the thought of coed classrooms and interviewers rating applicants as “frumpy.”
It continues like this, the onslaught of narratives—at once antiquated and contemporary, distant and near.
*****
In the fall of 1918, a young pianist enrolls in Radcliffe. She has an ear for German and music composition, her professors observe, and—after she’s admitted into acclaimed poet and journalist Charles T. Copeland’s workshop—it’s clear that she’s talented at prose as well. Boston-born and Brookline High School-bred, Marita Bonner publishes her first essay a few years later. In “On Being Young—A Woman—And Colored,” Bonner writes of “Youth,” its carelessness and frivolities, its ability to make a growing girl forget, at times, the hue of her skin. She writes of promptly remembering while riding in a “Jim-Crow train" and receiving a “petty putrid insult.” She writes of “craving to pass for Ariel,” compares it to an “empty imitation of an empty invitation.” She questions if “color is, after all, the real bond.”
*****
In the fall of 2015, Brown Girl and her friend (another Brown Girl) explain why they won’t punch. Their brown punch masters frown, send polite requests to meet, then frown some more. There is more politeness, too—talk of “buying-in” and safe spaces, of burnt punches and image selection, of feeling personally victimized and feeling misunderstood. There is never a resolution offered or made after hugs are exchanged and hands waved. There is only the prospect that another one of these discussions will happen again sometime, that others are happening right now, even—behind closed doors, in cultural group meetings, during the wait to get into the Spee.
*****
Brown Girl and Fam sit in gray couches facing windows that overlook a quasi-garden. They try to avoid looking at the suspicious stains on which their arms rest and instead listen to the pop hit blaring from the barista’s laptop. It slowly fades into a weak bass, and so the bros chatting while waiting in line to use their Board Plus form the soundtrack to which Brown Fam types their papers. They hear mention of Harvard-Yale, Ec 10, and “that butch girl who probably pees standing up.”
*****
During her final year at Radcliffe, Adrienne Rich ’51 wins the Yale Series of Younger Poets for her first collection, “A Change of World.” Auden judges the competition. “They speak quietly but do not mumble,” he writes of her poems. “They respect their elders but are not cowed by them, and do not tell fibs; that, for a first volume is a good deal." But Rich’s writing, much to her chagrin, isn’t a good enough deal for the college’s revered literary magazine. Upon observing the Advocate’s insular culture, she privately puts pen to page, fuming. “Harvard’s message to women was an elite mystification,” she fumes, in which “the ‘great men’ talked of other ‘great men,’” It is only eighteen years after she graduates that the Pegasus accepts her poem “Face to Face.” "How people used to meet!” goes a latter stanza. “Starved, intense, the old/ Christmas gifts saved up till spring, / and the old plain words."
*****
Though hazy clouds of smoke blur Brown Girl’s senses, she manages to squeeze into the cramped kitchen where a few back issues lay strewn. She has endured such a comp meeting once before, so she doesn’t flinch this time around when she hears how these walls have honed Steven’s “juvenilia” and Rich’s, too. But still, her heart lurches in a painful brag; “I am, I am,” she breathes. “I am not comfortable here.” She seeks solace by staring into the candlelight illuminating cracked and empty wine bottles. The stiff gaze of a hanging deer head bust stares back until Brown Girl becomes cross-eyed.

If you have been following the Crimson pieces that have rocked the Harvard community over the past few weeks, then like me, you might have had a realization: all of this—from advising (or a lack thereof) to mental health issues, problematic campus culture to the sexual assault climate survey results—is connected.
The question then becomes: Can our individual moments of realization become a collective one? Our Harvard moment.
To put these problems fully on the shoulders of our administration, I think, would be both unfair and irresponsible. It is true that the administration has, for a long time, failed to create the kind of support network and foster the kind of campus climate that is conducive to positive academic, social, and psychological spaces.
But as Paul Barreira, director of UHS, recently asked: “Should UHS,” and, for the sake of this argument, the administration more broadly, “be the only place that deals with students in distress, or should we be creating a community that is more supportive?”
What I also know to be true is that we, as a student body, are responsible for many of these distresses. We have, time and again, failed to create positive spaces, both with our actions (where we go out, how exclusive we make our social spaces, how we treat our classmates), and our inaction (what we’re able to overlook and who we choose not to worry about).
Sometimes we even ignore the people closest to us. This often occurs when we introduce the “work excuse,” something we’ve all both perpetrated and been victimized by. “I just have too much work,” we feel alright saying, when a friend is dealing with an emotional or personal crisis.
Maybe the stakes are low when your friend is just having a bad day. But when the stakes are higher, and we have neglected to take the steps necessary to foster supportive relationships and spaces, then we begin to see the results of this daily negligence manifest itself in “deeply troubling” survey results and unacknowledged and unfairly stigmatized “Harvard Conditions.”
I’m often asked, as I’m sure many of you are, whether I “like” Harvard. I can’t say for sure what your response is to this question, but, for me, there’s always a moment of hesitation before I answer. The fact that Harvard students—when asked whether they like Harvard—sometimes hesitate does not mean that Harvard is a "bad" place; to the contrary, it’s an incredible place with amazing resources for those able to reach out and take advantage. But my hesitation, and what I think might be the hesitation for other students, comes from a deeply problematic piece of Harvard’s culture that is just now being brought to the fore. Through a combination of administration indifference and our own inability to construct a safe and supportive community, we have not yet built a campus that is conducive to healthy and positive student life.
Yet the reason I am hopeful—the reason why this piece is not strictly a criticism—is that I think we are experiencing a rare moment — one of those times in which there is a swelling tide of collective experience and unmistakable evidence that something is just not right. The Sexual Assault survey; the brave and powerful pieces by Viviana I. Maymi, Rachel C. Talamo and many others; the extended deep dive into “The Harvard Condition” by Mariel A. Klein; and maybe most importantly, Luke Z. Tang’s death have all created enough of an emotional disturbance that we may have encountered a tipping point. This may be the moment that we turn Barreira’s promise of a few more trained mental health professionals into something far more substantial and long-lasting: a real culture shift that transforms our social interactions and our broader interactions with the academic environment of which we are all lucky to be a part.
There is no doubt that we now have the ear of an administration that has repeatedly come under fire for not extending that ear when we feel our input should be considered. We now have the ears of Harvard students as we try to cope, collectively, with the horrifying, but unsurprising, results of a damning sexual assault survey, and a sudden and tragic death.
To me, the question is not only how each of us can use our personal moments of reflection to improve the lives of those around us, but also how we take individual action and find the kind of systemic change that most of us, in varying degrees, thinks is necessary for a campus-wide culture shift. Does it mean we demand advising that better fits our needs? Absolutely. Does it mean that we begin to rethink the culture and social structure of our Houses? Probably. I can’t say that I have all the answers. But I do think it is clear that change, of all kinds, is becoming a must for our campus. Recently, a Crimson survey asked some of these questions—questions whose answers can begin to shape our collective response to the rapidly growing disillusionment and discontent with the institutions and spaces that we both inherited and created ourselves.
Our moment is now. I have, recently, become steadfast in my belief that we are the right student body, at the right time, to reach out and seize it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 26, 2016, at 3:05 p.m.
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 reiterated the challenges of sustaining HarvardX’s current financial model in a document released Friday and pointed to potential areas where the non-profit virtual education platform edX, which Harvard co-founded, could improve, such as developing mobile platforms and accommodating students from different backgrounds. 
The 33-page “white paper” summarizes the three-year history of edX after its initial founding by Harvard and MIT and emphasizes the company’s three main goals: to improve on-campus learning, expand college-level course offerings to the world, and conduct research on learner behavior.
Garber, though, projected that the current models for funding HarvardX—Harvard's branch of the massive open online course provider—are unsustainable, given the high cost of generating online material and the time investment of professors producing the online courses.
“We have been able to offer free HarvardX courses and modules thanks to the support of generous donors as well as unrestricted University funds, which cannot be sustained indefinitely at current levels,” Garber wrote in the paper.
The University, he said, is experimenting with other ways to bring in revenue, including paid options for users wanting more options for paid certificates of completion and verifications and higher cost professional programs. 
To fundraise for online education, Garber has focused on pitching HarvardX to donors, saying they are interested in promoting free education around the globe and the prospect of helping professors enhance their on-campus classes at Harvard.
“The prospect that we would improve the quality of education either at the undergraduate or graduate level is quite appealing,” he said in an interview last Tuesday.
Additionally, in a subsection titled “Never grow complacent,” Garber outlined areas where edX should improve. He wrote that the platform should be more adaptable to mobile devices so “students can make full use of our courses wherever they happen to be”; better accommodate students from “different backgrounds and abilities”; improve assessments of students’ progress; and make course timetables more flexible so students can take classes at any time during the year.
Still, Garber generally praised the platform, lauding faculty efforts in designing courses and the body of research that Harvard and MIT affiliates have produced about learner behavior in the past few years.
Yet despite the paper’s lofty vision of edX on Harvard’s campus, the online course platform has not taken hold here to the degree that it has at MIT. Indeed, in a 2013 letter, 58 Harvard faculty members initially warned that the online course provider may not align with Harvard’s academic mission, but in the years since their concerns have waned, some professors say.
Some professors, though, have expressed frustration that they do not receive additional compensation or teaching relief for their work on HarvardX courses, which require extensive hours of research and production.
The document also provided a glance at the instruction that users—HarvardX now has more than three million course registrations—experience with HarvardX. Ninety faculty members across 10 schools teach online courses, and a total of 225 faculty, undergraduates, graduates, and technologists provide content and research.

This story has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: October 26, 2015
A previous headline to this story incorrectly indicated that Provost Alan M. Garber '76 questioned edX's financial sustainability. In fact, Garber focused his discussion to HarvardX's finances. Additionally, a previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that edX has three million registered users. In fact, HarvardX has "more three million course registrations" according to Garber.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students expressed their desire to define their racial identities on their own terms at “OTHER: A Multiracial Student Photo Gallery,” which opened in the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Sunday.
Amanda Mozea ’17, who organized the exhibit, described it as an attempt to highlight the struggles that many multiracial students at Harvard face. 
The exhibit features more than 50 models who identify as multiracial, each of whom posed for a portrait and answered a series of questions displayed in a written transcript. The questions included, “How does the government define your race? How do others define your race? How do you define yourself?”
The portraits were candid shots that omitted any jewelry or “distractions” that would detract from the message of the photographs, organizers said. 
“Every model you see—the only thing looking out of the picture is themselves,” Mozea said. “And so it is that in the purest sense, that person is looking out at you and you are looking back at them, and the hope is that you will form a connection, maybe in a little way.”
Mozea mentioned her interaction with a black cultural organization during her freshman year as the inspiration for the project.
“A girl came up to me and said, ‘Well, at least you have a little black in your face,’ as if my only right to be in that space was that I have slightly phenotypically black features,” she said. While the exhibit began as an outlet for her anger, Mozea said that “it became more of a cathartic experience.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who stayed for the duration of the opening, said he was particularly interested in the exhibit’s statements about personal identity.
“I think this exhibit speaks to our understanding of who we are in terms of its social and personal transformation—which is so critical in our own lives—but also raises important questions,” he said. “On an intellectual level, the exhibit asks how does ethnicity or identity get developed as a person, versus how is it socially constructed by the state?”
Breeanna M. Elliott ’14 discussed the relevance of the exhibit in the context of student organizations at Harvard.
“There are communities and clubs that exist for one community versus another, so I think this opens up the conversation that there are mixes of identities and that it’s very difficult for certain individuals to define themselves by one thing versus another,” she said.
This Thursday, a follow-up panel will be held to serve as a “reflection on what people have seen in the gallery and what the implications of being multiracial have on how we identify as multiracial, not just biracial,” said William A. Greenlaw ’17, a partner in the production of the exhibit and an Undergraduate Council representative.

Matthieu Ricard, a French-born scientist and Buddhist monk deemed “the happiest man in the world” after a University of Wisconsin-Madison study tracked his neural activity, discussed altruism as a solution to global issues in front of a packed auditorium at the Kennedy School of Government on Friday afternoon.
Speaking about his recent book “Altruism,” Ricard presented altruism in the contexts of economic inequality and environmental sustainability, emphasizing its power to affect societal and personal change.
“I was always interested in happiness for different reasons...but something was missing,” Ricard said in his lecture, which was sponsored by the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership. “Then I realized there is no such thing as selfish happiness. The pursuit of selfish happiness is born to fail.”
Ricard described humanity as standing “on the edge of the precipice” on both the individual and societal level, focusing on the issue of “poverty in the midst of plenty.” He said growing inequalities within countries and between countries have placed the world “at the edge.”
“We know that in any countries where inequalities are large, everyone will suffer from it,” he added.
Ricard also explored the problem of environmental sustainability and the general misconception that humans have “unlimited resources.”
“By 2050, we’ll need three planets,” he said. “We don’t have them.”
After outlining the issues of socioeconomic inequality and exploitation of natural resources, Ricard suggested altruism as a means of solving major global challenges.
Bringing in his experiences as a scientist and Buddhist monk, Ricard presented data and brain imaging from a study of experienced meditators in a Himalayan monastery which showed the changes in the brain that can result from daily mindfulness-based meditation. According to Ricard, in as little as two weeks, test subjects showed an increase in “pro-social” behavior, indicated by structural changes in the amygdala.
To bring this model of individual change to a societal level, Ricard introduced the theory of evolution of culture, explaining that culture changes “faster than genes” do.
Ricard ended his lecture with solutions for bringing about such an evolution of culture in the direction of altruism and cooperation, including the creation of “caring economies” and the encouragement of “local commitment and global responsibility” as cultural values.
“We need a unifying concept to work together towards a better world,” he said. “It appears to me that there’s no other common concept for working together than having more consideration for others.”

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest argued in favor of the antagonistic relationship between the White House and the press at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Friday.
In conversation with Institute of Politics resident fellow Brent Colburn, Earnest touched on a number of topics, ranging from his personal maturation, to his role as the public voice of the White House and in interacting with the press, to certain policies of the Obama administration.
Earnest highlighted the tension present in his role as press secretary, saying that he welcomes conflict between the administration and the press, calling it “part of what makes for a healthy democracy.” He was adamant that despite push-pull dynamics, “the Obama administration is the most transparent administration in history.”
At the same time, Earnest rejected the notion that he should have a completely agreeable relationship with the press. “If there were any independent reporter who is committed to covering the White House, if they ever walk into my office and say, ‘You know, Josh, you’re doing a great job of telling us all we need to know about what’s happening at the White House,’ they are not doing their job,” Earnest said.
Prompted by Colburn, who served in the Obama administration, Earnest also explained key policy goals of the administration in its final 15 months.
Earnest said he sees criminal justice reform, both in its “ineffective use of taxpayer dollars” and in ways to rehabilitate people who have served time, as a policy item that will be addressed soon, bolstered by bipartisan agreement.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement between 12 Pacific Rim nations, focusing on a variety of economic policy matters, is another cause that Earnest said he hopes will receive bipartisan support. Earnest also addressed more immediate concerns, including the new budget, which needs to be passed by the second week of December; the transportation bill, which will expire at the end of October; and the Export-Import Bank, which lapsed over the summer.
More than 300 people filled the forum for the conversation and subsequent question-and-answer session, including Harvard College and graduate students and students from other local colleges.
Daniel S. Menz ’19 said he appreciated the unique outlook Earnest offered. “I think during his presentation he really opened up channels to the White House, giving a unique perspective on the White House, the media’s job, and the White House press secretary’s job and interactions,” he said.

An unidentified male chased a woman to her doorway at Holden Green, a Harvard-affiliated housing complex located about half a mile from Harvard Yard, early Friday morning, according to police.
While walking her dog near the complex, the victim saw an older model, dark-colored van pull in and “felt something wasn’t right,” Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said in an advisory message reporting the incident.
The offender, described as a male in his early 20s with short light colored hair and a tall, muscular build, exited the van and attempted to approach the victim.
According to the advisory, the victim began running to her doorway, and although she was able to reach her residence and lock the door before the offender could enter, he proceeded to bang on her door before returning to the minivan. An unseen driver and the offender reportedly fled the scene.
As of Friday evening, no arrests had been made in relation to the case, and HUPD had assigned uniformed officers to patrol the Holden Green complex area, Catalano wrote.

The Undergraduate Council voted on Sunday to use the Council’s College-wide email list to publicize the Harvard Student Agencies’ Harvard-Yale shuttle service.
HSA, which through the service transports hundreds of students every two years to New Haven for the annual Harvard-Yale football game, requested that the Council publicize the shuttles’ pricing and schedule to the student body. 
While the UC ultimately voted to approve the email use with only three abstentions, some representatives spoke out against the proposal with worries of setting a bad precedent for other student groups seeking to publicize their events.
One representative, for example, said publicizing an HSA initiative would be providing HSA with “implicit sponsorship” from the UC. When faced with a proposal from Divest Harvard for help in publicizing its Heat Week protest events in April, the Council voted it down, citing similar concerns of showing implicit support and preference to certain groups.
Those in support of the legislation, however, said comparing the two instances was tantamount to comparing “apples and oranges,” due to the political nature of Divest Harvard’s agenda as opposed to publicizing shuttles to New Haven. UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 defended the legislation, calling the shuttles a “public service.”
In response to claims that approval would mean implicit support of HSA, UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 argued that the legislation would merely provide HSA with the benefit of reaching all College students.
Also at the meeting, the Council’s Student Initiatives Committee chair, Daniel V. Banks ’17, proposed creating the Council’s first-ever BGLTQ caucus. The group would come just weeks after the Council formed a black caucus following the most recent general election in September.
In addition to creating the caucus, Banks proposed meeting with the Harvard Queer Students and Allies to form Council legislation with BGLTQ students especially in mind.
Also at the meeting, Victor C. Agbafe ’19 proposed a piece of legislation that would put $325 of the Council’s budget towards a freshman class “town hall,” or a meeting to discuss potential improvements in freshman programming or dorm infrastructure.
The legislation was considered and passed, with a single vote down from UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16, who criticized the legislation for not previously having gone through the usual Council committee process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the lawsuit accusing Harvard of practicing race-based discrimination in its admissions processes has halted pending the return of another affirmative action case to the U.S. Supreme Court, Harvard and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs have proposed competing visions of what the interim discovery period should look like.
Earlier this month, Judge Allison D. Burroughs partially granted Harvard’s request to delay the lawsuit until the Supreme Court reviews Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, a 2013 case challenging affirmative action policies, for a second time next term.
Harvard has argued that the lawsuit, which alleges that the University sets “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities and illegal quotas on students of Asian descent in its undergraduate admissions processes, will depend heavily on the outcome of Fisher v. Texas. 
By Burroughs’s order, the lawsuit will pause until Fisher v. Texas is resolved. But Harvard was also ordered to provide database information from its two most recent admissions cycles to the plaintiffs, along with other general information concerning the College’s admissions policies and procedures.
In two proposals filed Friday, Harvard and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs—the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions—found little common ground regarding the type and extent of investigation that should be allowed during the interim discovery period.
In its proposal, Students for Fair Admissions requested more extensive materials from Harvard, arguing that limiting discovery would further stall the case. The group also proposed to include third-party testimonies—including those from alumni interviewers, former Harvard employees, and high school officials—in discovery, a request denounced by Harvard in its proposal as excessively burdensome on those parties.
Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that Harvard has repeatedly failed to produce documents promptly and requested regular status conferences “to keep a vigilant eye on this case to ensure that any ordered discovery proceeds in a timely and diligent fashion.”
Edward Blum, the director of the group behind the lawsuit who is also behind the Fisher case, declined to comment.
Harvard, in its proposal also filed Friday, disputed the plaintiffs’ requests, arguing that the College “has produced more than twelve hundred pages of documents” per the court’s orders and that expanding the discovery period’s scope “would render any stay essentially meaningless.”
According to the proposal, Harvard’s director of admissions, Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73, has also completed a deposition, and the deposition of a former admissions officer is two-thirds finished. Given these released documents and depositions, Harvard argued that the discovery exchanged to this point should be considered more than sufficient.
Harvard also suggested that the plaintiffs be ordered to produce documents “regarding, among other things, its organizational structure, its corporate filings, its correspondence with the IRS” and “most importantly,” documents identifying the individuals they say they represent.
According to  Students for Fair Admissions’s initial complaint, the group is “a coalition of prospective applicants and applicants to higher education institutions who were denied admission to higher education institutions, their parents, and other individuals.” At least one member of the group is a first generation Asian-American student who graduated at the top of his or her class and was denied admission to Harvard’s Class of 2018.
Burroughs said she will issue another ruling outlining the terms of the discovery period after reviewing both proposals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 26, 2015, at 1:43 p.m.
The Fox Club’s recent decision to accept a group of women into its all-male membership follows student members’ growing support for going co-ed and, more recently, an extended back and forth with Harvard administrators that left the club’s undergraduate leadership feeling that its hand was “forced.”
The Fox’s thinking, detailed by its undergraduate leaders in a letter to club graduates courting their support, seems to have evolved over at least the last year but accelerated this fall, when administrators increased public scrutiny on Harvard’s final clubs and their single-gender makeups. The Crimson obtained the letter, dated Oct. 19, on Sunday.
The Fox, one of Harvard’s eight male final clubs, is not formally affiliated with the University, but according to the letter, undergraduate members feared repercussions from administrators if the club remained single-sex. Specifically, the letter indicated that members of the Fox, in addition to themselves wanting to go co-ed, believed that Harvard had imposed a Nov. 1 deadline on them to formulate plans to admit women.
“Independently of the undergraduates’ sincere desire to admit women, Harvard University has applied tremendous pressure on all of the clubs to go coed. We now believe that our individual reputations and careers, as well as the reputation, autonomy and existence of the Fox Club going forward, are at serious risk if we do not act by November 1,” the club’s undergraduate officers wrote in the letter, under the section heading “Harvard Has Forced Our Hand.”
‘WILL SHE BE MY FRIEND?’
Late Saturday evening, the undergraduate leaders of the Fox Club informed prospective members via email that some junior and senior women had accepted offers to join the formerly all-male group, meaning that the 117-year-old institution for the first time had gone co-ed.
That email message, according to the Oct. 19 letter, was just one step in a calculated plan—one that included multiple votes of the club’s undergraduate membership and an unorthodox initiation process, but not necessarily a formal vote of approval from its graduate board ahead of time. The letter suggests some discord between the undergraduate and graduate members of the club, with the writers indicating that “some within our own graduate community have questioned our motives or grasp of the facts.”
The letter, which first details the group’s reasons for going co-ed, emphasizes that Fox Club undergraduates wanted to add women to club membership independent of Harvard’s actions. Long before the club admitted its first women this fall, a group of Fox undergraduates drafted a report on the prospects of going co-ed, according to the letter, signed by five Fox Club officers: President Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16, Vice President Patrick E. Dowling ’16, Treasurer Matthew T. Barber ’16, Secretary Lev E. Ratnofsky ’16, and Librarian Cameron R. F. Clemence ’16. 
“Work on this report began well before Harvard started applying pressure upon the clubs to make that change,” the officers wrote. “It was an internal process begun by members who felt simply that it was the right thing to do.”
More recently, this September, the undergraduate membership held a vote on the issue: More than 80 percent voted in favor of going co-ed, according to the letter.
Some time later, Fox undergraduates voted again, this time to “select the Fox’s first prospective class of women, a group of Junior and Senior women leaders who embody Fox values” and would “provide a female presence during a special female punch and initiation” next spring.
According to the letter, the undergraduates voted to go co-ed, this time approving the measure unanimously. The prospective female members were selected based on one criterion that the letter suggests is club tradition: “Will she be my friend?”
The letter—which the club’s undergraduate officers confirmed to The Crimson on Sunday that they sent to club graduates—informs alumni of the change. It makes no suggestion that the club’s graduate board had voted to approve selecting women to join first.
The undergraduates, the officers wrote, intended to extend offers of membership to 10 women, and those who accepted their offers would be initiated and admitted by the end of the month. That initiation, according to the letter, would be “abridged” and “focus on the tradition and values of the Fox, while eliminating any activities with the potential to be ill-received by the female initiates.”
The club’s first female members would attend a formal initiation dinner on Oct. 31, likely ahead of the conclusion of the fall punch process, and “be able to witness a full initiation as the new class of males is initiated, giving them the ability to provide suggestions as to how it could be adjusted for future female members, while still retaining as many traditions as possible,” the officers wrote.
The women who join the Fox may retain membership both there and in a female final club if they are already members, according to the letter, although the officers noted that future classes of women could not dually enroll.
“Aside from this, these women will be treated the same as any member once admitted, subject to all the same rules, and afforded all the same privileges,” the five students wrote.
“The Fox now has an opportunity to gain an impressive class of women Foxes, women you all would be proud to count as fellow members,” the undergraduate officers wrote to club graduates. “If we make them members now, we allow them to learn from this year’s upcoming initiation, and begin laying the groundwork for a successful integration in which the Fox remains a strong and respected institution at Harvard.”
‘THE FOX CLUB ITSELF IN DANGER’
But as much as the Oct. 19 letter frames the Fox undergraduates’ decision as one of their own volition, it also makes clear that members feared severe repercussions from Harvard if they did not act on an expedited timetable. The undergraduate officers wrote that they lacked time for a formal graduate board vote in the face of administrative demands that they go co-ed.
Administrators have recently reiterated their beliefs in public comments that single-sex social organizations—most currently unrecognized by Harvard—have no place at the College. But in private, according to the Fox letter, they may have gone even further.
In a section of the letter headlined “Harvard Has Forced Our Hand,” the Fox undergraduates wrote that they and their graduate board counterparts had met with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a vocal critic of final clubs, multiple times.
In those meetings, they wrote, “he has been very clear” that top officials, including University President Drew G. Faust, “have made it their mission to address sexual assault on campus, and open up the social scene to students of all genders, and that the university’s chosen method of doing so is to push the final clubs to go coed.”
The letter contends that Khurana, citing concerns about sexual assault on campus, told Fox members that Harvard is preparing a report that will “address the University’s plan to change the culture around sexual assault and gender equity on campus,” to be released before the start of next semester.
Although the Fox letter suggests that Harvard’s Board of Overseers will author that document, it more likely refers to the upcoming report of the University’s sexual assault prevention task force, chaired by former provost Steven E. Hyman. Faust expects a detailed report in January from that group in response to the recent release of Harvard’s sobering sexual conduct climate survey results, which administrators saw as implicating final clubs.
Ahead of that report, the Fox officers told club graduates in the Oct. 19 letter, they believed that they needed to go co-ed soon, or face consequences. Naming a perceived deadline of Nov. 1, the club members wrote that they believed that they had to admit women before Khurana submitted a set of recommendations to the authors of the final report, or they would face negative portrayal in it.
“If the Fox Club does not become a coed club, it will be categorized with all the other clubs when Harvard releases qualitative sexual assault information (except the Spee, which is already coed, and the Delphic, if it finalizes its merger with a women's club before November 1),” the letter said.
The Spee Club invited women to participate in its punch process in September. The Delphic Club, according to undergraduate president Joe F. Barbato ’16, has met with the presidents of some female final clubs to “gauge interest” in merging, but has made no decision about going co-ed.
Although whether Harvard would actually take such an action is unclear, the Fox letter indicates that its undergraduate leaders feared that administrators would force them to go co-ed if they did not this month, potentially by requiring students to disaffiliate from male final clubs as a condition of enrollment.
There is precedent for such a move, and in interviews, Khurana has refused to rule out the option; he has largely remained silent on any role he has played in pushing final clubs to change. In public, Khurana has said administrators are encouraging unrecognized social organizations to reevaluate their traditions, while maintaining that the College is not driven by notions of sanctions.
On Sunday, The Crimson provided Khurana with a copy of the Oct. 19 Fox letter so that he could dispute any statements ascribed to him prior to this story’s publication. He refused to dispute or comment on the Fox’s characterization of his actions. In an interview last week, Khurana also declined to confirm or deny whether he has requested that male final club leaders submit plans for going co-ed.
Although Khurana has alluded to preparing a set of recommendations about the College’s social scene, he has declined to provide many specifics. He did not directly respond to a question about whether members of the Harvard Corporation would review his recommendations, but he wrote in an email Sunday that “any document meant to describe potential policy changes would need to be reviewed [by] multiple stakeholders,” adding that he does not believe a document of the type has “received that type of review.”
“Throughout this process we have done our best to keep the leadership of the University informed,” Khurana wrote.
Fox undergraduates, clearly, worry that Harvard could threaten the club’s existence: “Failure to act now also places the Fox Club itself in danger,” they wrote on Oct. 19.
“Harvard is unfairly scapegoating the final clubs for Harvard’s poor performance on sexual assault issues,” the undergraduate officers added, but they maintained that the pressure was “real” and necessitated action.
“[I]n order to preserve the reputation of the organization to future prospective members, both male and female, to protect the undergraduate members from disciplinary action by Harvard, to protect the reputation of the graduate and undergraduate members regarding sexual assault, and to allow the Fox Club to survive and thrive as a place for friendship, for social education, and for bringing together men and women of high standards and congenial tastes, we need to make this transition before November 1,” they concluded.
The undergraduate officers of the Fox finished their letter with a plea to club graduates for support as they moved ahead to include women in the organization. Alluding to some graduate pushback and suggesting that some alumni had “openly discussed permanently shuttering the club or transforming it into a graduate-only institution” in the face of the mounting administrative pressure, the undergraduates advocated their alternative solution of admitting women.
“We therefore pray for your confidence, your trust and your support,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NFL veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 entered the 2015-2016 campaign as the backup quarterback for the New York Jets, but a bizarre locker-room incident pushed him into the lead role before preseason even started.
Seven weeks into the season, it seems like the former Harvard quarterback and 11th-year NFL journeyman might finally be finding his groove.
Fitzpatrick was set to start for the sixth different team of his career after incumbent starter Geno Smith got in a fight with a teammate and had his jaw broken. Even with new head coach Todd Bowles and a bevy of new star players providing for a new-look team, the incident prompted many to preemptively write off the Jets’ season as a train wreck.
So far, however, the season has not gone according to that script. Fitzpatrick led the Jets to a 31-10 week 1 drubbing of the Cleveland Browns, and the group has since gone on to a record of 4-2 with Fitzpatrick at the helm. The Arizona native has thrown for over 1400 yards on the season, with 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions.
The Jets’ four wins already matches its win total of last year’s 4-12 season.
On Sunday, Fitzpatrick threw for 295 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-23 loss to the undefeated New England Patriots. Despite the loss, Fitzpatrick posted a higher passer rating than Tom Brady did, 97.7 to 94.3, and threw no interceptions.
Fitzpatrick is also coming off the best season in his 11-year career. Last year, for the Houston Texans, he posted a QB rating of 95.3 and a completion percentage of 63.1, both career highs. Fitzpatrick was traded from the Texans to the Jets for a conditional late-round draft pick in March.
Fitzpatrick majored in economics at Harvard, meanwhile throwing for a total of 3756 yards in his junior and senior years with Crimson. He led the team to a 10-0 record and an Ivy League Championship in 2004.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Success is a culture, not a result, and it is one No. 5/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone has built and maintained during her tenure in Cambridge.
Her Crimson squad (0-1-0, 0-1-0 ECAC) dropped its regular season opener, 2-1, against Dartmouth in Hanover on Friday night, showing that Stone’s team cannot afford to rest on its laurels as the new season commences. After taking an early lead, Harvard, last year’s Frozen Four runner-up and ECAC Hockey champion, was undone by the Big Green (1-0-0, 1-0-0) in the Crimson’s first opening game loss since the 2000-2001 season.
With just over seven minutes remaining in the second period, the Big Green took its first lead of the game, an advantage it would not relinquish. Rushing up the ice with a 3-on-2, forward Lindsey Allen took her defender out of the play and found junior forward Kennedy Ottenbreit skating into a shooting position. Ottenbreit’s shot beat co-captain goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer over her top-right shoulder to put Dartmouth ahead, 2-1.
“As a goalie, from my perspective, I want to save every puck,” Maschmeyer said. “That was one I wish I could have saved, one I’d like to take back, but Dartmouth is a really good team, and they create a lot of offense.”
The Crimson had a few chances to equalize. Late in the second period, freshman forward Bradley Fusco led a breakaway down the right side, drawing the left defenseman out of position before leaving it off for sophomore forward Karly Heffernan. Heffernan, one-on-one with the goalkeeper, let a wrister rip, but goalie Robyn Chemago was equal to the task and blocked it aside.
Midway through the third period, junior forward Jessica Harvey’s pinpoint centering pass found freshman forward Grace Zarzecki in front of the net, but Zarzecki turned and sent her shot just wide.
“I thought we did pretty well getting the puck into the zone but should have taken the opportunity to shoot when we had it,” senior right winger Miye D’Oench said. “It was the little mistakes, turning it over down the stretch. We did pretty well, but we need to shoot more.”
Harvard got off to a strong start, pressuring Dartmouth throughout the opening period and forcing Chemago into a string of solid saves. The Crimson’s determination paid off with 7:06 remaining in the first period and Harvard on the power play. Sophomore center Haley Mullins played a neat one-two with junior defender Briana Mastel, who skated in and found space behind the net. Mastel then centered for D’Oench, who coolly slotted the puck past Chemago for the first goal of the game.
“We worked on our power play a lot this week,” D’Oench said. “We changed some things around, so it was really great to see that clicking. It was a really great pass from behind the net and an easy tap-in. It was great to get things going—we would have liked a different result, but it was a good way to start.”
Dartmouth began to grow into the game, however, and grabbed the momentum heading into the first intermission with a score. With Crimson sophomore defenseman Chelsea Ziadie in the penalty box for cross checking, the Big Green caught out the Harvard penalty kill on a breakaway in the waning seconds of the period. Senior right winger Laura Stacey set up a streaking Allen for the goal as time expired.
“It happened really quickly,” Maschmeyer said. “Obviously, it’s never a good feeling ending a period getting scored on, but we knew we couldn’t be complacent after that. We kind of had to get going after that, going into the second period, so giving up a goal can kind of be a kick in the butt sometimes.”
Dartmouth continued to pepper Maschmeyer, forcing the Canadian U-22 international into making a few pad saves. Early in the second period, Maschmeyer sticked away a long pass only for Stacey to find trailing sophomore defender Hailey Noronha, whose point-blank wrister was saved well by the Crimson netminder.
Maschmeyer recorded 31 saves on the night, eight more than her average during the 2014-2015 season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday in Cambridge, Harvard’s 42-7 win over Princeton was not perfect, but it was certainly remarkable.
From an atypically slippery ball to an unusually dominant Andrew Fischer, the Crimson made several different headlines as it powered past the Tigers.
NEVER LET ME GO
Heading into its matchup against Princeton, Harvard had committed a lone turnover—an interception by senior quarterback Scott Hosch against Rhode Island. The next stingiest FCS team was South Dakota State, which had lost two fumbles.
Well, after Saturday’s contest, fans of the Jackrabbits can rejoice. The Crimson fumbled the ball four times, losing possession twice.
“I think our guys take great pride in ball security,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said “It’s good to learn from your mistakes one time, but this is something we’ll get better at.”
Despite these errors, though, the Crimson conceded no points off turnovers, turning the Princeton bench from ebullient to more subdued.
The zaniest sequence began with 4:09 left in the first quarter and the Crimson on its own 31.
After a rush by senior running back Paul Stanton went nowhere, Hosch found senior tight end Ben Braunecker, who leapt down the right sideline, possessed the ball, and then fumbled the ball harmlessly out of bounds.
Three plays later, Hosch targeted Braunecker again—and the ball came loose again. This time the mistake had more serious consequences, as the Tigers’ Matt Arends scooped up the ball.
That was the second fumble that Princeton had recovered. The first came off the opening kickoff, when a long gain by freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley ended with the ball bouncing on the ground.
In both these cases, however, the Crimson defense held strong. Despite the short rest, Harvard limited the Tigers to a pair of three-and-outs following the fumbles.
“As a defense, we were kind of excited, honestly,” captain Matt Koran said. “We know we can stop them even if we’re backed up. All the guys step up and make big plays during big situations.”
FISCH PERFORMS SWIMMINGLY
Andrew Fischer’s return to the gridiron after two weeks of inaction did not get off to a smooth smart.
The senior wide receiver, who had been sidelined by an unspecified upper-body injury, received the opening kickoff as usual. But on this occasion, a trick play-call had Fischer pitching the ball to fellow return-man Justice Shelton-Mosley, who caught the pass but fumbled a few seconds later.
So it was that Fischer trudged off the field after 11 seconds of playing time.
However, the disappointment was temporary, as by the end of the first half, Fischer had grabbed six catches for 110 yards.
After 30 minutes and 14 targets, these statistics increased to 190 yards on 10 receptions. He also scored a touchdown.
“After [Fischer] catches the ball, he does a great job of getting yards after the catch,” Hosch said.
The performance was so dominant that when Fischer came out for good at the start of fourth quarter, he received a salvo of applause from his teammates.
That appreciation followed a sequence in which the receiver had almost single-handedly dragged the Crimson into scoring position.
Earlier, on a third-and-two from Harvard’s 28, Fischer had hauled in a 27-yard completion.
One play later, Hosch lofted a long ball to Fischer down the right sideline. He leapt backwards, snagged the ball above his head, and landed on his back at the Tigers’ 10.
Fischer’s third-quarter score was similarly difficult. Despite a defender draped over him, the senior held onto the ball in the left corner of the end zone for a 14-yard touchdown.
NOT YOUR AVERAGE SMITH
Five years ago, as a senior in high school, Harvard wide receiver Seitu Smith operated as a slash player, presenting a dual threat out of the backfield and from the wide receiver position.
Since joining the Crimson, the now-senior has spent most of his time in the receiving slot, but he still has the ability to bruise tacklers as a running back.
Against Princeton, he flashed this capacity in bunches, taking 10 carries for 46 yards and a touchdown.
“We’re always trying to find those guys because of versatility,” Murphy said. “Seitu gives us an outstanding running back and a lot of depth at both positions.”
Smith’s increased usage came at the end of a five-game stretch that saw freshman running back Noah Reimers emerge as a serious in-game threat.
Despite tallying six touchdowns and over 220 yards so far this season, Reimers did not see consistent action until the fourth quarter. He ended the afternoon with six rushes for 29 yards.
Murphy attributed Smith’s uptick in usage to the emergence of Shelton-Mosley at the wide-receiver position. As a consequence, Harvard has been able to line Smith up in the backfield more often.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team carried the weight of its Ivy League title hopes up to Hanover on Friday. A loss to Dartmouth would drop the squad two games back of the conference-leading Big Green with six games remaining, all but extinguishing conference championship aspirations. A win would ensure a share of the conference lead with a half-dozen games left.
The game in Leede Arena was far less dramatic than the buildup. And for the Crimson, that was a good thing.
Harvard (10-8,6-2 Ivy) took control of the game frOM the get-go and never let go, taking the match in straight sets and never letting Dartmouth (9-8, 6-2) eclipse 20 points in a single set.
“We knew that there was a lot on the line for that game,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “We knew it was the game that would determine if we were back in the No. 1 spot…. But we didn’t focus on what was [at] stake.”
Harvard played one of its cleanest games of the season, tying its season-low in attack errors. The Big Green, on the other hand, recorded 25 Friday night. Three players recorded at least five on the day.
“Clean is actually a perfect word to describe it,” Holte said. “We actually use that word a lot in our huddles when we’re making too many unforced errors. We don’t try to play flashy volleyball; we try to play clean volleyball.”
The first set began as the first game of the series played out earlier in the year, with each team trading points equally. But with Harvard up 9-8, sophomore Paige Kebe helped push the team out to a big lead, delivering three kills in a 9-1 run to hand the Crimson a sizable lead. Dartmouth staged a run of its own to bring the game to 18-16, but kills from co-captain Caroline Holte, senior Kathleen Wallace, and junior Corie Bain kickstarted a 7-3 run to take the set.
Although she only registered three kills in her first game back from an ankle injury, freshman Christina Cornelius contributed an ace in the aforementioned run to get the team out to a 1-0 lead.
“I couldn’t do as much as I usually do because my ankle wasn’t 100 percent, so I had to let the game come to me,” Cornelius said. “Hopefully I’ll be good by next weekend.”
The second and third sets followed a similar pattern. When Harvard reached 10 points in each set, it led by two and was tied in these sets, respectively. But a 13-5 run in the second set and a 6-1 run in the third helped create distance between the Crimson and the Big Green that would prove to be an insurmountable lead.
With sophomore Caroline Labanowski still dealing with ailments of her own, freshman Jocelyn Meyer played a key role as middle blocker alongside Holte and Cornelius, registering six kills and a block on the night.
Coming into the game this week, Harvard brought in a strategy that was much more tailored to curtail the strengths of Dartmouth’s attack, which caused fits for the team in the first matchup. After recording 23 kills in the first matchup, junior Emily Astarita failed to have the same impact in the rematch, recording a team-high eight on the day.
“We watched five-minute segments on their big three key offensive players and we talked about how we could change our block and defensive back row,” Holte said. “Then we implemented it in practice and actually played through it…. I think that completely translated into how we played.”
Bain continued to be a driving force for the Crimson, coming one dig shy of recording her sixth double-double of the year. Wallace was another a key factor in the game, recording a team-high 10 kills after taking home Ivy League Player of the Week honors the weekend before.
With a Yale loss to Brown this past weekend, Harvard and Dartmouth are alone on top of the conference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newest varsity team continues to make history on the offensive side of the ball.
For the second time this season, the Crimson women’s rugby team scored a team single-game points record, this time en route to a 132-5 win at the University of Pennsylvania on Saturday.
Playing against a squad it hasn’t faced since going varsity, the Crimson (4-2, 3-2 Ivy) came out with a big win against a team that made it to Sweet 16 of the American Collegiate Rugby Association Championship Tournament just two years ago.
The points record came less than six weeks after Harvard set its previous record of 111 points against Yale earlier in the season.
Although the Quakers (1-3, 1-3 Ivy) have yet to obtain varsity status at Penn, the match was pivotal last test for Harvard before the Ivy League tournament on Nov. 7. Saturday highlighted the Crimson’s underclassman strength, as three freshmen scored their first tries of the season.
“Obviously it feels good to get that big of a win in our last game before Ivies,” said co-captain Hope Schwartz, who is a former Crimson sports editor. “This is our last opportunity to be in a really competitive setting before two weeks of practice and then Ivies. We were definitely less focused on the outcome today and more focused on some of the stuff we’re looking to perfect before the tournament.”
With the Crimson heading to the Ivy League tournament in two weeks, junior Rachael Stein felt that the team is in a good place following their last regular season game, especially with the team’s rookies making significant contributions early and often in the weekend contest.
“Yesterday’s game was really exciting,” Stein said. “We got to score a lot of points, we got to have a lot of our rookies really step up in the game and take a central role in the game plan, so yesterday was a really good opportunity for us to really practice and emphasize our game plan.”
On a squad that now features nine freshmen, Harvard’s rookies have proven integral to the team’s success and winning Ivy League record. Harvard scored its first points within the first minutes of the contest with freshman Virginia Miller, who is a Crimson sports comper, completing her first career try.
“It was a good developmental opportunity for some of our rookies who got their first minutes today,” Schwartz said. “A few people got the start, and a few of our rookies also scored for us, so that was really exciting to see.”
From the start of the match, the Crimson dominated all aspects of the game. Freshman Sarah Lipson and classmate Caitlin Weigel both added tries off successful scrums in the first half, and freshman Susie Clements converted both for a quick 19-0 lead.
From there, Harvard ran away with the match and never looked back. Freshman Rachel Harkavy tallied her first try of the season and classmate Grace Chao added another for the Crimson. The onslaught continued with Weigel, Chao, and Clements all adding tries before the end of the first half.
In the second half, the Crimson continued to press despite the huge lead that had mounted. Lipson crossed the line a second time, and Clements produced another successful conversion. In ensuing possessions, Wiegel scored again, and Harvard received tries from freshman Genevieve Quirion, Stein, and classmate Claire Collins. Lipson and Weigel each tallied another try before the end of the match.
Despite the record-setting outing, the team remains focused on the goal it set before the season even started: winning the Ivy League Championship.
“It was definitely an important win for us to be able to practice the way we plan to play at the Ivy League championship,” Stein said. “It was also really important in that we got to really get all our players on the field…. It really helped us get ourselves together in preparation for this big event that’s coming up in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone except Hannah Winner thought that Harvard had tied the game. Despite the Crimson sideline’s celebration, Princeton’s junior goalkeeper had managed to corral Harvard senior forward Emily Mosbacher’s 60th-minute shot between her legs before the entire ball crossed the goal line to keep the Tigers’ lead intact on Saturday at Jordan Field. The 2-1 win gave Princeton sole possession of first in the Ivy League.
“It was a perfect cross from Rachel [Garcia],” Mosbacher said. “I hit it as best I could—phenomenal save by that goalie. I still don’t know how she got it.”
The Crimson (7-7-1, 4-1-0 Ivy League) and Tigers (12-3-0, 5-0-0), two teams that have combined for six of the last seven Ivy League championships, each entered the game with an undefeated mark in conference play, with both teams holding a six-point lead on third place Cornell. It was a clash of styles as Harvard’s conference-best defense went head-to-head with the Ivy League’s highest-scoring offense.
“We played a really hard 90 minutes, but so did they. [There were] a couple of tough bounces,” Mosbacher said. “Hats off to them.”
Princeton entered the game as one of the nation’s hottest teams, riding a nine-game win streak and boasting an undefeated mark on the road. Harvard had won five straight contests and had not lost at home since Sept. 22.
Winner’s save of Mosbacher’s shot was one of five the Princeton junior had to make on the afternoon. Despite outshooting the Tigers, 18-8, the Crimson’s only score came from junior forward Rachel Garcia.
Harvard was able to hold Princeton’s potent offense in check for much of the afternoon. However, junior Tyler Lussi and freshman Mimi Asom, two of the Ivy League’s leading goal scorers, were able to cash in on the few chances they did have.
Lussi’s tally in the 57th minute, her 12th of the season, proved to be the game winner. The forward floated a shot over Harvard junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack to give the Tigers a lead they would not relinquish despite consistent pressure from the Harvard offense.
“First half we were really playing our game,” Mosbacher said. “We’re a really possession-oriented team. In the second half, we just threw all our numbers forward trying to get a goal any way we could.”
Princeton capitalized on strong starts to both halves. Asom, who has won a share of the Ivy League’s Rookie of the Week award for five consecutive weeks, got the Tigers on the board in the sixth minute. Sophomore defender Katie Pratt-Thompson caught the Crimson defense off guard and threaded a pass to Asom, who took a dribble and beat Durack.
“The starts and ends of the halves are when most of the goals are scored,” captain Haley Washburn said. “I think we just have to be on our toes and anticipate what the other team is going to do and react. I think we did a good job, but they did catch us on our heels a few times.”
It was the first Ivy League goal Durack has allowed this season, but it proved to be a wake-up call for the Harvard offense. Less than seven minutes later, junior forward Midge Purce blasted a shot on goal that rebounded off Winner to Garcia for the Crimson’s only score.
Garcia saved her best performance as a member of the Crimson for her team’s biggest game of the season. The transfer from the University of Georgia notched eight shots in 90 minutes, but it proved not to be enough.
“It was exactly like our game against them last year,” Mosbacher said. “They scored early, [and] we got one back. Last year, obviously we ended up coming back and getting the better of it, but they got us this time.”
Harvard is no stranger to falling behind this season. The team has conceded the game’s first goal six times this season, but the two separate deficits proved to be too much on Saturday.
“There was a lot of effort,” Washburn said. “It was a battle. It was really physical, but I’m really proud of us for battling it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Saturday, Harvard men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer had lost only one conference home game. Outside of the Crimson’s 2013 season finale against Penn, Lehrer had emerged victorious each of the seven times he led his squad onto Jordan Field.
But the one time Lehrer did find himself on the losing side of an Ancient Eight contest, there were consequences, as the Quakers’ win on the season’s final day knocked Harvard out of first place in the conference. And on Saturday, the other Killer P accomplished the same feat.
Despite being outshot 19-7, Princeton (7-4-2, 1-2-1 Ivy) made the most of its opportunities against the Crimson (6-5-2, 3-1-0), scoring three goals in the first 47 minutes en route to a 3-2 victory—the Tigers’ first conference win of the year. With the loss, Harvard drops to second place in the conference behind reigning co-champion Dartmouth (8-3-1, 4-0-0).
After sharing the title with the Big Green in 2014, Princeton entered the season with high expectations before a tie with Brown and a loss to Columbia effectively eliminated the Tigers from championship contention. Princeton was held to just one goal in its first three conference games, but Saturday afternoon, the Tigers rediscovered their scoring touch.
Less than eight minutes in, Princeton got on the board after a ball squirted out to freshman midfielder Jeremy Colvin at midfield. Off to the races, the rookie pushed the ball forward 40 yards to the top of the box, where he blew by junior defenseman Daniel Smith and guided a shot into the left corner of the net to give his side an early edge.
The Tigers struck even more quickly in the second half. Taking a free kick in his own half, junior defenseman Mark Romanowski blasted the ball forward just one minute into the frame. Colvin then flicked the ball on to senior forward Thomas Sanner, who beat senior goaltender Evan Mendez with his left foot on his first touch to put Princeton up, 3-1.
“[On] some of the goals we gave up, we kind of lost focus a little bit from the game plan,” senior defenseman Andrew Chang said. “Overall, we’ve got to build from this and focus on the next game.”
The Crimson’s lone goal of the afternoon came in the 18th minute after Harvard was awarded a penalty kick. Leaving his net to clear away a bouncing ball in the box, Tiger senior netminder Ben Hummel crashed into sophomore midfielder Christian Sady just as he was trying to volley the ball toward the center of the field.
Sady collapsed to the ground, where he remained motionless in front of the referee, who had yet to make a call. After checking on the sophomore, the official consulted the line judge and awarded the Crimson a penalty shot. Senior forward Jake Freeman then stepped up to the spot and buried the penalty into the left side of the net to level the score at one.
The score remained even for much of the half, but Princeton capitalized on another Romanowski long ball to jump back ahead in the 40th minute. Running on to the defenseman’s ball along the right wing, junior midfielder Vikram Pothuri centered a cross on his first touch. Finding space inside the box, sophomore midfielder Daniel Bowkett then headed the ball inside the near post to give the Tigers the lead for good.
“Between Evan and the backline, the communication looked like it was a little off,” Lehrer said. “He hesitated a couple [times] and they had a chance to get in. I thought the backline did well—that communication error just happened twice and when you give up two goals, that’s going to hurt.”
After Princeton built its lead up to 3-1, Harvard had a chance to halve the deficit minutes later when senior forward Oliver White received a push from behind inside the box. But the referee determined that White had flopped, handing the senior a warning rather than a penalty kick.
Harvard finally shrunk the gap with 1:37 remaining as junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, playing a full 90 minutes after missing the last two games with a hamstring injury, lifted a cross from sophomore forward Tyler Savitsky off the ground and over the head of Hummel.
In the game’s final minute, the Crimson immediately pushed forward, ultimately giving Freeman a chance to rip a shot from just inside the 18-yard line with 11 seconds remaining. But the shot deflected off a Tiger defender, ending both the threat and the game.
“We weren’t short on chances, we just have to finish them,” Lehrer said. “We had 19 shots. We’ve got to have at least 50 percent on goal, and we’d probably win that game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We competed for 70 minutes, and at the end, the fact that it was just not enough was painful,” Harvard women’s field hockey coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said.
Carrying his young son on his shoulders, Van Herwaarden held his head high. His embattled Crimson (7-6, 2-3 Ivy) came within minutes of upsetting No. 20 Princeton (8-5, 5-0) at Jordan Field, falling 2-1 in the end.
“I’m really proud of the team—we played our hearts out, and it just wasn’t quite there today,” co-captain and midfielder Caroline Code said.
With its Ivy League position on the line, Harvard rebounded from two losses last weekend with an inspired start to Saturday afternoon’s game. After taking the lead late in the first half, the Crimson defense held on until late into the second half before conceding the equalizer and game-winner in succession.
Just over seven minutes into the game, freshman forward Kathleen Young had the first opportunity of the game. A pass from outside the circle squirted onto her stick, and Young had the presence of mind to fake a shot and round Princeton’s senior goalkeeper Anya Gersoff. With the open net in front of her, however, Young was unable to wrap her stick around the ball, allowing the Tigers defense to recover.
With 12 minutes remaining in the first half, however, the Crimson’s pressure paid dividends. After Young won Harvard’s third penalty corner of the half, senior forward Elizabeth Jacobson took the ensuing pass and put a nifty backhand on goal. The rebound fell right to Young, who scored her fourth goal of the season by ramming the ball past Gersoff.
“Kathleen is doing fantastic,” Van Herwaarden said. “She’s having the right impact, and it’s clear that she’s part of the United States U-19 national team for a good reason. I cannot wait to keep her developing.”
After the goal, Princeton looked determined to retake control of the game. Led by freshman forward Sophia Tornetta and sophomore Ryan McCarthy, the Tigers began to dominate possession and dictate the pace of the game. They were able to win a few penalty corners in the last seven minutes of the first half, forcing Crimson senior goalkeeper Issy Davies to make a few saves.
First, Davies sticked away a rifling shot from junior Tigers defender Hailey Reeves after a penalty. Then, with just three minutes remaining in the half, McCarthy picked a Crimson defender’s pocket deep in Harvard territory, slaloming into the penalty area before getting off a shot headed for the bottom corner. The experienced Davies stuck out a pad to deflect the effort, preserving Harvard’s lead.
“[Izzy]’s been amazing,” Code said. “She’s pulled up the team as a senior and a goalie. She’s the backbone of the defense. She’s held up her end of the deal really well.”
Princeton came out of the halftime locker room a different team, creating chances inside Harvard’s area and winning a number of penalty corners. After a string of Davies saves, the Tigers finally broke through with 12:20 remaining in the game. Senior striker Maddie Copeland converted a penalty corner from the left side of the area to the bottom right corner, evading the defense and then placing the ball past Davies.
The game deadlocked from their, with neither side able to take full control of the final 10 minutes. With six minutes left in the game, Young made a run through the Princeton defense, weaving in between defenders and using her speed to get in behind the last defender. With the crowd ready to celebrate and only the goalie in front of her, the ball just slipped from her stick, allowing Gersoff to stick it away and clear the danger.
Young’s run was the closest the Crimson would get to a potential score for the rest of the game, and eventually Princeton’s high volume of penalty corners bore fruit, with Copeland converting her second of the game and giving the Tigers the winning goal.
“This whole entire season, we’ve been rebounding well,” Van Herwaarden said. “Last week was a tough weekend, and we knew Princeton was going to be a tough opponent, and we came out and gave it everything we got, which is the one thing you can ask for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four members of the Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to Dartmouth for the three-day Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Northeast Regional Championships this weekend. Two Crimson players picked up victories, with sophomore Nikki Kallenberg leading the way with three.
After a sweeping 6-0, 6-0 victory in the round of 64, Kallenberg went up against Columbia freshman Star Makarome, who has been a U.S. Tennis Association National Open and Regional Tournament champion every year since 2011 and was the No. 12 overall recruit in the class of 2015.
The match came down to a nail-biting tiebreaker. After Makarome snagged the first set in an 11-6 tiebreaker, Kallenberg, ranked No. 98 in the country entering the season, rallied back to secure the second set, 6-3. After a back-and-forth exchange in the third set, the Naples, Fla., native then took the lead and edged out Makarome, 11-9, in a tiebreak to propel the sophomore to the round of 16.
“Nikki’s really been competing well for us,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “She’s really trying to do the right things on the court even when they don’t go her way. That’s a sign of a player who wants to improve.”
Kallenberg claimed Harvard’s best finish of the weekend with her three wins in Hanover. Close scores and multiple three-set matches were the stories of the weekend for each of the four Crimson players that participated.
“I was really happy with the way we competed,” Green said. “Some of the matches didn’t go our way. However, we saw a lot of great teams out there, and a lot of our players were doing a lot of what they’d been working on in practice.”
Kallenberg had another three-set thriller on Sunday. She swept the first set of her round of 16 matchup, conceding only one game to Cornell junior Dena Tanenbaum. But Tanenbaum ultimately came back in the match’s final two sets, 6-3, 6-2, ending Kallenberg’s bid for the singles title.
Kallenberg’s qualification for the round of 16 was an improvement from last year, when she fell to Syracuse in the round of 32.
Elsewhere, after advancing to the tournament semifinals last year, junior June Lee battled Cornell sophomore Lizzie Stewart in the round of 128. After dropping the first set, Lee came back to take the second set, 6-4, but the West Windsor, N.J., native struggled to close the third and fell, 6-3.
“Everyone [was] giving it their all in the third set,” Kallenberg said. “Even just making it to the third set if you lost the first, that really showed the dedication of the team.”
Sophomore Annika Ringblom also fought a close round of 64 battle against Brown freshman Maddie Stearns. Snagging a tiebreaker in the first set proved critical for the sophomore. After taking the first set, 7-6, with a tiebreak score of 11-5, Ringblom handily won the second set, 6-3.
In the next round, Ringblom got close to another tiebreaker. After dropping the first set, 6-2, she tried to close the gap, but ultimately fell to Stony Brook sophomore Elizabeth Tsverkov, 2-6, 5-7.
“We see this tournament as a chance to practice the things we’ve been working on,” Green said. “It’s a step in our process to be closer to where we want to be in the spring season.”
As Harvard’s biggest individual tournament of the season, the ITA Regional Championships provided an opportunity for team members to compete at the highest level of play and scope out potential competition in the spring.
“We’re basically more than halfway through our regular season, and it was a great opportunity for our players to test themselves against some of the tough talent around the region,” Green said.
The only freshman from the Crimson to participate, Erica Oosterhout, faced Fairleigh Dickinson freshman Shreya Pasricah, who was 14-4 in tournament play last year as a high school senior. Oosterhout claimed seven games against the New Delhi native, but ultimately dropped the match, 3-6, 4-6.
“I think the tournament was a success,” Green said. “Everyone was out there trying to do the things they’ve been working on in their individual practices, and it’s all coming together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Lady Blue Hen Invitational in Rehoboth Beach, Del., Harvard’s one-two punch of sophomore Lita Guo and junior Anne Cheng led the Crimson to a tournament victory at plus-39. Facing off against 12 other teams and 70 other golfers, members of the duo finished first and second overall, respectively.
The tournament, hosted by the University of Delaware, was the fourth and final event for Harvard this fall. Entering the invite’s final day, the Crimson held a slim lead over Delaware. The teams were separated by four strokes, but the host of the Blue Hen Invitational was unable to mount a comeback in round three. Instead, Harvard tallied a team score of 296, the best mark of any single round for any team during the tournament.
At the conclusion of three rounds of play, the Crimson had a cumulative score of 903. Led by Guo, who finished at plus-3, Harvard was able to walk away with a comfortable margin of victory over second-place Delaware, who finished at 915 strokes.
“We’re really excited to have won the last tournament of the season,” Cheng said. “We put in our best effort, and we were glad to see that it paid off.”
Guo and Cheng faced stiff competition from Delaware fifth-year senior Andi Slane and senior Nathalie Filler, who finished third and fifth overall, respectively. However, despite the threat from Delaware’s top two golfers, Guo and Cheng helped the Crimson maintain its lead and secure the victory.
Paired with Penn junior Isabella Rahm and Rollins College junior Paige Lyle in round three, Cheng built a comfortable lead after the conclusion of the second round but ended up in second place after a late surge by Guo. Following a 79 in the invite’s opening round, the Auckland, New Zealand native rebounded with a 71 and a 69 in her next two rounds.
“I felt pretty good in general,” Guo said. “I just kept a very positive mindset because it was our last tournament of the season…. I really love being with the team, so that really kept me calm and focused on each shot.”
Along with Cheng and Guo, captain Christine Lin, junior Nina Fairbairn, and freshman Michelle Xie helped guide Harvard to its second win out of four tournaments this fall. Xie tied for 16th place, Lin tied for 25th, and Fairbairn tied for 43rd.
“It’s a five-person team, so everybody’s score definitely counts,” Guo said. “It’s not just me and Anne—I think everyone contributed a lot.”
The Crimson struggled with par threes at the Blue Hen, as the team compiled a plus-22 total score and a 3.37 scoring average on those holes. However, the team’s performance on the rest of the course set it apart from the competition. Harvard led all teams in pars recorded with 158. The Crimson also capitalized upon 31 total birdies to gain and maintain its lead in the Blue Hen.
Harvard tallied an average of 4.29 strokes on par fours and 5.10 on par fives. Guo posted a scoring average of 4.03 on par fours, the best of any golfer in the tournament. Cheng played the longer holes particularly well over the weekend, finishing two-under-par on par fives.
The par 72 course played at 6180 yards over the weekend, and not one golfer in the field finished the weekend under par.
“The greens were really fast, the rough was thick, the fairways were really tight, there were a ton of water hazards,” Cheng said. “It’s a really challenging course, but it was very beautiful because it was right next to the beach.”
After winning one tournament during the entire 2014-2015 season, the Crimson has already doubled that mark in the fall of 2015 alone.

When United States Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy came to speak at Harvard Law School on Thursday, he discussed topics you might expect from a sitting member of the highest legal authority in the country— the meaning and future of freedom, dignity, and democratic society.
In between references to Kafka and brief spurts of German, Kennedy also made one other, arguably more important point: "Legally Blonde" is a good movie. Famous for its Harvard setting and pinkness, the movie traces the rise of Elle Woods from clueless sorority president to award-winning law student. That story arch seemed to have some appeal for Kennedy.

Ever been to a Halloween party where someone asks you, “What are you even supposed to be?” How about having no idea what to be, and minutes before the party, you panic, throw on a flannel and some boots, and show up as the fiftieth cowboy in the room? Do you want to avoid these altogether uncomfortable situations? Look no further because Flyby’s got you covered for Halloween this year:
For Those Looking to Make a Statement
The wrecking ballYes, as in Miley Cyrus’ most famous prop. All you need is a human-sized sphere of foam, some black spray paint, and a plastic chain to hang from the top. Perks of this costume: you get to ram into people all night screaming the song’s chorus.
The Kia Soul hamstersThis is best done with a partner, so one can rock the white pleather jacket and the other can wear the red windbreaker. Obtaining a hamster costume might be difficult, but Amazon is full of weird things.
Group Themed Costumes
The stages of Britney Spears“Hit me baby one more time” Britney, hot mess Britney circa 2007 with the hot pink wig and black bikini, wild just-met-Kevin-Federline Britney (this costume can feature bridesmaids dressed in Juicy), and of course, bald Brit.
A six pack of Corona ExtraWrap yourselves in yellow fabric with the label hot-glued or sewn onto the front and wear a long, tube-shaped yellow hat with a white feather boa glued on top to look like foam. Complete the look by making a rectangular package out of cardboard for everyone to stand in three by three. Downside: you have to travel as a pack all night long.
Decide Saturday Morning What to Wear Saturday Night
ScarecrowThis is a slightly more original, but not much more difficult, version of the cowboy. Wear a plaid shirt, jeans, and a straw hat. Use eyeliner or other face makeup to draw on a creepy face. For good measure, hold some sunflowers or stuff some hay (or dead grass that you find in the Yard) into your pockets.
Liz LemonEveryone’s favorite 30 Rock character can be done in five minutes. Blue blazer, striped tee shirt, and dorky glasses. Oh, and don’t forget the bag of cheese puffs.

By now, most have probably seen clips of this year’s sorority recruitment videos, where groups of girls at different schools across the United States dance, sing, and wave in efforts to encourage new members to rush their organization. The videos garnered attention earlier in the year, when Alabama Alpha Phi was criticized for its all-white, bikini-clad set of girls in the promotion video. Never one to be bested, however, the Harvard male fraternity AEPi has created its own version: a sorority recruitment parody video that asks the question, “what happens when you get a group of bros together with way too many cases of glitter?”

Jimmy Fallon partied a bit too hard while at Harvard Saturday night and injured his hand, again. Earlier on Saturday, Fallon was awarded the Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor and crowned the “Emperor of Comedy” by the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret sorrento square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
During the late-night festivities that followed, Fallon reportedly tripped while holding a bottle of Jagermeister and cut his right hand, warranting a trip to Massachusetts General Hospital. Earlier today, Fallon posted a photo of his bandaged hand on his Instagram, commenting “nothing that a few band aids couldn’t fix.”
We at Flyby wish you a speedy recovery, Jimmy.
