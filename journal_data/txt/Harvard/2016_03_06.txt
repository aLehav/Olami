After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After securing its best win of the season, a 73-71 victory over rival Princeton, the Harvard men’s basketball team (13-16, 5-8 Ivy League) wraps up its regular season by hosting the Penn Quakers (11-15, 5-7) Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. Staff writer David Freed has three things to watch as Harvard looks to sweep an Ivy League weekend for the first time this year.
 1. Which Team Shows Up — If Harvard had played all year the way it played Friday night, it would be in the title conversation. From the opening tip, the Crimson played with aggression. Captain Evan Cummins had eight early points by aggressively going at the rim, something that has been missing all year. Seniors Patrick Steeves and Agunwa Okolie repeatedly took smaller Tigers defenders off the dribble and helped Harvard ring up a 40-28 advantage in points scored in the paint.
After the performance of the season, the question is how Harvard will respond. Historically, the answer is well: the Crimson has won the last two Saturdays after dispiriting losses on the front half of the back-to-back. A day after beating Brigham Young, its then-biggest victory of the year, Harvard trounced Auburn in the Diamond Head Classic. Against Penn, it will draw on those memories to try and come out with energy on Senior Night.
2. Battle of the Freshmen — Last time the two teams played, Penn’s freshman backcourt of Jake Silpe and Jackson Donahue got the better of Harvard’s rookie tandem of Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson. While Johnson drilled a trifecta of threes early in the game, he missed all seven shots he took in the second half—including five triples. McCarthy faired worse, getting his shot twice blocked by Silpe and letting frustration boil over, committing a flagrant foul on the opposing rookie.
The Penn backcourt has taken divergent paths since the last outcome, however. Silpe has struggled, posting nine or more points just twice in seven outings. Against Columbia at home a week ago, he didn’t attempt a shot in 19 minutes. Donahue, by contrast, has flourished, draining three or more triples in six of seven. Yet it will be Silpe’s defense against an improved McCarthy that will be key if Penn wants to walk away victors.
3. Containment — Without leading scorer and rebounder Zena Edosomwan, Harvard could not contain Penn’s forwards in the last outing. Three different Quakers finished the game with double-doubles, with senior Darien Nelson-Henry pacing the team with 18 points and 12 rebounds. The glass will be a focus for Harvard, not a great rebounding team, in the rematch. Given Edosomwan’s recent struggles with foul trouble, perhaps the biggest key to the game is simply whether he can stay on the floor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the final game of their careers, Harvard’s senior class never left the outcome in doubt. The three seniors scored a combined 29 points, propelling Harvard (14-16, 6-8 Ivy League) to early 17-3 and 40-20 leads en route to an 18-point blowout of the visiting Penn Quakers (11-16, 5-8), 74-56.
It was the 12th time in their four years that Harvard had dispatched an Ivy League opponent by 18 or more points.
“I’m just really proud of our senior class,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It is an honor to be part of this journey with them and they’ve been amazing representatives of our program and our school… I’m just really honored to have the opportunity to be their coach.”
A day after notching its best victory of the season, the Crimson came out with energy from the opening tip. After giving up a three-point play to Quaker freshman Max Rothschild at the 17:32 mark, the Crimson held the Quakers without a basket for nearly eight minutes. Harvard blocked three of Penn’s first 17 shots and contested numerous others.
Despite suffocating the Quakers on the defensive end, Harvard initially struggled to get going offensively. Early turnovers kept the game close before the Crimson’s shooters got going. At one point, Harvard—which set a program record with 220 triples on the season—had threes on three consecutive possessions to push the lead from 12 to 21. Freshman Corey Johnson, who didn’t take a single three in Friday’s win over Princeton, made three in the first half alone.
“He has that shooter’s mentality and he knows that we have confidence in him to continue to take his shots,” Amaker said. “I was pleased and impressed with him that he didn’t force shots… I’m never worried that he’s not going to step forward and take the next one because he didn’t get some or he missed some.”
After trailing by 20 at the break, the Quakers came out fighting early in the second. Penn opened the half on a 6-0 run, bracketing a quick early Amaker timeout with consecutive stops and scores.
Harvard responded by leaning, as it had all season, on senior Agunwa Okolie. The wing halted the run with a bank shot in the lane and found junior Corbin Miller on the next possession for a four-point play that pushed the lead back to 18.
Miller’s triple jumpstarted the Crimson on both ends, as Harvard ran off a quick 13-4 run, capped by another Johnson triple, to lengthen the lead to 27.  Although Penn eventually cut the lead down to 13 points with 5:21 to go, it would get no closer. Despite taking just four threes in the second half, Harvard made 58 percent of its shots to overcome 11 second-half turnovers, holding Penn to just 41 percent shooting on the defensive end.
“A lot of [defense] is just attention to detail with our plays, defensive rotations, and things like that, just always competing and giving your full-out effort every minute you’re on the floor,” Okolie said. “Don’t take things for granted. Things are not given here.”
The blowout underlined the importance of junior Zena Edosomwan. The team’s leading scorer and rebounder missed Harvard’s last game against Penn, a 67-57 loss that dropped the Crimson to 1-5 in the Ivy League. Without its best post player, the Crimson allowed three Quakers—Rothschild, Matt Howard, and Darien Nelson-Henry—to post double-doubles on that night.
A month later, the trio combined for just 30 points on 40 shots and had just 20 total rebounds. Edosomwan, who finished the year with 14 rebounds in consecutive games, had one of his best all-around outings of the year, chipping in seven assists, 11 points, and three blocks.
Nelson-Henry ended his penultimate collegiate game in just 22 minutes, picking up four of his five fouls defending Edosomwan. The junior became only the fourth person this season to hold the 6’11” big man without a single offensive rebound.
“We want to get the ball to him inside, that’s our game plan,” Okolie said. “He’s done a tremendous job this year. Watching him grow is amazing… He’s been a monster for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Under the leadership of its three seniors, the Harvard men’s basketball team capped off the 2015-2016 season with a commanding win over Penn (11-16, 5-8 Ivy League), 74-56.
With the win, the Crimson (14-16, 6-8) ends the regular season on a three-game win streak and claims sole ownership of fourth place in the Ancient Eight. Barring a Penn victory over Princeton next Wednesday, Harvard will end the season as the only team in the league’s bottom five to beat Princeton, Yale, or Columbia.
ZEROING IN ON ZENA
Junior forward Zena Edosomwan was absent the last time Harvard faced the Killer P’s, but Amaker and his team benefited from having the Los Angeles native back in full force this weekend, as the junior had arguably his most complete game of the season on Saturday.
Though he fell just shy of finishing the season with a double-double average, Edosomwan snagged 14 rebounds in each of the final two games. By adding 11 points, he finished with his 12th double-double of the year and even added a season-high seven assists to his stat sheet.
But even more important than Edosomwan’s statistics were the lack of notes in the stat sheet for the Penn frontcourt. The distinction was especially notable in the first half, when Edosomwan snagged 10 of his 14 rebounds and limited Quaker forward Darien Nelson-Henry to just four points.
“He’s been a monster for us, especially today in this game—he was blocking shots, rebounding, scoring in the post, he was hedging, doing everything for us,” Okolie said. “We didn’t have him last time we played Penn and he was really excited to go against Nelson-Henry and show his competitive fire. It’s been amazing to watch him grow.”
With sophomore Chris Egi out with a concussion, there was additional pressure on Edosomwan to stay out of foul trouble, which has plagued him throughout the season. The junior had just one foul on Saturday—a flagrant on Nelson-Henry in the first half.
SENIOR SENDOFF
Seniors Patrick Steeves, Agunwa Okolie, and captain Evan Cummins were honored before the game as they took the floor for the final time at Lavietes Pavilion. While the trio’s performance was not as flashy as the previous night—when they combined for ___ points in a nail-biting victory over Princeton—the group steadied a Crimson team that has been defined by its youth all season.
After three seasons that ended in the NCAA Tournament, the class of 2016 was new to being in the middle of the pack. However, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker noted that the seniors were able to steady the squad through up and downs, including a 1-5 start to the Ivy League season, before Harvard closed out the campaign by winning four of its final games.
“I’m just really proud of our senior class,” Amaker said. “I thought that the way they’ve played here down the stretch to finish our season in a very positive way with the sweep of the weekend which we haven’t had that all season.”
Okolie was particularly crucial both in Saturday’s win and in the Ivy League season as a whole. Despite being known for his perimeter defense, the Ajax, Ont. native demonstrated in conference play that he is not a one-trick pony. After scoring in double digits just six times in nonconference play, Okolie averaged 13.2 per game during the Ivy season. Against the Quakers, the senior notched 16 points and was one rebound shy of his fourth double-double in Ivy play.
Steeves added seven points, four rebounds, and two assists while Cummins was a defensive force in the paint, registering three blocks. His rejections moved him into the Harvard record books at 10th all time in both career and single-season blocks.
“It feels kind of sad but also kind of happy all at the same time,” Okolie said. “I’ve had an unbelievable experience here with the coaching staff, coach Amaker, and being with an amazing group of guys each of my four years here. It’s just like kind of sad because it goes by so fast and you kind of want it to last forever because you don’t get to do this again.”

There are a lot of pretty definitive signs that the world is ending. First, we had a strangely mild winter. In the beginning, I assumed that this was Boston’s way of personally saying sorry to me for last year, when I, one of the three thousand Harvard students who come from California each year for the opportunity to confirm and then complain about the superiority of the West Coast, suffered through an unreasonable number of blizzards (yes, I alone experienced this struggle). Although this year’s temperate climate was a daily reminder about the presence of global warming, its gentleness also left me with a sense of guilt, for I knew that I was enjoying wearing my light grey quarter-zip Patagonia (embroidered with evidence that I am involved in at least one club on campus as any real Patagucci must) too much.
Then, Panera, a store I rarely visit and don’t often think about but pass nearly daily, closed without so much as a proper goodbye. Considering how many meetings and voting and lack of student consultation it takes to change the title of our house leaders, this felt like an unreasonable and unsettling occurrence. I sort of liked the 900-calorie pasta and the spotty internet. Word on the street is that the store is turning into a Tatte bakery, which is a delicious and hipster brunch/bakery place but is unfortunately far from reasonably priced. Here’s a hint, Harvard: if you want fewer students to pursue lucrative careers in finance and consulting, consider putting more stores in the Square that normal people can afford.
Now, in the course of a single week, the Harvard student population has been informed of six isolated cases of mumps, with the very helpful advice that those who have been vaccinated are not immune and that washing hands is the best form of prevention for this disease. It is mildly comforting that if we tell Harvard about all of our mental health problems we will get a $5 J.P. Licks gift card, but free ice cream is unfortunately not enough to forget about this public health concern. And in the midst of this viral infection, it appears that Harvard is doing just about the most embarrassing thing imaginable, and is now turning to Yale for advice about ways to improve its social scene, because in case you haven’t heard by now, Harvard has a problem with exclusivity.
Harvard is, of course, not all bad. In fact, it’s a pretty great place. But this series of events is a lot to process in the midst of a particularly brutal midterm season. Pro-tip for now: stay away from anyone who looks like a chipmunk—it’s probably mumps.
