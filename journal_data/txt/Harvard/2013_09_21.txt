Summers Inspired Uncertainty—He Will Be Missed
With Larry Summers out of the race for the Federal Reserve chairmanship, the future of American monetary policy is looking more certain than it did a week ago. That may not be a good thing.
Predictability is exactly what many financial market participants have been hoping to see in President Obama’s choice for the Fed. Markets tanked when Summers surfaced as a serious contender and rallied when Janet Yellen recently re-emerged as the frontrunner. Traders, however, are notoriously short-sighted; in evaluating which candidate would be the best pick, it is important to look well beyond any immediate market implications.
The policy issue that has preoccupied markets since June is the question of how and when the Fed will taper its bond-buying program—and, in doing so, take the first step toward an eventual tightening of monetary policy. Needless to say, the contender seen as less likely to alter the current regime and introduce any policy surprises—namely, Yellen—has been able to line up support across the board. Solving our economic woes, however, is not merely a matter of staying the course and perpetually injecting cash into the financial system.
Having taken the current program of quantitative easing to its logical end, we are in need of new (and possibly unconventional) policies to stimulate growth. The set of possibilities ranges from placing a greater focus on fiscal policy to increasing inflation expectations by, as Paul Krugman has characterized it, “credibly committing to irresponsible future monetary policy.” Setting aside the debate over exactly which policy choices are advisable, the point is that predictable, immediately market-soothing policies may not be the ones which will do the most to bolster America’s long-term economic health.
Larry Summers was an easy target for detractors and earned no favor with the markets for his perceived hawkish stance. Ignored amid criticism of his supposed “unpredictability” was the implication that he might also be willing to stray from the beaten path and advocate forcefully for needed policy shifts. The future is looking more certain now that the Fed Chair nomination is converging around Yellen, but that is not to say that widely anticipated dovish conventional monetary policy will make for a better ultimate outcome than the harder-to-anticipate new policies that Summers may have put in place.
If Yellen is appointed as Fed Chair, she will likely implement a stable policy trajectory. We will never know how a Summers chairmanship would have unfolded, but the policy outlook would have initially been uncertain—and that may have ultimately had positive implications for the economic recovery.

Don’t Punish a Slip-Up
A few days ago, Larry Summers removed his name from consideration to replace Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve. Opposed by a broad coalition of progressives, the Harvard professor and Clinton-era Treasury secretary's ambitions were done in mostly by his neoliberal economic outlook, which leftists maintain was repudiated by the 2008 mortgage meltdown.
While I join them in happiness to see Summers go—and cheer the probable appointment of his chief rival Janet Yellen—I disagree with those on the left who resisted Summers' ascension due to unfortunate remarks he made about women in math and science during his tenure as president of Harvard University.
Summers, whose administration was marked—and marred—by controversy, stated, in 2005, that disparities between men and women in those fields could be explained in part by innate differences between the sexes. His faux pas, along with other missteps, cost him his post the following year.
That might have been how things should pan out at a university, but I find it ludicrous that gender politics should intrude on the workings of the Federal Reserve, an institution that in principle stands above petty hatreds to regulate the money supply and rationalize the American economy.
Comments such as those made by Summers should only be taken into consideration when they express beliefs that could impact policy decisions, or when they display ugly, deep-seated prejudice. That his slip-up met neither of these tests and was still held against him must concern fair-minded people.

Summers Is(n't) Coming
Appointing Larry Summers for Federal Reserve chair would have been a political disaster for President Obama. Summers had already earned the "no" votes of three Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee by the time he voluntary withdrew, citing a possible "acrimonious" confirmation process. Amid serious difficulties with Syria, government shutdowns, and debt defaults, Obama simply had no political capital left to expend on his friend and close advisor.
Though Summers is an eminent economist, the public has little knowledge of his views on monetary policy as compared to Janet Yellen's near 10 years as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. But the new Fed chair would not just dole out interest rates. The Fed is one of the chief regulators of the banking industry, and Summers' lucrative consulting gigs with Citigroup and legacy of deregulation of derivatives during the Clinton era that worsened the financial crisis are far from comforting.
Though Fed chairs are expected to be exceptional economists, their job is mostly done through finding consensus with the Board of Governors. If Summers's stormy tenure at Harvard—from the Shleifer shadiness, Cornel West debacle, or HMC disaster to name a few—is any indication of his brash attitude, then it is clear to me that Yellen would be the better chair.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Campaign has set a fundraising goal of $6.5 billion, University officials announced in a press release on Saturday, a target that, if reached, will make it the largest fundraising drive ever in higher education.
The announcement said that Harvard has already raised $2.8 billion in donations and pledges from more than 90,000 supporters in the Campaign’s quiet phase, a two-year period of intense internal planning and preliminary gift solicitation behind the scenes. The quiet phase ended Saturday with the Campaign’s public launch, which has drawn alumni from around the world to campus this weekend for several launch events.
In its announcement, the University also laid out an approximation of how the Campaign’s funds will be spent. Forty-five percent will go to teaching and research, 25 percent will go to financial aid and “the student experience,” 20 percent will be used for capital improvements, and the remaining 10 percent will serve as “flexible funding to foster collaborations and initiatives,” according to the release.
The announcement also named more specific campaign priorities that have been public for some time—House renewal, development in Allston, expansion of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, creation of common spaces, and the advancement of HarvardX, the University’s branch of the virtual education platform edX.
Saturday’s launch, which is not open to the public but is being streamed live online, includes events featuring University President Drew G. Faust, former students such as Bill Gates, and prominent Harvard faculty members. Live-streamed events began at 1 p.m. with a faculty panel held in Memorial Church.
According to excerpts of Faust’s prepared remarks, slated to be delivered at 4 p.m. in Sanders Theatre, she will frame the Campaign as a chance to address unprecedented challenges and opportunities in higher education.
“We undertake this campaign in a time when public discourse about higher education so often focuses narrowly on outcomes we can measure in dollars and products, numbers and jobs. Make no mistake: those are important, and universities are crucial to those outcomes,” she will say. “But to see universities through so restricted a lens is to fail to recognize their most distinctive strength; it puts at risk their most vital and enduring contributions to society—their singular power in the search for meaning, values and creativity, in the constant and ever-changing pursuit of truth.”
In a statement in the press release, James F. Rothenberg ’68, University treasurer and a Campaign co-chair, expressed excitement about the public phase of the campaign.
“The Harvard Campaign is critical to the University’s ability to fund important priorities going forward, but it is also an opportunity to redefine Harvard and higher education more broadly,” Rothenberg said. “This is an exciting time for Harvard, and we are committed to ensuring that the University will continue to have a meaningful impact well beyond Cambridge.”
The University’s fundraising target of $6.5 billion exceeds the record-breaking $6.2 billion raised by Stanford in its latest campaign, which wrapped up December 2011, as well as the $6 billion goal set by the University of Southern California, which launched its ongoing campaign in September 2011.
A Harvard official told The Crimson in 2011 that Harvard’s campaign would likely last for about five years past its public launch, a timeline that would see the campaign’s conclusion in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clinching its second victory of the season, the Harvard women’s soccer team (2-3-1) topped Rhode Island (4-5), 2-0, at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium on Friday evening.
Freshman forward Midge Purce pocketed the Crimson’s two goals in the match, bringing her season and career total to four. Purce’s first goal came unassisted in the eighth minute of the contest when the freshman snagged a lost ball and took it past two defenders, getting off a hard shot on the ground.
“I think we did a good job of playing our game from the very beginning,” co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson. “I think we did a lot of things really well. I think we’re a lot more dynamic in our attack than we’ve been in the past and I think you can attribute that to more games played together and people getting more used to each other’s strengths and how they can help each other. I think our attack was definitely more unpredictable.”
Harvard tallied 11 shots on goal throughout the match, while URI registered just one shot on goal, with most attempts hitting off frame. The ball came dangerously close to the Crimson goal line in the final two minutes, but sophomore defender Emily Mosbacher kicked it out of bounds as it was rolling across an empty goal.
“We’ve been moving people around on the back line trying to see who works well with whom, and we’ve kind of figured it out,” co-captain Lizzy Weisman said. “[The defense] was very strong as they are in every game. We’ve been doing a lot of video and showing them when they need to step and when they need to drop and covering for whom, and they’ve finally clicked. They played really well.”
Utilizing the versatility of its players, the Crimson constantly changes up its formation, a practice very much at play in the Rhode Island match. Johnson, usually a midfielder, played left back in the contest.
“I think that this season our goal as a team has been not to be a one-formation team or be one-position players,” Johnson said. “We have the team mission in mind. What goes along with that is people being very flexible and that allows us to change things on the fly, and people can play more than one position. We’re very lucky in that we’re not only deep, but also very versatile. Everyone’s been awesome about stepping up to the plate wherever their name goes up on the formation chart. It’s been a really nice change of pace for us.”
Other standouts on the defensive line on Friday included freshman Bailey Gary, sophomore Alika Keene, and junior Erika Garcia.
“Our back line is a little bit more experienced than it has been the past few years,” Johnson said. “I think Erika Garcia has especially been an incredible leader of the back line. She’s got a full year under her belt of playing defense after switching from forward. Now she’s really got the communication down, and she just really gets it. She’s made it easy for people to play next to her because she commands a lot of respect on the field.”
Up 1-0 heading into the second frame, the Crimson netted its second and final goal in the 53rd minute. Weisman centered the ball to Purce who rocketed it toward the goal, where the ball nailed the crossbar and bounced in to lengthen Harvard’s lead.
“It was the game where we finally felt like we connected,” Weisman said. “Everyone from the beginning of the game was relaxed…we all just kind of took a breath and focused, and I think that showed in the game.”
Two goalkeepers saw action in the contest, with junior Bethany Kanten earning the start and playing the first frame. The win was her first of the season. Freshman Lizzie Durack was in goal for the final 45 and registered a save.
“I think it starts with our goalkeepers,” Johnson said. “We’ve got the goalkeeping core of three excellent, excellent goalkeepers…we’ve been super supportive of each other on the back line, and it starts with them.”
The Crimson’s next home game will be Friday against UPenn, marking the start of Ivy League play.
“I think this weekend we cared a lot about URI,” Johnson said. “But we have that goal in mind, which is Penn. We know it’s going to be a really good test to start the Ivy Leagues off, but we’re incredibly grateful that we’re playing them first…We’re excited to keep working out the kinks and getting even better so we can bring everything we’ve got come Friday."

Apple has released its new mobile operating system, iOS 7, and with a quick glance you can tell that it changes your iPhone quite a bit. But so that you don’t have to spend your own time looking through the changes, Flyby put together a guide to the ins and outs of your iPhone’s new look.
Simply put, the software makes your iPhone look totally different. If you thought that the old screen was too dreary, the new software boasts a more animated one—but you might need to dig out your sunglasses, because the colors are pretty bright. (Perhaps Apple got the idea from the new Science Center Plaza.)
After combing through the phone’s new features, we found a few improvements. If you hated the multitasking feature on the old software, you’re in luck, because it’s been revamped, so you can now see preview screens of your open apps.
And are you obsessed with selfies? Great, because iOS 7 has photo filters. It’s like your own private Instagram, only without #showingoff.
Still, despite the promising selfies, we feel obligated to warn you about at least one problem we ran into with the new software. Some online commentators have claimed that you can lose your contacts when you download the new operating system, so if that cute guy you met last night has downloaded iOS7, he may not be texting you back.
So, the verdict? Think about waiting a couple days and learning more about any potential bugs before downloading. But if the allure of unlimited, artsy selfies is too great, at least back up those contacts.

Harvard students are notoriously wary of "dropping the H-bomb" in everyday life, and our collegiate version of noblesse oblige—the old “I go to school in Cambridge”—has become proverbial. But, at least in some countries, fans of the the Crimson seem to have fewer qualms about name dropping—especially if they’ve never set foot at Harvard.
According to an article on KoreaBANG, a 31-year-old Korean man managed to steal $50,000 from his fiancee by pretending to be a “Harvard University doctor.” The man, whom police have identified only by the surname “Seo,” claimed to be a graduate of medical school, and he regularly posted photos of himself wearing a white HMS lab coat, complete with embroidery, on Facebook. Beginning in 2010, he crafted a meticulous backstory, going so far as to forge an HMS professor’s business card. Seo, who is allegedly a middle school drop-out, even learned medical jargon so he could fool other (real) doctors. After convincing his girlfriend that he was an American citizen and that he would bring her to the U.S. after they were married, her family showered him in tens of thousands of dollars in gifts.
But, like another Harvard “Love Story,” Seo’s engagement came to an unfortunate end. On September 17, the International Crime Investigation Bureau of the Seoul Police Department caught on to Seo’s act and arrested him. His girlfriend had allegedly urged him to travel to the U.S. before their marriage, but the impostor had disappeared a few days before their flight. Upon closer inspection, police also found that “Massachusetts” had been misspelled on Seo’s Mass. General Hospital doctor’s coat.
 
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen people trying to pose as Harvard graduates. Remember 11-year-old child prodigy Luis Roberto Ramirez from Mexico? Ramirez’s parents told Mexican media that the gifted child was headed for Harvard, but University officials claim to have no record of him. What is this far-flung, international fascination with Harvard and anything (or anyone) associated with it? Is there anyone else out there trying to ride on John Harvard’s coattails?
 Harvard’s bizarre cultural currency abroad might never fully make sense to us, but one thing seems clear : If you’re getting tired of problem sets, readings, and midterms, perhaps the trick is getting somewhere far away from here, someplace name-dropping goes a long way. Just make sure not to take your Harvard-related Facebook pictures down when you do; you never know when those might come in handy.

University President Drew G. Faust recently told The Crimson that administrators have secured a donor for a campus center. It won’t be under construction right away, but we at Flyby have some recommendations for how Harvard can avoid a concrete catastrophe.
Where it is
The center better be in a good location—so not the Quad. (Faust has named the Holyoke Center as a possible location for it—we like this suggestion. Attention, administrators: If you want anyone who lives on the River to actually use the center, don’t reconsider and make it next to SOCH.)
What it looks like
A campus center should be aesthetically pleasing—and not just from a helicopter (here’s looking at you, Science Center). With luck, maybe Harvard can avoid introducing another eyesore to campus. It would be refreshing for Harvard to surprise us all with something bold and beautiful (and somewhere we can sit without wearing sunglasses).
Who uses it
Faust has said that center will likely serve other parts of the University, rather than just the College, but undergraduates could definitely benefit from the space if it caters to them. So, administrators: Beware of forgetting your constituents in the Yard, River, and Quad. We won't forgive you if you do.
