After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s reputation in Allston over the past five years has been a little less than stellar, to say the least. After a string of aborted builkding projects by the university, what was formerly a well-preserved urban neighborhood has been blighted by unfinished construction and vacant properties along Western Avenue, the heart of the town. For over two decades, Harvard bought up land in Allston, at times under fake names, evicted businesses, and demolished property, in order to construct an Allston campus, the centerpiece of which was to be a $1-billion Science Complex. However, the University halted construction in Allston in December 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving a not insignificant part of North Allston bulldozed. Now, Harvard is announcing plans for the Harvard Business School Innovation Lab, a resource center with a myriad of intended purposes, including to develop small businesses and nonprofits in the Allston area.
Creating the Innovation Lab is an excellent move for the HBS community. Harvard’s other graduate schools already have similar community outreach programs, and to put the resources of the HBS to use for the betterment of society, whether national or local in scale is a laudable mission, and it is good that HBS faculty and students are adopting it in this instance. Other Harvard graduate schools already have such programs in place: Harvard Medical School places students in numerous public health clinics, and Harvard  Law School runs several clinical programs. However, we are less certain about the Lab’s effectiveness for the Allston community. Although any move to rectify the damage done to Allston is positive, Harvard’s plans here represent, at best, a nebulous attempt at appeasement.
The Harvard community was justifiably angered when Harvard halted construction on the Science Complex a year ago. Students lamented the diminished academic resources that would be available to them, and some professors considered leaving over implicit de-emphasis of the sciences. However, unmistakably, the true victims were the Allston residents. However, this project, along with the successful Harvard Allston Education Portal, seem to indicate that Harvard is coming to tacitly accept responsibility for its actions; this is encouraging. Nonetheless, we cannot stress enough the need for a definitive commitment to fix what was done in Allston. Allstonians have born the aesthetic and economic costs of the underdeveloped Western Avenue stretch for a year; Harvard owes them a revitalized community.
Under this lens, Harvard’s stated plans and purpose for the Innovation Lab are simply too vague. At the Jan. 20 public meeting on the subject, The Harvard-Allston Work Team, one of the bodies charged with reimagining Allston’s development, seemed to emphasize the Innovation Lab’s prospective coffee shop—a feature which seems to less important than its pro-bono consulting. Further, who will be volunteering their consulting services for Allston residents? Materials from the January public meeting only  indicate that a “SCORE” counselor will be available for this purpose, without going into detail. Will Harvard actually offer access to the renowned business minds that comprise its faculty, on a regular basis, or will HBS students interact with local entrepreneurs? And although at that meeting Allston seemed to be the focus of the multi-million dollar center, Harvard has also said it plans to use the lab to foster relationships between different Harvard schools. This leads us to fear that the important goal of Allston revitalization could be drowned out by other purposes.
In any case, with the multiplicity of roles the Innovation Lab is slated to play, Allston residents must be made aware of their centrality in this project. Harvard should make extensive outreach efforts to the Allston community to ensure they know that it is taking an active role in promoting local economic growth.  We understand that the Harvard-Allston Work Team is not due to release a definitive report advising on the future of Allston development until the middle of this year. However, in the meantime, any conciliatory steps we take for Allston should be detailed and clear.  Harvard  has not been kind to the Allston community and owes a debt to its citizens; this should not be paid piecemeal.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION Feb. 17, 2011
An earlier version of the Feb. 16th staff editorial, "Cleaning up our  Mess," incorrectly referred to the body that is advising President Faust  about Harvard's future Allston plans as the Harvard Allston Task Force.  The group is called the Harvard Allston Work Team. The Harvard Allston  Task Force is a group of Allston-Brighton residents who volunteer to  give their input to the City of Boston regarding Harvard's expansion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a whirlwind semester at Harvard, I impulsively signed on to spend winter break with four other students, living and teaching at an orphanage unknown to Westerners, in Bukembe, Kenya. The orphanage, Wema, is run by two Kenyans, and it is in continual danger of shutting down due to lack of funds and resources. Packed with over 100 children orphaned by AIDS, the Mt.  Elgon political violence, and poor families unable to feed more mouths, Wema is barely able to feed each child three meals a day. The story of how Wema came to be and the difficulties it faces today exemplifies some greater challenges faced by Kenyans, but displays as well the compassionate, tenacious, and thrifty character of its staff members that has allowed them to carry on.
Wema was founded in 2007 by Teresah Wati and Stephen Juma, who recognized the growing need in the community to take in orphans and children from poor families. The orphanage is associated with Highway  Academy, a private school founded by Teresah and Stephen in 1999, which now ranks as one of the best for primary and secondary education in the country. Although it has been a great source of pride to bring quality education to the orphans and children in the surrounding village, the Academy and orphanage lack necessary school supplies and adequate living conditions. The orphanage and school have no computers, only a box full of books, and a well with contaminated drinking water. Most children wear the same, tattered clothes every day, and some have no shoes.
Nearly one in five Kenyans in this region is infected with HIV/AIDS, and, close to a quarter of the children have been orphaned due to the epidemic. In spite of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, strong Christian and traditional values discourage educating and discussing with the children the causes and dangers of HIV/AIDS and some of the children have not been told that the death of their parents was due to AIDS. Another reason for the influx of orphans was the Mt. Elgon political violence that took place 30 kilometers away from the orphanage in 2007-2008. This violence between rival political groups was spurred by land disputes. Armed young men, part of the Sabaot Land Defense Forces, forced people from their homes, raped women, and ultimately left hundreds dead, and more than 45,000 displaced.
Children fled the violence and hid in the forests or stayed with relatives when their parents were killed or missing. As Wema was just started up at that time, many children were brought to the orphanage and have since made a home for themselves here. It is easy to spot a child orphaned by the Mt. Elgon violence—they are very timid and uneasy about contact with adults. One can only hope that with time, in a safe and nurturing environment, they will regain their youthful demeanors.
While Teresah (dubbed the “Mother Teresah’”of Wema) and Stephen have been keeping the orphanage afloat these past few years, they have encountered quite a few setbacks. A man claiming to be a priest working for Finnish Child International duped the couple and got away with around $35,000 of the orphanage’s money. They have also been faced with a broken school bus, torn malaria nets and omnipresent illnesses, a contaminated well, and overcrowding at the school.
It is humbling to visit the orphanage, learn what they are up against, and still see their ever-present optimism. Stephen works another job at a sugar plantation to make ends meet and Teresah, very unfamiliar with the internet, somehow found the addresses for the Gates Foundation and other non-profits and has written them hopeful pleas for help. Faith is very important to the founders and the children, and they retain a strong sense of spiritual center. Working at Wema helped me begin to realize the astonishing breadth and variety of challenges facing Kenyans today.  It is all too easy to get wrapped up in our problems and never  ending to-do lists at Harvard. Getting to see and experience firsthand the challenges that others from different countries face provided me with invaluable perspective. While many of my peers  have had similar experiences travelling abroad, I hope all Harvard students will get to travel and work outside their comfort zone in  a new place with a new culture and new challenges at some point during their college experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since my undergraduate years a decade ago Harvard has struggled to balance the pleasures and dangers of alcohol on campus. Many of the changes I’ve witnessed are definite improvements. For me, AlcoholEdu was the evening I spent kneeling in front of the toilet, and my Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor was my freshman girlfriend cradling my head above it. I arrived at college clueless about alcohol and armed with little more than trial and error to figure it out. A trip to the Ad Board (trial) and many mixed drinks (error) later, I started to get the hang of things. Today we have an Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services which supports many good things: AlcoholEdu, the DAPA program, Ryan M. Travia, and something called e-TOKE which I have not experimented with but have been assured is not a joke.
Yet, despite these new programs, alcohol on campus remains dangerous, as evidenced by the sobering statistics recently released about alcohol-related hospital admissions last semester. DAPA claims to avoid scare tactics, but Provost Steven E. Hyman and Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds did their best to scare the assembled Resident Tutors with these numbers at the unusual mid-year tutor meeting. Perhaps they frightened themselves: Provost and Dean both left before the event concluded with a panel discussion of the issue they had raised. After an Adams House tutor delivered a moving declaration of his love for the party form, the panel came to a general agreement that alcohol remains worrisome.
Before the meeting concluded, however, Quincy House tutor Seth W. Moulton ‘01 raised an uncomfortable question highlighting the tensions inherent to Harvard’s approach to campus drinking. He pointed out that underage students from our era had opportunities to drink at supervised, house-sponsored events like Stein Club where our imbibing was tolerated in the hopes that we might learn how to drink responsibly.
In my case, the approach worked: I did learn to drink. I remember encountering a blockmate in the basement of Lowell House. “There’s alcohol in the Grille,” he said. “It’s very strange.” We were both underage, and there was alcohol available in the grille. But it wasn’t strange. It was the comfortable public alcohol that brings friends together, not the furtive drug taken to shot-pounding extremes behind closed doors. Hoisting a pint in responsible company formed the cornerstone of my alcohol education.
Today Harvard doesn’t tolerate those grey areas, and Beverage Authority Teams patrol Stein Club. We focus on student safety as long as it doesn’t incur any liability. When it does, we turn away from those we are trying to educate, pursuing confrontational and ineffective strategies. Two examples illustrate my point: the legal drinking age and the Harvard-Yale Tailgate.
Why won’t Harvard support lowering the legal drinking age? We hear repeatedly that 21 is Massachusetts state law, and that is true. But “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was federal law and Harvard made it’s disagreement with that misguided policy extremely clear and extremely public. The mixture of legal and underage drinkers on campus is the source of many of our difficulties with alcohol. Students hide their parties because inevitably some of the attendees are underage. Tutors stay away because confronting underage drinking strands us between the reality of campus drinking and our own liabilities.
Trying to defend the current drinking age is hopeless, but Harvard won’t officially decriminalize underage alcohol use on campus. It won’t publicly eliminate underage drinking as a disciplinary priority. It won’t indemnify residential life staff against alcohol-related lawsuits, freeing us to focus on student safety. Harvard won’t even join the 135 other institutions as a signatory to the Amethyst Initiative, which merely calls for “debate on the 21 year-old drinking age.” In the face of this silence, it’s easy to reach the uncomfortable conclusion that Harvard won’t act because it cares about liability more than safety. Because Harvard worries that a lowered drinking age will mean more drinking, more accidents, and more lawsuits.
If Harvard cared about student safety it would increase the length of the Harvard-Yale tailgate. Every year the tailgate gets shorter, more restrictive, and less safe. It’s just not hard to posit a connection between the tailgate length and student safety. The shorter the tailgate, the faster the drinking; the faster the drinking, the less safe the event. Why won’t Harvard sponsor a more relaxed, more normal tailgate, like the one they have at Yale? Perhaps because a shorter tailgate also limits the amount of time that Harvard is sponsoring an alcohol-driven event, reducing their liability.
What’s needed is something else Seth’s question mentioned: institutional courage. This means courage to reconcile safety versus liability concerns in favor of safety and students, and to take a few unpopular countercultural stances along the way. Courage the College had ten years ago but seems to have lost.

Sections
1. Fifteen Minutes: Your book deals with the influences that shaped Obama’s view of the world. Why is this important for Americans to know?
James T. Kloppenberg: I think if people had a better sense of how he sees the world and how he sees the United States they might have a clearer understanding of why he has made some of the decisions he has made.
2. FM: Did your opinions about him change after conducting extensive research into his past?
JTK: Yes, I had been skeptical about him in the run up to the Democratic primary because he seemed like just another moderate Democrat, and as someone pretty far to the left myself, I was not terribly impressed with what he had to offer. But when I read his books I was actually quite impressed to find that he was a man of depth and thoughtfulness and had a much deeper understanding of American history and how democracy works than I had given him credit for.
3. FM: Do you think more Americans would have faith in him as a president if they knew more about his educational background?
JTK: Not many people have a very good sense of how he sees the projects and the possibilities and the limitations in contemporary politics in relation to the much longer history of the United States ... He represents something quite different from most democratic politicians. Although I would have liked it he had been more toward the left in his political views, I developed a respect for the solid foundation [on which] his approach to politics rests.
4. FM: How do you think the president has received your historical account of his influences?
JTK: Oh I have no idea whether he’s read it. I hope that at some time when his presidency has ended, he would find the time to read it, but I think he has so many more important things on his mind [Chuckling].
5. FM: Was there one influence in Obama’s life that stood out as being more visible than any others?
JTK: It’s hard to say if there was one influence that was strongest over the others because there have been many that together have shaped Obama’s worldview.
6. FM: Were there any influences that surprised you?
JTK: I think what surprised me more than anything else was the intellectual ferment that was going on at the Harvard Law School when he was a student there. What impressed me was the extent to which Obama was immersed in [intellectual] debates ... A lot of students skate through the Law School without ever getting that deeply engaged.
7. FM: In your New York Times interview, you were quoted as saying that Obama was a “rare breed of philosopher presidents.” What do you mean by this?
JTK: Actually that was a phrase that the reporter Patricia Cohen had used, and I’m actually very glad you asked that question because now I can go on record saying that I never used that phrase, and never would use that phrase. It suggests Plato’s philosopher king, and that’s not the way I see Obama. [But] I think he’s someone who read a lot of philosophy and who takes ideas seriously.
8. FM: If Harvard students were to look into the influences that shaped your world views, what would they find had the biggest impact.
JTK: [Laughing] I think most of them would find them much less interesting than the influences on Barack Obama. But, playing college baseball in my freshman year of college in 1970 was probably the most influential moment in my life, when I became very engaged in the anti-war movement.
9. FM: With your success as a historian, why do you teach?
JTK: I enjoy everything about it. I don’t think I’d be doing this if I couldn’t teach. When you get to have engaging conversations with students, and you get to see them coming into awareness and understanding of new ideas, there’s nothing more satisfying than that. One of the perks about teaching at Harvard is I get to experience that every day.
10. FM: You’ve taught several courses abroad: were there any major differences that came with teaching abroad?
JTK: It’s an entirely different system in Britain, and the position I had only required me to give a series of public lectures. There was no formal course, so the students who came were simply interested in the topic. There were no tests, there were no papers, and they solely came to hear what I had to say.
11. FM: And was your interaction with colleagues different?
JTK: What was also different was that at any given lecture I had a half-dozen to a dozen faculty members in attendance and that’s something I’ve never seen in an American university. It made me raise the bar and make sure that this was the best work I could present.
12. FM: What is your favorite work [that you’ve written]?
JTK: I couldn’t specify just one. At the moment I’m in the middle of a book, so that one would have to be my favorite because I’ve spent the most time on it, but all my books have taken a lot of time and hold significance to me.
13. FM: So then, what would you say is the most difficult part of the writing process, since you’re right in the middle of it?
JTK: Well it depends on the type of book. For the piece I’m writing now, the hardest part is keeping the many pieces of the book in focus in my mind as I work on individual portions of the book.
14. FM: To that end, what advice would you give Harvard thesis writers as they head into crunch time?
JTK: Thesis writers should keep their focus on what they’re working on at the moment and not get distracted by the larger project. If you can write a thesis as a series of short papers and not be intimidated by the scale, it’s not that much more difficult than writing the papers you’ve written up to that point. So, think big while simultaneously you think small.
15. FM: With the second annual “Harvard Thinks Big” coming up, what would be the idea you are most passionate about that you would share in order to inspire Harvard students?
JTK: I’d have to say democracy, which has its roots in the ancient world and we have seen unfolding before our eyes right now in Cairo. I definitely think that’s an idea worth confronting and worth wrestling with.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahmed Ragab—a historian of, among other things, medieval Islamic medicine—has been appointed the Richard T. Watson Assistant Professor of Science and Religion at the Harvard Divinity School, a position he will assume this July, the school announced last week.
Ragab, who has been working in the History of Science Department at Harvard since 2008, will continue his research on a broad range of topics that stretch from medieval science in the Islamic world to the cultural history of women in the Middle East.
“His scholarship is so broad. It’s really extraordinary,” said History of Science Professor Katharine Park. “It’s very unusual to find someone who covers so many bases.”
Park said that she was first impressed with Ragab after auditing a class he taught on medieval Islamic science. Now, she said, the two are developing a course for next year that combines the histories of medieval European and Islamic sciences.
“The plans of this particular division is to work on how religion and scientific discourse intersect as a larger framework that ground our perception of the world,” Ragab said of his future research.
Ragab said he is thrilled to join the Divinity School faculty and that he believes his appointment will increase the possibilities for dialogue between the faculties at the different Harvard schools. According to Park, it is likely that because of Ragab’s research interests, he will retain at least a nominal position in the History of Science Department.
“I think it’s wonderful to build that kind of bridge between FAS and the Divinity School,” Park said of the potential for new interaction between faculties.
Divinity School Professor Mark D. Jordan—chair of the search committee responsible for selecting Ragab—said in a press release that Ragab’s background and research make him particularly well-suited to weigh in on contemporary debates on science and religion.
Though he now leaves for a position at the Divinity School, Ragab said that he plans to continue teaching undergraduates and that some, if not all, of his courses will be cross-listed.
Ragab is currently teaching a lecture course for undergraduate and graduate students entitled History of Science 108: “Bodies, Sexualities, and Medicine in the Medieval Middle East.”

Disparities in race and quality of care contribute to the higher proportion of older black patients who are readmitted to a hospital after a heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia, according to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
The study, conducted over the course of a year, found that elderly black patients had a 13 percent greater chance than elderly white patients of being readmitted to a hospital within 30 days after discharge.
Karen E. Joynt, the study’s lead author, said that the researchers also discovered that older black patients disproportionately received care from lower quality hospitals.
“This is really the coming-together of two issues that we’ve been interested in for some time—first in disparities and second in readmissions,” said Joynt, a research fellow at the School of Public Health.
In designing the study, researchers selected a sample of Medicare patients from 2006 to 2008—just over three million people—that were discharged from a hospital in the U.S. after suffering from a heart attack, heart failure, or pneumonia. They then divided hospitals into “minority-serving” and “non-minority-serving” health care facilities.
According to Joynt, readmission rates were 23 percent higher in the minority-serving hospitals, and blacks had 35 percent higher odds of readmission at a non-minority-serving hospital.
“That told us that both race and the site where care was provided were important in determining whether you were readmitted,” Joynt said.
Joynt said the study was not able to determine why the readmission rates were higher.
“Our suspicion is that it has a lot do with the kind of support and resources that patients have at home, in the outpatient settings, and in transitions of care,” Joynt said.
“If we really want to address disparities in care and the outcome, we need to find ways to help these vulnerable patients during that time period, and it’s going to take targeting both black patients and patients coming from hospitals with a high proportion of minorities,” she said.
Ashish Jha and E. John Orav, associate professors at the School of Public Health, also contributed to the study.
Jha, who is also a physician at Harvard Medical School, said that the causes of inadequate minority health care include other factors besides the site of care.
Poor communication between doctors and minority patients and the quality of follow ups after discharge can also contribute to the problem of higher-than-average readmission rates for minorities, Jha said.
“Here we are, in the year 2011, in a nation that’s made so much progress on race in so many different areas, and we continue to see clearly substantial racial disparities in various aspects of our health care system and it adds to the urgency of trying to fix this problem,” Jha said.
The study was published in today’s issue of the “Journal of the American Medical Association.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School has added a world-renowned cultural idol to its student body—model and media personality Tyra Banks.
After Banks was recently spotted strolling through Boston, visiting Harvard’s dining halls, and walking around the HBS campus, both administrators and students confirmed her presence.
She is currently enrolled in the Business School’s Executive Education Owner/President Management Program (OPM), according to Jacqueline Baugher, director of the OPM program.
Baugher said the program usually attracts “presidents and CEOs of companies with sales from anywhere between five million to several billion dollars.”
With annual earnings upwards of $20 million and a foundation to her name, Banks should fit in with the other businesspeople participating in the executive education program.
But Banks stands out among her classmates due to her celebrity status. Baugher said that people of Banks’ fame don’t frequently attend the OPM program.
“This is a first for us,” Baugher said.
Banks has already made successful ventures into modeling, fashion, and philanthropy, and has established herself as a television personality with her headlining work on both “The Tyra Banks Show” and “America’s Next Top Model.”
At HBS, she will participate in classes teaching entrepreneurial skills and techniques for managing a company’s growth.
The OPM program, which usually draws in about 200 students, requires participants to attend one three-week session of lectures at the Business School each year for three years. Tuition for the first of the sessions comes to $31,000.
While the OPM program is noted for its selectivity, it is very different from a full-time MBA degree program, Baugher said. OPM’s schedule gives students a large amount of leeway while trying to balance their full-time careers with an intensive educational experience. Most of the program’s participants are employed, and the majority have already earned bachelor’s degrees.
Those who are enrolled look to the program to “gain the skills to take their business to the next level in the private sector,” Baugher said.

Harvard Law School graduate and research associate Lobsang Sangay is hoping to lead a government with no borders and no jurisdiction in the country it says it represents. After an eight-month campaign traveling to settlements across the world, Sangay hopes to become the next prime minister of the Tibetan government in exile.
Sangay, the first Tibetan graduate of Harvard Law School, came to Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship, where he earned both his J.D. and LL.M. While Sangay said that being the first Tibetan to graduate from the Law School is an honor, he added that the barrier could have been broken much earlier.
Sangay said that he hopes his success at Harvard will inspire young Tibetans to pursue higher education so that they can “continue to more effectively provide leadership in the Tibetan movement and community at large.”
He added that his education at Harvard helped equip him to serve the Tibetan community.
“Exposure to diverse views, ways of thinking, and how leaders conduct themselves have definitely helped me become both an individual and an academic, as well a leader,” he said.
Sangay said that conversing with Chinese students had been especially helpful.
“Meeting hundreds of Chinese students helped me understand their perspective and also equipped me in sharing the challenges in the present occupation of Tibet,” Sangay said.
Professor of Tibetan and Himalayan Studies Leonard W. J. van der Kuijp said he has known Sangay since Sangay came to Harvard more than a decade ago and that Sangay has “always been very active within the Tibetan community in Boston” as well as in the broader Tibetan movement.
“He used to be very hardline, [with a] pro-independence Tibet mindset,” van der Kuijp said about Sangay when he first arrived at Harvard. “But in the meantime he’s mellowed quite a bit.”
Van der Kuijp said that Sangay—like the Dalai Lama—now realizes that an independent Tibet probably isn’t going to happen in his lifetime, and that there are other more effective ways to push for improved life for Tibetans.
According to van der Kuijp, Sangay has been “very active” in trying to encourage discussion and debate on campus by gathering Tibetans to discuss the region’s future, and by bringing Tibetans together with Chinese officials to encourage mutual understanding in each group-’s positions. Sangay organized and participated in five such conferences on campus.
Although Sangay has been active on campus in facilitating conversations between Chinese officials and Tibetan activists, neither he nor the government he is campaigning to run is allowed to enter Tibet. Centered in Dharamsala, India, the government operates completely outside of Tibet, and has jurisdiction over and is elected by a voting population of refugees in Tibetan colonies around the world.
The government employs over 400 individuals at its headquarters, and over 700 staff members in Tibetan settlements across the world, according to Sangay. The government also sustains a parliament and a judiciary, which overhears civil and administrative cases within the Tibetan community.
Before the campaign, Sangay traveled to different Tibetan settlements to give lectures and hold workshops. He said that while Harvard paid for his academic trips, all trips related to his candidacy have been covered by the campaign. The Tibetan population, though scattered, is small, and Sangay said it only takes a month and a half to visit all the settlements across the world.
Since last August, Sangay has split his time between the campaign and Cambridge—his home since 1995. If Sangay wins the election, he will have to resign his position at the Law School and move permanently to India, a step Sangay called a “compromise one has to make.”
“It’s a duty for a cause, for a movement. I’ve always worked for Tibet and the Tibetan people, now I’d be physically moving to India,” Sangay said. “These are minor challenges compared to the sacrifices made by Tibetans in Tibet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In welcome news for universities, President Barack Obama’s 2012 budget proposal released on Monday focuses on promoting and investing in innovation and includes funding increases for science research and continued support for student financial aid.
The budget proposes a modest addition to science research funding. Harvard received over $600 million in federal funding for research in fiscal year 2010, according to the University’s annual fiscal report.
In total, the National Institutes of Health would receive about $32 billion for basic and applied biomedical research, up three percent from 2010.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) would receive a 13 percent boost, and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science would see a nine percent increase.
In an interview with The Crimson, White House Domestic Policy Council Director Melody C. Barnes said that the larger increase in funding for NSF indicates the administration’s prioritization of energy technology and training of math and science teachers.
Harvard Director of Federal Relations Suzanne Day said that these modest increases show “a deep commitment to research and biomedical research,” especially considering the financial climate.
According to Day, the NSF has enjoyed a significant amount of bipartisan support for increased funding, which also explains the considerable budgetary increase.
“I think that the president has sent pretty clear signals about investments in the foundations of economic growth,” Day said. “So we expected a strong budget in education and research.”
The funds allocated for the sciences target areas that are most likely to create jobs, White House Office of Public Engagement Associate Director Kalpen S. Modi said on a conference call with reporters yesterday.
Obama’s budget also sustains the Federal Pell Grant Program for college students, keeping the maximum grant amount at $5,550.
The Obama administration has increased the total award by $819 since 2008, Barnes said. Republicans are seeking to cut the maximum Pell Grant by $845.
Barnes said that the maintenance of Pell Grants is one indicator of the president’s emphasis on innovation and education, and that his budget seeks to position the U.S. to “out-build and out-innovate our global competitors.”
Though the value of Pell Grants pales in comparison to the average aid package awarded by Harvard’s financial aid office—around $40,000—the program is important nationally.
“It is clear that there is a lot at stake for students and we are all watching the developments carefully and working hard to make sure key federal financial aid programs are protected,” Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue wrote in an e-mail. “The Pell Grant program is not only critical as a source of grant funding for low income students nationally, but it is also critical as an aspirational program for younger students from low income families who need to know that college is accessible for them.”
Day said that the University usually does not have trouble garnering support in Washington for financial aid. “Aid programs are not places where we have trouble finding friends across the aisle,” she said.
Day said that Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations will work with coalitions, organizations, and peer institutions to remind members of Congress of the importance of investing in education.
“We understand the intense scrutiny for every expenditure at this time and hope, and will work to sustain, the tradition of bipartisan support these programs have enjoyed because of their evergreen contributions to our economy,” said Harvard’s chief lobbyist Kevin Casey.

Harvard Law School announced last week that it would partner with prominent New York law firm Milbank to create an annual eight-day executive training program for associates.
The program will teach fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh year associates about three major areas: business and finance, law, and leadership and management, according to Ashish Nanda, the Law School’s faculty chair of executive education.
"Clients are increasingly demanding value-for-fee charged," Nanda said, explaining that Milbank is trying to use the program to build the capabilities of its associates that will "translate to better quality of service to clients."
The program will benefit the Law School as well, according to Nanda. He said that the program would give the Law School a “tactile, close look at senior- and mid-level associates.”
Since many Law School students will become associates at law firms, Nanda said the Law School hopes to assess what associates need to know and didn’t learn while acquiring their law degrees. This will enable the Law School to potentially tweak their J.D. program to make it more meaningful, according to Nanda.
The partnership with Milbank will also allow the Law School to explore the possibility of creating an executive education program with open enrollment or offering more executive education programs for junior members of firms. Many other professional schools, like the Harvard Business School, offer many executive education programs.
Nanda says that the Law School would be happy to collaborate on executive education programs with other law firms or government bodies that approach Law School administrators.
While other firms have chosen to respond to the market by cutting the number of associates or making associates take yearly exams, Milbank leaders have been seeking a way to distinguish themselves, according to Nanda.
“We are delighted to initiate this unique program at Harvard Law School,” said Mel M. Immergut, chairman of Milbank, in a Law School statement. “We believe that our clients need lawyers who have been trained in both business and law at the highest level, with a real-world practical understanding of the commercial problems that they face.”
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said she was excited about the collaboration in the Law School statement.
“This collaboration will represent an important part of Harvard Law School’s continuing emphasis on strengthening the ties between theory and practice, as well as business and law, connecting our teaching with the fresh experiences of the legal practitioners who will come here to learn but also to share knowledge,” Minow said.

CORRECTION: FEB. 16, 2011.
The Feb. 16 article "Harvard Law School Partners with Milbank" misquoted Law School Professor Ashish Nanda as saying that there is a link between a weak labor market and demands placed on law firms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entomology Professor Edward O. Wilson, a ground-breaking biologist who coined the terms “biodiversity” and “sociobiology,” has received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category, in recognition of his long and varied career in the field.
The award, which includes a 400,000 euro prize check, is given to interdisciplinary scholars who have made major contributions to science.
Wilson, a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction, is best known for his studies on ants, which revealed the way that ants use pheromones to communicate with one another. That research garnered Wilson the moniker “Lord of the Ants.”
In addition to his research on the ant population, Wilson’s research has also contributed widely to the field of biology. His coinage of term “sociobiology,” which explains the social behavior of humans through evolutionary and biological terms, led to a wide variety of research into the topic.
Wilson has also contributed to ecological research. He coined another term—“biodiversity,” which refers to the variation of species in a particular ecosystem—that helped spark research into such issues.
“I have to say that the public and politicians are insufficiently aware of the importance of biodiversity,” Wilson said in a press release accompanying the announcement of his award.
Wilson is widely considered to be one of the giants of his field, and his research has made major contributions to fields outside of his own specialty, especially evolutionary psychology.
“For me, Ed Wilson is one of the faculty whom I admire most because he has pursued his research in the purest way possible,” Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Peter R. Girguis said. “Often times, it is easy to be swayed by fads that occur in the sciences, but Ed Wilson has always been the person to let the data do the talking and pursue science in a manner that he thinks is the most appropriate. This helps explains his intellectual firepower.”
The BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category is given out once a year and is currently in its third year.
Wilson could not be reached for comment yesterday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meet junior Valentin Staller. As a Harvard fencer, Staller had never won an Ivy League championship. But last weekend Staller beat Adam Fields from Yale in the men’s sabre, and freshman teammate Mike Raynis narrowly defeated Yale’s Peter Cohen. Staller finally had his championship trophy.  Maybe it was the eggs or the indie rock—either way, in this exclusive interview with The Full Court Press, Stellar explains why fencing is cool, and leaves us with a mystery: why was the fencing team ad-boarded in 2005? Every week The Full Court Press gives you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Valentin Staller
Year: 2012
Stats: As a freshman, Staller started his Harvard career with a bang, claiming silver at the NCAA Regionals, and placing 15th at NCAA Championships in the men’s sabre event. Last year, Staller took it a step further finishing 6th in the nation at NCAA Championships after winning 15 bouts.
He may be an Ivy League Champion, but how well will he handle these questions?
1.Typical pre-game meal.
I always try to eat eggs beforehand, and I've been getting really into fruit lately. I don't know if this counts, but I also always take Ibuprofen before a competition.
2. List four songs you listen to before matches to get pumped up.
Here are some songs that have been in the rotation lately:
"Mr. November" by The National. Pumps me up for life.
"Your Hand in Mine" by Explosions in the Sky. This one's sweet because it reminds me of Friday Night Lights (TV Show, sorry), and that really pumps me up.  Coach Taylor has taught me a lot about myself.
"Hip Hop is Dead" by Nas. Can't say I really know what it's about, but it's still pretty intense.
"Drain the Blood" by the Rural Alberta Advantage.  A random indie rock band with a cool name and great drums.
3. Favorite team to fence against and why?
My favorite team to fence is probably Princeton, because it's always really intense. I don't know how it happened, but we developed a pretty serious rivalry with them since I got here.  Before that, the team to beat used to be Columbia, so it's funny how it switched.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Not too much ridiculous stuff happens. Just a lot of hugging, mostly.  I think all the crazy things happened before the whole team got ad-boarded in 2005.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had fencing.
My most embarrassing moment as a member of the fencing team was probably when I participated in the SAAC Bench Press for Breast Cancer competition last year. Some of our guys couldn't make it, so I was bumped up to the A-squad at the last minute.  I definitely benched less than anyone else in the room.  I did get a sweet t-shirt out of it, though.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I think that I'm the hare that lost to the tortoise. I run into problems when I get antsy and rush too much.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a match you were in.
See, fencing is a cool sport because it's the fencers themselves who yell the craziest things, and we have some crazy, passionate guys on the team. Just Youtube it. It's pretty strange to see for the first time. I think it originated before there was electric scoring equipment; people would basically need to convince the referee that they scored a touch.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
If I could play another sport, it would probably be women's squash. Winning a national championship is pretty amazing.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
I'm told that I'd be a chaser. I think they score a lot.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
I'd probably want to take out Jeremy Lin to dinner. He's kind of a hero of mine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the midpoint of the Ivy League basketball season, which means that everyone has had the chance to play everybody else. We’ve seen some great games, some surprising upsets, and we’re down to two contenders for the title in Princeton and Harvard.
The main thing I’ve learned from watching every team play thus far is that the league is significantly more competitive top-to-bottom than in years past. There have been more close games and fewer blowouts, and the Tigers and Crimson have both respectively had some trouble with league bottom-feeders Cornell and Dartmouth.
There are also a lot more good players, but fewer great players, in the conference this season. Last year, the Ancient Eight was star-heavy, highlighted by Cornell’s Big Three, the Crimson’s Jeremy Lin ’10, Yale’s Alex Zampier, and Brown’s Matt Mullery, all of whom dominated their teams’ offenses. This year, the scoring is more balanced on nearly every squad, and because there are more good offensive players, the games have been more competitive.
There’s the Tigers, for example, whose four leading scorers are all within one point of one another. Harvard has six players who could easily lead the team in scoring on any given night.
Last season, five players averaged over 16.2 points a game; this year, no player has averaged that many. There’s no clear frontrunner for Ivy League Player of the Year or Rookie of the Year right now, both of which likely be determined by teams’ performances in the second half of their conference schedules.
Let’s take a look at what we’ve learned about each squad at the season’s midpoint. And with the Oscars right around the corner, let’s put the Ivy League scene in Hollywood terms.
Brown is “True Grit,” as each has one impressive rookie—Sean McGonagill for the Bears and Hailee Steinfeld on screen—being the major highlight of both.
But with Peter Sullivan, Tucker Halpern, and McGonagill, Brown is certainly talented offensively, as Harvard learned after Saturday night’s stunning 55-point first-half outburst.
Columbia is “127 Hours.” Both are centered around one key figure (James Franco in the film, Noruwa Agho on the court), but neither has enough supporting talent to push it to that next level.
Cornell is “Black Swan.” Chris Wroblewski and Natalie Portman provide the star power, and Errick Peck and Mila Kunis are solid in supporting roles. In both, a new coach is trying to continue the successes of the past few seasons, but unfortunately for Thomas Leroy and Bill Courtney, the plot of each story is based around the new talent not being as good as its predecessor.
Dartmouth is “Toy Story 3.” Both team and movie involve college students playing as if they were little kids.
Penn is “Inception.” Filled with stars, but mind-bogglingly confusing. The Quakers arguably have the most talent in the conference and a quartet of Zach Rosen, Jack Eggleston, Tyler Bernadini, and Miles Cartwright that's probably the best in the league, but they’re also by far the most inconsistent team. To play the way they did against Harvard and Princeton—two games they should have won in overtime—and then to lose at Cornell and Columbia the following weekend makes absolutely no sense.
Princeton is “The Fighter.” With four go-to performers (Ian Hummer, Kareem Maddox, Dan Mavraides, and Doug Davis on the court, or Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams in the film), the Tigers—like Mickey Ward—won’t blow you away, but they’ll hang with you just long enough to pull out the win in the end.  They're the best team in the conference right now, just like “The Fighter” was, in my opinion, the best picture of the year.
Yale is “The King’s Speech.” Both feature one star (Greg Mangano for the Bulldogs, and Colin Firth for the Britons) and came out of nowhere in terms of pundits’ preseason predictions to become solid competitors.
It’s too bad for Yale that Michael Sands left the team before the start of the season; pairing him with Mangano in the frontcourt with Austin Morgan and Porter Braswell in the backcourt would probably have had the Bulldogs up there with the Tigers and Crimson right now—the team’s size would have been tough to beat.
Finally, of course, there’s Harvard, which is “The Social Network,” and not for the obvious reasons. Both may not win the title this year, but highlighted by young talent, they will probably be the story people talk most about in years to come.
In both cases, the team stayed strong after losing one of its key components—Eduardo Saverin and Lin. Harvard isn’t blowing out teams at home like it did last year, but that’s likely because its opponents have gotten better. So as strange as it seems that the Crimson could improve after losing one of the best players in franchise history, the improvement of co-captain Keith Wright and the addition of freshman Laurent Rivard may have helped it do just that.
Wright has developed from a guy who would merely hit his open lay-ups when Lin was double-teamed into a player with consistent post moves and a reliable outside jumper. Rivard, meanwhile, has singlehandedly brought the team back into two games it would have otherwise had no business being in—at Michigan and at Princeton—with his eye-opening three-ball ability.
As good as Lin was, the offense at times tended to revolve around him too much last year. This season, the ball movement has been much better in Tommy Amaker’s more balanced inside-out scheme.
No matter what happens this season, with no seniors and the Ivy’s best recruiting class by a mile, the Crimson–which is probably a Kyle Casey injury away from being 20-2 right now–should be the best team in the conference for years to come.
With a veteran backcourt in will-be senior Oliver McNally and will-be junior Brandyn Curry, an interior post threat in Wright, and great shooters in Rivard and Christian Webster, the team will have all the components you look for in a team capable of making a Cornell-esque tournament run next year.
But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. We’ll gladly take the Golden Globe for now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—With 13:21 to play in the third period of the 33rd annual women’s Beanpot finals, Boston College forward Mary Restuccia stole the puck just outside the Harvard crease after a long Crimson possession.
Before the Harvard defense could adjust, the Eagles’ junior quickly tucked a shot behind sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy, and into the top left corner of the net.
Restuccia’s goal put No. 7 Boston College (20-6-5, 12-4-3 WHEA) up by one over the Crimson, (14-9-4, 13-4-3 ECAC), and, unfortunately for Harvard, gave the Eagles a lead they would not relinquish, as Boston College took down the defending Beanpot champions, 3-1, at the Conte Forum last night.
“When we turned the puck over it cost us,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Of course, I’m disappointed and our players are disappointed, but I think we played well…It’s a game of turn-aways and takeovers and we turned the puck over more than we took it away.”
The Eagles would go on to seal the deal with a late assurance goal, as tri-captain Kelli Stack netted the last goal of the game at 16:42 off of a pass from Restuccia.
“To be able to have a championship in the middle of the season, it’s extra special,” said Boston College coach Katie King. “I think our kids do a good job of getting up for it and being ready to play when it’s time for the Beanpot.”
The Eagles were first to light up the scoreboard on the night, as BC sophomore Caitlin Walsh scored on a breakaway, unassisted, with under three minutes to play in the first period.
But just seconds later, while the Eagles’ opening goal was still being announced, senior forward Katherine Chute evened the score, 1-1, with Harvard’s only goal of the night.
Bellamy earned the assist with a long pass to Chute, who was sitting in the neutral zone. The senior weaved through the BC’s defenders before slipping the puck into the right side of the goal over tri-captain goaltender, Molly Shaus.
The second period was scoreless, though chances to take the lead came on both sides.
The Crimson and the Eagles had eight shots on goal apiece, and each team had one two-minute power play in the second, with Harvard taking the advantage at 13:30 and BC going a man up at 4:20.
“We’re a much better team now [than when we first played Boston College],” Stone said. “Our emotional resiliency was there tonight and it wasn’t there before [winter break]. We put too much pressure on the game before, but now our kids can just go play. They believe in each other and we have a better game than we did before Christmas.”
Without a doubt, the Eagles had the closest opportunity on goal in the second period.
With less than seven minutes to play in the frame, a shot from Boston College forward Danielle Welch hit the crossbar and bounced out.
At the next stoppage, the referees reviewed video footage of the play, but the ruling of ‘no goal’ on the ice was confirmed.
“I always think those [almost-goals] go in,” King said. “Or I always hope they go in. That’s one of the reasons we have the video replay system…to be able to check out those kinds of opportunities.”
Bellamy had a particularly strong game between the pipes, with 26 saves and an assist on the Crimson’s only goal of the Beanpot finals. Shaus had a solid night as well, recording 31 saves.
The Eagles swept the two All-Tournament honors, as Schaus took home the Joe Bertagna Goaltending Award and Restuccia earned Tournament MVP honors.
Harvard has won 13 Beanpot titles in the tournament’s history, just one fewer than the all-time leader in wins, Northeastern.
Despite the loss last night, Stone is confident in her team’s potential, as the Crimson heads into the final week of the regular season.
“We need every game, from the first one back in October to the last game of the regular season on Saturday night,” Stone said. “We approach each game like we want them all…We’re still playing for the No. 2 spot in the league, which would secure home ice for us all the way up to the [ECAC finals].”
The quest for home ice will continue with matches against Colgate and Cornell this Friday and Saturday, respectively, at Bright Hockey Center, to round out the final weekend of regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—A year ago, Molly Schaus was training with the U.S. Olympic team, and her teammates back in Chestnut Hill were wishing she were there. The opening round of last year’s Beanpot pitted Harvard then-freshman Laura Bellamy against fellow rookie, Corinne Boyles. Bellamy needed only 15 saves to secure the shutout, while the Crimson abused Boyles with 51 shots to take a 5-0 victory.
In the Eagles’ Beanpot rematch with Harvard, Schaus showed her team what it had been missing a year ago. While both goaltenders made impressive saves over the course of the night, the silver medalist won the cage match with a 31-save performance that secured her team its fourth Beanpot title and earned her the Joe Bertagna Goaltending Award as the best goaltender.
“I thought Molly had a few really...good saves, and big saves for us at the beginning of the game,” said Boston College coach Katie King. “She did a great job.”
The Eagles’ netminder was just as impressive in the team’s Dec. 5th meeting, which also took place in Conte Forum. But unlike the first Conte clash, the BC forwards were unable to provide Schaus with the same offensive cushion. With the Beanpot title game tied for nearly the first 45 minutes, Schaus’s play was much more critical than it had been in the team’s first meeting.
BELL-IEVE IT
While the Crimson suffered a setback in its quest to qualify for the NCAA tournament, it also demonstrated just how far it had come since its first meeting with the Eagles, a 6-2 loss in Conte Forum.
“We’re better,” Stone said. “We’re a much better hockey team. We’re playing a team game. Our resiliency—mental and emotional resiliency—is there. It wasn’t there before. We put too much pressure on every game. Now our kids just go play. They believe in each other…Everyone stepped up.”
Perhaps no one stepped up more than Bellamy, who made 26 saves in last night’s loss. In December, the sophomore made 12 saves while allowing six goals. But over the course of January, Bellamy has found her rhythm in the cage.
In a contest that pitted her against an Olympic medalist, the sophomore held her own.
“She played great today,” Stone said. “She’s doing what she needs to do. She’s making saves she needs to make.”
Last night, the sophomore made several saves that were anything but routine. One of these saves came shortly after BC’s junior forward Mary Restuccia put her team ahead six minutes into the third period. The Eagles seemed poised to score again as one of its forwards broke free for a one-on-one with Bellamy. But the sophomore stuffed the shot, sending it behind the cage and giving her teammates time to recover.
“Unfortunately sometimes we put more pressure on her than we need to,” Stone said. “She comes up big then. She’s keeping it simple. She’s making the saves a goalie should make and every once in a while she makes a big save that hides a big mistake of ours.”
FLY LIKE AN EAGLE
Boston College may not have the historical Beanpot success of neighborhood rivals, Harvard and Northeastern—not taking their first title until 2006—but in the past six years, the Eagles have been making up for lost time.
“Hopefully this continues,” King said, “but one step at a time.”
King attributed her team’s recent success to the leadership of its senior class, especially Olympians Kelli Stack and Schaus, who serve as tri-captains with classmate Katelyn Kurth.
“Kelli [Stack] and Molly...have changed our program,” King said. “For them to be able to end their senior year ...with a win is awesome, and you know they’ve worked extremely hard for their four years that they’ve been here. ”
Stack and Schaus, both of whom missed the 2009-2010 season to compete in the Olympics, won three Beanpots in their four years with Boston College. The Crimson’s senior class will finish its career with two Beanpot titles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a good time for most of Harvard. The cold looks like it might just end after all, meaning we won’t have to mummify ourselves before we go outside anymore. And what’s more, we have Presidents’ Day just around the corner. For Harvard sports, though, things aren’t quite as cheery, or at least they weren’t last weekend, thanks to a bunch of tough losses. But with the start of a new week came good news for the Crimson. We’ll explain it all in another edition of Around the Water Cooler.
This past weekend saw some exciting action in the Ivy League, but a lot of it didn’t go Harvard’s way.
After an undefeated start to the Ancient Eight season, the Crimson women’s basketball team unexpectedly dropped both games over the weekend to fall from first to third in the league standings. And after Princeton and Yale won both of their games, the Tigers and the Bulldogs overtook the Crimson to finish the weekend in first and second, respectively.
In men’s basketball, despite narrowly holding off a tough Yale team and overcoming a large deficit to knock off Brown, Harvard failed to gain any ground in the Ancient Eight standings, thanks to two Princeton wins.
But perhaps the best Ivy action over the weekend came not under the net or on the ice but on the squash court.
Saturday featured a showdown of the high-ranking men’s and women’s squads from Harvard and Yale. While on the men’s side the No.2 Bulldogs coasted to an easy 7-2 victory over the No. 6 Crimson, the women’s contest was much closer. In a down-to-the-wire finish, No. 2 Yale squeaked out a 5-4 victory over No. 1 Harvard. With the win, the Bulldogs ended the Crimson’s two-year winning streak and will undoubtedly overtake Harvard in the polls as the top women’s team in the country.
After the tough weekend, things began to look better for Harvard on Monday.
In a huge upset, Harvard men’s hockey team overpowered No. 15 Boston University in Monday’s Beanpot consolation match, 5-4. While the victory wasn’t in conference play, it could spell trouble for other ECAC teams.
Despite a weak start to the season, Harvard has picked up its game considerably, culminating in Monday’s win. Other than an ugly 4-0 loss to Northeastern in the Beanpot opener, the Crimson hasn’t lost by more than a goal in over a month and has kept up with some top-level teams, just losing to then-No. 3 Yale before tying then-No. 20 Princeton, 4-4. If Harvard continues on its upward trajectory, the men from Cambridge could wreak some unexpected havoc in the ECAC playoffs, which start Mar. 4.
The hockey win over BU wasn’t the only good news Harvard received on Monday. Earlier in the day, former Harvard backstop Matt Kramer ’08 signed with the Boston Red Sox. While wearing a Crimson uniform, Kramer did most of his damage with his glove and, in his senior year, with his bat. In his 2008 campaign, Kramer led the team in slugging percentage and was second on the squad with three dingers.
But the Red Sox are more impressed with Kramer’s arm and plan on bringing him from behind the plate to on top of the rubber. After all, Kramer can light up the gun with his 93-95 mph fastball and a high-80’s slider.

Have you ever had the urge to shout from the rooftops your undying love for the United States? We can't help you with the rooftops, however, but thanks to the new website "God Bless 'Merica," created by Adams House resident Justin R. Butler '11, you can come pretty close. Butler combined his web design hobby with inside jokes between him and his friends into a blog that allows people to share why they love 'Merica.
 
The idea began with Butler's recognition of the popularity of niche user-generated content websites, such as HarvardFML. 
"We're always talking about ridiculous things that we do and how much we love America," Butler said. These conversations led him to create a forum with which to share moments of American pride.
 
Users can submit links, pictures, videos, and stories anonymously by visiting  the website. However, be sure to exercise your First Amendment rights carefully, as the terms of the website allow for alteration and deletion of posts by moderators.
"It's definitely been a concern of ours to moderate it, at least in the beginning," Butler said, "so that it doesn't become a hateful thing, because it's supposed to be a fun, all-inclusive thing."
 
So far, "God Bless ‘Merica" has gotten more hits than Butler anticipated, and he and his friends hope to expand and create other user-generated content blogs and websites, possibly of a more serious nature
 
Until then? Go online to share your pride for the red, white, and blue, and "GB'M."

Vi Hart, recreational mathemusician perhaps best known for her videos about doodling in math class,  is in residence in Pforzheimer House this week. Last night, she held a  workshop where Pforzheimer and College affiliates—including this Flyby  correspondent—learned to make polyhedrons and other mathematical objects  using balloons.
