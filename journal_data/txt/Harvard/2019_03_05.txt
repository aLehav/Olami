While the Jonas Brothers broke up just over six years ago, their reunion single, “Sucker,” feels like the unfortunate culmination of the “10 Year Challenge” meme: The last time this trio was collectively relevant was a decade ago. This single is as about as appealing as that random person from high school you still follow on social media bragging about his “glow-up.” Truly, some things never change — the Jonas Brothers are back and bland as ever.
At their peak, the Jonas Brothers produced middling music for middle school students. In the years that followed their break up, two of the brothers (Nick and Joe) sought independent music careers. Nick, in his solo career, moved away from the brothers’ original pop-rock towards a vaguely R&B-esque sound, while Joe, fronting DNCE, went in the direction of a poppy faux-funk. The latter is closest to the brothers’ new sound on “Sucker” — although the track sounds less like DNCE’s hit single “Cake by the Ocean,” than it does a B-side. This lightly funky number about being a “sucker” for someone manages — in its roughly three minute duration — to run through what feels like an exhaustive, or maybe just exhausting, list of songwriting cliches about desire. The by-the-numbers pop, unsurprisingly partly-penned by Ryan Tedder, is not improved by the brothers’ lackluster, uninspired vocals, featuring their requisite harmonizations and unspirited solos.
To be fair, the Jonas Brothers’ popularity never had much to do with the quality of their songwriting. They were primarily known for being cute, in a distinctly white-bread way, and squeaky clean — as purity-ring sporting Disney channel stars — the sort of boys so often aggressively marketed to young women as appropriately crush-worthy. They are still insipidly cute and they’ve all since ditched the purity rings — Nick and Joe are now on the other side of the timeless former Disney Channel star ritual of proving their sexual adulthood through tiresome gestures. To an extent, they are still doing it in this track.
In the accompanying video, Nick, Joe, and Kevin perform with their respective partners (superstar Priyanka Chopra, Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner, and reality television personality Danielle Jonas) in a mostly G-rated fashion. There is a mildly surprising scene in which Joe is briefly shown tied up in his boxers while Turner looks on licking her lips with something approaching lasciviousness. Unfortunately, this moment of self-conscious naughtiness is the most interesting thing about this pat and predictable comeback single.

Michigan-born indie-pop artist Quinn XCII showcased his superb talent in an intimate performance at the House of Blues in Boston. Though Boston was far from the first stop on his “From Tour With Love” tour, Quinn XCII did not show the slightest exhaustion at his performance Wednesday evening. He greeted an apprehensive crowd with his new song, “Sad Still.” Immediately, the crowd started grooving with a recognizably catchy Quinn tempo. He filled the concert hall with his clear, melodic voice while fun, psychedelic patterns and images flashed on the screen behind him. His playful dancing and lively movement added to the lighthearted sensation in the crowd. Audience members on the first floor and up on the balconies couldn’t help but move to the irresistible beat of the music.
While most of Quinn XCII’s songs have a fun, upbeat feel, the perky pulse of his beat often masks the melancholy meaning behind his lyrics. This idea is particularly relevant — and noticeably paradoxical — in his newest album. “From Michigan With Love” is a testament to mental health. After singing a few of his songs, Quinn XCII actually paused to speak to the crowd and said, “Even though you might be going through a really shitty time right now… you have a tomorrow if you want it. Life is going to go on. If you feel like shit right now I want you to know you’re not alone.” Cheers and whistles from the audience punctuated his words as he continued, becoming increasingly personal. “We’re struggling through this together. And I want you to know this because I struggle with that stuff too, and it’s nice to know that there are other people out there that go through it, just like me,” he said. Quinn then proceeded to sing “Life Must Go On,” another song from his new album. The colorful lights flashed, the image behind the stage displayed playful, abstract images, and Quinn began to swing and bop his way across the stage once more.
The night continued with Quinn showcasing more of his new sounds, occasionally throwing in popular songs from previous albums such as “Candle” from “The Story of Us.” At one point, he seemed to disappear from the main stage, only to surprisingly pop up in the back of the venue in the middle of the shocked and ecstatic crowd. His proximity added an additional level of personal connection, bonding him with his audience even more. He soon appeared back on stage while the crowd continued to wave their arms and sway with the music. Many captured images and videos on their phone in attempts to crystalize the moment in memory.
Quinn XCII catered his entire performance to the audience. He truly did come from Michigan with love. And repeatedly, the crowd responded with cheers of exhilaration and appreciation. Even after he played his last song, “Kings of Summer” (a collaboration with Ayokay), the crowd refused to leave, pleading for an encore performance. Sure enough, Quinn XCII came back out with a song for the true fans: a piece from his debut album, “Another Day in Paradise.” He finished the night with a double encore. After asking each audience member to turn on their phone flashlight and put it up in the air, Quinn XCII played one of his most popular songs, “Flare Guns.” The incredible and moving night finished with the collective image of each concert-attendee — the House of Blues was dotted with small lights as everyone savored the last sounds of an unforgettable performance by Quinn XCII.

When someone says, “fashion in the 1980s,” a few things immediately come to mind: bright, flashy clothing, overstated accessories, tight spandex, parachute pants, fanny packs, and maybe even fingerless gloves. While a few of these looks are making a comeback in 2019, there are still some ‘80s items that remain niche and time-specific. Besides the classic “door-knocker earrings” and bright clothing, what were some of the specific crazes? And why? This piece takes a deeper dive into a few particular trends and the history behind some quintessential ‘80s items. An eclectic mix? Maybe. Weird and interesting? You decide.
1. Jane Fonda Workout Clothes
Thanks to the infamous Jane Fonda, Aerobics were incredibly trendy in the 1980s. She released upbeat workout videos where women leg-lifted, side-bended, and dumbell-raised in groups, accompanied by funky, fast-paced music. The success of Jane Fonda’s workout videos and her book “Jane Fonda’s Workout Book” led to a huge surge in the popularity of aerobics. More significantly, the general conception of working out eventually expanded to include women. It also resulted in a fashion craze of neon spandex, printed leotards, and leg warmers. Oh, and don’t forget the scrunchie. Perhaps the most peculiar of the Jane Fonda workout items were the “high-cut fitness briefs” over the spandex pants. This new trend of workout gear bid goodbye to boring gym outfits. Thanks, Jane, for spicing up workout fashion.
2. Nike Air Jordans
It’s 2019, and Nike Air Jordans are back in style. Whether it’s testament to Michael Jordan’s lasting legacy or to the general surge in sneaker wearing, these kicks owe their popularity to a dramatic story in the ‘80s. After Michael Jordan signed an endorsement deal with Nike, he debuted the original Air Jordans on court. The NBA then banned the sneaker, asserting that they did not conform to the league’s regulations on uniforms and colors. Of course, Jordan continued to wear the sneakers, facing a $5,000 per-game fine. This public pushback, combined with Jordan’s increasingly obvious talent on the court, resulted in a surge of Air Jordan popularity. Suddenly everyone had to have a pair.
3. Cosby Sweaters
Of all the ‘80s-specific trends, the “Cosby Sweater” one might immediately come to mind — more for its peculiarity than for its stylishness. Cosby sweaters feel as if the classic ugly Christmas sweater and the loud patterned sweater birthed an even more colorful child. The “Cosby sweater” got its name from — you guessed it — Bill Cosby on “The Cosby Show.” The legacy of the sweater is undoubtedly tainted by the recently revealed, and unacceptable actions of Bill Cosby himself, and it perhaps seems dubious how the sweater rose to such fame even as Bill Cosby was paving such a path of unpopularity. Nonetheless, these loud knits were a popular fashion trend in the 1980s, perhaps because “The Cosby Show” was one of America’s most popular TV shows at a time when many fashion trends were being picked up from television. The sweater has an explanation of its own: The director wanted to maintain each characters individualism, and because so many people were [on screen simultaneously, patterned clothing seemed to be the obvious answer. NBC also often spliced separate camera takes together in order to create a perfect shot. Creating a combined scene was much more forgiving and smooth when the actor was wearing a colorful sweater rather than a shirt and jacket that would show the slightest shift in costume.
4. Shoulder Pads
As women in the ‘80s continued to challenge their role as individuals in the workforce rather than wives or mothers at home, the shoulder pad emerged as a fashion trend that signified a woman’s power and her entrance into a man’s world. This phenomenon could be partly thanks to the shoulder-pad-wearing Margaret Thatcher, or other various characters on television. This trend in the ‘80s was an obvious challenge to the female role and the female silhouette — and a cool one at that. The shoulder pad allowed the female silhouette to shift away from exclusively the petite feminine look, and towards a presence with more obvious strength and assertion.
While people in 2019 may not be walking around in a Cosby Sweater or with big shoulder pads on, there are multiple references to ‘80s fashion in style today: off the shoulder shirts and dresses, high-waisted jeans, even animal print. Why could this be? Perhaps because style often works in cycles.
Perhaps 2019, like the ‘80s, has latched onto the trend of pushing back. The clothing worn by Michael Jordan and Jane Fonda gained iconic popularity largely because they made a splash and were unafraid to rebel against established cultural norms. In today’s social-political climate, it only makes sense that fashion is invoking this beloved bold era that perhaps isn’t as bygone as one would expect.

Anyone familiar with “Game of Thrones,” or rather with its fans, knows that any small tease of the upcoming season will send them into a frenzy. The eighth and final season of the beloved series is just around the corner and will premiere April 14. But since that might as well be five years away, the world has to be content with the short snippets of footage released sporadically by HBO.
A series of small teasers have been released in 2019. The “First Look” teaser, released in early January, showed brief footage of some of the main characters meeting at Winterfell, and featured what promises to be tension between the characters of Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen. The second teaser, related later that month, followed the Starks — namely, Jon Snow (Kit Harington), Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) , and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) — in the Winterfell Crypts, which soon filled with snow and ice, probably representing the coming Winter (and army of the dead). The latest teaser was a compilation for many of HBO’s 2019 shows. For the first time in a month, “Game of Thrones” fans got to catch another glimpse of the final season, including new Season 8 footage of, among other things, dragons and Unsullied soldiers in the North.
HBO loves to release the smallest bits of footage, knowing that a loyal and zealous will gobble them up. Of course, this will lead to the inevitable dissection of every millisecond by the Internet. From Twitter to Youtube, people speculated on everything – EVERYTHING – from the microscopic details of Arya Stark’s outfit to the metaphoric significance of the Stark children standing in the crypts. The most debate, however, has been centered on the ever pressing question: Who is going to die this season? It’s anyone’s guess who “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin and show creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have decided to kill off, and in what creative and disturbing ways they’ll do it. Who knows, maybe they’ll just let the Night King win, and everyone else die.
The suspense is crushing, and won’t abate until HBO releases a proper trailer — and the Internet goes completely berserk again. This only leads, however, to more speculation and theories until something else comes along. It’s a truly vicious cycle, especially for those who just want to enjoy the show without having to entertain 50 ridiculous Youtuber theories (like how Bran Stark may be the Night King?). Let’s just all take a breath, because whether you’re a casual watcher or hard-core fan who dedicates your life to figuring out plotlines three episodes in advance, everyone’s questions will be answered in April.

It would be hard to argue that Ariana Grande can’t sing. There is a mountain of live audio evidence on just YouTube alone demonstrating her raw vocal talent across multiple genres of music. Take, for the example, the goofy “Wheel of Musical Impressions” segment on “The Tonight Show,” seemingly designed to let Jimmy Fallon show off his knack for mimicking Sting and Bruce Springsteen, and how Grande’s appearance on it elevated the hokey game to ridiculous new heights. She nailed Christina Aguilera’s insane though often excessive rifs and melismas as well as Celine Dion’s distinct nasally tone (she even includes the aggressive chest bumps and classic Dion outbursts like “Shall we go for it?!”). Since she makes her powerful, resonant tone seem so effortless, it’s hard to believe that that much sound can come out a girl who is only five feet tall. But her vocal stats can’t lie — a four octave range that features both whistle tones and a dark, well-supported lower register and allows her to healthily belt all the way up to a B5 (translation: really freaking high). Even though her sound matches the typical energy of a soprano pop diva, she also has a strong enough mixed voice to nail a Broadway staple like “The Wizard & I.” The irrepressible joy on her face when she absolutely crushed the “Wicked” tune at the musical’s fifteenth anniversary concert is magically infectious, and it’s a shame that this doesn’t shine through more often.
The point is, Grande’s problem is not whether she has vocal prowess but rather that the quality of her music rarely matches her potential.
Her two most recent hits, “7 rings” and “thank u, next” emphasize how her catchy pop songs certainly excite her massive fan base yet don’t take full advantage of the powerhouse voice behind the mic. There’s no denying that “thank u, next” was a cultural phenomenon, reinventing what it means to write an empowering break-up song with a sensational, record-breaking music video to go along with it. But at the end of the day, these chart-toppers are quite melodically mundane, consisting of repetitive choruses smack dab in the middle of Grande’s range. Sampling “My Favorite Things” was a risky move that could have been a wonderful homage to the beloved Julie Andrews, but instead it comes across more as lazy, especially with the rather irreverent lyric, “Whoever said money can't solve your problems must not have had enough money to solve 'em.” And while “thank u, next” is bubbly, addicting, and fun, the fact that any drunk college girl can sing it at the top of her lungs at a party isn’t exactly a sign of the song’s complexity or soulfulness.
A quick Google search will confirm the bold claim people are making that Ariana Grande is “the voice of our generation,” a pop queen comparable to Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey. Whether the claims are exaggerated or spot-on, their mere existence signals the respect and reverence this 25-year-old ex-Nickelodeon star has accumulated. However, what Grande lacks is her very own “I Will Always Love You,” a song so emotionally charged that it will awe audiences for decades, one where she uses her God-given talent not just to craft something sweet or sexy but to soar to new heights.
It’s worrisome to think that Grande might be constrained by any sort of “songwriting formula” or that her high ponytailed, childish but seductive persona is keeping her trapped. Perhaps the evolution of Lady Gaga from an eccentric meat-dress lover with a follower of “Little Monsters” to an unstoppable Oscar-winner proves that it is possible to transcend a character and create music that bursts with undeniable passion. It would be wonderful to be able to root for an Ariana Grande song as easily as it is to admire and admittedly envy her voice.

In 2005, George W. Bush was inaugurated for his second term as president, Jennifer Aniston filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, and people who are now in their late twenties were turning up to “Gold Digger” at their middle school dances. Situated halfway between the release of “Toxic” and Britney Spears’s infamous breakdown, 2005 marked a period of change and controversy. The LGBTQ+ community was no exception to this turbulence. As more states began to consider the legalization of same-sex marriage, mass media realized the money-making potential of queer topics and audiences. What followed was an outpouring of LGBTQ+ media. Here are five of the most significant.
5. “Capote”
“Capote” is not typically thought of as an LGBTQ+ movie, and this is where its beauty lies. Telling the story of real life writer Truman Capote and his investigation into the murder of the Clutter family, this film was met with wide critical acclaim. Unlike many biographical films of the past, “Capote” does not shy away from depicting the title character’s relationships with men. This subtle normalization of same-sex relationships speaks to the role that films can play in shifting public opinion. It also helps that Philip Seymour Hoffman’s portrayal of Capote marks one of the most memorable performances of the decade.
4. “The Color Purple” opens on Broadway
Despite its associations with queer and female audiences, Broadway has not had the best track record with portraying relationships between women. Queer female characters are often relegated to the background (if they even appear at all). “The Color Purple” marked a turning point in this (lack of) representation. Like the 1982 novel it is based on, this musical tells the story of Celie, an African American woman navigating the struggles of life in the South, as well as a relationship with blues singer Shug Avery. When it first opened, “The Color Purple” was the only Broadway show to depict a same-sex relationship between two women of color. Though things have improved slightly since then, there is still a long way to go.
3. “Rent”
Though not without its controversies, “Rent” has always held a special place in the hearts of the LGBTQ+ community. The 2005 film is no exception. Sporting a diverse and star studded cast, “Rent” dives headfirst into the lives of a group of friends dealing with ever-increasing rent and the threat of the AIDS crisis. All of this is accompanied by some of the catchiest songs known to man (everyone has at least heard “Seasons of Love” once). Despite its flaws, such as biphobia and transphobic tropes, “Rent” remains one of the most popular pieces of queer media to date. Just don’t let a theater kid catch you saying that you like the film soundtrack more than the Broadway cast recording.
2. “Brokeback Mountain”
Heath Ledger. Jake Gyllenhaal. Cowboys. Love. Need I say more? There’s no reason to center a list of LGBTQ+ media on 2005 if you’re not going to include “Brokeback Mountain.” Not only does the film unambiguously depict the relationship between two men in the American West, but it also pushes boundaries in its questioning of love and masculinity. Critics and fans alike saw the brilliance in this memorable romantic drama, and it went on to win three Academy Awards — though we all know it should have been at least four. Like Ledger’s character Ennis, this film cannot be topped, except by...
1. “Sky High”
This should go without saying. Sure, “Sky High” is a random, overlooked Disney movie with zero (explicitly) queer characters whatsoever, but that should not stop it from being considered one of the most iconic pieces of LGBTQ+ media of all time. What other film so poignantly touches on themes of accepting outcasts, breaking binaries, and never judging others based on first appearances? And what other character is as queer-coded as guinea pig shapeshifter Maj? This movie about a young boy learning what it means to truly be a hero deserves to be at the top of any 2005 themed list. Besides, there are certainly plenty of queer people who owe their gay awakenings to Warren Peace or Layla Williams.

When “How to Train Your Dragon” first premiered in 2009, a teenage Hiccup and a wounded dragon, named Toothless came together in an unlikely friendship. Almost a decade and two movies later, a new player comes into the picture — a romantic interest for Toothless. “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World” follows this new love in an endearing story with outstanding graphics and music, neatly tying together the plot of the beloved trilogy. Aside from somewhat predictable character development, the story remains as heartwarming as ever. It’s a joy to follow Hiccup and Toothless on their thrilling rides through worlds that the animators have rendered with stunning visual detail.
Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and Toothless’s crew lead a raid in an effort to rescue dragons from captivity. Despite the peaceful utopia that dragons and humans have maintained on Berk, where Hiccup’s people have now lived for seven generations, the island is running out of space and is susceptible to other Viking civilizations that angrily demand the once-captive dragons that Hiccup’s clan has stolen from them and freed. Threatened by an attack by the dragon-hunter Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham), Hiccup pursues “The Hidden World” — the place where all dragons come from — that his father told him about when he was still a young child. Grimmel uses a female white dragon, dubbed “Light Fury” by Astrid, as bait to try to capture Toothless, who’s the last known surviving Night Fury. After a night attack from Grimmel, who sets fire to much of the village, the Berkians leave their island behind and set forth for “The Hidden World.”
Under the direction of Dean DeBlois, who also directed the previous two films, Hiccup seems to struggle to grow into his role as a leader, especially while a distracted Toothless pursues his new love interest. The pressure from others for him to marry Astrid (America Ferrera) only adds to his uncertainty. Grimmel says of Berk’s people, “They don’t have a leader; they just have a boy.” Though Hiccup goes through somewhat of a hackneyed, well-tread character arc of trying to “find himself,” DeBlois’ supporting characters, though sometimes annoying — Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) and her non-stop monologue and commentary on everything, Snotlout (Jonah Hill) with his oblivious self-presumption — are also undeniably funny. The characters aren’t perfect, but they don’t need to be. They flit in and out of scenes and carry the story, and are all lovable in their own ways.
The highlights of the film are the stunning graphics, animation, and music. The courting scenes between Toothless and Light Fury are absolutely gorgeous. As they fly across skies of brilliant colors with their sleek bodies intertwining, their chemistry practically radiates from the screen. Their flight through the skies, which leads them to nothing other than the Hidden World itself, an interstellar-looking landscape of dragon utopia, is a beautiful journey. John Powell’s dramatic music also elevates the power of the scenes as the score soars with the dragons.
Beneath the visual acrobatics the film manages to pull off, the messages it leaves behind are darker than what the family-friendly fighting scenes may suggest, and something that older audiences can grapple with. Would it be impossible for humans to live with the sacred dragon species? Can humans be trusted with powerful weapons or would they just become irresponsibly, chaotically violent? Or — a much more practical question — is it impossible for completely different cultures to live together peacefully? Though the animated film is full of delightful scenes for the young, the story and the technical effects transcend the expectations of a children’s film and make “The Hidden World” an enjoyable watch for all.

No single channel or individual is more responsible for the rise of modern foodie culture than Food Network. From scientific analyses of ingredients to high-adrenaline cooking competitions, the channel offers programming for all audiences. From someone who has consumed Food Network since elementary school, here are the top five shows the Food Network has ever produced.
5. “Barefoot Contessa”
Ina Garten’s “Barefoot Contessa,” the oldest show on Food Network’s schedule, has earned a place in the American home — if not as a source of easy entertaining tips, then as a meme about store-bought vanilla. The classic cooking show may be critiqued as boring by some, but there’s something beautiful and refreshing about scenic shots of Garten’s garden, her trips to the grocery store, and Michael (Ina’s florist and friend) coming to visit weirdly often. Her high brow recipes may not be the easiest, fastest, or cheapest to make at home, but they are nonetheless delicious.
4. “Good Eats”
Alton Brown is perhaps best known today for “Cutthroat Kitchen,” a show that incorporates America’s favorite things: food, capitalism, and betrayal. However, “Good Eats” is clearly the better show. Essentially the “Bill Nye the Science Guy” of the culinary realm, this show explores the science of cooking and the history of food preparation. Original uses of music, cinematography, and characters created a unique viewing and learning experience, something that’s hard to find in a sea of food-based programming.
3. “Giada at Home” 
Giada De Laurentiis is a Food Network goddess and icon. “Giada at Home” features Italian cuisine at its most approachable, particularly with De Laurentiis’ own casual and inviting demeanor. As with “Barefoot Contessa,” the show features the host’s family and friends, and shots of De Laurentiis narrating casually perched on a couch make viewers feel, well, at home.
2. “Chopped”
“Chopped” expanded beyond the realm of Food Network to become an American cultural fixture after landing on Netflix. While the premise may seem trite now, over nine years after its release, Chopped may be one of the network’s most interesting concepts, and more importantly, one of their best executed. In each episode, host Ted Allen introduces a series of baskets with unusual ingredients that chefs must incorporate into their appetizers, entrees, and desserts for a chance at $10,000. With dramatic meltdowns, increasingly ridiculous ingredients, and high stakes, this classic makes 45 minutes fly by easily.
1. “Food Network Star”
This may not be an obvious choice, but this meta, dramaticized recruitment process is extremely riveting. It’s essentially “America’s Next Top Model” for food media stars and features chefs put through tests of culinary skill and screen presence to survive weekly eliminations and win a Food Network show of their own. This show wins out with its top-notch judges, high production quality, and actual narrative. Plus, it brought us Guy Fieri.
Honorable Mentions:
“Iron Chef America”
This show brings some of the best chefs, cooking, and production value to the table, but it ultimately loses its heart in the professionalism.
“The Best Thing I Ever Ate”
This program all about the favorite foods of acclaimed chefs and Food Network stars is an underrated gem. It’s like “Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,” except it has culture.

With features on Forbes and The New York Times, fashion entrepreneurs Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur affectionately proclaim their support for what they believe to be the sweet intersection of female friendship and business in their new book “Work Wife.” As co-founders of design and e-commerce website Of a Kind, Cerulo and Mazur’s experiences inevitably drive the majority of the instruction and advice the book offers about attaining and maintaining this “work wife” relationship. To supplement their own musings, the two women also draw upon the stories of several other successful “work wives” from KMR Law Group’s Keli L. Knight, Yondi K. Morris-Andrews, and Jessica B. Reddick to lingerie brand Hanky Panky’s Gale Epstein and Lida Orzeck. With tips on “dating around” to find the perfect wife and handling money as women, Cerulo and Mazur attempt to present a practical how-to for business besties. Although the book may not be entirely useful in this particular department, however, it presents an unexpected value in a comparably meaningful way: Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur’s “Work Wife” offers better wellness and relationship advice than most “Cosmopolitan” articles and Barnes & Noble self-help books.
Derived from the dated, heteronormative, and sometimes inappropriate “office wife” relationship of a man and his “high-functioning secretary,” Cerulo and Mazur define their “work wife” dynamic as a “a combination of personal and professional bondedness and healthy, supportive closeness among women.” Despite effectively selling the reader on the magic of this work wife relationship, Cerulo and Mazur provide underwhelming advice on how to actually achieve a relationship as strong and powerful as theirs.
The introduction claims that from the start of their professional pursuits, Cerulo and Mazur “saw each other as equals; there was no power dynamic to contend with, and [they] trusted that would remain constant.” However, for the majority of women who have been painfully socialized to internalize misogynistic values and involuntarily compete with one another, Cerulo and Mazur’s perfectly balanced personal and professional relationship sans any jealousy or resentment about power offers little to the average female reader. Ultimately, the Of a Kind co-founders, along with all of other “thriving” work wives whose stories they include, tease us with the splendor of having a work wife but fail to properly address the barriers of getting there.
While their advice on work friendships may not be groundbreaking, Cerulo and Mazur have innocuously interwoven a refreshing and grounded approach to health and wellbeing in the workplace throughout their work wiving guide. In their “Finding Work-Wife Balance” section, the book very importantly discusses the difficulty and danger of pursuing a perfectly compartmentalized personal-professional life: “The real win has been not having to bury the baggage of our nonoffice lives.” By encouraging a work-wife relationship built on openness and communication, “Work Wife” gives us meaningful tools to healthily maneuver any office relationship — not just the one with our business best friend.
In further discussing the benefits of developing a nourishing professional relationship, they explain, “we get more practice at expressing our feelings and being vulnerable than the majority of people do in their work day to day.” Though we may like to believe that properly communicating one’s feelings is a matter only relevant to five-year-olds locking themselves in their rooms, healthy self-expression is clearly an issue that persists throughout one’s life when a surprising number of adults throw similarly-sized tantrums. In an incredibly mature and insightful way, Cerulo and Mazur acknowledge the necessity of recognizing our feelings at work in order to better understand how to manage relationships in all aspects of life.
Though we may not have a comprehensive guide to overcoming internalized misogyny in the workforce and becoming badass female co-entrepreneurs as the book attempts to do, Cerulo and Mazur perhaps intentionally contribute something of similar value: In a world which adamantly condemns discussing anything personal or expressing in the workplace as unprofessional, “Work Wife’s” healthy reimaginings of work life are entirely necessary.

Phoebe Bridgers’ 2017 single “Motion Sickness” has all the hallmarks of a typical indie song: absurd and specific lyrics, ethereal vocals, and experimental instrumentals. It’s a poignant yet scathing reflection of a past relationship with Ryan Adams, a musician and the owner of the record label PAX-AM known for his successful solo albums and his cover of Taylor Swift’s “1989.” In “Motion Sickness,” Bridgers vividly addresses the pain and the aftertaste of an imbalanced relationship with Adams.
But “Motion Sickness” has deeper implications in light of the recent allegations against Adams. In a recently published exposé by the New York Times, Adams was accused of emotional abuse and sexual harassment by several women, one of whom was Bridgers. Taking these revelations into account, “Motion Sickness,” is no longer just a song that describes one circumstantially incompatible relationship. It’s part of the larger picture of how Adams exploited the power imbalance between himself and promising female musicians.
Bridgers directly confronts her relationship with Adams. The titular lyric, “I have emotional motion sickness / somebody roll the windows down,” alludes to the emotional turmoil of an abusive relationship — a sick-to-the-stomach, visceral sense that something is amiss along with the knowledge that it would be difficult to break free. Lyrics like “There are no words in the English language / I could scream to drown you out” reflect the lasting trauma that can remain after a hurtful and exploitative relationship and acknowledge that abuse is not a trivial matter, but rather an unabated constant that taints future experiences.
Bridgers’s experience as told through “Motion Sickness” seems to describe another iteration of Adams’s tendency to exploit female musicians. By detailing her own relationship with Adams, Bridgers corroborates other similar accounts of female musicians who were in the same position of being Adams’ pretty musical project instead of his partner — how he promised to bolster their careers while allegedly trapping them in a toxic, harassing relationship, essentially forcing these women to choose between their well-being or their musical career.
While the lyrics to “Motion Sickness” offer insight to the nature of Adams’s unacceptable behavior, the existence of this song reveals Bridgers’ strength. By pursuing relationships in which he could take advantage of his influence in the music industry to exploit women, Adams took away the musical independence of these budding female artists and left many of them with a disillusioned attitude toward making music. Yet the existence of this song suggests that Bridgers was able to break free from Adams and his toxic behavior, taking back what belonged to her — her musicality — which she possessed all along. Bridgers’s unfiltered take in the form of sharp songwriting is a message that she was able to reclaim some of her independence and passion for music, even after she was in a relationship where both were jeopardized.
On a broader scale, this account in the form of a song can provide a sense of hope for all who have endured harassment or abuse within their careers — hope that it’s possible to find the strength to break free from controlling, exploitative relationships and reclaim autonomy. “Motion Sickness” therefore becomes not only a testimony of pain, but also a powerful example of fortitude.

In response to these allegations brought forth against him, Adams released a series of tweets that apologized superficially but still denied any culpability — the eye-rollingly predictable response of men who want to appear sympathetic and in-touch while also shirking responsibility of their actions. The influx of responses from many women is standing against Adams’s word right now. Perhaps “Motion Sickness” can provide an additional perspective — a musical one — sung from a place of sincere hurt that contributes to the various accounts from other women that can hold Adams fully accountable.

In the absence of a prescient, industry-wide movement like #OscarsSoWhite or #TimesUp, the fashion at the 2019 Academy Awards was unusually serene. Sure, the ceremony had no host, but in the grand scheme of things, attendees had little reason to protest the Oscars through their attire. As a result, stars could focus on aesthetics, comfort, and most importantly, having a good time.
Many celebrities opted for muted pastels and rich earth tones in subdued, decidedly un-voluminous silhouettes. Olivia Colman, who took home the award for Best Actress, radiated understated elegance in a forest-green Prada column dress draped with an embroidered dark-gray cape. Emma Stone, Colman’s co-star in “The Favourite,” chose an amber-hued Louis Vuitton dress whose crosshatched pattern inspired memes comparing it to waffles, loaves of bread, and even glazed ham. Oscars newcomer KiKi Layne, of “If Beale Street Could Talk,” dazzled in a minimalist, pale-pink Atelier Versace gown, which featured a striking draped bow in the back.
Another understated highlight: Spanish actress Marta Nieto, whose partner Rodrigo Sorogoyen directed the best live-action short film nominee “Madre," floated down the red carpet in an austere yet feminine off-white number by the Iberian designer Delpozo. Her dress layered a sweetheart neckline over a sheer top with a demure Peter Pan collar — an ethereal and thoroughly unconventional combination.
On the menswear front, attendees like Chris Evans, Michael B. Jordan, and Jason Momoa looked almost cozy in sumptuous velvet smoking jackets and suits. Elsie Fisher, the breakout star of “Eighth Grade,” delivered tomboy cool in a three-piece Thom Browne ensemble that demonstrated an acquired confidence as her first turn on the award show circuit drew to a close.
Other stars seized the opportunity to live out their girliest fairytale fantasies. Gemma Chan, Linda Cardellini, and Helen Mirren, and several others opted for princess-pink gowns embellished with ruffles, ribbons, or sequins. Country singer Kacey Musgraves stood out in bubblegum-colored, tulle-covered Giambattista Valli Couture. A silver, rhinestone-encrusted bow cinched her ballet-inspired look together with a perfectly feminine flourish.
Amidst it all, a few celebrities still chose deliberately flashy outfits. This, however, seemed to reflect not words of protest, but rather the pursuit of going “viral” — or, less cynically, the pursuit of having fun. “Pose” star Billy Porter took the Internet by storm in a gender-bending Christian Siriano Couture creation comprised of a tuxedo jacket attached to a dramatic black maxi-skirt. Rachel Weisz embraced a red Givenchy Couture dress that featured an unflattering yet attention-grabbing latex top, a nod to her highly erotic role in “The Favourite.” Rapper and actress Awkwafina, who sported a metallic pink Dsquared2 pantsuit, was arguably the most extravagant of all. While chatting with reporters, she raised her glittery clutch, unscrewed a cap hidden at its side, and took a swig from the flask hidden inside. “That’s tequila,” she said.

Welcome to midterm season. It’s time to rise and grind, ladies and gents. Days here are cold, long, and dreary. Sometimes all you need is a playlist for a little motivation, a little pep in your step, and some tunes to get your pen tapping and your head bobbing. This isn’t exactly a playlist you listen to while working, but it’s your study break and dance break in one to re-energize. Put your earphones in or blast it in your room, and you’ll be ready to dive back in to work. While listening to this playlist, there’s no p-set you can’t take on or study guide that’s too long.
“Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen
There’s no motivation like Queen belting “Don’t Stop Me Now” in your ear while you’re on the brink of study stress. We’ve all been there when we’re one of the last Lamonsters of the night. It’s time to put on some Queen to remind you that you can do anything.
“Good Life” by OneRepublic 
When everything just seems to suck, it’s always nice to remind yourself that the life you're living is pretty darn good. When you hear the opening beats, you’ll know the lyrics, so grab some friends and jam out.
“The Sound of Sunshine” by Michael Franti & Spearhead
There have definitely been a few nights when the late nights have morphed into early mornings. You’ve got another long day ahead of you and haven’t slept in a while, so this song will make it just a little bit easier to welcome the new day.
“Losing It” by Fisher
As the song title may suggest, you might be losing it a little, and that’s totally okay. We’ve all been there. Instead of bottling up all of that negative energy, just let it out and groove out to this electronic mix.
“Good Form” by Nicki Minaj (ft. Lil Wayne)
Leave it to Nicki to lighten the mood a little. Jam out to this in Widener during a study break. Game changer.
“Paradise” by George Ezra
The library is most definitely not a paradise, but Ezra will take you away from the stacks for a little bit. You won’t help but crack a smile when you hear his songs come on.
“Happier” by Marshmello, Bastille
This 2018 hit is both Marshmello and Bastille’s highest charting single, and there’s reason behind that. It’s catchy and fun and exactly what you need for a long night studying.
“Good as Hell” by Lizzo
It’s the night before a big exam, and you might not be feeling totally confident in yourself. Let Lizzo remind you of how awesome you are. This is the confidence boost you’re looking for.
“Dreaming” by Smallpools
American indie-pop band Smallpools pours energy into its debut 2013 single “Dreaming.” When they sing, “But I could go all night,” you’ll feel like you can do the same.
“September” by Earth, Wind, & Fire
At this point in the night, you’re almost done studying and hopefully ready to go to bed. Close out the night with this smooth yet funky jam to put you in a good and confident mood to take on everything you have on your plate.

Get. Hype. Believe it or not, summer is fast approaching, and the season just isn’t complete without a new batch of movies to get excited about. From kids’ films to adult dramas, indies to blockbusters, there’s something for everyone. Here are five of the best trailers for films coming out this summer. Let’s hope the actual movies compare.
Rocketman (May 31)
I see your “Bohemian Rhapsody” and I’ll raise you one “Rocketman.” Directed by Dexter Fletcher, this fantastical biopic chronicles the rise of music legend Elton John, and promises to be an enchanting and crowd pleasing event. Musical biopics are all the rage right now, and this is shaping up to be a potentially massive crowd favorite. Watch it for the costumes. Watch it for the ‘70s hairdos. Watch it for Taron Egerton singing Elton John’s most iconic songs. (Yes, that’s really him singing in the trailer.)
Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (May 10)
Everybody and their mother has at least passing knowledge of Pokémon. Maybe you watched the anime back in middle school. Maybe Pokémon Go took over your life three summers ago. Maybe you won your girlfriend that Jigglypuff plushie at the carnival. As such, you should expect “Detective Pikachu” to be one of the biggest films of the summer. The new digital take on the Pokémon looks surprisingly stunning, and the titular detective, voiced by “Deadpool’s” Ryan Reynolds, looks poised to steal the show.
The Lion King (July 19) 
If you’re starting to get tired of all these recent Disney remakes, I feel you. We’ve already gotten “Beauty and the Beast,” “Cinderella,” and “Alice in Wonderland,” with dozens more still to come. But this one is upping the ante. Directed by Jon Favreau, who also helmed 2016’s “The Jungle Book,” this “live-action” (i.e. 100 percent CGI) retelling of “The Lion King” promises to be a technological and visual marvel. The songs are iconic, the story is incredible, and the cast — including Donald Glover, James Earl Jones, and BEYONCÉ — is to die for. Don’t be surprised when this film makes approximately all of the money come summer 2019.
Yesterday (June 28) 
So...this trailer came out of nowhere and looks amazing. Refreshingly not based on any prior IP, this Danny Boyle-directed musical comedy sees a down-on-his-luck musician entering a parallel universe where he is the only person who remembers the songs of the Beatles. What would you do with that kind of opportunity? Is plagiarizing still wrong if the creator never existed? The movie looks funny, sweet, romantic, and totally original. This could be the sleeper hit of 2019.
Avengers: Endgame (April 26) 
You all knew this would be number one. The Avengers kick the summer movie season off in April this year, and we’re all holding our breath in anticipation. This is the culmination of 22 films' worth of buildup over 11 years, so you’re going to want to be in the know for what’ll likely be the biggest film of the year. Not much is known about the plot just yet, but we know it takes place after the last film’s villain successfully wiped out half of the world’s population with a single snap (it makes more sense in context). Will the remaining Avengers be able to pick up the pieces, and save the world?

On Feb. 28, Kristen Roupenian visited the Harvard Book Store to discuss her debut short story collection, “You Know You Want This,” with Boston Globe advice columnist Meredith Goldstein. Roupenian is best known for her short story “Cat Person,” which was published in the New Yorker in December 2017 and went viral in a feat that publishing executives have called “unusual if not unprecedented” for a work of short fiction.
Much of the evening’s conversation centered on Roupenian’s attempts to navigate her story’s unexpected fame. Though Roupenian had been working on the “You Know You Want This” for several years before the publication of “Cat Person,” she still found herself having to consider the popularity of “Cat Person” while preparing her collection for publication.
The other stories in her collection, she explained, are tonally very different from “Cat Person,” whose depiction of an ambiguous sexual encounter resonated with many readers because of its uncanny familiarity. “A lot of the stories in the book are horror-inflected, are very dark,” Roupenian said. “‘Cat Person,’ thematically, is as dark as any of them… but in terms of what actually happens [in the collection], things get much more extreme in terms of murder and monsters and whatnot.”
Before “You Know You Want This” was published, Roupenian considered changing the order of the short stories to accommodate readers of “Cat Person.” She said that among editors there was “a split set of opinions whether we should start…[the collection] with ‘Cat Person’ and then lead people into this other space where things might be more extreme or there would be more genre elements.”
Ultimately, Roupenian decided to open her collection with “Bad Boy,” a horror story. “It felt better to me to… keep the collection in the form it had been before ‘Cat Person’ went viral… and to lead with a story that was a fairly clear signpost of where things were going,” she explained.
The last 25 minutes of the hour-long event were reserved for an audience Q&A. In response to a question about her transition from critical to creative writing — Roupenian graduated from Harvard in 2014 with a Ph.D. in English — she reflected that it was difficult to write fiction while remaining in a literary-critical mindset for her Ph.D. studies. “I am glad now that I had [time] to read books and think about them,” Roupenian said. “But I could not really do creative writing while I was doing that… it felt impossible because I was too attuned to what could go wrong. I was too self-conscious. I feel that, for anyone moving between both worlds, my advice is to do fully the one thing and trust that maybe in the future it will pay off.”
When asked whether “Cat Person” was written in response to #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, Roupenian explained that it was not. “I wrote [‘Cat Person’] around April of 2017, which puts it… before the #MeToo movement had really taken off,” she said.
“But I do think, in retrospect, that some of the same energy that fed the #MeToo movement fed… my story as I was writing it and then the conversation around the story,” she continued. “When I remember that April, what I remember is the news just feeling poisonous all the time.”
“All conversations about gender and dating had this kind of ugly bite to them,” she said.
For some members of the audience, like Boston Globe writer Amy J. Pedulla, this revelation was highly unexpected. “I was surprised that she wasn’t reacting to #MeToo, but she was… unconsciously responding to it in her work without trying to make a response to the movement,” Pedulla said. “That was actually shocking.”
Other attendees simply expressed their admiration for Roupenian’s work. Meredith B. Johns ’22 came to the event because she appreciated reading “Cat Person” when it first went viral. “I came out today because… when I read the story, I hugely identified with it and was taken with her ability to explain a situation that often feels indescribable,” she said. “I haven’t read any other of her stories but was super impressed with her ability to speak about them and liked the excerpt she read as well.”
Brighton resident Jose M. Martinez shared similar sentiments. “I loved [‘Cat Person’] when it came out,” he said. “It made such an impact then and when I read it again recently… that I wanted to come here and listen to [Roupenian] talk about her craft, talk about writing, talk about really anything.”

Looking around the dining room, I meet the gaze of a stranger. Within seconds of our eyes locking, I reach for my phone and start scrolling incessantly. As a solo diner, I hope my phone will make me appear occupied in a flurry of dining hall conversations. But moments later, I feel embarrassed for recoiling.
I wasn’t the only solo diner — in fact, I was surrounded by many solo diners. Why did I feel particularly ashamed about eating alone?
It’s common for us to frequent dining halls, alone, at weird hours — we’re college students with unpredictable schedules. Unfortunately, phrases such as “eating alone” and “table for one” strike universal fear not only in the minds of college students anticipating the next meal but also adults around the world.
These fears, while perfectly natural, can be partially overcome through reading. The internet, for instance, provides a rich, historic record of articles and blogs that empower the solo diner. Headlines range from personal stories such as “The Best Way To Dine Alone” to “Table for One: The Art of Dining Alone,” which both portray dining alone as an inherent fear we can conquer and even master. People tend to agree that there is nothing wrong about eating alone once in a while. In fact, seasoned solo diners such as Nevin Martell tell us that we should learn to embrace this aloneness, center ourselves in the act of eating, and enjoy the food more as a result. Martell assures diners that they can “be as talkative or as quiet as [we] like” and not “let people make [us] feel like a social outcast.”
We should not be ashamed of eating alone. Other cultures, in fact, have made eating alone a custom, depending on the cuisine, country, and size of the dining room. People can learn tips for eating alone by reading online articles, but these fears can only be conquered through the real experience of solo dining through different cultural contexts.
When I think about eating alone, I try to conjure images from my recent first trip to Japan. I thrived on solitude there. I wandered the streets, read silently on my commute to work, and feasted often as a single diner. I never felt the anxious rush of averted eyes or being an island amid raucous conversations. Most notably, my phone rarely surfaced during dinner.
Ichiran, a famous ramen chain I often visited, epitomizes low interaction dining by constructing “flavor concentration booths” for diners. Single booths feature foldable frames that can cover adjacent seating areas. A server will also hand diners their bowl through the drape in the private booth. According to Ichiran, they want to “encourage guests to dine alone and focus solely on the bowl of noodles in front of them.”
Japan prizes these methodically curated dining experiences. During the Shogun period (1639-1853), when Japan was virtually cut off from the world, it fostered a culture rooted in isolation and intense self-reflection. With a nod to their history and desire to destigmatize isolation, appreciation for solo food experiences has developed over time. Japan’s eating culture — ramen counters and sushi bar conveyor belts — embraced my singleness. For the first time, I felt at peace as a solo diner.
In other countries, eating alone carries more negative connotations, but solo dining continues to galvanize fans. In South Korea, technology, music, and media offer acceptable and mainstream ways of coping with lonely meals. Mukbang, a cultural phenomenon originating in Korea, features videos of people eating visually appealing foods and interacting with viewers through a live stream. According to cultural critic Jeff Yang, mukbang can attribute its beginnings to unmarried couples and Korea’s communal dining culture. It’s no surprise then that millions of Koreans tune into daily mukbang for virtual companionship during meals.
More recently, mukbang has spread to other countries in Asia such as China and Japan as well as the USA. However, tuning into mukbang in the USA is seen as a private activity, not to be shared and discussed with others. Korea is a prime example of how some practices associated with eating alone may not be fully understood across cultural boundaries.
Similarly, in many Chinese and Chinese-American restaurants, eating alone retains a certain stigmatization. From rotating lazy susans to the lack of bar space, Chinese restaurants make it explicit that they expect more than just a single diner. While emerging technologies, cookbooks, and internet videos have ushered in more acceptance for solo diners in Chinese culture, it is impossible to fully eliminate cultural dining rituals meant for more than one person. Nonetheless, eating alone anywhere, even in Chinese restaurants, can be made into an enjoyable dining experience.
Dining alone encompasses many factors — both controllable and uncontrollable. Our perspectives on dining alone can change after examining various restaurant cultures, the people around us, and the dining rooms environment. My perspective has certainly changed. Equipped with new dining experiences, I don’t feel a sense of shame in pulling out my phone or even making eye contact with a stranger. This is how I eat alone.
— Contributing writer Jess L. Eng’s column, "Takeaways From Chinese America," wrestles with the possibilities and boundaries of food culture from a third-generation Chinese American perspective.

Several Harvard alumni have come together at the American Repertory Theater to contribute their perspectives to — and learn lessons from — the production of Celine Song’s new play “Endlings,” which runs from Feb. 26 to March 17 at the Loeb Drama Center. The alumni working to bring this story to life are director Sammi R. Cannold (who graduated the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2016 and is A.R.T.’s youngest ever female director), assistant director Brian J. Ge ’18, actors Mark J. Mauriello ’15 and Matt J. DaSilva ’12, and Kevin H. Lin ’12, who is Song’s agent.

The play follows two distinct stories in two distinct settings: The last three Korean sea women, known as “haenyeos,” harvest seafood in Man Jae, while a Korean-Canadian playwright grapples with her writing in Manhattan.
Other than Mauriello, all the Harvard alumni working on the play interned for the A.R.T. while attending Harvard, and a few of their paths intertwined in ways that eventually led to their collaboration on “Endlings.” Lin and Cannold met through the A.R.T., where Cannold was a Hasty Pudding Artistic Fellow, and later, Lin sent her the script of “Endlings.”
In turn, Cannold brought Ge onto “Endlings” and encouraged him to assistant direct, a job he had not done before. “She always gets me to do the craziest jobs,” Ge said.
Cannold and Ge have collaborated on multiple A.R.T. productions, including “The Pirate Princess,” through which they met in 2015, feminist poetry readings, and “Violet” in 2017, a show that traveled around Harvard Square on a shuttle.
Now, in their work on “Endlings,” these alumni have drawn a range of new understandings about education, American theater, and how to address their own racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as unfamiliar ones, in personal and theatrical contexts.
“Most people didn’t know much about the haenyeos, who are the heroines of the play,” Cannold said. “Because of that, there was a large learning curve in terms of the culture.”
For Ge, the ability to see similarities between the play and his own life came with its own lessons.
“As an Asian Canadian myself, it’s just so rewarding to see a story unfold on stage and in a rehearsal room that's so incredibly relatable, that I feel I've lived or my parents have lived or my ancestors have lived, even though I'm not Korean,” Ge said. “I think that's been the biggest learning experience — that there's so much more to learn from people like yourself, and not necessarily always from the university education, from the ways that people tell you to learn.”

DaSilva and Mauriello portray white stage managers in the “Endlings” cast, and they reflected on their responsibilities as cast members of a play focusing on women of Korean descent.
“This show is not about us,” DaSilva said. “If we try at all to make it about us, then we're just de-servicing the story and taking away from the intention of the playwright and kind of disrespecting it in a way. My role is to not be thought about.”
Mauriello said he has found acting in “Endlings” to be invigorating. “It’s a really remarkable and exciting thing, as a white male, to see this show that is about four Asian women, and to watch the way they are sharing stories and unraveling identity, and doing it in a way that also pokes fun at the kinds of theater we’ve been seeing on stages for decades and decades, especially in America,” he said.
Cannold said she believes “Endlings” disrupts the status quo of American theater both by introducing the untold story of the haenyeos and, more broadly, by confronting racism in theater.
“Celine has written a play that is so bold, that says so much that I think so many of us are afraid to say or afraid to wrestle with,” Cannold said. “It confronts what it means for artists of color to tell certain stories or not tell certain stories.”
The play holds an expansive meaning for Ge, too. “At the end of the day, it's not just a story about the haenyeos. It’s a story about immigration. It’s a story about real estate. It’s a story about how much you have to give up to go somewhere where the life is better,” he said.
“So many of us here in this country have that story in our blood,” Ge said. “It's just impossible for me, as an immigrant, to look at this play and not want to call my grandmother.”

Decked out in bright garb, colorful dreadlocks, and a Harvard beanie, rapper Lil Pump promoted his latest album “Harverd Dropout” in an appearance at Harvard’s student-run radio station, WHRB, on Feb. 28.
In an intimate setup in Studio B, WHRB member Griffin R. Andres ’21 conducted a live interview with the 18-year-old musician. After the interview, members of the Harvard community who were eager to gain some insider knowledge about Lil Pump participated in a direct Q&A session with the artist himself.
A pop-up shop selling “Harverd Dropout”-themed merchandise set up prior to the live interview and Q&A allowed students to get their hands on their own piece of Lil Pump. The merchandise included sweaters and shirts with a skeletal rendering of the artist in graduation regalia emblazoned on the front.
Students sought to gain some insight on the intersection between Lil Pump, who dropped out of high school, and Harvard. “I hope I just hear him talk about why he named it ‘Harverd Dropout,’ and get some meaning behind the lyrics,” said Madison R. Conklin ’21.
Lil Pump entered the room just after 9 p.m. to jubilant cheers and cries of his signature catchphrase, “Eskeetit,” a condensed version of “let’s get it.” He delivered a mock commencement speech, a follow-up to his initial — but since disputed — claim that he was named as Harvard’s official speaker for Commencement 2019.
Lil Pump employed the style and sentiments of a commencement speech to discuss his ascent to stardom. “It was by no means easy; there were many times when I thought I would not reach this finish line,” Lil Pump stated. “But those struggles have only made this moment even sweeter.”
An interview followed the speech, in which Lil Pump answered specific questions regarding his background and his songwriting process. As a child, Lil Pump explained that his parents did not have much influence on his musical stylings and preferences. “I ain’t listening to any of their music, I listen to my shit!” he said.
The artist also discussed his collaboration with Kanye West on the 2018 hit “I Love It.” Lil Pump attributed the music video costume design to West. “He, like, sent me a text message… and it was like some fucking stick figures in a box,” Pump said. “He’s like yo, I want this to be the costume! They drew it up, and that’s what it came out like.”
Lil Pump addressed a variety of questions posed during the Q&A session that aligned with his persona as a fictitious Harvard dropout. When asked his favorite city to perform in, Lil Pump responded with “Harvard.” The rapper at no point admitted that he did not attend Harvard University. When questioned as to why he chose to “drop out” of Harvard, Lil Pump said, “I dropped out of Harvard to save the fucking rap game!”
The collaboration with WHRB was intentional, according to WHRB President Kiran O. Hampton ’20. Hampton explained that Lil Pump’s team reached out to WHRB looking for a college-associated venue with an underground vibe to align with the style of Lil Pump’s newest album. “I told them WHRB is pretty underground — we’re literally in a basement. I also told them that beyond that, everyone in WHRB is really nice, and we include and welcome everyone,” Hampton said. “He liked that a lot — he’s a pretty inclusive guy and thought it was a good match.”
To an audience of eager Harvard students, Lil Pump’s presence kicked off the weekend. Some students were die-hard supporters of Pump, not just by virtue of his current fame, but because of his music. “I was a big fan of Pump’s work before he was signed,” Nicholas S. Brown ’22 said.
“I came out because I thought it was pretty cool that Harvard’s integrated into the hip-hop culture,” David M. Gonzalez ’22 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The name and face of Frida Kahlo have become a brand of their own, coming to represent a feminist icon, a survivor of tragic illness, and a political revolutionary. “Frida Kahlo and Arte Popular,” an exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston until June 16, is not just another homage to her storied life and iconography, but rather a much needed and deserved look into her inspirations — namely, Mexican folk art, or “arte popular.”
In a poignant link between art and politics in the years following the Mexican Revolution, government officials and artists alike strove to unite the divided Mexican people. Kahlo and other urban intellectuals passionately collected handmade objects made in rural communities, from ceramics to children’s toys, which came to represent a shared and distinctly Mexican history. Though the exhibit only features eight of Kahlo’s own pieces, it comprehensively contextualizes them with arte popular objects similar to those in her own collection, demonstrating the many unequivocal, shared strands between her work and the movement at large.
The exhibit is divided into five thematic sections, each of which features at least one of Kahlo’s works. The first section, “Art of the People,” opens with two portraits: “Autorretrato con collar de espinas y colibrí” (“Self-Portrait with Hummingbird and Thorn Necklace”) and the MFA’s recent acquisition, “Dos hermanas (Salvadora y Herminia)” (“Two sisters”). Because Kahlo is perhaps most known for her self-portraits, this introduction seems expected. Further scrutiny, however, reveals that the organic backgrounds of her portraits emulate the leafy, floral patterns from the two burnished vases on display nearby. Moreover, Kahlo’s choice to use the European form of portraiture is a commentary in itself, as she harkens back to her own German roots from her father’s side while honoring the Spanish and indigenous heritage of her mother.
Another section, “Aesthetics of Childhood,” highlights Kahlo’s fascination with the world of children, an interest she shared with many of her contemporaries. As many art critics saw children’s artwork as “spontaneous,” it — along with handmade children’s toys — served as a source of inspiration for arte popular. In “Niña con máscara de muerte (Ella juega sola)” [“Girl with Death Mask (She Plays Alone)”], Kahlo hides her face under a skeleton mask and holds a marigold in a reference to “Día de los muertos,” or Day of the Dead. Here she juxtaposes youth and death, blurring the distinction that would usually keep them in separate spheres. Similarly, arte popular also fused the inanimate with the animate, life with death, and things with beings, making skeletons smile and pitchers sprout plants.
In perhaps one of the most effective curatorial placements, a glass case of arte popular objects sits directly in front three of Kahlo’s still lifes. Out of context, Kahlo’s propensity to animate her still lifes by giving fruits humanlike qualities may seem arbitrary. But here, the inspiration is clear: “Cocos gimientes” (“Weeping Coconuts”), for example, is paired with carved coconuts with eyes and teeth, just a sampling of Mexican artists’ experimentation with coconuts.
Unfortunately, the two adjacent galleries that are intended to complement the main exhibit detract from the central purpose. On one side is “Modernism and Folk Art in the United States,” which features a generous supply of folk art from Kahlo’s “modernist colleges in the United States,” according to the gallery’s description. While it does serve as contextualization for the contemporary American folk movement, this addition feels unnecessary given the already established focus on Kahlo and arte popular.
The other gallery is an emotional amalgamation of other Kahlo-related works not by Kahlo herself. “Frida’s Bathroom,” an intimate photograph series by Graciela Iturbide, captures various of her possessions that her husband, Diego Rivera, locked away in her bathroom after her passing. Under Iturbide’s direction, these possessions come to represent different aspects of Kahlo’s suffering and turmoil: prosthetic legs, back braces, pain medications, and posters of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, whom she admired as she was a staunch member of the Mexican Communist Party. The rest of the works featured in this gallery are similarly intriguing — but granting them a space just as large as the main exhibit’s ultimately distracts from Kahlo’s own work.
Paradoxically, “Frida Kahlo and Arte Popular” transcends oversimplifications of Kahlo’s life by asking a radically simple question: What inspired her? Kahlo is far more than her eyebrows or moustache, as popular and commercial conception has come to maintain, and her art encapsulates more than a tumultuous marriage or a life of illness and injury. As “Frida Kahlo and Arte Popular” shows, Kahlo was an ambitious and accomplished painter — one who contributed powerfully to a national artistic movement in the years after a nation-altering revolution.

Netflix’s French arthouse film “Paris Is Us,” directed by Elisabeth Vogler, is a dazzling but ultimately garbled Millennial manifesto on the formation of identity in a trauma-stricken world. The first few minutes are deceptively straightforward: The protagonist, Anna (played by the enchanting Noémie Schmidt) meets Greg (Grégoire Isvarine) at a rave. He asks to touch her hair. They kiss. Suddenly, the music ceases and the two lovers engage in a voiceover dialogue about life being a simulation. Wait, what? This trippy duet signals the film’s wayward dive into the tension between illusion and reality that is thematically central to the story, but that Vogler never fully develops.
An abrupt jump in time lands us in the midst of their troubled relationship. Greg announces that he’s moving to Barcelona, but Anna refuses to go with him — after all, she likes her job at the little Parisian coffee shop. Luckily, she doesn’t get on that flight and it crashes en route to Barcelona. Or maybe she was on that flight. Was Greg on that flight? Did the crash even happen? Reality is now completely up for grabs. Once the plane crashes, any hope for a linear narrative is lost. The remainder of the film is a highly impressionistic collage of memories, dreams, and alternative timelines punctuated by many, many monologues in voiceover.
With the crash, the image spins out of control into a whirling picture of an empty theatre, with Anna now a bewigged and bewildered platinum blonde audience member. Cut to a serene shot of Anna and Greg nuzzling each other on a sun-soaked beach, evidently in the happier, early days of their romance. But who can say? It’s really anyone’s guess whether each scene is a memory from bygone days, a leap into the future, or a glimpse of an alternate reality in which Anna and Greg live happily ever after.
Each of the vignettes is exquisite — evocative or surreal or, just plain pretty. But, alas, there is little connective tissue between them. One begins to wonder if there is a through line (which, admittedly, would be a welcome reprieve) or if yet another artsy film has fallen to queasy self-indulgence. There may be some glue that is holding together, however loosely, this assemblage of disparate images: The film’s fragmented structure is perhaps meant to mirror the fragmenting world it depicts. This much is evidenced by its title: “Paris Is Us” is reminiscent of the “Je suis Charlie” (“I am Charlie”) solidarity movement in response to the 2015 terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo, the Paris-based satirical magazine.
Indeed, the November 2015 Paris attacks figure prominently in the latter half of the film. Vogler shows Anna at vigils honoring the victims, with supporters carrying “Je suis Charlie” signs in the background. She runs through the police-lined streets of Paris as bombs go off and birds take flight around her. For a plot that doesn’t bother to unfold through a linear time progression, nightmarish visions certainly progressively become the norm. Anna becomes the terror and trauma that surrounds her. She is Paris. Paris is her.
Throughout the majority of the film, Vogler maintains the intense close-ups and dizzying camerawork of the opening scene at the rave, suggesting that everyday reality is as chaotic as a drugged-up night of clubbing. Remarkably, Vogler, who doubles as the film’s cinematographer, limits the gaze to Anna’s body throughout much of the film. The effect is one of mildly claustrophobic, titillating voyeurism. The close-ups of her freckled shoulder, her hair resting on her collarbone, her calves, and her left eye are enthralling. Her head bobs in and out of the frame like a buoy, and it’s clear that she’s but a fragile little vessel wracked by the tumult of the terrifying world around her.
However stunning the film’s cinematography, Vogler severely dilutes it with a mélange of incomprehensible monologues. Touching upon everything from simulation theory to burn-it-to-the-ground anarchism, Anna’s feverish voiceovers fizzle out quickly. At one moment she’s slamming herself against a concrete wall; at the next, she’s drowning in a flooded, but oh-so-chic Paris. The whiplash is nauseating.
One thing, at least, is certain: In her wandering, Anna embodies the hopelessness that a politically fraught, terrorized Paris sustains. Hers is the resignation of an entire generation that knows it cannot change the world. In the final montage, the platinum blonde Anna passes through the curtain from the stage to the rave, from illusion to reality — or, what seems to be reality. And it’s back to techno-fuelled hedonistic romping.

Crime thrillers are never in short supply in the world of network television, but NBC’s “The Enemy Within” is off to an engaging start. The show’s premiere is full of action and suspense, with high production value to back up its ambitious stakes.
The most compelling part of “The Enemy Within” is its protagonist, Erica Shepherd (Jennifer Carpenter), a former top CIA operative who is arrested for treason within the thrilling first two minutes of the premier. Erica becomes “the most hated woman in America” for assisting terrorist Mikhail Tal in killing four CIA operatives, including FBI Agent Will Keaton’s (Morris Chestnut) fiancee, Laine Heffron. Three years later, Tal is actively committing acts of terror once again. The renewed hunt for Tal forces Will to work with Erica to prevent more deaths. There is nothing ingenious about this premise: NBC’s own “The Blacklist” revolves around the same notion of working with the enemy, and tragic personal connections to the target are essentially cliché for the genre. Yet the premiere blazes through the set up to get into the action, and the confident execution of the premiere promises a riveting ride.
By the end of the first episode, Erica’s character is easily the most developed. A myriad of tight close-ups on Carpenter’s face and eyes captures every microexpression and nuance, and she delivers a detailed performance that rapidly humanizes the protagonist, a national traitor. Erica’s dual personas of a cold and calculating CIA operative and a loving mother ground her character while also leaving plenty of opportunities for deception — a definite asset for a show of this nature. Erica reveals the reasoning behind her treason by the end of the first episode, which writers may have mistakenly believed was necessary to win over viewer support for the character, as the mystery around the protagonist was one of the most compelling questions of the premise. That being said, every other character on the show is a constant reminder that Erica may be lying, so the possibility for another reveal is certainly still open.
Unfortunately, all the other characters fall short in the premiere. The only other character given a chance at development is Will, but he falls into the archetype of the driven and competent FBI agent. He only shines in his antagonistic interactions with Erica, since it is the layered power dynamics of their relationship that fuel the premiere’s stand-out scenes. Writer Ken Woodruff tries to develop empathy for Will as he continues to mourn his fiancee, but if anything, Will’s constant loss-fueled aggression and furniture-tossing make him appear one-dimensional. Furthermore, the fact that everyone working on this case seems to have conflicts of interest is slightly concerning. No one else on the team has enough personality to be memorable, but perhaps the ensemble will be fleshed out as the season continues.
The show shines in its cinematography and direction. To build suspense as the characters pursue Tal, short scenes and rapid cuts maintain a constant sense of pursuit that propels the narrative forward and demands the viewer’s attention. This also makes the slow-motion used in the premiere’s most emotional scene particularly effective. While it does build up intensity, the prevalence of close-ups on faces begins to feel a tad unnecessary after some time. The show pulls no punches with the action, featuring an explosion and several assassinations right after its opening sequence, and raw scenes of violence back up the premise’s high stakes. Suspense mounts throughout the episode and does not let up, which one can only hope will continue throughout the season’s 12 episodes. With a relatively unoriginal premise and longway to go for its characters’ development, the premiere of “The Enemy Within” is far from perfect, but it is a thrilling ride with a strong dynamic between the main characters and capable visual direction that reveals serious potential for the adventure about to unfold.

The Boston Modern Orchestra Project prides itself on championing “monumental and provocative new works,” with the hope of expanding “the horizon of a typical night at the symphony,” according to its mission statement. Its most recent concert of the season, “John Corigliano Portrait Concert,” embodied exactly that: Under the baton of artistic director Gil Rose, the orchestra embarked on an expansive and refreshing musical journey, highlighting contemporary orchestral innovation in a surprisingly accessible manner.
The performance, which took place on Feb. 23 at the New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall, featured works by two composers, John Corigliano and Diana Voyer. Corigliano is well-versed and well-known in today’s compositional realm — he has won five Grammy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize and is on the composition faculty at the Juilliard School, while Diana Voyer is an engineer by training and winner of this season’s New England Conservatory’s Composition Competition. Voyer’s piece, “The Infinite Forest,” harmonizes their quantitative background with their natural musical intuition in the form of a “process piece” based on mathematical constructs like prime numbers and non-abelian groups. Despite the work’s rigorous backbone, the music never feels artificial or contrived. Instead, “The Infinite Forest” unfolds continually like a tapestry, wherein myriad members of the orchestra interact delicately — yet deliberately — with one another, highlighting independent timbral motion while ensuring that none take an overpowering role. Indeed, meticulous orchestration and musicianship allow for a veritably immersive, forest-like soundscape to emerge, moving through passionate climaxes and moments of repose seamlessly.
Corigliano’s pieces, though not as through-composed, reflect as much musical intricacy and thought. Such is the case with his “Symphony No. 2,” a work for string orchestra. Written in five movements, the work is a structural palindrome, thereby embarking on an aural adventure that culminates in a similar tonal and orchestrational place as it began — albeit undergoing a deep-rooted transformation through the course of the piece. The outer movements, aptly titled “Prelude” and “Postlude,” embody a hazy quality that feels as uncertain as it does ethereal. Indeed, the nuance of the orchestra’s strings highlighted this notion, imparting clarity and smoothness. These movements are respectively bordered by “Scherzo” and “Fugue,” both of which start with a more-or-less rigid order that devolves, equally through orchestrational and structural methods, into fervent chaos. This leaves the middle movement, “Nocturne,”as a being of its own: Gliding in and out of both tonality and concerto-like form, the movement approaches the lament in a sparse but equally impactful way. It is through this extensive, impassioned structural treatment that the root of the work — the Baroque-like chorale that features itself in some way in each month — epitomizes a symphonic journey.
However, perhaps the most compelling piece of the night was Corigliano’s “Troubadours,” a single-movement (but in three parts) concerto for guitar and orchestra. Grounded around a beautifully wistful flamenco-esque tune, the work undergoes a series of transformations that are transportative and reflectionary. Yet, these transitions are never once jarring, instead taking on a subtler, more nuanced quality. This is enhanced by Corigliano’s phenomenally gifted orchestration: the impossibly smooth coalescence of the strings’, the winds’, and the guitar’s timbre at the piece’s opening is just as striking as their independence in the second part. It is this aspect of “Troubadours” that makes its main theme — when heard in the solo guitar with shocking sparseness compared to the rest of the work — so powerful each time it returns. The masterful, virtuosic performance of soloist Eliot Fisk allowed Corigliano’s concerto to embody the warm, intimate storytelling which the title suggests.
Through these avenues, Gil Rose and the Boston Modern Orchestra Project managed to craft not only three independently fulfilling musical journeys, but also one macroscopic voyage: From the precision of Voyer’s opening notes to Corigliano’s subtle finish under the craft of the orchestra’s musicians, the performance’s program takes both an emotional and harmonic arc, thereby embedding novelties in compositional techniques with roots that naturally resonate and synergize, as most stories do.

To the Editor:
Thank you to The Crimson Editorial Board for your enthusiastic reception of the Embedded EthiCS program. The team responsible for the program, including a dedicated group of graduate student teaching fellows, is excited about the program, and we are very happy that undergrads are too. As you say, it is important that we in higher education help students learn to engage with the ethical dimensions of the technology they will be creating and using. Regulation alone cannot keep up with the rapid pace of technological development. The creators of technology should design their systems in a morally reflective and socially responsible way.
We want to clarify a couple of things in the staff editorial just so that readers have a better understanding of where the program is. First, Embedded EthiCS, with modules developed and taught by Philosophy graduate students for existing Computer Science courses, aims to give computer science students tools for thinking through the ethical dimensions of their work in a variety of course contexts. While the creation of “ethics based” or even fully “interdisciplinary” courses are wonderful ideas, we aren’t able to do these on a broad scale yet. CS 105: “Privacy and Technology” and CS 108: “Intelligent Systems: Design and Ethical Challenges,” which have been around for some time, fully integrate both philosophy and computer science. More courses like these would be great, but we simply do not have the faculty to mount them. Second, we do not yet have a “plan” to bring something like Embedded EthiCS into the Life Sciences and the Medical School although we fully support such an expansion and have been approached by faculty in those areas who are interested. But we can’t expand until we have faculty to mount the courses and develop the program. We are hopeful about growth and expansion!

Ruben: Bad Bunny sits on the screen in front of me, in a robe, his ears pierced, a stud on his nose. He’s getting his nails done, a dark black shade painted over his cuticles, and he seems absolutely unbothered as it happens. Suddenly, Bad Bunny is a girl. Suddenly, Bad Bunny is himself again and he’s being kissed on the cheeks by men and women.
I sit there, wondering how he makes it so easy to be comfortable with his body, how he’s able to release a music video like that knowing that a deluge of questions will follow: Is Bad Bunny gay or bisexual? Why would he paint his nails, wear that outfit, act so out of line with what a man should be?
I wonder how he handles the non-stop barrage of questions, how he finds comfort when the queries and assumptions do not stop.
Zoe: On the other side of reggaeton, is the Latina. She is fierce, she is powerful, she is beautiful, and she is talented. From Becky G to Natti Natasha, she is represented by successful women. She produces catchy, hip-shaking songs and has a curvy body to go along with it. She is comfortable in her own skin and she is the antithesis of what I grew up thinking I could be.
For me, sexuality has always been a sort of forbidden fruit. I was meant to act like a lady, to wear tops that weren’t too revealing, and to hide my body from prying gazes. Even more, my body wasn’t the curvaceous replica of Becky G and Natti Natasha. So, in a family of beautiful, curvy, yet slender Latinas, baggy clothes given to me at Christmas were usually the most “flattering.”
R: When it comes to understanding my masculinity, Harvard is worlds apart from my life in California. Latinx culture is still obsessed with gender roles. There’s limited versions of what a man can look and act like. Here, at college, I can imagine new versions of my masculinity, news way of understanding myself and my gender.
This is not to say that homophobia or transphobia do not exist on this campus. People’s gender presentation, their bodies, and sexuality are constantly policed here. The “liberal bubble” does not protect us from bigotry. But compared to a community so invested in familiar labels and gender norms, college has offered some freedom to begin shedding my shame, to no longer feel insecure about my choices or the way I understand my masculinity.
Z: The first time I wore a crop-top at Thanksgiving, my grandma pulled it down so quickly, I was immediately filled with shame. In college, I was free of familial expectations for the first time and financial independence allowed me to dress myself in what made me feel beautiful. Yet, in that moment at Christmas, I felt like too much and not enough. I wasn’t the girl that was meant to wear that shirt. I was showing too much, when I was taught less was more.
Without the right clothes, I was failing to be the young “lady” in modest clothing my grandma wanted me to be. Without the curvy body, I was failing to be the “sexy woman” society deemed to be inherently Latina. In that moment, I didn’t feel beautiful. Swallowed by my own insecurity, I felt lost between two molds I never completely fit into.
R: Feelings of insecurity, low self-worth, and stomach-churning self hatred do come out of the the unnecessary policing of people’s sexuality. Yet our adherence and unquestioned adoration of gender roles also come with corporeal consequences. Women in El Salvador are facing life-time sentences for miscarriages because of the country’s total ban on abortions. Young BGLTQ folks are taking their own lives after their peers harass them for how they choose to express themselves. Lives, not just emotions, are at stake.
Z: But a Latina is not only policed by her body or physical sexuality. She is policed in who she can love and who she is. It’s the way family members ask, “¿y tú novio?” at Christmas, assuming a Latina is half of a heterosexual pair. Or how the contributions of trans-Latinas are ignored. The Latinx community is machista, heteronormative, and homophobic. In order to change it we must constantly push back against the ways our community attempts to fit everyone into molds that should have never been created.
I can only hope that the next time I wear a crop top I won’t feel the weight of two opposing expectations on my shoulders. I can only hope that one day, I’ll just be Zoe, a Latina who wears crop tops sometimes, because they make her feel beautiful.
R: Bad Bunny is not some savior. He’s not rewriting the book on gender and sexuality, and has gotten oddly defensive after people implied he might not be straight. The revolution will not happen in reggaeton.
Yet any time I scroll past a picture of Bad Bunny in an outfit that would’ve gotten me bullied as a child, I feel some hope. Watching his seemingly unhinged joy, I allow myself to imagine a future where Latinx families will abandon everything we’ve internalized about gender and sexuality. I hear a ringing in my ear of a day when we all sing together, “no hay nada mal, estamos bien, estamos bien.”

The University recently announced that on April 2 — the first day undergraduates will be able to access the 2019 Association of American Universities’ sexual conduct climate survey — Harvard will also hold its first ever gender equity summit. Entitled “Harvard Hears You: The 2019 Summit for Gender Equality,” the summit brings together the University’s Title IX Office and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs to host events around gender equality.
The summit is a laudable and important effort, especially as it convenes influential public figures, such as Laverne Cox, and administrators together to discuss this issue. Gender inequality continues to trouble our campus, as it negotiates a number of allegations, investigations, and climate-improvement initiatives related to sexual misconduct and gender inclusivity; this is a significant step in bringing attention to this conversation. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore several problems with this in its initial stages.
As described in the announcement, the summit purports to address not only campus issues, but national and global gender equity as well. While such large scale issues are important to discuss, we feel it is more pressing for the University to address the vast and varied instances of gender inequality on our campus. The conference threatens to become less effective if it stretches its focus on the global implications of gender equity. Instead, it should seek to discuss localized issues and actionable methods to combat gender inequality here at Harvard.
In addition, we feel the intentional alignment of the summit and the second iteration of the AAU’s sexual conduct climate survey seem too convenient for comfort. Such a concurrence may undermine the genuine intentions of the University in spearheading this inaugural event. The University should continue to pursue discussion and action against gender inequality, even when there exists no impending campus climate evaluation.
As administrators continue to plan and organize this event, we hope to see women of color from the administration included in the available list of speakers. The summit offers an enormous opportunity to address the intersectionality of gender by including speakers and topics that address the theme from diverse perspectives.
Laverne Cox’s participation demonstrates the University’s commitment to thinking about gender in a broad and nuanced way. One speaker, however, is not enough. To avoid tokenism and over-simplification, the University should involve a more diverse group of its own faculty and staff in this event. Actively bringing diverse voices to the table and podium should continue to be a priority of the University, both in its more public events — like the summit — and in other less-visible initiatives.
Overall, we commend the University in its work to further discussion of gender equity. Holding large scale conversations is an important first step, and we look forward to further information on the summit as it is planned. Still, the University, both in its organization of this summit and in general, needs to do a considerable amount of work before they can truthfully claim that they not only hear us, but are really listening too.

Harvard men’s basketball team started off this year by heading down to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to play a game against the University of North Carolina. That same UNC team would go on to rank in the top ten for most of the season so far, and played top-ranked Duke University last month. The rivalry between these two schools, whose campuses are only a few miles from each other, is historic and dates back almost 100 years. It’s such an important rivalry that even former President Barack Obama was in attendance at the game.
Even though coaches for these teams are paid handsomely, those on the field and on the court are not. Rules governing college sports dictate that none of the student-athletes can receive any compensation, but given the amount of time that students dedicate to their passions, this has to change. If schools are going to require that their athletes put in the equivalent of a full time job in the practice room and in games, we must compensate our athletes accordingly.
Given the popularity of the Duke-UNC game, Obama-level connections might be needed in order to watch in person. Hours before tip-off, the lowest resale prices of tickets shot up into the thousands of dollars. If someone wanted to buy the tickets at face value, though, they’d be out of luck since those sold out swiftly after being posted online.
Traditionally, it’s love for the game and a tradition of good performance by both UNC and Duke basketball that drives demand for seats. But this year, one of the players is driving much of the interest: Zion L. Williamson.
Williamson, a “freshman phenom” at Duke, is leading stat sheets and driving up ticket sales. Despite this, he will receive no financial compensation for the time that he remains a college athlete because of rules governing collegiate competition.
Other teams are also raking in profits with regular sellouts, merchandise licensing agreements, and conference television deals that go well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. That money is used by schools to compete and stay relevant. Across the country, there’s an active arms race of coaching contracts that’s pushing coaches’ salaries up into nearly the tens of millions of dollars. These college coaching contracts now rival the contracts extended to coaches for professional teams. In fact, Duke’s coach, Michael W. Krzyzewski, is getting almost $9 million this year alone for his services.
With coaching contracts in the six and seven digits, the college sports world is looking less like an amateur or friendly arena for college students to also engage in athletics and more like a training ground for professional teams, especially in the big-ticket sports of football and men’s basketball.

Yet despite the professionally-comparable sums paid to coaches, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for collegiate sports, does not view its student athletes as professional athletes and therefore restricts them from receiving any monetary compensation whatsoever. The NCAA argues that athletes cannot be paid because “maintaining amateurism is crucial to preserving an academic environment in which acquiring a quality education is the first priority.”
The NCAA, of which Harvard is a member, essentially expects players to physically exert themselves at a full time job and carry on their obligations as a full time student simultaneously. And since these student-athletes are often putting in 40-hour weeks between lifts, practices, and games, little time is left for problem sets, papers, office hours, and other academic tasks at the College. In order to make up for this, some colleges help their athletes skate by on little work.
A few years ago at UNC, news of “one of the worst academic fraud schemes in college sports history” detailed that the school offered a “shadow curriculum” with fake classes and easy grades to make sure student-athletes were receiving the grades necessary to remain academically eligible to compete for their schools.
After the scandal came to light, the school received no punishment and lost no funds or scholarships; the real losers were the student-athletes who were promised and denied an education so that they could continue their professional level of athletics on the field. This point becomes doubly apparent upon considering that athletes are often putting their bodies — and therefore their livelihood — on the line, every game. Early in the game, that same star player that attracted so much attention before the game, Williamson, went down with an injury and did not return for the rest of the game.
The NCAA’s stated goal is to “emphasize academic opportunities and responsibilities of student-athletes in their college experience” and to “encourage student-athletes to enrich the experience of being a student-athlete by applying what is learned in athletics to their course of study and ultimately, to their career development,” but in these respects the governing body is badly failing their athletes and schools are failing their students.
Our own school is a member of the NCAA, and as such, Harvard needs to take an active role in advocating for the governing body to establish real limits and definitions to what it means to be a student-athlete. More importantly, we need to make sure that the NCAA is enforcing these limits, ensuring that each member school is prioritizing academics. While I am confident that student-athletes at Harvard are not having their educations adversely affected by their athletic participation, this must also be the case around the country.
If we don’t change this system then the NCAA is nothing but a pipeline to professional sports. And if that’s the case, then we should compensate our athletes accordingly and ensure that student-athletes are respected, not exploited, by the colleges they compete for.

Excitement peaked at the Smith Campus Center on Monday afternoon as Harvard affiliates celebrated the grand opening of the building's newest restaurant, The Heights.
Located on the top floor of the Smith Center — which serves as a study space for Harvard ID-holders — The Heights allows University affiliates and their guests to dine on an Asian and European- inspired menu while admiring sweeping views of Cambridge and Boston.
The Heights adds to a plethora of ground-floor offerings, including Bon Me, Whole Heart Provisions, and Saloniki, which are accessible to the broader Cambridge community.
Joe Santos and Rolando Abaquin — executive chefs of The Heights — said in a press release they were drawn to the Smith Campus Center as a prime restaurant location because it represents a “new and innovative chapter for the University.”
“Our goal is to deliver an elevated food experience, and I don’t mean that because we’re on the top floor,” Santos said in the release. “We want to take familiar favorites to a new level.”
Director of Common Spaces Julie Crites encouraged Harvard students and affiliates to visit the new restaurant and experience its variety of food options in the press release.
“We hope students, faculty, staff, and alumni will appreciate this new space as both a quick and relaxing lunch spot as well as a unique destination for evening drinks, snacks, and dinner,” Crites said.
Santos said in an interview that the eclectic menu helps foster a “relaxing” environment.
“The menu is contemporary American, or a mix of what America is now. I’m Asian-American, but I also grew up up with a lot of Latin Americans and Caribbeans,” Santos said. “It’s very comforting food with a twist here and there.”
Santos also said the opening event had a good turnout despite the snowstorm that hit the Boston area overnight. Although Cambridge Public Schools were closed, the University remained open for normal operations on Monday.
Fatema H. Elbakoury, a student at the Harvard Divinity School, said she will be a returning patron at The Heights.
“I saw they had sandwiches, but I wasn’t hungry enough,” Elbakoury said. “Then I saw the fries, and they were really good. They had the perfect amount of spice.”
“You [won’t] be able to find anything like it on campus,” she added.
The Heights operates from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. On March 26, the restaurant will introduce a cocktail menu Tuesday's through Friday's from 5:00-11:30 p.m. with dinner service to come in the near future.

The Harvard University Police Department is investigating a male Harvard undergraduate’s allegation that he was robbed of his Apple AirPods in Harvard Yard on Sunday, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Monday.
The victim and another student were walking in the Yard near Thayer Hall when two unidentified males approached the students, according to Catalano.
Catalano’s email stated that one of the unidentified men allegedly asked to see one of the student's AirPods “in order to determine if his charger was working properly.” Upon request, the victim handed one AirPod to the man, who then demanded the second AirPod. The victim repeatedly declined and then asked for the first one back.
The other unidentified man allegedly “purposely and physically” stepped in between the student and the man holding his AirPod to prevent the student from retrieving his property. Out of concern for what may happen if he did not comply, the student handed over his second AirPod to the men, who then fled the scene, Catalano wrote.
The incident comes months after a series of burglaries were reported in first floor rooms in Wigglesworth and Holworthy Halls — two freshman dorms located in Harvard Yard. In these earlier thefts, the offender or offenders climbed through windows and stole laptops, wallets, and various other Apple products.
In addition to Sunday’s robbery, two incidents of AirPods theft were reported to HUPD in the month of February, according to HUPD crime logs.
In the email, Catalano encouraged University affiliates to take precautions when navigating Harvard’s campus, which is located in an urban setting that he said shares many of the crimes and safety issues existent in other cities.
“Persons should avoid talking on cell phones, listening to music, or walking too close to persons unnecessarily,” he wrote.
“Trust your instincts,” he added. “If you feel uncomfortable about someone near you, head for a populated area and call the Harvard University Police Department.”

​​​​​​
After more than a decade at the helm of one of Harvard’s largest courses, Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw announced in an email to graduate students Monday that he will step down from teaching Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” at the end of this semester.
The Economics Department has not yet found a replacement for Mankiw, who has taught Ec 10 — the department’s year-long flagship introductory course — for 14 years. Both the fall and spring iterations of the course consistently rank among the College’s most popular offerings, coming in at 585 students and the College’s top-enrolled class this spring.
Mankiw wrote in an email to The Crimson that he chose to step back from Ec 10 to pursue “new pedagogical challenges.” He also wrote that he plans to take a sabbatical next year and return to teach in 2020.
“After 14 years as ec 10 course head, as well as one year long ago as a section leader, I decided it was time to pass the baton,” he wrote. “Teaching ec 10 has been a wonderful experience, but I am looking forward to new pedagogical challenges.”
“Looking ahead, I would like to have smaller discussion-based classes, such as the freshman seminar I have been teaching,” he added.
Economics lecturer Thomas H. Baranga, who serves as head section leader for the class, said Mankiw has had an “enormous influence” over the structure of Ec 10 and “frames” the course around his textbook. Students are required to purchase Mankiw’s textbook for $132.
“Ec 10 in many ways reflects his missions of the principles of economics that people should be exposed to in their preliminary class,” Baranga said.
Baranga added that the department has not made any concrete plans to alter the structure of the course after Mankiw’s departure, but that the new course head will likely have some liberty to change the course as they see fit — with the department’s approval.
“Whoever is ultimately going to be course head will have their own opinion about pedagogy and the most effective way to teach undergraduate introductory economics,” Baranga said. “They will be given a lot of support and free range to shape the course that way.”
Mankiw wrote in his email to The Crimson that he told Economics Chair Jeremy C. Stein and Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron he intended to leave Ec 10 around a month ago. A committee of senior faculty members in the department began the hunt for Mankiw’s replacement immediately afterwards, according to Miron.
Miron wrote in an email that the committee is working “in consultation with the appropriate Deans” to choose a new head and hopes to make a selection “within a few weeks.”
Baranga said the department is taking the search for a replacement “very seriously.”
“Ec 10 is very much one of the flagship courses of the department,” Baranga said. “They’re concerned to find the best possible people to take the course on for the next 14 or 15 years.”

Following the results of last year’s student health survey, Harvard University Health Services and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life have partnered to create a working group to address the mental health needs of BGLTQ students.
The group will be comprised of undergraduates who identify as BGLTQ, according to the application for students seeking to participate. HUHS and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life have tasked the group, which will meet three times over the next several weeks, with recommending initiatives to promote students’ mental health. The application closed on March 1, and the meetings are expected to begin before spring break.
“The purpose of this working group is to gain a deeper understanding of the data and to develop data-driven interventions to improve the emotional wellbeing of BGLTQ students,” the application reads.
Fourteen students — ranging from freshmen to seniors — responded to the Google Form application expressing their interest in participating in the group, according to Scarborough.
HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira and other HUHS administrators decided to form the group after reviewing data from the biannual undergraduate health survey, which showed that BGLTQ students were more likely to face mental health issues, according to Chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis.
“He [Barreira] had noticed that the BGLTQ community — it wasn’t surprising — was at higher risk. Maybe had needs that weren’t being met,” Lewis said.
HUHS then passed on the data to the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, where Director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 joined forces with Lewis and Barreira to create a student group that would review the survey data and design an intervention, Lewis said.
“We want students to come with ideas and make suggestions,” Lewis said. “I know that I have met with a couple of students who are actually interns with Sheehan, and I think they have had some great ideas, so we’re just trying to formalize that.”
Scarborough said he believes gathering student input is crucial, referencing productive conversations he has had with Office of BGLTQ Student Life interns.
“Our interns are amazing, they’re fantastic advocates,” Scarborough said. “So a lot of these conversations that I have been having have been informed by what I’ve been hearing from students and wanting to make sure that the concerns that they’re bringing up get the visibility that they deserve.”
Scarborough said that he is looking forward to collaborating with students directly in the working group.
“I'm most looking forward to partnering with students in thinking about their own experiences and how they can really inform those experiences to make them better — to improve them not only for themselves, but for the entire student body,” Scarborough said. “Students — you all have such innovative ideas about your experiences here on campus, and to be able to incorporate those directly into the services that are provided for mental health — that's exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Institutional Research is conducting a pilot "Pulse Survey" of approximately 50,000 Harvard affiliates — the first-ever University-wide survey of its kind.
The survey comes after a University-wide Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion — originally convened by former University President Drew G. Faust in 2016 — released its final report last spring. The report outlined several recommendations from the 55-member presidential task force, including a survey that evaluates participants’ perspectives from the “bottom-up”.
Open from Tuesday to March 22, the pilot survey consists of ten questions — nine of which are quantitative and one that is open-ended. The survey will be administered to all Harvard faculty, staff, and degree-seeking students.
Professor of Education Andrew Ho, one of the initiative’s leaders, said the first question asks whether or not participants feel like they belong at Harvard, the central theme of the survey as a whole.
“It is the utmost interest to us given the work that we do across faculty, staff and students across 50,000 different people to know the extent to which people feel that way because that underlies good learning, good work, good teaching, good research,” Ho said.
Ho — who served on the University-wide task force — said the survey was created with input from the faculty, students, and staff within the task force. He also administered and “talked through” the survey to his class at the Graduate School of Education.
“This pilot is yet another opportunity to continue to improve the items to make sure that whatever we do in the future will be at the high quality that we expect at this university,” Ho said.
The survey is confidential and responses will never be matched with the names and titles of the participants, he said. The survey will also follow standard protocol as laid out by the Office of Institutional Research.
John S. Wilson, Jr. — senior advisor and strategist to the president on diversity and inclusion initiatives — noted that the survey will allow leaders across Harvard’s various schools to understand perspectives on diversity for those under their jurisdiction and amend their leadership approaches to address points raised by respondents.
“There is in this process a healthy respect for the ‘every tub culture’ at Harvard University and we believe that this approach respects that appropriately,” Wilson said, referrring to 19th-century University President John T. Kirkland’s famous saying, “It is our rule here for every tub to stand on its own bottom.”
Faust created the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force in 2016 to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and recommend improvements to existing programming. The group focused on four topics: demographics of faculty, staff, and students across the University, the “fabric of the institution” and its culture, academic resources available to students, and diversity organizations on campus.
Wilson — a former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body — said the legacy of Faust’s initiative on inclusion and belonging lives on with current University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Wilson also said he believes that the survey will foster a “new set of conversations” on campus and is optimistic that it will lead to an improvement for Harvard students, faculty, and staff.
“I think minimally and thankfully, this effort is going to lead to a new set of conversations at Harvard University,” Wilson said. “And I believe amazing things can happen when you stimulate a new set of conversations, especially about a matter like this and that's what we're most hopeful about.”
Administrators began publicizing the survey with flyers posted around campus this week that read “10 questions. 3 minutes. Your Voice” and included a link to the online form.

​​​​​​
Eight Harvard students traveled through snowy weather to the Massachusetts State House Monday to participate in the annual Immigrants’ Day lobbying event.
Now in its 23rd year, Immigrants’ Day is the “biggest lobbying day of the year” for immigrants, refugees and allies, according to a Facebook page for the event. The event was organized by the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, as well as more than 50 co-sponsors.
Liza Ryan, the organizing director for MIRA, said she hopes the Massachusetts State Legislature will offer more support for immigrants going forward.
“We want to remind the legislature that under the current federal administration, despite all of the words that they have said, they still have continued to do nothing to support the immigrant and refugee community in this really terrible time,” she said in an interview before the event. “We expect more from them.”
This year's lobbying efforts follow the state legislature's exclusions of an amendment in this year’s budget protecting immigrants from police questions concerning their immigration status.
Filing into the State House at roughly 10 a.m., Harvard students from organizations including Act on a Dream, the Phillips Brooks House Association, and the Harvard College Democrats joined hundreds of other Mass. community activists advocating for immigrant rights.
“It was really empowering to see a lot of different community organizations from the Boston area come together and push for immigrant issues at the state level,” said Diego Navarrete ’21, co-director of Act on a Dream and a Crimson Editorial board member. “There’s a lot of emphasis on national immigration reform and national immigration policy.”
​​​​​​
The day’s programming began with “Lobbying 101” training, where participants learned how to lobby legislators. At 11 a.m., local and national political advocates — including Carol Rose, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Massachusetts, and U.S. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) — took to the stage to speak to Immigrants’ Day attendees. Pressley focused on the need for Massachusetts to prioritize the “humanity of immigrants.”
“We have 6,000 Salvadorans and 5,000 Haitians living with temporary status,” she said. “And let me be clear, there is nothing temporary about the contributions of the people and the lives that they have built here and the families that are rooted here and their contributions for decades.”
Doris Landaverde, a Harvard custodian with Temporary Protected Status, shared her story about being an immigrant in the U.S. over the past 18 years during the event. She said she hopes Mass. legislators passes the Work and Family Mobility Act, a bill that would allow undocumented people to apply for a driver's license.
“A license is very important to me. I work in Harvard University, and I have to drive one hour every day. My schedule is 6 in the morning, and I have no commuter rail to help me to bring me in the morning,” she said in an interview after her speech. “We are workers. We are the people who clean the university. Like today, it snowed, but we had still had to be here in the morning to clean.”
During the remainder of the event, participants joined thematic break-out groups to learn about specific pieces of legislation, including the Work and Family Mobility Act. Several Harvard students visited the offices of State Representative Harold P. Naughton, Jr. and State Senator Michael O. Moore to specifically lobby for the Safe Communities Act, which would restrict federal immigration intervention within the state and its municipalities.
Jeremy A. Stepansky ’21, the legislative director of the Harvard Democrats who attended the event, talked about the importance of student lobbying efforts.
“It’s incredibly important as Harvard students and as members of the Massachusetts community, who are both allies and people directly affected by state and federal immigration policies,” Stepansky said. “This is just an issue that really needs all of our voices.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
When Arlene Yarde, a full-time Securitas guard at Harvard Medical School, was called into her supervisor’s office two years ago to discuss a tweet she had posted, she could not anticipate the upheaval that would follow their conversation.
At that meeting, Steve Barkowski — her supervisor — told her she was being suspended after working for the company for 18 years and asked her never to disclose what was said during their discussion, in particular the contents of the tweet, Yarde said. A few days later, she learned from Christopher Connolly, an area director for Securitas, that she was being transferred out of her Longwood campus post at the request of its client, a Medical School administrator.
Yarde was told her transfer was non-disciplinary, meaning the client did not have to provide a reason for its request, according to provisions of a 2016 contract guards negotiated with Securitas through their union, 32BJ Service Employees International Union. Harvard contracts Securitas North America to handle most of its security guard operations, and the company has significant say over hiring, disciplinary action, and firing.
In the two years since Yarde was transferred, she said she has only been able to find work on Harvard’s Cambridge campus for a few weeks each year and has gone unpaid the rest of the time. She now plans to file for bankruptcy.
“From that time on, I really have not worked,” Yarde said.
Barkowski did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Connolly declined to comment on Yarde’s case, calling it inappropriate to comment on personnel matters.
“Non disciplinary transfers and other types of transfers, employment actions, management rights and other terms and conditions of employment are all matters which have been collectively bargained between the Company and the Union,” Connolly wrote.
She is not alone in alleging retaliation from Securitas supervisors — last week, Joseph G. Bartuah, a Securitas guard at Harvard’School of Public Health was terminated following allegations of retaliation. Bartuah said that managers began investigating him for leaving his desk because he sent an email to his supervisors stating that one of them made “unprofessional” remarks that damaged his reputation among his colleagues.
In the case of Yarde and fellow Medical School Securitas guard Susan C. Castignetti, who was also subject to a non-disciplinary transfer in November 2018, they have not been terminated, but Securitas managers offered positions in Cambridge that were incompatible with noted personal accommodations. As a result, they are without work and pay even while still employed.
In Yarde’s case, Connolly offered her late night shifts, which she said could not take because she has young children, according to emails Yarde provided to The Crimson. In further communications, Connolly also offered Yarde various other shifts like weekends and afternoons, but she turned them down because of childcare and religious commitments. Since being transferred, Yarde said she has had to work elsewhere part time.
Last September, Connolly reached out to her and informed her of a “long term turning permanent” opportunity, according to text messages provided by Yarde. She said that after Connolly’s offer, she quit a nursing home job she had taken in the interim, but about a month after assuming the new Securitas position, the post was eliminated.
Castignetti, the other Medical School guard, said she worked overnight shifts for Securitas for six years to eventually earn a daytime shift at the school’s Warren Alpert Building. But after four years in her new position, the client — an unnamed administrator at the Medical School — requested a non-disciplinary transfer for Castignetti to the Cambridge campus.
Castignetti alleged her transfer was orchestrated by Securitas management as retaliation for requesting time off for a medical condition, and that Harvard administrators simply went along with Securitas’ request.
She said Barkowski, Securitas’ account manager at the Medical School, was unhappy with the amount of time Castignetti requested to take off because she has fibromyalgia, a disorder that causes patients to feel chronic musculoskeletal pain and fatigue.
After Securitas management refused to give her Fridays off, Castignetti said she secured the extra day off through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows workers up to twelve weeks off each year for medical and family reasons.
“I had tried to get Friday's off with just a doctor's note and they refused me and then I went through FMLA and got it that way,” she said. “So [Barkowski] wasn't happy that I was getting the Fridays off.”
She alleges that Barkowski asked Robert A. Dickson, director of campus services at Harvard Medical School, to request Castignetti’s transfer. She says Securitas management were aware that there were no open daytime slots in Cambridge despite knowing that she could no longer take overnight shifts because of her condition.
Dickson declined to comment, writing in an email that “this is a Securitas employment related matter.”
Gina Vild, a Harvard Medical School spokesperson, declined to comment on all the allegations against the school, referring to Dickson’s response.
Castignetti technically remains an employee of Securitas and collects health benefits, but said she has only worked four days since November, covering a short detail during winter recess. When she is not assigned to shifts, she said she does not receive a salary, and does not expect to find a new long-term assignment at Harvard at this point.
“They transferred me knowing that there's no day jobs in Cambridge because Arlene [Yarde]’s been waiting for two years. How am I going to get a position if she's been waiting two years?” Castignetti said.
Non-disciplinary transfers have been a topic of conversation in recent contract negotiations between Securitas and its workers’ union. Before 2016, Securitas was not required to make any effort to understand why its clients asked for these transfers. As of 2016, Securitas employees can still be put under non-disciplinary transfer with or without cause when the University requests so, but Securitas must now make a “good faith effort” to understand why, according to the contracts.
“We were proud to win improvements in our language about non-disciplinary transfers when we negotiated with Securitas in 2016,” Roxana Rivera, the vice president of 32BJ SEIU, wrote in an emailed statement.
Castignetti, however, said the “good faith effort” provision has not brought transparency to her case.
Rivera wrote that the union represents its members in non-disciplinary transfers on a case by case basis, and tries to ensure they can remain employed at Harvard.
“We work hard to help our members secure the schedules and job accommodations they need to maintain this employment, while facilitating a positive working relationship between the employer and the worker,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team kicked off its season with a 14-6 win against the University of New Hampshire on Feb. 16, followed by a 17-6 loss to Boston College last Saturday and an 18-12 win against the University of Massachusetts last Wednesday.
In the victory over UNH, the Crimson’s sophomore goalkeeper, Grace Rotundo, made six saves on the night, keeping the Wildcats’ lively offense at bay. To complement the team’s stellar defense, senior attacker Nicole Baiocco matched her career-high, scoring three goals. The midfield also chipped in on offense with sophomore Tessa Queri, freshman Grace Hulslander, and senior Caroline Garrity tacking on two scores apiece. Senior attacker Keeley MacAfee pitched in as well, scoring her 100th career-goal in the contest.
The win is not without precedent. With the two teams meeting on the field once a season since 2016, the win represents Harvard’s fourth consecutive in the series.
While Harvard won this season’s rendition of the game, the first goal of the Crimson’s season went to the Wildcats. Harvard was not deterred though as it responded with four of its own, one of which was Huslander’s first career point.
The Wildcats soon followed with another goal, but Garrity, Baiocco, and junior attacker Hannah Keating were quick to counter, cementing the Crimson’s lead with a goal each, expanding the point margin to five and the score to 7-2 in Harvard’s favor.
The second half began with MacAfee and Baiocco each scoring a goal to give Harvard additional breathing room. UNH still had life and began to lay the foundations of a comeback rally. Three quick, consecutive goals stole the momentum only to be reclaimed by the visitors who rocketed five more of their to clinch the game. Of these, Queri scored two, while MacAfee, Hulslander, and Garrity each tallied one, with MacAfee’s being her fourth of the game.
Harvard set the bar high in their first game of the season, and the team is ready for the challenge.
“We will be playing top-tier opponents all spring, so opening with a win was great for team morale,” MacAfee said. “I think we won because our coaches prepped us all week leading up to the game. They kept reminding us that we’re now in the full-swing of season, and we need to be ready to compete with other teams.”
MacAfee was the star of the game, scoring four of the fourteen goals and earning her 100th career-goal.
“In all honesty, it’s a testament to my teammates and coaches pushing me to improve every day,” MacAfee said. “I couldn’t ask for a better, more selfless group of teammates or more dedicated coaches.”
Harvard wasn’t quite so fortunate in the next game. The team played at BC this past Saturday, who were 3-0 going into the game. Although Harvard had momentum from the hard-earned win against UNH, the Crimson faltered by a 17-6 margin.
BC scored six consecutive goals to start the game. Harvard fought back, with Garrity, Keating and sophomore attacker Madison Conklin each scoring a goal within fewer than seven minutes. The Eagles were still comfortably ahead, and scored six more insurance goals to end the half. With plenty of time to reverse course, Harvard entered the second half and posted three goals, two earned by Garrity and one by Katie Muldoon. Unfortunately, the effort was fruitless, as the game ended 17-6 favoring BC.
Garrity played exceptionally, earning her fifth goal of the season and leading the team in goals. Her three scores are the most she’s ever tallied in a game, and she is on track to surpass her career-high 11 goals in a season.
Goalie Rotundo also played impressively, making eight saves in the cage against the aggressive Eagles’ offense.
Harvard came back home for their next game, beating UMass 18-12 to regain their winning record.Rotundo played another great game in the cage, recording a career-high 15 saves against the Minutewomen.
Although the Crimson started the game roughly, giving up three goals, the team quickly recovered, with Garrity and Muldoon scoring two goals each and Conklin, Hulslander, and MacAfee each scoring four.
The team played an excellent second half, outscoring UMass 8-3. Marley Jenkins, a senior who scored her first goal of the season against the Minutewomen, accredited this second half to Harvard’s defense.
“We buckled-down on defense and came up with some key draw controls that resulted in goals,” Jenkins said. “Once we were on a run, UMass couldn’t stop us. It’s always exciting to score and the game was pretty back and forth at times, so it felt great to help the team move our momentum forward with a goal.”
Jenkins said the team is looking to be more offensive in future games to create opportunities for more goals, a chance they will get in their next game on Wednesday against Boston University.

So spring break is coming up and you’re not feeling quite ready to bare any skin for beach photoshoots. Or maybe you’re getting restless from doing work at your desk all day. Either way, your subconscious (and your mirror) has been telling you that it’s time to hit the gym. Here’s why the “it’s too cold to work out” excuse doesn’t cut it.
House gyms
Sorry to leave you out in the cold, freshmen, but House gyms are the move for anyone who doesn’t want to brave the elements for a workout. They’re usually well-stocked and not too crowded, plus working out in-House gives you the chance to show your dhall crush how good your stamina is (or not).
Hemenway and the Malkin Athletic Center
Just stop avoiding them. They’re conveniently located for anyone who lives in the Yard or a River House, and have just about any piece of equipment you may need. If running on a treadmill makes you feel like a caged hamster, try out one of the many group exercise classes that they offer.
Get into a relationship
The much-needed human contact will give you a reason to quit complaining about the cold weather (after all, it’s still cuffing season). Additionally, your romantic partner will have you doing mental gymnastics at least a few times per week, so you can get a workout without going outside. But if this option doesn’t work…
Just go outside
As long as you work out on a relatively warmer day, the winter air won’t be too painful. Plus, avoiding puddles and jumping over snow banks can give you that extra tone you’ve been needing.
Sorry for taking away all your excuses! We might even take our own advice and go outside sometime this week (not like we really have a choice since the Faculty of Arts and Sciences refuses to close).
