Zhang Yimou’s “A Woman, a Gun, and A Noodle Shop” opens with the titular woman (Yan Ni) purchasing a pistol from an eccentric Persian merchant, unaware of the catastrophic series of events about to befall the workers at a noodle shop seemingly located in the middle of nowhere. A Chinese remake of the Coen brothers’ 1984 debut, “Blood Simple”, the film is a competent transposition of many of the distinctive character archetypes and story elements that make Joel and Ethan Coen unique filmmakers. But because it accurately captures all of what made its predecessors great, it becomes difficult to escape the feeling that stories like “A Woman, a Gun, and a Noodle Shop” have been told many times before.
Nearly all of the action of the film takes place in the noodle shop owned by the abusive, misogynistic Wang (Ni Dahong), who, by the film’s beginning, has driven his unnamed wife to buy a pistol. Wang’s wife is having an affair with the effeminate and timid Li, an employee at the restaurant. Becoming suspicious, Wang hires a police officer named Zhang (Sun Honglei) to follow his wife and discover the truth. Supporting these four principles are Cheng Ye and Mao Mao as Zhao and Chen, respectively, who requisitely provide comic relief in the film.
The film’s greatest strength is its visual composition. Vivid colors are evident in every frame, either in the red- and beige-streaked hills of the film’s desert setting or the colorful period costumes worn by the cast (though the latter can be a bit garish at times). Li is always dressed in an emasculating pink; Wang’s wife always wears green, and so on. Despite the steady chronology of the film, Yimou also inserts some striking time-lapse shots of the desert to correspond with the escalating pace of the story. The film also highlights the visual intricacies of seemingly simple processes; for example, one sequence in the film’s opening act illustrates the formidable art of noodle-making.
The other striking element of “A Woman, a Gun, and a Noodle Shop” is its balanced pacing. The film is presented in three acts containing varying degrees of slapstick comedy and tense drama, with the end of each segment signaled by a shot from the gun. While the opening act is more humorous in tone, it’s not particularly noteworthy. A few laughs may be mined from Li’s constant worrying, Zhao’s oversized buckteeth, or Wang’s pratfalls, but for the most part it only serves to set the stage for events to come. The rest of the film, however, is far more engaging, as each character’s clandestine motives and actions escalate the events toward their tragic conclusion. In fact, after the first part of the story, much of the film proceeds with very little dialogue, which Yimou uses as an effective technique to increase the tension.
However, while “A Woman, a Gun, and a Noodle Shop” tells an engaging story, it’s hard to escape a nagging feeling of déjà vu. The successful emulation of the Coen brothers’ tropes ultimately does the film a disservice. The secretive characters who all have independent motives, the greed central to most characters’ actions, and the quasi-slapstick violence are all overly familiar if not outright predictable. Halfway through the film, it becomes easy to assume that most of the cast is going to end up dead by the time the credits roll.
“A Woman, a Gun, and a Noodle Shop” is hardly a bad film. In fact, it’s quite enjoyable. But by adhering so closely to the style of its source material, it makes it difficult to consider the film as anything other than a Chinese Coen brothers movie. Though the visually lush transposition of the film’s setting may be enough for some, the faithfulness of the film’s tone makes it difficult to escape the feeling that all of this has been done before, albeit in English rather than Chinese.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, gorgeous redhead with a husky voice who went to a high school where no one was very nice to her. Despite being gorgeous, she was invisible and uncool until she pretended to be someone she really wasn’t, mostly by wearing more revealing clothing. Suddenly everybody was talking about her, and she basked in her newfound notoriety until everything started to go terribly wrong. In the end, she realized that she should instead embrace her true self and wear more conservative clothing.
Though this plot may sound a bit like Lindsay Lohan’s career-making hit, “Mean Girls,” the movie being discussed here is actually Emma Stone’s potentially career-making hit, “Easy A,” a loose adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter.” Its storyline isn’t particularly original, believable, or funny, and the plot spins completely out of control in the final third, but the movie manages to remain entertaining because of Stone and a few outstanding performances by her supporting cast.
The film is oddly structured as a webcast streamed by Olive Penderghast (Stone), who attempts to explain away her whorish reputation. In order to get out of a trip with her obnoxious friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka), she claims to be spending the weekend with her college-age boyfriend. Pushy Rhiannon forces Olive to confess to having sex with her imaginary boy, though in reality she spent the weekend dancing to “Pocketful of Sunshine” in one of the funnier montages in the film. Of course, Christian extremist Marianne (Amanda Bynes) overhears and spreads the rumor to the whole school, turning Olive into an insta-tramp.
The movie’s plot kicks in when Olive’s gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her to pretend to have sex with him so the other kids will stop making fun of him for being gay. It’s not clear whether this request is supposed to be funny, sad, or some sort of social commentary on how gay kids feel the need to pretend to be straight because of societal pressure, but whatever the case may be, it feels very uncomfortable. The fake sex scene itself is definitely a highlight of the movie—“It smells!” “You’re not supposed to say it smells!” “Oh. It doesn’t really smell!”—but Byrd’s portrayal of a gay high schooler is so over-the-top that he is not particularly funny.
The same is true of all of the other males who exploit Olive’s reputation as a whore to boost their social status; the fat kid pouts and eats a snickers bar when Olive doesn’t want to help him, the Indian kid is cheap and tries to pay her with a coupon, and the viewer doesn’t know whether it’s supposed to be funny or offensive. The same is true of all of the caricatures in the movie, from the Christian extremist group led by Amanda Bynes in an incredibly irritating performance to the sex-starved guidance counselor who gives chlamydia to a student in a bizarre plot turn towards the film’s conclusion. Because all of the exaggerations hit a little bit too close to home, “Easy A” is a wince-and-wonder-whether-to-grin movie instead of a laugh-out-loud movie.
The only supporting characters who add a sense of true humor to the movie are Olive’s parents, hilariously portrayed by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci. They are unbelievably, incredibly fun, and despite their craziness of their lines, seem to represent some of the only moments of sanity in such a strange film. When Olive sits down with her family to watch a movie and they comment on the scandalous clothes that she’s been wearing to school—“Honey, you’ve been dressing like a hooker.” “But a high-end stripper, for governors or athletes!”—Tucci and Clarkson somehow manage to convey truly caring parents even through such outlandish lines. The best moment between Olive and her mother happens at the end of the movie, when Clarkson goes into extreme detail about all of the different sexual tricks she performed as an actual “slut” in high school.
Stone herself is fantastic as Olive, a parallel to Lohan’s breakout acting as Cady in “Mean Girls.” Her comedic timing is right on, and most astoundingly, she manages to turn Olive’s ludicrous story into a believable one, so that viewers truly understand why a girl would resort to slaying her reputation for the sake of a bunch of not-so-deserving males. She expresses the psychology of Olive and infuses her with realness while still getting all the gag laughs that she’s supposed to.
As far as high school adaptations of classic literature go, “Easy A” ranks far below films like “10 Things I Hate About You” and “Clueless.” Reading the book or even just re-watching “Mean Girls” is probably a better option.

“Well, it isn’t every day an elephant appears in our lives,” reflects José Saramago in his latest novel, “The Elephant’s Journey.” Saramago, a Nobel Prize-winning Portuguese novelist who died this past summer, endows his carefully researched work with a set of theoretical and historical ideas that could extend beyond this simple statement of novelty. Most poignantly, Saramago meditates on the very concept of creative non-fiction, exposing the layers of his own narrative artifice to reveal that certain eras and places are inscrutable. To honestly write about the past, real or imagined, a writer must use the thick lens of the present-day, though which certain objects will be obscured entirely. This modesty does not extend to the geopolitical realities of sixteenth-century Europe, which Saramago writes about with subtlety and obvious relish. At times, the novelist’s ironically manicured and high-minded prose succeeds in concretizing the whimsical, antiquarian aesthetic established by this conceptual background.
However, “The Elephant’s Journey” is not primarily a novel of ideas, nor is it a work of great beauty. Rather, it is the charming yet languid true story of King João III of Portugal’s gift of an elephant (named Solomon) to the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, and that elephant’s trip from Lisbon to Vienna in the 1550s along with his Indian mahout, or keeper, Subhro; a platoon of the Portuguese military; and the Archduke himself. Overcommitted to the enchantment of this wonderfully odd plotline, Saramago loses the weight of his more interesting ideas and applies his potentially inventive and humorous writing style to subject matter that renders it tedious. Worse, the historical facts of the story itself swallow up the novel’s characters, none of whom have exhibited real depth by the last page.
The most compelling aspects of “The Elephant’s Journey” do not come from the cultural analysis for which Saramago is famous, but rather from a self-referential exploration of the form of the novel. After two characters argue over the distance between them and the nearest town, Saramago explains that the narrator “will use our own modern itinerary units of measurement… It will be as if we were adding subtitles in our own language to a film…we will, therefore, have two parallel discourses that will never meet, this one, which we will be able to follow without difficulty and another, which, from this moment on, will remain silent.” The truth of history is irretrievable; only its distorted descendant—fiction, told from a modern perspective—can give its events contemporary meaning.
Later, when the elephant, Subhro, and the Archduke are preparing to cross the formidable Brenner Pass, the narrator instantly admits that, due to changes in the area since the sixteenth century and the limited descriptive power of words themselves, he cannot appropriately capture the scene. The world of Subhro, then, is always at an arm’s length from the reader; everything around the flashlight of the narrative is imperceptible. Though the novelist joyfully mentions the Council of Trent and the Inquisition, actual flavors of the historical moment are shrouded in an intriguing half-darkness.
At times, Saramago’s writing style, characterized by sweeping, endless sentences and few paragraph breaks, as well as dialogue in which separate voices are delineated only by commas, supports the wondrous confusion that the novel reaches at its best moments. The reader is not immersed in a certain character’s point of view but rather in the feeling of discourse itself, in which words, thoughts, and the outside world all combine into a single, integrated impression. When it is successful, Saramago’s absurdly intricate diction helps place the reader in the world of old European royalty.
Yet this language can also be grating, even cloying. Saramago describes the elephant as “this pachyderm…this ridiculous proboscidean more than four ells high, who, god willing, will soon be depositing his malodorous excretions on the pretentious Austrian city of Vienna.” In this and other attempts to establish a pleasant and preposterous manner, the result is often just a contrived circumlocution. Much of this language, in fact, has incomprehensible connotations for the story. Oft-repeated terms like “pachyderm” or, here, “proboscidean,” relate to a scientific mindset that otherwise plays no part in the novel. While Saramago’s style is pitch-perfect when he describes the Portuguese court, elsewhere it becomes disjointed.
In addition to uncomfortably stilted prose, Saramago’s attempts at humor often fall flat. After Solomon kicks a priest who is attempting to exorcize him with holy water, Saramago describes how the man, “will always say that these apparently brutish animals are, in fact, so intelligent that, as well as having a smattering of Latin, they are also capable of distinguishing ordinary water from holy water.” This kind of unsuccessful humor undermines the novel’s more serious moments.
The book’s most serious flaw comes in its relentless description of the minor social and physical perils of the trip across Europe, and the resulting lack of depth in each character. The closest any character comes to real development is the nameless platoon leader, who exclaims with evident irony, “I’m just a captain of cavalry who has undergone some inner change during this journey.” It seems that Saramago openly scorns the idea that his characters should undergo any kind of analysis or change during his story. Indeed, Subhro is one of the few characters to get a name, past, or multi-dimensional personality. This emptiness at the novel’s emotional core makes it impossible to become truly invested in any aspect of the story.
Without an overriding commitment to its ideas or characters, the center of Saramago’s final work must be this story of an elephant. The author is right in pointing out that “it isn’t every day an elephant appears in our lives”, and it was especially rare for the sixteenth-century Portuguese to enjoy one. But this observation, however fruitful in terms of whimsy, is skimpy in fictional substance.

What happens to memories if we don’t remember them? Do films truly tell the whole story? These are some of the questions that artist and Visual and Environmental Sciences [VES]visiting lecturer Kerry Tribe explores through her film, video, and sound art installations. Through this medium, Tribe delves into the ephemeral and seeks to challenge the understanding of memory, subjectivity and doubt, as well as the limits of representation. Her work has been exhibited in world-renowned museums across America and Europe, from the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York to the Generali Foundation in Vienna. Tribe is currently teaching two classes, “The Art of Forgetting” and “Sound-Film-Video-Installation,” and also has her own work on display in the Carpenter Center. On September 23, Tribe will be participating in the event “Artist Talks,” a series of informal discussions implemented to encourage dialogue between undergraduates and VES faculty.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you start exploring the ideas of memory, doubt, and installation art?
Kerry Tribe: When I was an undergraduate at Brown, I took a production class on documentary. I tried to make a video about my grandfather, who was at the time becoming quite senile, and this introduced all kinds of problems for me. The documentary ended up becoming a document about how difficult it can be to make something that’s objective and accurate when your subject is somebody who can’t remember, and the project became very much about the problems about documentary. This project kind of initiated these twin interests for me in representation and its limits, and memory and its limits.
THC: What are the challenges of working with a time-based art?
KT: One challenge is dealing with a viewer that can come and go. When you go into a movie theater, you sit down, the film rolls, the credits follow, and then it’s over. In an art installation, it’s difficult to say how long a project is. Do you want to spend 15 minutes looking at my work? Through a photograph or a painting, you’re able to take it in in a lot less time. Another challenge is preservation and issues of media specificity. I create work in 16 mm film, work that gets saved and played on DVDs. DVDs get scratched. Films break. Formats change. There are a lot of issues that are physical and material that come up for me in the process.
THC: What is this artistic process like for you?
KT: I have a set of people that I really love to collaborate with as editors and sound designers, but I don’t make a lot of work. Typically I’ll think about something for months, upwards towards a year before I will shoot. The production part of the project is very short. For example, the idea for the piece up at the Carpenter Center right now, “The Last Soviet,” had been turning around back and forth and the scripting had taken about a year, but afterwards, it was just one day of shooting.
THC: What is particularly special about art installation to you?
KT: I think every artist ends up making the work they want to see in the world. You get an idea, and it becomes a bee in your bonnet, and you sort of have to see it realized. But also, my background is in conceptual art, and a founding principle of conceptual art, is the idea that the work is really the idea, and it has to get realized in whatever medium or form best suits the idea. Because my ideas make sense to me in a temporal medium, they are often about the passage of time. I try to use the format that I’m showing the work, to talk about time: what gets remembered and what gets forgotten.
THC: What are the different reactions you have gotten about your works?
KT: It’s not like I always have a clear idea of what a work will mean. It’s often realized in the process. The work is interpretable. The reader or the viewer of the work is always going to bring their own associations to it, and I try to make work for a range of audiences so that people who have a lot of experiences looking at experimental film might find something of interest in it, I hope, and hopefully an audience of people like my parents, who are perfectly intelligent, lovely people, but who haven’t seen a lot of art, might also find a lot of intrigue in it.
THC: What do you hope to gain from your time at Harvard?
KT: For me, it’s really terrific to take a step back from making for a few months. I’m not working hard on any major new project right now. I’m using my classes as a kind of laboratory to think through ideas. I’m seeing students’ work that feels refreshing.

“Now something was raising a stink. / A poem decomposing around what looked like an arrow. / Her stomach contents ink.” So Paul Muldoon writes in the opening of “The Humors of Hakone,” one of the sequence poems in “Maggot,” his eleventh full-length collection. Muldoon chose his title well; though it is perhaps only in “The Humors of Hakone” in which poetry itself is said to be decaying, the themes of rot and death pervade throughout the entire collection.
Sometimes this morbidity leads him in a rather gruesome, if evocative, direction: “By day four the skin would have peeled from her thigh like a fine-mesh stocking.” But more often than not, the buoyancy of Muldoon’s language overcomes the sobriety of his subjects. Between his constant wordplay and his easy use of rhyme, Muldoon creates a series of poems that are full of exuberance even as they approach the grisliest of topics.
The energy of Muldoon’s language is in part a result of his mixing of contemporary references and slang with a wide range of historical and literary allusions. In the opening poem, “Plan B,” “dork” is rhymed with “Scythian torc.” This is only one of many instances in which modern ideas appear side by side with the arcane. He uses scientific terminology such as the Y chromosome or a cancer cell as easily is as he alludes to Cuchulainn and Boudicca. Moreover, his verse is no less full of poetic play when he speaks of science than it is when he draws on mythology and history. Take, for example, the chiastic lines: “I’ve taken in / how my own DNA is 87% European and East Asian 13%.”
However, the most often-invoked tradition in “Maggot” is Muldoon’s native Irish one. Though he has lived in the United States since 1987, and is currently a professor at Princeton University and the poetry editor of the New Yorker, Muldoon’s work is still steeped in Irish lore and legend. He refers at one point to his forbearers in Ireland: “the Muldoons will lose their hold on the ancient barony of Lurg / and be reduced to ferrying pilgrims to Lough Derg.” Nevertheless, the Irish tradition is not the only one at Muldoon’s disposal. From the explorations of Henry Hudson to the lands of the Tokugawa clan, Muldoon seems to have a world of knowledge at his poetic fingertips.
It is without doubt that at least some of these allusions will elude even the most knowledgeable of readers. However, it is a direct result of the breadth of Muldoon’s references that he is able to achieve the kind of effusive sonic play that he does. One poem, entitled “@,” is composed of a series of similes intended to evoke the “at” symbol. It begins: “Like the whorl of an out-of-this world ear that had been lent / to an oak gall wasp by a tenth-century Irish monk / who would hold out oak gall ink against the predicament in which he found himself….” From the near-rhyme of “whorl” and “world” to the repetition of “oak gall,” Muldoon conjures the swirling of the modern symbol even as he describes the actions of tenth-century scribes.
Although in “@,” the poem imitates the structure of the symbol in the title, Muldoon nevertheless uses the traditional form of a sonnet. It is the ellipses, enjambment, and rhyme that create the swirling sensation of the symbol rather than any kind of break from literary form. This is the case throughout most of the collection. Though Muldoon’s playful poems are certainly anchored in the modern world, he consistently uses traditional poetic forms. The title poem, “Maggot” is a sequence of nine sonnets linked by the repeating tercet: “where I’m waiting for some lover / to kick me out of bed / for having acted on a whim.”
Just as Muldoon does not hesitate to use traditional forms, he also frequently calls upon other voices from the literary tradition. One poem, “Capriccio in E Minor for Lowfly and Strings,” is dedicated to John Ashbery; another is entitled “Lines for the Centenary for the Birth of Samuel Beckett.” Even when he invokes other literary figures, however, he is always sure to add some kind of contemporary twist. In “Charles Baudelaire: ‘The Albatross’,” which is a creative translation of Baudelaire’s famous sonnet, Muldoon also includes an epigraph composed of a quote from BBC news: “About one-third of all albatross chicks die on Midway, many as the result of being mistakenly fed plastic by their parents….Many albatrosses are found to have swallowed disposable cigarette lighters—which look remarkably similar to their staple food of squid.”
“The Poet is not unlike this Prince of the Clouds,” Muldoon writes of the albatross. “Again and again he’s dragged down by the weight of those wings.” Baudelaire’s poem presents a dreary vision of the life of a poet. However, though Muldoon’s vision is consistently dragged downward throughout his poems, as he encounters maggots, decaying bodies, and decomposing poems, his verse is nevertheless also full of the seemingly “effortless motion” that he first ascribes to the bird.

Perhaps because her witty, tongue-in-cheek 1980 bestseller, “The Official Preppy Handbook,” was such a smashing success—and inspired both the creation of the J. Crew clothing line and the resurgence of the L.L. Bean brand to boot—Lisa Birnbach has decided to revisit the subject of “prep.”
This time, however, in “True Prep: It’s A Whole New Old World,” a subject that she once treated with a humorous, quasi-satirical eye is depicted for the most part with an affectionate reverence that seeks to defend the idea of “prep” from those who would argue that the culture of Nantucket red and “call it house not home” belong exclusively to a certain faction of the elite, East Coast American establishment bookended by Montauk and Bar Harbor.
Thirty years ago, Birnbach writes in the “Manifesto” that begins her new book, preppies were “Formerly WASP. Failing that, white and heterosexual. One day we became curious or bored and wanted to branch out, and before you knew it, we were all mixed up.”
And while “True Prep” is, in part, a later-life continuation of its predecessor, which dealt mostly with prep school and college, such inclusiveness, in a nutshell, seems to be its raison d’être: to promote and to sell an image that was once the exclusive property of the landed aristocracy but that now can apparently belong to anyone.
Anyone, that is, who can afford to pay the $37,341.60 tuition for a year of private day or boarding school or the more than $10,000 for an Hermès Birkin bag for the primary purpose of toting around “swatches and paint chips.”
For those who are still unsure whether they merit the distinction of “prep,” Birnbach and collaborator Chip Kidd are here to help: “if by some chance you are entering this world on your own, of your free will, with no one to lead you by the hand, let us guide you,” they say in the book’s beginning. “We know the code. We’re here to help.”
For the most part, the book—a series of short little features on subjects as diverse as trunk shows, second weddings, and different types of loafers—is an entertaining encapsulation of one of the most recognizable (and ridiculous) styles under the sun, and the author certainly maintains a healthy sense of humor throughout. But underneath the humor and behind the fun, the book has an odd dimension that suggests some things that are somewhat less whimsical.
In fact, the most difficult thing about “True Prep” is determining exactly what to take seriously and what to take with a grain of salt. But given that the author has modeled her book as a “code” rather than as pure satire, there are some things the reader cannot help taking away. For one, the book makes a strange argument, which is perhaps the most unpalatable aspect of the entire project. Although Birnbach does allow that prepiness can indeed now belong to anyone, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation, she justifies this argument, a fine idea in its own right, in a borderline offensive manner.
With a certain lighthearted tenor that borders on flippancy, Birnbach makes it quite clear that non-white minorities, too, can also be preppy, but only provided that they attend the right schools, wear the right clothes, and summer in the right spots (there’s even an entire page devoted to “African-American Prep Resorts”).
On the particular subject of African-Americans, the “True Prep Pantheon” early in the book includes two black members, glorified merely because of their entrance into the ranks of the American elite and, more importantly to Birnbach, because they appear to have assimilated entirely into the rarefied world of Sperry loafers and Madras shorts. And, of course, these two avatars of assimilation are none other than Barack and Michelle Obama.
Of the first lady, “a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,” Birnbach writes that “she has arms that look sculpted out of onyx and, for covering up, often chooses cardigans from J. Crew.” Regardless of the cheeky noblesse oblige with which Birnbach approaches the tricky issue of minority inclusion within the “new old world” of prep, moments like these nevertheless read like subtle inducements to assimilate into the privileged culture of the, yes, predominantly white American establishment. And, the book seems to suggest, as long as you cover your black skin with the same sorts of clothes as your neighbors in Sag Harbor, you, too can be one of us!
Naturally, there is never an explanation of why prep culture is something worth glorifying or even a subject worthy of two whole books. “It just so happens that almost anyone can assimilate into our world of prepdom,” Birnbach says with regard to the subject of preppy Muslims. But, after 234 pages, one has to wonder: why would anyone want to?

If there’s one thing actor, writer, and director Ben Affleck loves, it’s Boston, and he wants to make sure everyone knows it. From the sweeping views of the city’s skyline, to the heart of Harvard Square, and even to the bleachers of Fenway Park, “The Town” makes sure to leave no Boston landmark untouched. Though the unrelenting shots of Beantown can begin to feel a bit like a protracted Duck Tour, it’s clear that Affleck’s hometown is his muse. And this smartly-written thriller, which is heightened by the uniformly realistic and compelling performances of its strong cast, proves that Affleck is at his best when he knows what he’s talking about.
The town for which the movie is named is Charlestown, Mass., an infamous area just outside Boston in which bank robbery has become a kind of family trade, passed down from father to son. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a tough “townie” who falls in love with Claire (Rebecca Hall), who happens to be the hostage from his most recent bank robbery. When Doug’s best friend and partner Jim (Jeremy Renner) finds out he’s dating the one person who could give them away to the FBI agent hot on their tail (Jon Hamm), Doug is forced to make a decision. But when he tries to choose a life with Claire, he finds out that getting out of Charlestown and its twisted web of thieves is much harder than it seems.
In his directorial follow up to 2007’s “Gone Baby Gone,” Affleck proves that he can get exactly what he needs from his cast. Renner shines with a flawless delivery as the slightly unstable but loyal best friend, with an extremely convincing accent, biting wit, and a scowl seemingly tattooed on his face. Affleck offers a strong, consistent performance as well, sporting every conflicted emotion in his clenched jaw. Hamm gives as much depth to his bloodthirsty FBI agent as possible, making the most of his sarcastic comments and bitter staring matches with Affleck.
In addition to the strong male performances, Hall gives an equally conflicted and passionate performance. Where other actress may have let Claire fade in the presence of such strong male characters, Hall gives her character a strong wit and realistic intelligence, making up for what the character lacks in intuition. The only performance of almost no merit is that of Blake Lively as Doug’s former flame and Jim’s sister Krista. Her flat delivery and awful accent perhaps wouldn’t be so horrible if the other performances weren’t so strong. But in Affleck’s otherwise pragmatic and accessible setting, she sticks out like a fake, overly made-up sore thumb.
Though the advertisements for “The Town” strongly evoke Martin Scorcese’s 2005 Oscar-winner “The Departed,” one shouldn’t worry about sitting through a carbon copy. “The Town” is innovative and original, with stronger dialogue and a decidedly different story. In this film, the narrative is more closely tied to the thieves, rather than the officers. “The Town” also lacks the darkness of “The Departed,” both in lighting and in content: thieves are supposed to be bad, not the police department, but in this film many expectations are defied.
Affleck also directs some excellent action sequences. The anticipated high-speed car chases are much more intense in the narrow, brick backstreets of Brighton, where the walls close in from all sides. The thieves also pull off some ambitious heists, some of which include beloved Boston attractions. Though the film is long, it never loses its sense of tension during its action scenes showing the gang’s robberies, its explication of Claire and Doug’s potentially dangerous relationship, or its denouement as the FBI gets closer to breaking the case.
“The Town” is overflowing with smart dialogue, thrilling action, and Boston pride. Affleck creates a portal into the twisted world of the robbers of Beantown, making an otherwise frightening place new and exciting even to those who walk its streets every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Poet Allen Ginsberg’s beat generation anthem “Howl” has long been considered impossible to adapt as a film. For co-directors Rob Epstein and Jeffery Friedman, this was a welcome challenge.
Four years ago, Ginsberg’s estate approached Epstein and Friedman with the idea of making a documentary in conjunction with the poem’s 50th anniversary. The two acclaimed filmmakers have won multiple Oscars for their documentary work, which includes 1984’s “The Times of Harvey Milk.”
While they were immediately interested in the material, “We knew at the beginning that we wanted to do something that would be formally challenging, and adventurous, in a way that would resonate in the way that the poem [did],” Friedman says. As such, the duo decided not to make the film a “traditional documentary.”
“We wanted the film to play in the present tense, rather than do a historical documentary when you are starting from the point of older people looking back on themselves,” adds Epstein.
There was also a logistical reason why making a straight documentary would be difficult. “There was no material from that period,” Friedman says. “We would have had to create it anyway.”
The directors ended up creating a kind of hybrid; a film that is stylistically a documentary, but with content that is scripted and acted out. “Howl” is divided into four parts: an interview of Ginsberg (played with aplomb by James Franco), short dramatizations from Ginsberg’s life, animated sequences accompanying a reading of the poem, and recreations of the obscenity trial from 1957 that helped make the work famous.
“The flashbacks are in black and white, and the present tense is in color,” Epstein explains. “Metaphorically, the world transitions from black and white to color when ‘Howl’ is launched into the world and Allen finds his creative voice.”
To some, scenes from the courtroom in which the obscenity of the poem is debated might initially seem out of place when compared with the rest of the film. The directors, however, see it as an essential piece. “We had to set it in a period context, and that’s why the trial seemed like an important element to us, because the trial really helped to contextualize it,” says Epstein.
The film’s numerous animated sequences are another element that the directors feel was critical to fully capturing the “Howl” experience. “Animation, to us, seemed like a way to create a cinematic experience that you wouldn’t have in any other form” Epstein says. “We thought of animated films like ‘Fantasia,’ we looked at Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall,’ where it just takes you into a very trippy experience of somebody else’s mind.”
In the dramatizations, it was important to the directors to be as faithful as possible to Ginsberg’s real experience. “All of the flashback scenes were inspired by photos that Allen took or were taken of Allen,” Friedman says.
“Even within the movie there’s some real documentary evidence. On the set, the photos of his parents are Allen’s real parents,” adds Epstein.
Having an actor of James Franco’s caliber also helped the directors accomplish that level of realism. “People who were close to Allen came to the set and they just couldn’t believe [Franco’s performance]” Epstein recalls. “They were just stunned when they saw it. We were watching on the monitors and you could just see, they were like ‘that’s Allen.’”
Other actors became equally immersed in their roles. Mary Louise Parker, who plays a school teacher testifying in the obscenity trial, even out-researched the directors. “Mary Louise Parker found out that Gail Potter was a blonde. We had no idea,” Epstein remembers. “She insisted that she have a blonde wig.”
Despite the film’s historical accuracy, a question remains as to whether it will resonate with a younger generation. For Epstein and Friedman, this is the key to the film’s success. “Allen talks about prophecy in the movie, and in his life talked about how he intended ‘Howl’ to be a time bomb that would go off for different generations at different points,” says Epstein.  “I feel like we’re at one of those points right now.”

“Welcome to the land of the unfortunate and the deserted,” intones a character in the newest collection of fiction from rising literary star Yiyun Li. This melancholy statement serves as an apt introduction to the nine perfectly-realized worlds in “Gold Boy, Emerald Girl.” Alongside her tales of the miserable and despondent, however, Li’s enchanting prose also nurtures a distinctly more uplifting message. Ultimately, “Gold Boy, Emerald Girl” thrives on a constantly pulsing, energetic undercurrent: a triumphant depiction of the power of interpersonal connection.
“Gold Boy, Emerald Girl” is Li’s second collection of short stories and follows her critically-acclaimed novel, “The Vagrants.” These earlier works have garnered an impressive roster of awards, including The Paris Review’s Plimpton Prize and the Frank O’Connor International Short Story Award. Recently named one of “20 Under 40” top writers by The New Yorker, Li has been drawing considerable attention as a vivacious new talent.
Regardless of her status as a relative newcomer to the literary world, Li’s fiction embodies a mature, fully developed richness. This quality lends to each story the property of flawlessly immersing a reader into an alternate universe. Nowhere is this power more palpable than in the collection’s briefest and most penetrating tale, “Souvenir.” This story incorporates the emotional substance of a lengthy novel into mere pages, masterfully chronicling the narrative of a man’s fruitless pursuit of an unnamed young girl and her devastatingly hopeless love for another. The tale comes to a crescendo with the girl’s unforgettable speculation: “[s]he wondered how much they understood love, and love despite the fatality of humankind.”
Similarly somber, emotionally wrought circumstances reappear in each of the worlds that Li creates within “Gold Boy, Emerald Girl.” The narratives are littered with heartbreaking moments; in the novella “Kindness,” a father presumes to apologize to his adoptive daughter for a lifetime of shortcomings. Li’s characters are overwhelmingly lonely, often faced with the dilemma of whether to open their hearts to another or to resign themselves to the safety of isolation and reticence.
Nevertheless, the beauty of human connection permeates, and ultimately dominates, the text. Sometimes, this uplifting theme radiates from nondescript corners; in “Kindness,” it’s the associations that Moyan forms with other women that serve to shift her to a less-pessimistic worldview by the novella’s end. In other stories, human connection is the centerpiece, as in the deep and unexpected bond that develops between two men in “A Man Like Him.” (In describing this nascent connection, the protagonist delivers one of the work’s rare but charming moments of humor, stating: “[h]e imagined that a friendship between two men should start over harsh liquor and variety meats.”) In “Prison,” a woman who has lost her child tentatively develops a bond with another woman whom she has hired as a surrogate mother.
Thus, no matter how harrowing the circumstances, Li finds a way to elevate human connection to the forefront of narratives littered with heartbreaking tales of loss and solitude. Despite this remarkable achievement, the collection does veer slightly toward the melodramatic. Li’s plotlines are a relentless revolving door of tragic fates, crippling loneliness, and innumerable deaths. The reader occasionally becomes desensitized to yet another heartrending demise of a spouse or an additional relative succumbing to debilitating illness. Nevertheless, the collection’s emphasis of the beauty surrounding the pains and tribulations of existence offsets this numbing quality.
Alongside these universal themes, “Gold Boy, Emerald Girl” also explores the culture of its setting, Li’s native country of China. Chinese culture saturates every aspect of the work, including Li’s use of figurative language: in “Kindness,” Moyan describes “a quilt and a blanket, both dark green, folded as though they were sharply cut tofu.” The depiction of Chinese culture extends to direct historical references describing political oppression and life in the Chinese army, and is particularly prevalent in describing gender relationships and the culture of organized matchmaking. More than a mere establishment of setting, Li’s cultural exploration is one’s of the book’s central thematic components as she investigates the interface between new and old cultures in her home country.
Ultimately, Li’s artful prose and her portrayal of human connection infuse the collection with optimism and a unique beauty. Each story plunges the reader fully into a world in miniature, allowing for complete emotional immersion. Succinctly conjuring personal histories and emotional ranges for her characters, Li ensures that her poignant depictions of loss, loneliness, love, and transforming cultures achieve a commanding emotional resonance.

This winter, the Pudding gets a new flavor with the taste of the Orient. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ (HPT) 163rd production—which opens February 4, 2011—will spice up the lives of its audience members by taking them on an Indian adventure complete with forbidden love, brutal murder, and cosmic redemption. In the show, titled “Kashmir If You Can,” this irreverent story of colonial India and some of the country’s rather eccentric inhabitants comes alive.
Taking on their first HPT script together is the ambitious writing duo Gus T. Hickey ’11 and David J. (“DJ”) Smolinsky ’11. When their show opens in the New College Theatre, the stage will be graced by an exaggerated array of characters including Pooch Yermoneywhereyourmouthis—a Slumdog Millionaire who is in fact an actual dog and a real millionaire to boot—who forbids the love between the steamy and attractive Arabian slave boy Kareem Inyourpants and the beautiful yet innocent Sari M. Notsari.
They will be joined onstage by Marta Luff, a Swedish milk maid, who is the only person in India pure enough to tend to the country’s holy cows. “She is well endowed, if you know what I mean, but there is more to love than just that,” Hickey jokes of his Scandinavian creation.
Despite the lust factor with Marta, the plot still focuses on nobler themes. “It’s a story of true love prevailing, like any fairy tale. Plus there is some jazz music and rock songs,” Smolinsky says.
The music extends way beyond the jazz and rock, however, as the co-writers point to Indian culture’s wide gambit of musical elements. Combining jazz and rock with Indian and Bollywood music means a fusion of activity and energy. “The music has a real Indian taste to it. Like paprika and curry,” Smolinsky says.
Both writers feel that since gaining their position, their humor has been scrutinized by everyone they meet. “I always have to deliver my A-material now,” Smolinsky says. “I have to be funny all the time.”
“People are always judging me if I don’t say something which makes them laugh,” Hickey adds.
This pressure might be getting to the writers. “There are no real jokes in this year’s show,” Hickey teases. “We’ve gone for a period piece, a period drama.” Smolinsky laughingly agrees, “It’s going to be a marathon in two parts.”
Although they joke about their lack of humor, the pair have a strong working relationship. “We have a very different sense of humor,” Hickey says. “But instead of being that friend who would let me throw grain alcohol down my throat, DJ would be the one to take me to AA.”
“We are both really eager and end up acting out voices or even the scenes and songs,” Smolinsky adds.
With this new writing team also comes a very fresh-faced cast, especially due to the fact that freshmen are stepping into four of the 12 roles. “We are lucky with the cast,” Smolinsky says. “The Hasty Pudding has a continuous cycle and people often get to know the organization really well, returning year on year. Now we can introduce new people to the traditions of the group.”
Jonathan K. Stevens ’14 is one such freshman who is eager to throw himself into the 40-show Pudding marathon which begins in Cambridge and later heads to New York and Bermuda. Stevens’s character, Vishnu Werehere, will require the enthusiastic actor to take on the form of a Hindu God who sits upon a mountaintop playing the harmonica. “It’s going to be so cool being painted blue every night,” Stevens says. “Also, the schedule will give me a taste of what it is like to act professionally.”
Stevens will be joined by eight other actors who have never before performed with the HPT, but Hickey and Smolinsky are not worried about these new additions. “These guys performed their audition pieces in ways we had never considered,” Smolinsky says. “Gus and I can alter a character to fit the person taking the role.”
Now that they have a cast to work with, the pair are going into writing overload, collaborating with the Pudding’s professional director Tony Parise to achieve the highest possible standard. “The Pudding is all I can think about at the moment,” Hickey admits.
“It’s getting stressful,” Smolinsky says. “But the show is going to be awesome.”
Reflecting on what “Kashmir If You Can” will bring to audiences, Hickey says, “They will leave with 9,000 gallons of smiles to last them a lifetime.”
“And their dignity,” Smolinsky adds. “I hope.”

A single story, a single poem, a single song: the individual work of art has the undeniable power of unity, the power to stun by its clarity of vision. I am moved by that power. At times I have listened to the same song on repeat for days, transcribed a poem and taped it above my desk, kept a novel on my nightstand as if its mere presence could quiet my sleep. There are songs that make us sing to ourselves before we even realize we’re singing, poems that make us repeat their words in whispers when our minds are only idly wandering.
But it is not the power of the individual work of art that most moves me; no single story or poem made me an English major, and no single work of art made me an art lover. I have found art’s greatest power not in any one work’s euphony but rather in the dissonance generated when many works of art clash, when multiple artistic visions of human experience—each convincing from its own perspective—are thrown together, set loose to wrestle with one another. Then monologue becomes conversation, and I am challenged not only to appreciate diversity of vision but to try—if I dare—to make sense of that diversity, to build bridges between superficially disparate worldviews, to figure out what common sentiment animates the art that moves me. I love art because I love making connections.
The other day I found one of those unexpected connections in the most unlikely of places. Working my ponderous way through Pseudo-Dionysius’s mystical treatise on the “Divine Names” for class, I noticed that the translator made not only helpful distillations of sometimes mind-numbing theological principles in the margins; he also took it upon himself to cite apparently relevant Romantic poetry. I can make no informed speculation about the connection between sixth-century mystical theology and nineteenth-century Romantic poetry, but there it was, as my translator had set it out: Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “After-Thought”—not a particularly well-known poem of his—quoted in the margins of my copy of “Divine Names.”
By then I was tired enough of theology to hope for respite in poetry, so I pulled up “After-Thought” on Google and read it through. The force of unexpected, edifying connection immediately overwhelmed me. My translator’s obscure connection made all I’d been reading at last make sense. There in Tennyson was Psuedo-Dionysius’s “Via Negativa,” the negative approach to God through emphasizing God’s ultimate inscrutability. Dionysius’s is a mysterious God, and Tennyson’s is a mysterious hope—but neither is any less forceful for being shrouded in mystery.
Tennyson’s sonnet, written more than a thousand years after Dionysius’s theology, was animated by the same spirit; once again art proved to me the consistent depth of human experience across boundaries of culture and time. Much as Dionysius speaks of a God who transcends all names, Tennyson speaks of a hope that transcends death: “And if, as toward the silent tomb we go, / Through love, through hope, and faith’s transcendent dower, / We feel that we are greater than we know.”
It’s an idea I still need to work through, but it’s also one I would never have understood at all were it not for the elegance of art that makes connections, art that prompts me to see unity undergirding diversity. Far from reducing all art to one monotonous note, I feel the pulsing unified rhythm animating each distinct work, giving each unique voice its timbre.
Over the past couple days, Tennyson’s poem has become one of those voices that captivates me, working its way calmly under my skin. I love the conversation; but the conversation is, after all, only a multiplication of many single voices. And it is Tennyson’s lone voice I thank for his beautiful poem, for the words I’ll be whispering to myself before I even realize I’m speaking: “We feel that we are greater than we know.”

Professor Andrew G. Clark had a busy weekend. The new Director of Choral Activities was tasked with leading more than 100 students from the Harvard Glee Club and Radcliffe Choral Society on a weekend retreat. This retreat was no spa getaway—rather, it included hours of focused rehearsal and spirited community-building.
Last spring, Harvard University announced that Clark would replace Dr. Jameson Marvin as Director. “It is very intimidating,” Clark says of the legacy Marvin left after conducting for three decades at Harvard. “His shoes are impossibly large to fill.” Clark, however, plans to expand Harvard’s rich choral culture into an ambitious scholarly enterprise.
Clark’s post as Choral Director (who oversees the Holden Voice Program and the Holden Choirs: the Glee Club, the Radcliffe Choral Society, the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus, and directs the former three) is actually his second stint at Harvard. After completing graduate work at Carnegie Mellon University, Clark started as Assistant Conductor of the Collegium Musicum under Marvin in 2001. “I learned a lot from Dr. Marvin about the mechanics of how to run a choral program. I was counting my lucky stars all summer that I had that time to work with him,” Clark says.
Returning to Harvard after seven years at Tufts, Clark will split his time between the Holden Choirs and music department classes. Elizabeth Craft, the teaching fellow for Clark’s Music 121a: “Choral Conducting” course, remarks that Clark’s friendly energy creates a comfortable environment for his students. He often shares his own experiences with them. “Students love to sing for him,” adds Kevin Leong, Associate Conductor of the Holden Choirs. Clark plans to incorporate features of music department curricula into his concerts: “A lot of our programs will interface with music department courses, as a way to partner with my colleagues and give students a chance to see this music up close.” Clark has enjoyed the freedom and license granted to him by the music department, which has allowed him to explore his topics of interest, primarily in the lecture hall. “The department has been great—­they’ve made me feel like I’m part of the team,” he says.
As director of the Holden Choirs, Clark has so far planned a rigorous schedule of concert tours, including trips to Austria and Germany for the Collegium Musicum, concerts in southern California for the Radcliffe Choral Society, and a trek through the American Midwest for the Glee Club.
Clark is also devising bold artistic ventures for the upcoming year. The choral season will culminate at the spring Arts First festival, when the three Holden Choirs will join the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra for a program comprising Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and the Boston premiere of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “On the Transmigration of Souls,” composed by American John C. Adams ’69. This collaboration usually takes place biannually. Clark says, “It’s something I’d like to do more often and I’m really looking forward to having Federico [Cortese, Director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra] as a teammate and artistic partner.”
Additionally, Clark hopes to expand the choirs’ historical and scholarly output by performing and endorsing rarely-heard twentieth-century American choral works—what he calls an “artistic treasure hunt” in search of forgotten gems. He wants to document and disseminate these works with new recordings and score editions. However, Clark still intends to continue the Marvin tradition of programming significant, canonical works. “One of my responsibilities is to introduce students to great works of art,” he says, referring to pieces by Beethoven and Brahms. As a long-term goal, Clark intends to raise the choral program’s esteem to even greater heights by producing a Harvard series of recordings or even founding an in-house record label. A recording and publishing setup would grant Clark the ability to make Harvard’s “enormous treasury of archival recordings” available worldwide, either digitally or in CD format.
Clark acknowledges that he has been given free reign to shape the future of Harvard’s choral program, and he is ever grateful to the mentorship of Marvin and the dedicated student groups he now leads. “[The choirs] have demonstrated that musicians don’t have to choose between talent and community.” He continues, “The students have been extremely generous and thoughtful as this transition moves along. I’m having a lot of fun, and everyone is allowing me to be myself.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 22, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 21 arts article "Clark Foresees Noteworthy Year Year Ahead" incorrectly stated that the Harvard Radcliffe Collegium Musicum is planning  to go on tour to Israel and Egypt.

September 24 - October 2, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Julianne I. Ross ’11
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12
Many children have imaginary friends. But not many children are like four-year-old Lucy, whose strangely inconsistent, cocaine-addicted unreal pal is the titular character of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s first production of the semester, “Mr. Marmalade.”
Lucy is a victim of modern childhood, almost always left alone while her single mother is working long hours. As a result, she develops a strange dependence on her imagined and immoral businessman Mr. Marmalade, who is closely tied to the dark adult issues she faces in the real world. But that relationship is altered when five-year-old Larry becomes her first real friend and she begins to grow into a more normal childhood.
“It’s the idea that she’s bringing all this baggage from her real world into her fantasy world, which is so sad because the place that is supposed to be this sort of free space for a girl and her imagination has become tainted by real life,” director Julianne I. Ross ’11 says.
The play, written less than a decade ago by Noah Haidle, takes a direct yet imaginative look at the psychology of growing up today, embodied in how Lucy deals with loneliness, the influence of the media, false idols, and unsatisfied needs.
“It’s so very immediate to what’s going on in the world right now,” producer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 says. “A lot of theater I’ve done at Harvard is thought-provoking and about real issues, but they are veiled in symbolism and metaphor. This play really takes these issues and puts them right in your face.”
Yet despite the difficulties of Lucy’s situation, the cast and crew say the show is an uproariously clever and irreverent portrait of coping with childhood issues.
“Every other line is laugh-out-loud funny,” Ross says. “It’s definitely just a really funny play that happens to be really dark.”
Ultimately, “Mr. Marmalade” uses sometimes-disturbing, sometimes-hilarious fantasy to comment on very real contemporary struggles.
Vanessa B. Koo ’12—who plays Lucy—adds, “We get to see the peculiarities of what happens when someone with such a vivid imagination just expresses her frustration, but I see a lot of what she grapples with as common difficulties.”

Fatih Akin’s new movie “Soul Kitchen” is delicious, in both the literal and metaphorical sense of the word. The movie centers around the many changes and complications which Zinos encounters as the owner of a simple family restaurant. Akin puts viewers through a journey that is tough, hilarious, and ultimately rewarding, in a melange that American comedy rarely manages to achieve.
“Soul Kitchen” is distinctly rich in its cultural nuances and combinations—it is a film about Greeks living in Hamburg, and the emotional consequences that result when the German girlfriend of the Greek protagonist goes to work in Shanghai. The cultural blend is key and is carried throughout, even in the soundtrack, which mixes traditional Turkish music with postmodern German industrial beats.
Born into a Turkish family in Hamburg, Akin portrays the world of immigrants with a personal tone. The challenges a Turkish immigrant faces in Germany are similar to those a Greek immigrant might face, so Akin could avoid resorting to stereotypes. He co-wrote “Soul Kitchen” with one of his best friends, star Adam Bousdoukos (Zinos), the son of Greek parents in Hamburg. In this film you aren’t being fed clichés, but rather the organic, real stuff. As Akin and Bousdoukos reveal their own particular experience, the result is something that any child of an immigrant family can especially relate to, as well as a piece that can provide insight to those who are not.
“Soul Kitchen” is also remarkable for its humor and humanity. It is as down to earth as a film can get, showing the real problems of real people, in all their remarkable strengths and unpredictable weaknesses. It also retains a delicate, precise, and biting sense of irony that people who face significant struggles often develop, as a coping mechanism, I suspect. In “Soul Kitchen” everything constantly goes awry: not the small embarrassing minutiae, but life-changing events. Many mainstream American comedies focus on a string of unfortunate events that usually involve looking stupid in front of others (think of the slight, albeit hilarious antics of Gaylord Focker in “Meet the Parents”). The stakes are not as high as when a character’s whole life starts falling apart right before your eyes—but then neither are the rewards or your emotional investment in the character.
Akin made use of the city itself, rather than a set, while filming “Soul Kitchen,” creating a unique cinematic experience. The American standard of living is often higher, hence the setting of American movies generally follow suit. The settings of foreign films often offer a different environment, giving audiences a different kind of humor. I have noticed that seeing an ordinary person who keeps facing real-life problems and somehow fighting them, creates an effect that is actually life-affirming, more so than seeing dramas unfold in Hollywood mansions, prosperous suburbs, or Upper East Side apartments. When watching Pedro Almodóvar films, for example—often set in the slums of Madrid and most of which contain death, rape, and disease all in one movie—you might cringe a couple of times, but the take away message isn’t meant to be entirely disheartening but ultimately uplifting. In each of his movies Almodóvar shows that no matter how many tragic things happen, life always goes on and is essentially a sumptuous joy, filled with irony, comedy, love, and sex. “Soul Kitchen” is satisfying in a similar way.
But the food of “Soul Kitchen” should not be overlooked. While the dishes you see may make you hungry, they also become a source of comfort and grounding. The film points out the distinction between food that is made just to be eaten, and food that is made as a form of art to be admired and enjoyed. In one funny scene a chef shows the difference between an eight euro dish and 45 euro one—and it’s all in the presentation. The food plays a vital role in a film which constantly brings us back to what is important—eating well, having a job, taking risks and finding love. And in the case of “Soul Kitchen,” food is, of course, the key to doing all four.

Cars and pedestrians may still dominate the hectic streets of Harvard Square, but it’s the bicycle that will have the right of way at the Boston Bicycle Film Festival (BFF). The festival, which will run from September 23-25 in Cambridge and the Boston area. The festival will showcase dozens of short films and include an exhibition of hand-built bicycles.
This local event, now in its third year, is part of an international network of festivals founded by Brendt Barbur. According to festival lore, Barbur came up with the idea after being hit by a bus while riding his bicycle in New York City.
What began as a one night event at the Anthology Film Archives in New York City has now entered its tenth year and expanded to 39 cities around the world.
With a burgeoning popularity amongst cyclists and non-riders alike, the celebration will now span three days with various exhibitions, film screenings, and afterparties.
While the line-up of films to be screened is similar across cities, each festival also takes on a unique local flavor.
“The supplementary cultural events are site-specific and reflective of the local community,” says the festival’s co-producer Jamie Renee Smith ’08-’10.
For example, kicking off the festival will be a gallery opening and reception at the Boston Area Handbuilt Bicycle Exhibition, which will feature an exhibition custom-made bicycle frames by 11 local craftsmen alongside other forms of visual art and live music.
With Boston’s long history of custom handmade bicycles dating back to the turn of the twentieth century, Joshua H. Kampa, who is returning for his second year as producer, explains that the exhibition celebrates the revival of the bicycle as both a tool and an art form.
“Handbuilt bicycles are really just functional sculpture,” Kampa says.
The films, which will be screened in Harvard Square’s Brattle Theatre, are diverse in origin and subject matter. They range from a Spike Jonze-produced documentary on BMX legend Mat Hoffman to a Japanese art film featuring bike parts in a Rube Goldberg machine. Local artists are also represented in the BFF with, among others, the work of Massachusetts-based director Lucas Brunelle.
In “Line of Sight,” a documentary that will be screened at this year’s festival, Brunelle has collaborated with director Benny Zenga to make a film about Brunelle himself. Dozens of other short films and documentaries round out the line-up, and many of them are exclusive to this year’s BFF.
Kampa remarks that the variety of films that will be represented in the event reflects the diversity of cyclists who reside in the city.
“The Boston bike community is substantial but fragmented,” he says. “The festival is a common meeting point for all the different subcultures: road and cycling racers, mountain bikers, hipsters and their fixed gear bikes, BMX riders, commuters.”
Both Kampa and Smith note that Boston’s relatively small size already promotes interaction between cyclists because they tend to see the same people over and over again.
“When I’m biking and I see another cyclist, I’ll wave,” Kampa says, “which people don’t do when driving cars.”
In a city such as Boston where the subway stops running at midnight and parking is difficult to find, bikes are often the environmentally-friendly and practical choice as well.
Indeed, the producers hope that the festival will even reach out to those who do not already own a bike.
They point to the festival in Milan, which draws national funding and thousands of participants annually. As the second largest cultural festival of any kind in the city, its success reflects the surging popularity of bicycles.
“It really speaks to the cultural reach this festival can have beyond cycling groups,” Smith says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon returning to campus, the observant among us have likely noticed the Busch-Reisinger Museum’s sudden disappearance from the Prescott Street skyline. Some may just have grumbled as they were funneled into the pedestrian walkway on their way down Quincy Street. Others see the renovation of Harvard Art Museums—encompassing the Busch-Reisinger Museum, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, and the Fogg Art Museum—as a refreshing change of scenery. “Temporarily removing much of the uppermost part of the Fogg admits far more light into the [Visual and Environmental Studies (VES)] studios,” says VES Professor John R. Stilgoe.
Though spoken in jest, Stilgoe’s response typifies much of the Harvard community’s attitude towards its art museums. They are appreciated as familiar features of the landscape, and for the light they shed on our chosen fields of study, but otherwise largely overlooked. “I think students who have taken History of Art and Architecture (HAA) classes or who have spent time at the museum absolutely appreciate it,” says Alexandra Perloff-Giles ’11, President of the Harvard Art Museum Undergraduate Connection (HAMUC) and a former Crimson arts columnist. “But I think there are many students who don’t know what an amazing resource we have.”
Far more than a physical reorganization, the renovation now in progress aims to combat the lack of recognition identified by Perloff-Giles, along with museum administrators past and present. While many Harvard classes incorporate a token art-viewing ‘field trip’ into their schedules, the museum’s potential as an interdisciplinary resource remains largely untapped. The renovation currently underway looks to reposition Harvard’s art collections within the landscape of the university and within the greater public community—to allow its diverse holdings to illuminate other areas of study, and not just the adjacent buildings.
A SECOND LOOK
Since construction began in 2008, the famed Fogg Art Museum—historically seen as the heart of the HAM complex—has been closed to visitors. Though the Sackler Museum showcases a selection of important works throughout the renovation in an ongoing exhibition entitled “Review,” only this year’s seniors have enjoyed full access to the active Fogg and Busch-Reisinger buildings during their time at Harvard. This inaccessibility may account for the relatively low profile among students of Harvard’s world renowned art collection, the sixth largest in the United States.
Founded in 1895, the Fogg was the first of the Harvard museums. The collection moved from its original location—now the site of Canaday Hall—to the Quincy Street site in 1927. Over the following eighty years, seven additions were built onto and around the Quincy site, including the Fine Arts Library, Werner Otto Hall—formerly home to the Busch-Reisinger Collection—and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The scattering of new additions made for an increasingly fragmented viewing experience. The collections were rigidly divided along cultural lines—the Sackler holding Asian, the Busch-Reisinger Germanic, and the Fogg predominantly Western art—while the rambling layout impeded easy circulation and study.
Excluding the Sackler, all such later additions have now been demolished with an eye to consolidating their holdings in a sizeable new wing on the back of the Fogg. According to Thomas W. Lentz, Director of HAM, one of the project’s primary objectives is to fuse the disparate collections together within one functional, streamlined space. “Our goal is to consolidate them on one site, under one roof, as one destination,” Lentz says. “What we like about this idea is that it allows us to have a much greater dialogue between those three collections.”
PURE AND SIMPLE
In order to draw the attention of passers-by, HAM has enlisted internationally-renowned architect Renzo Piano and local design group Payette associates to craft a museum fit for the twenty-first century. Still, according to HAM’s Director of Facilities and Capital Planning Peter J. Atkinson, “there aren’t a lot of bells and whistles. It’ll be simple in many ways.” The choice of simplicity is both an aesthetic and strategic decision. “[Renzo’s] architecture doesn’t dominate the art,” Atkinson says. “[He] quietly has built buildings that are spectacular.”
Both Atkinson and Lentz stressed that though the museum’s design will be cutting-edge, functionality and navigability are its main priorities. Atkinson anticipates a finished product that maximizes natural light and takes the Fogg’s surroundings into consideration; “Renzo Piano is giving us a rationalized, transparent and flexible building, ” Lentz says. Architectural flourishes and attention-grabbers may be unnecessary, given the museum’s advantageous location within the University. “We actually fit right in middle of a visual arts cortex, right in between the Graduate School of Design and the Carpenter Center, right on the edge of Harvard yard,” Lentz says. “We [are] very well positioned as a kind of hub and connector.”
The building’s stylish yet functional aesthetic will be achieved through environmentally sustainable construction techniques. The project is angling for a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), the second highest rating on their scale. Over the course of two years spent emptying the Fogg’s galleries and offices, HAM reached out to two dozen local organizations that claimed and reused 30 tons of material—from office furniture to exhibit cases, from easels to teak flooring.
CLIMATE CHANGE
HAM decided not to aim for USGBC’s highest rating in order to maintain an art-friendly climate around the clock. Atkinson concedes that this pursuit inevitably requires high energy expenditures, but it serves an important purpose. “We always say, ‘The art never goes home’,” he says. “While most people live in a building during the day or they live there at night, the art is in the building 24/7. And that’s why we’re using a lot of energy: we’re building for the art and we want it to feel comfy all day long.”
High standards in climate control are vital to HAM’s position in the artistic community. Opened in 1927, the original Fogg lacked even the most basic technologies necessary to safely house and preserve works of art. As researchers discovered the detrimental effects of certain temperatures and levels of humidity on works of art, unequipped museums like the Fogg lost the ability to borrow works from other institutions. This meant that temporary exhibitions were far less frequent—an unfortunate development in light of the fact that the museum had previously secured the work of William Blake in 1920, Fra Angelico in 1930, and Paul Gaugin in 1936. For two weeks in 1941, Pablo Picasso’s famed “Guernica” hung in the Fogg’s Warburg Hall; as a point of pride, the hook on which it hung was symbolically in the wall until the museum was dismantled. With a new facility that meets modern standards of art conservation, HAM may again borrow pieces of similar magnitude for display and study.
WEATHERING THE STORM
Even though current economic conditions pose a challenge to funding, HAM has garnered enough financial support to preserve the integrity of the original plans for renovation. While the cost of the new museum was previously projected at $350 million, the renovation is fortunately the only building project currently underway at Harvard. According to Lentz, HAM has raised between 81 and 82 percent of the target amount, largely thanks to a strong belief among donors and university administrators that renovation is imperative. “The financial downturn has not helped,” Lentz says. “But I think when you have a good plan, when you have a real need and you can articulate that effectively, I think people want to be a part of it.”
Similarly, Eugene Y. Wang, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Professor of Asian Art in the HAA department, believes that caring for the museum and its collections is a worthwhile investment at any cost. “When people come to visit Harvard, the art museum is where almost all people make a stop,” he says. “[It] is the highlight of the campus, so… financial difficulties shouldn’t hold this back.”
When a large-scale renovation was first conceived in 1956, disagreements between the museum and the university over budget delayed the project’s implementation. “The [Harvard]Corporation did not have a vision for the museums, and the museum people had a vision,” says HAA Professor John M. Rosenfield, who served as Curator of Oriental Art at the Fogg from 1964 to 1991 and Acting Director of the museums from 1982 to 1985. For reasons Rosenfield did not detail, the university was unable to allocate the funds that museum officials required to carry out the necessary transformation. However, Rosenfield expresses optimism about the collaboration between today’s HAM and the current university administrators, who seem far more supportive.  “In my years in the operations of the museum I always felt that… the museum’s development and the plans of the corporation were not closely coordinated,” says Rosenfield. “But… in recent years, the coordination seems to have become more advanced.”
REDRAWING BOUNDARIES
Fifty years after these initial squabbles, HAM can begin to realize its vision. However, due to constantly evolving notions regarding how museums should function, the new plans differ significantly from the originals. Though the Fogg’s brick façade has been carefully preserved, in the future it will encompass a interior space that differs dramatically from the original in both architectural and conceptual ways.
The museum’s original central courtyard and the basic layout of galleries will remain, but visitor circulation and arrangement of research spaces will be significantly re-orchestrated. The new wing on Prescott Street, which will house the Busch-Reisinger and Sackler collections, will finally consolidate all the collections.
The long-anticipated integration of the museum’s culturally diverse holdings comes in response to modern conceptions about the study and practice of art history.  “Our notion of art history is changing,” says Professor Wang. “We are thinking of art objects in a more global context. I want to see this global sense being emphasized, in a space that will make it easier to cross [over] from different parts of the world.”
Lentz anticipates that the museum’s physical reorganization will spark a conceptual reconsideration in visitors. “In the past, the way we were physically configured, we weren’t able to make the historical and visual linkages we wanted to make between those three collections,” he says. The renovators hope that within a spatially integrated setting, viewers will more easily identify the continuity between the many traditions, cultures, and eras represented in the collections.
VISUAL AID
The new museum also hopes to emphasize community outreach. The arena of engagement with the broader public is a relatively new one for HAM, which has traditionally given academic pursuits priority. “There was outreach, but that was never the main purpose,” says Rosenthal of his time at the museum. “The main purpose was to promote scholarship.” Previously, the enormous amount of space allocated to the university left little room for the public, and practical considerations thwarted attempts at community outreach before they began. “It’s difficult to have a broad public outreach program if there’s nowhere to park the buses,” Rosenthal says.
However, the museum’s decision to hire a full-time educational staff signals a shift in values, and the new building’s design will take these into consideration. “The spaces will be bigger—more art to be seen, more connections to be made,” says Ray Williams, HAM’s first Director of Education. With innovative educational facilities, such as the study rooms, the museum staff can turn to previously unaddressed questions. “What educators think about is ‘Who could these collections matter for?’ ‘How can we spread the word?’” Williams says.
In the past year, Harvard museums have worked with over 4,000 public school students and 7,000 university students in the Boston area. They have also brought students from Harvard Medical School into galleries for workshops on self-care, and placed an emphasis on reaching out to the local Brazilian community.
E PLURIBUS UNUM
Though display space will be dramatically reconfigured, Lentz estimates that the design team has spent more time laying out non-public space for study and research than on gallery floor plans. “What we want above all is a highly functional building that allows for high-level research,” says Lentz. “Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is reposition the art museum within Harvard’s mission statement, having in place a physical model that allows students and faculty to work collaboratively.”
In keeping with these goals, the new building will allocate over 5,000 square feet of space for temporary and curricular use. Harvard’s Strauss Center for Conservation, the first art conservation lab in the United States, will be relocated to the top floor of the new building while a complex of study centers will occupy the floor below. Through the study centers, Harvard affiliates and other community members can request supervised access to pieces not on display in the museum. The centers are part of a larger effort to make works of art more accessible. “We want to put the collection to work for all students and all faculty, and the community,” says Lentz, “not simply for the specialists we always have had and always will train.”
HAM’s educational division has continued to facilitate and encourage use of original art objects as a medium for instruction within the university. Historically, the museum and the HAA department were very closely related, to the extent that most faculty members also served as curators. “The museum and the department of art history were in one building and very much imbricated into one another,” says Henri Zerner, a professor in the HAA department since 1972. “The office of the director and the office of the department chair were not only adjacent, but they had a door in between and they also had a bathroom that they shared. This is symbolically very important because it meant that the faculty and the institution were... communicating on a daily basis.”
Though HAM will continue its commitment to supporting scholarship in HAA, it also hopes to work with faculty across a broad range of disciplines in the coming years. The HAA department office complex, currently located in the Sackler, will not move back into the Fogg upon the building’s completion. Instead, the museum will act as an autonomous and central entity at the disposal of students in all concentrations.
While students acknowledge the unfortunate inaccessibility of the museums, there is a widespread agreement that renovation is necessary. Aside from a single teaching gallery on the fouth floor of the Sackler, and a few niches with rotating artworks, temporary exhibitions have been put on hold. However, in the fall of 2011 the Sackler will house a show entitled “Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe,” while groups like HAMUC help to maintain the connection between students and the art still available to them. Perloff-Giles maintains that the long-term benefits outweigh the temporary loss. “When Renzo Piano surveyed the grounds, he said the Sackler didn’t look like a museum,” she says. “The new Fogg will definitely look like a museum.”
In the end, Perloff-Giles adds, even the simple fact of renovation will help to attract attention to the museum. “If our goal... is to increase visibility, the new building will start to do that just with its physical presence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most tracks on Weezer’s latest album “Hurley” encapsulate the temperament of Hurley from the series “Lost”—pictured on the cover—who famously stays upbeat and easy going even while stranded on a mysterious island. Weezer have always shared Hurley’s attitude, and in the past, this manifested itself in the perfect combination of energetic guitar melodies, contented, mellow vocals, and steady drumming with speckles of clash. With the release of  “Hurley,” the alternative punk-rock giants once again deliver a collection of successful, mosh-worthy songs charged with energy; however, much of the lyrics come off cheesy and unimaginative, and are unfortunately cluttered with clichés.
“Hurley” starts with “Memories,” which is reminiscent in all the best ways of their 2005 song “Beverley Hills.” The serene string introduction is immediately followed by the bass-powered tempo of classic Weezer rock, which instantly compels quality head-banging. Crescendos of toms and bass and banters between vocals and short guitar riffs through the track lend it fresh bursts of energy. This driving energy extends to “Ruling Me” and “Trainwrecks,” which is certainly no disaster. Softer and slower numbers like “Unspoken,” “Brave New World,” and “I Want to Be Something” contrast with the upbeat tempo of the rest of the album, allowing listeners to recover from severe energy expenditure, as well as giving depth to the album.
“Trainwrecks” is the gleaming gem of the record, capturing the essence of living the Weezer life through creative, well-formulated lyrics. Cumos sings, “We’re digging through the couch for cash / we’re taking cabs cause both our cars are trashed / but we’re still kicking ass / we are trainwrecks.” On the contrary, songs like “I Want to Be Something” and “Represent” demonstrate the band’s new maturity, discussing complex emotions. Weezer’s growth shows in the lyrics of “Represent:” “it matters how you play the game / it matters that you can take the pain / you don’t want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top.”
However, the literary precision doesn’t translate to most of the other tracks, whose lyrics are placid and obvious. Weezer dedicate an entire song to the hackneyed concept “time flies when you’re having fun” in “Time Flies.” The multitude of songs about girls and falling in and out of love become tiresome after the fourth track of much of the same, “Smart Girls.” Although Rivers Cuomo sings “there’s so much I want to say about you,” in “Run Away,” he isn’t very successful in coming up with new ways to say these things.
Despite their lyrical weakness, Weezer demonstrates skill in navigating of all corners of rock in “Hurley”, from polished happy-go-lucky pop-rock in “Ruling Me” to bass-driven risqué tension in “Where’s My Sex;” returning to the coarse garage-band roots of “Time Flies” and purity of acoustic melodies in “I Want to be Something.” On top of everything else, “Hurley” also includes a cover of Coldplay’s megahit “Viva la Vida.” It’s always comforting to know that if Coldplay retires, Weezer can fill in, and then some.
Adding to the strength of the music, Weezer utilizes a varied instrumentation, from acoustic guitar, flute and piano to synthesized operatic vocals and techno interludes. Within each song in “Hurley”, Weezer sews together these starkly different forms to create eccentric combinations and pleasantly shock its fans. In “All My Friends Are Insects,” listeners are jerked from the emotional, heartfelt acoustic piano introduction to the seedy drum solo, over which Cuomo revels in a cheerful, quirky discussion of earthworms, butterflies and dragonflies, as he describes, “They are my friends and yeah / they’re all insects.”
With a steady career spanning two decades, Weezer has accumulated a solid base of loyal fans that will enjoy “Hurley” in all its “Hakuna Matata.”  Although a lot of the lyrics are shallow and uninventive, rock cravings will be satisfied by the energetic guitar riffs and upbeat rhythms of classic Weezer with the novel pairings of genres and new instrumentations offered in “Hurley.”

The ancient Athenians, though mighty, were doomed to destruction and ruin—and by the sounds of their latest album, “False Priest,” it’s happened to modern-day Athenians (of Athens, Ga.) Of Montreal. In previous albums, what stood out was Of Montreal’s utter wackiness, their fearlessness, and their vulgarity; they had the kind of disregard for critics and popular opinion that made them proclaim in their 2008 album “Skeletal Lamping,” “I’m just a black she-male / and I don’t know what you people are all about.” None of this free-spirited nonchalance is to be found i\on their latest LP.
In “False Priest,” Of Montreal play it safe—and the results are decidedly underwhelming. On most of the tracks, Kevin Barnes’s distinctive falsetto gives way to an almost rap-like monotone that could belong to any other garden-variety indie pop band. Perhaps this is a part of Barnes’s flirtation with R&B—the album features Beyoncé’s younger sister Solange Knowles on the track “Sex Karma.” But her vocals, though they add some much-needed variety, fail to lift the track out of banality. Where Barnes once talked about love in lyrics like, “I wanna be your what’s happenin” in “Gallery Piece” from “Skeletal Lamping,” in “Sex Karma” he can only come up with the hackneyed refrain, “You look like a playground to me—player.”
This is just one example of the uninspired lyrics that characterize the whole album. Part of the problem is that “False Priest” struggles under the weight of a hefty moral agenda. If previous albums had social messages to convey, they were better concealed, or at least presented with more panache. In “False Priest,” the moralizing just sounds clumsy. A case in point is the otherwise decent track “Enemy Gene,” in which Barnes asks, “How can we ever evolve / when our gods are so primitive?” By the time the album reaches its final track “You Do Mutilate?” another moral tirade is the last thing the listners want—but it’s precisely what they get. Barnes decides to indulge in one more rant about “genetic telephonic pills,” deriding the pharmaceutical industry.
Even putting aside the lackluster lyrics “False Priest” is disappointing. Of Montreal has never been a singles-oriented band, but every album has had standout tracks verging on mastery. The same cannot be said of “False Priest,” which fails to produce a single classic. Not one of the tracks has the umph of an “Id Engager” or a “Suffer for Fashion.” There are certainly no tracks of the monumental proportions of 12-minute “The Past is a Grotesque Animal” from 2007’s “Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?” Instead, most of the tracks are short; only two tracks out of “False Priest’s” 13 are longer than five minutes, giving the album a feeling of complacency.
“False Priest” does have redeeming moments. In fact, the album starts off promisingly. “Coquet Coquette” has the upbeat, indie electro-pop feel of some of the band’s earlier work. The heavy guitar chords and well-defined chorus distinguish it from the rest of the album. Barnes is actually singing in rhythm, as opposed to speaking straight over the baseline as he does in subsequent tracks. “Like a Tourist” has traces of Of Montreal’s trademark wackiness when it talks of “unicorns eating baby meat.”
But other attempts at the bizarre sound forced. On previous albums, Of Montreal could pull off wacky because it was so effortless. Yet tracks like “Girl Named Hello,” in which Barnes proclaims “I did a line with a girl named Hello,” are too contrived to be convincing. The artificiality reaches a peak on the album’s penultimate track “Around the Way,” which features an interlude in a made-up language. This pretention could be justified if it added anything to the track, but the vaguely Slavic-sounding language is almost indistinguishable from Barnes’s own impassive monotone.
Whereas Barnes pushed boundaries in earlier work, in “False Priest” he seems content to stay in familiar territory. His experiment with R&B and funk yields no remarkable results. The album’s flaws are unwittingly expressed in its title—it sets out to be revelatory, even prophetic, but ends up sounding holier-than-thou.  With “False Priest,” instead of Of Montreal’s signature absurdity, we get a poorly conceived sermon.

The hand on the doomsday clock inches a few ticks closer to the end, and “Minutes to Midnight” gives way to “A Thousand Suns.” Linkin Park’s latest release is a concept album, with a title borrowed from the Bhagvad Gita: “if the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one.” This image of a burning sky echoes throughout “A Thousand Suns,” from the eerie sound bites of J. Robert Oppenheimer as he describes the Trinity nuclear test, to the samples of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. remarking on the Vietnam War, to the lyrics of the songs themselves. But Linkin Park is playing more than the end of the world. Their music fuses genres—at times sounding like hip-hop, at times like rock, at times almost like European metal with its melodic vocals and assertive instrumentation. This counterpoint is used to powerful effect in “A Thousand Suns;” the grittier hip-hop against Chester Bennington’s smooth vocals sounds like human shouts in the face of the powers in the sky. In both the human shout and the angelic chorus, Linkin Park explores a multitude of loosely connected ideas of doomsday and what it means—everything from love to religious justice to political fury to a vague story of nuclear war.
Because ”A Thousand Suns,” is a concept album, much of it has to be taken as part of a whole. Oppenheimer’s voice over a heartbeat of explosive percussion in “The Radiance” is probably not something to listen to on the way to class, but it’s a powerful preface to what follows, recalling mushroom clouds and the sense of humanity somehow having gone too far.
While there are moral and political statements in the work, the dominant theme emerges from a few songs tracing a human reaction to an abstracted doomsday, though not necessarily to an actual end of the world. These songs tend to sound more like rock than anything else, and their lyrics, accordingly, are more about human struggles, as in the track “Iridescent,” where Bennington sings about “when you feel cold, and lost in desperation.” Snatches of the same lyrics and melodies thread through many of them, though most are distinct songs. In between are recordings of voices—Oppenheimer, Mario Savio, Martin Luther King, Jr.—set to music and occasionally distorted to lend them an almost prophetic echo.
However, while many of the elements that make Linkin Park so electric—the contrast between Mike Shinoda’s rap and the far more melodic vocals of Chester Bennington—are well-balanced throughout the album, this is often not so with its individual songs. Some of the more melodic tracks—“Burning in the Skies”, for instance—are uninteresting when played individually, though they provide a good counterpoint to the voice recordings and some of the rap.
Much of the interest in the record lies in the contrast between its different pieces, not as much as in the pieces themselves. This isn’t to say that the album doesn’t have its great singles. “When They Come For Me” starts with ferocious percussion and adds on first a verse of rap, and then additional vocals, ending with a chorus. “Iridescent” and “The Catalyst” are both characterized by Bennington’s melodic vocals, but they’re both heartfelt and provide enough musical contrast to be interesting. The last song, “The Messenger”, is strangely unadorned—just a guitar and vocals—compared with the rest of the work. It sounds uncannily like a popular love song and, though unexpected, seems to be a conceptually fitting conclusion—almost as if to say that “love keeps us kind” when nothing else remains.
“A Thousand Suns,” taken as a whole, is an ambitious album that reaches far beyond what Linkin Park has done previously. It has promising singles, but far more important is the vision articulated in the work as a whole. And while that vision can be unclear—sometimes swaying towards political fury, sometimes towards peace in the face of an apocalypse—the framework it creates to organize the music is memorable. Linkin Park has the wherewithal to make doomsday incandescent—and though their new release doesn’t have the coherence of prophecy, it has all of the contagious tension of the brink.

Despite the fact that the better half of their band is well over forty, Blond Redhead have yet to fall prey to becoming outmoded burnouts. Blonde Redhead was first formed by chance when the group met in a New York City cafe—in 1993. With their eighth, and newest album., “Penny Sparkle,” they continue their creation of incredibly fresh and new music most would only expect from kids half their age. In “Penny Sparkle,” Blonde Redhead try on a less complicated style and very much succeed: cutting out much of the noise and creating the soundtrack to afternoon daydreams.
Though Blonde Redhead have simplified their style, they’ve added a dimension that creates an even more out-of-this-world feeling than any of their previous albums, all of which were already labeled “dreamy.” In “Sparkle,” they create a layered style of simple elements. Foremost in aiding this is the synth has been given a new role as the sandman—bringing the atmosphere of the dream—rather than its typical role as a techno back-up singer. The percussion is simple and staccatoed, making each hit more effective as well as grounding the songs, and the beautiful, ethereal melody provided by Kazu Makino, the lead singer, complements the composition in a manner that intensifies the dream-like feel. A particularly striking example of the balanced instrumentation is “Everything is Wrong.” The melodies of the vocals, guitar, and synth create a sound that resonates deeply, while the percussion keeps us grounded.
The band continues the themes of love from their last album, “23,” with lyrics that speak of a misunderstood or misunderstanding lover. Though exploring similar themes, “Sparkle” succeeds in growth, striking the listener as a calmer and less-materialistic cousin of the previous album. Blonde Redhead have traded the faster, punkier sound for one made for musing. While “23” is heavy on guitars and quick rhythms, “Sparkle” is slower, affected with cosmic melodies and a distant beat.
However, the minimalism and speed do lend to a difficulty in distinguishing between tracks. This is also compounded by the nearly incomprehensible lyrics in most songs. In “Will There be Stars” and “Black Guitar” Amedeo Pace, the guitarist, makes an appearance as vocalist adding some variety. This helps the album avoid excessive monotony despite its tendency toward unrecognizable vocals, synthy similarities, and medium-to-slow paced beats which make singing along difficult and dancing along impossible. It does not, however, save the album from being a hard one to get all the way through. “Penny Sparkle” definitely takes more than one full listen to enjoy. But Pace’s voice does not take away from the dreamy state the album puts one in either, and instead gives a voice to the lover, who is usually the subject matter of the lyrics.
Perhaps this was done intentionally, as the album does present itself as a unified whole. It progresses almost as a break up, starting with songs that describe the brink of a rut, then the actual break, and finally, recognitions of the flaws in the given relationship. “Sparkle” begins with “Here Sometimes,” easily the catchiest song in the album, which introduces the bittersweet feelings of heartache consistent throughout. Makino sings, “you want to save me / people will save me.” By the middle of the album, she asks, “Is this love or prison?” while the last song, “Spain,” acknowledges “I don’t mean to fly to you,” telling the lover, “I can’t take it anymore.”
“Penny Sparkle” takes the listeners’ minds elsewhere with its otherworldly sound, keeping them from getting lost with persistent percussion. The ability to create that out-of-body experience is what gives “Sparkle” its edge, even while the songs hazily flow from one to another. Despite the fact that it is not an easy listen, these are the songs of slow dances in daydreams of unrequited love.

As green becomes the new crimson, Harvard students are asking their dining halls to align with the University’s trend toward environmentalism. Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services has risen to the challenge in the past, offering local food and organic staples in the salad bar and elsewhere. Now, however, it is time for HUHDS to go one step further: In light of Talia B. Lavin ’12’s recent petition to reduce the amount of meat served at Harvard dining halls, HUHDS ought to follow the petition’s suggestions by limiting its meat offerings and enhancing its available vegetarian options. Doing so would offer a variety of benefits for students, animals, and the environment alike.
By cutting back on the amount of meat that is served and thus reducing its demand, Harvard would be acknowledging that meat production is harmful to the environment. Factory farming, the main source of most of America’s meat, is responsible for significant amounts of carbon emissions and toxic waste. Moreover, animals bred on factory farms are largely treated in a cruel and inhumane manner.
There are, however, very few reasonably priced alternatives to factory-farmed meat that Harvard would be able to implement and sustain on a large scale. The U.S. government heavily subsidizes a great deal of meat production, making it artificially attractive to consumers’ wallets. Family-farmed meat or other forms of meat that are produced in a more humane manner are likely too expensive to bring to the entire campus. As a result, the only option for HUHDS to confront and act upon this problem is to reduce the overall amount of meat that is available.
Lavin’s petition calls for HUHDS to begin by eliminating meat either for one meal a day or one day a week. The petition is right to suggest a decrease rather than an entire elimination of meat altogether, as student satisfaction is an important factor in HUHDS’ services, and many students do not want to become vegetarians. Unlike other types of food that can be replaced with organic or locally grown equivalents, however, there is no viable counterpart for meat that can necessarily satisfy meat-loving students to the same degree. Were HUHDS to eliminate meat entirely, student dissatisfaction would dramatically rise, defeating one of the main purposes of Harvard’s dining services—student contentment.
We therefore suggest that HUHDS serve one lunch per week without any meat entrées. The grills in each dining hall should still provide meat—as always—for those who want it, although it is likely that the resulting long lines will deter those who are unwilling to wait and will prompt them instead to turn to the vegetarian entrées that are available. That said, the quality and taste of vegetarian entrées must improve in order for students to truly enjoy their meatless meals. With better vegetarian options available, students will be even more likely to gravitate toward eating less meat on their own, resulting in a considerable improvement in their consumption patterns and environmental impact.
Yet reducing meat offerings alone is not enough. To make the greatest environmental difference, Harvard must educate the student body on the harmful effects of sustained meat-eating. By the nature of students’ meal plans, most students enter dining halls largely indifferent to the origins of the various food types and do not widely choose what to eat based on price or environmental impact. Many may be unaware of the effects or implications of meat consumption, and raising more awareness on the issue can help them consider their options from a more informed standpoint and with a more open mind.
Even though we recognize that HUHDS is meant to provide students with an enjoyable culinary experience, we believe there is room for less meat and more vegetarian options. Although we do not hope that HUHDS goes entirely meatless, we do wish to see its offerings be meat-less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sharron E. Angle, the Tea Party candidate for senate in Nevada, was recently confronted about whether she was too conservative. “I’m sure that they probably said that about Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and Benjamin Franklin…And truly, when you look at the Constitution…you might draw those conclusions: That they were conservative.”
Let’s consider that for a moment. The Founders defied the mighty British Empire to establish a radically progressive democratic government in an era of monarchy and autocracy. They extended full freedoms of speech, press, protest, and religion to the masses. And had they lost the war, it is doubtful that King George would have shown mercy for such “conservatives.” Angle also claimed that the phrase “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” in the Declaration of Independence, was concrete proof that the Founding Fathers were obviously anti-abortion.
Indeed, Angle’s type of commentary has become commonplace within the Tea Party movement. But although the Founders may have given candidates like Angle the right to say such things, what such remarks really underlie is a manipulative and selfish perversion of American history.
Another Tea Party candidate, Rick Barber, who lost his primary-bid for Congress, went so far as to feature several of the founding fathers in a viral web-commercial. In the ad, Barber explains, to a horrified audience of Franklin, Adams, and Washington, of the tyrannies that are the federal government, the Internal Revenue Service, and healthcare reform. It ends with Washington urging Barber to “gather his armies.” Again, we can briefly forget that the ad offers not-too-veiled support for a violent overthrow of the U.S. government.
Here, Barber goes one step further than most Tea Party candidates and actually puts his partisan political ideology into the founders’ physical embodiment rather than just a self-indulgent interpretation of their words and actions. The founders were not anti-taxation; they wanted fair representation in the levying of taxes. Many of them, led by Adams, were actually in favor of a stronger federal government—especially after the notable failure of the weak central government established in the Articles of Confederation.
Most telling, though, is a quote from the self-proclaimed Tea Party Queen—Sarah L. Palin. Asked about the phrase “under God” in the pledge of allegiance, she replied, “If it was good enough for the founding fathers, it’s good enough for me.” For the moment, we will ignore the fact that the pledge was not written until 1892, and “under God” was not added until 1954, during the Cold War.
Ultra-conservative candidates from Alaska to Florida wrap themselves and their ideas in the founding fathers’ protective legacy. The precedent for appealing to the generally unassailable founders to justify one’s political ideology is well-established throughout American political history, though the breadth and distortion of the Tea Party’s appeal is a unique case to be sure.
But even more troubling than the Tea Party’s blatantly incorrect citations of the history of the founding fathers is the idea underlying these rallying cries: that the founding fathers should be the final word on American democracy. Slavery was “good enough” for Washington, but not for Lincoln. Discrimination by gender and race were “good enough” for Adams, but not for Wilson and Johnson. And American isolationism was “good enough” for Jefferson, but not for Roosevelt. It is one of this country’s principles, its foundational strengths, that each successive generation finds what is not “good enough” in America and sets out to better it. The founders specifically wrote the Constitution to be a flexible and elastic document, able to be interpreted through generations of changes completely unforeseen to Americans of the eighteenth century. In many cases, nobody can truly say what the founders wanted, but it should not matter. They knew their daring democratic experiment would be so much bigger than a handful of rebellious white males. And that great wisdom is the reason why we revere these men.

If Congress renews the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy this fall, the only conclusion to draw will be that the super rich have completely hijacked our political system.
Over the past few decades, inequality has vastly expanded in the United States. In the last 40 years, the share of total income for the top one percent of earners has expanded from eight percent to 18 percent. Also, the top 0.1 percent of Americans now earn eight percent of America’s total income. America’s wealthy and powerful are becoming richer at a rapid pace, and an extension of former President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for the rich would only exacerbate this trend, at almost no benefit to the economy as a whole.
President Bush’s 2001 tax cuts were strongly skewed toward benefiting the very wealthy. Now, President Barack H. Obama hopes to extend the tax cuts for the middle class and the poor but to end the tax cuts for the rich. What, exactly, would be the impact of Obama’s proposal to end the tax cuts for the richest Americans? Well, the wealthiest 120,000 taxpayers in America would still receive a hefty $61,510 tax cut under an extension of the middle class tax cuts, but they would lose out on the whopping extra $310,140 tax cut they would receive if the Bush tax cuts are extended in full. As a point of comparison, extending the tax cuts for the richest Americans would have little to no positive monetary impact for anyone below the 99th income percentile.
Judging on the merits of personal necessity, there is absolutely no reason why the top one percent of Americans need staggering amounts of extra tax relief. Even supporters of the tax cut realize this, which is why they make the argument that raising such tax cuts would hurt the economy during these difficult times. Yet tax cuts for the wealthy are the most inefficient way to stimulate the economy because the rich are much more likely to save their extra income than to spend or invest it. While the poor and middle-class, who are usually living paycheck to paycheck, will most likely spend their additional savings on necessities, the rich will save almost all of it, doing absolutely nothing to bolster demand.
In addition, President Obama’s plan would cut the 10-year deficit by $680 billion, which should be appealing to all of the Republicans currently refusing to pass any new job-creation legislation because of stated concerns about the deficit. With the money saved from not extending these giveaways to the rich, Congress should pass a temporary stimulus bill that would help the economy for the next few years and then allow the raised taxes to contribute to deficit reduction.
The money saved could be used to create an infrastructure bank, expand food stamps, give aid to the states, or restart the Work Share program, which pays private companies to keep employers on the payroll. A program like this would temporarily use these billions of dollars for productive uses throughout the economy, instead of sending them to sit in the bank accounts of the extremely rich. After the economy has recovered, the revenues could go plug the deficit.
The political debate over extending the tax cuts for the wealthy seems stunningly detached from the economic experience that much of the country is going through right now, and this is because our political system has truly been captured by America’s wealthiest citizens. As the influence of money in politics has increased to an astronomical degree, a vast majority of Congressmen—and the donors they absolutely need to stay in power—are from the top income groups. Living in this bubble where it seems as though many people will suffer from a tax increase, Congress is very worried about whether America’s top one percent gets a giant extra break.
Earlier this year, Annie M. Lowrey ’06-’07 wrote a column in the Washington Post where she hypothesized how the Senate would have been composed if it actually represented all Americans by income bracket equally. “Eight senators would have no income…16 would represent Americans who make less than $10,000” and “the bulk of senators would work on behalf of the middle class.” Instead, we live in a Senate where the median level of wealth is $1.06 million, and this is to say nothing of donors that often drive political decisions.
This staggering inequality between Congressmen and the people they represent is reflected in debates about everything ranging from tax cuts to universal healthcare and financial regulation. It has molded an unequal society where the wealthy have a stranglehold over the lawmaking process and where the most heated legislative debate about America’s worst employment crisis in 70 years centers on the tax rate for the top one percent. Our unequal society has now reached an economic crisis point, with America’s poor and middle classes failing to make ends meet. On this issue, Congressmen must put aside their self-interest and restart inclusive economic growth.
Whether they do will signify whether they represent all Americans or just their club of very rich ones.

The recent controversy over the influential cognitive psychological work of Harvard Professor Marc D. Hauser has performed the valuable public service of raising issues of scientific method and accountability. Unfortunately, it has done so by employing irresponsible and inaccurate reporting and argumentation in an inexplicable attempt to undermine legitimate research by one of our generation’s leading scholars.
Newspapers generally pride themselves on reporting at least two competing perspectives on hot-point issues, but in the Hauser case the only voices presented are those of scholars known to be virulently opposed to his research program. One such scholar, Michael Tomasello, has assumed the role of muckraking journalist—claiming his own anonymous sources within the Hauser lab—reporting on unsubstantiated rumors of staff “insurrections” and university “raids” to seize hard drives and videos. Then there are the insinuations and warnings of Hauser’s former supervisor, Robert M. Seyfarth: “Marc’s way of doing things and ours were not really the same”; co-authors and students “run the risk of being tarred with the same brush” of misconduct by Hauser’s compliance with the confidentiality protocol of his investigation. Most recently, “Cognition” editor Gerry Altmann has announced his “conjecture” (his word) that Hauser fabricated data; this is exceedingly improper, for Altmann is not privy to the totality of the evidence, and thus any opinion he expresses is by definition speculative and thereby a contravention of the due process (subsuming the presumption of innocence) that Hauser deserves. Aren’t journal editors supposed to be champions of disinterested formal processes?
Gossip, innuendo, and speculation are unbecoming of professional scientists; furnishing a bully pulpit for such defamation is unbecoming of professional journalists. Journalists and readers ought not to heed the hearsay and hunches that have thus far characterized the coverage of the Hauser case, but rather consider all sides in the case when possible.
Even the most meticulous of scientists makes mistakes, and Hauser has done so: “I acknowledge that I made some significant mistakes and I am deeply disappointed that this had led to a retraction (i.e., of a 2002 “Cognition” paper) and two corrections (i.e., to a 2007 “Science” paper and a 2007/2010 “Proceedings of the Royal Society B” paper).” However, it is not justified to see “a shadow [cast] over the several different fields in which Dr. Hauser and his students published papers,” or a “ripple effect” so violent that “all of Dr. Hauser’s results are suspect.”
In a 2009 paper in “Biology Letters,” Watumull—a member of Hauser's lab—collaborated with Hauser on a study conducted with the experimental design of the 2002 Cognition paper; this design is also implicated in some allegedly dubious 2007 research. Watumull can testify to Hauser's unimpeachable scientific integrity within the design, which obviously—as with any experiment—cannot be error-proof.
The experiment required the researcher to determine whether a monkey discriminated particular sound patterns; the evidence for discrimination was whether the monkey oriented toward the sound source for particular patterns. Researchers in some labs are irresponsibly subjective in their analyses: any turn of the head is counted as a positive datum. But as the most conservative and reasoned of scientists, Hauser insisted upon applying a Cartesian grid to the animal's head (in the computer analysis), defining orientation with respect to the transcendence of planes and positions in quadrants. This methodological meticulousness in our personal experience typifies all of Hauser's work as surely as it did in the 2002 research. Any mistakes made, therefore, ought not to “besmirch” (to borrow a detractor’s word) Hauser and his work, but humble us to concede that even the best science—one of our noblest pursuits—is only as infallible as the best scientists.
Watumull did not conduct any experiments for the 2007 and 2007/2010 papers but was present with many lab members to review the data of videotaped animal performances on which they were built. The data were collected with demonstrable rigor. To test action-perception in nonhuman primates, the researcher must methodically perform his actions to a focused, undistracted subject. Hauser choreographed researchers’ actions meticulously—from the angles of body parts to the speeds of movements—and selected subjects judiciously—aborting any trials wherein the attention of the animal was compromised. Such well-designed experiments are the stuff of good science. The findings reported in the papers were manifestly consistent with these data. It is a further testament to Hauser's integrity that he insists upon as many lab members as possible peer-reviewing data.
In our experience, Marc Hauser is the consummate scientist—the most disinterested, the most rational, the most ethical. We are proud to be his colleagues. However, we are less than proud of those in the cognitive sciences reacting publicly to Hauser's case with irresponsible impatience (disrespect for due process), unjustified slurs, and half-baked conjectures. All are interested in the truth, but as scientists we ought to consider the case reasonably and measuredly, with objectivity and fairness.
Bert Vaux is a former Professor of Linguistics at Harvard University, Jeffrey Watumull is a graduate student in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge and a member of Hauser’s lab.
CORRECTION: September 23, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 21 op-ed "Who Will Speak for Hauser?" stated that Bert Vaux is a former Professor of Linguistics at Harvard University. In fact, Bert Vaux is a former Associate Professor of Linguistics at Harvard University.

Default rates on student loans are increasing, as Education Secretary Arne S. Duncan ’86 announced last week, but the news has not translated into dramatic changes for a private university like Harvard.
Up from 6.7 percent the previous year, the default rate stood at 7 percent in 2008, the last year for which statistics have been reported. While an increase was noted in all categories of colleges, Duncan noted that students at for-profit schools are facing the most severe default rates, meaning that they have not made a payment or arrangements on their loan for 270 days.
Meanwhile, Harvard institutional loans have a default rate that is “very, very low, less than 2.5 percent,” said Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue.
This rate places Harvard on the lowest end of student default rates. Bloomfield College in N.J. is on the other end, with an average of 9.8 percent default rate from 2005 to 2007, according to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity.
In a decision made in Dec. 2007, Harvard eliminated loans from financial aid packages, a change that was implemented in the 2008-2009 academic year.
“We have been thrilled to eliminate loans to attract talent worldwide, so that students [from disadvantaged backgrounds] do not take themselves out of our applicant pool,” Donahue said. Both Princeton and Yale also implemented the no-loan policy for financial aid packages.
Despite this change, Harvard still offers its own loan program which extends loans at a 5 percent fixed interest rate without fees.
“Student loans are a wonderful way of financing education if they’re the good kind,” Donahue said, referring to loans in which interest does not accrue while the student is enrolled, such as those offered by Harvard.
Students who do not qualify for either Harvard or federal loans can turn to private lenders, whose interest rates do accrue. Donahue noted that these Harvard students tend to come from higher income families who have committed their assests to credit card bills and mortgages.
Each year, the Financial Aid Office published “A Guide to Your Educational Loan Debt.” According to this document, the average loan debt for the Harvard class of 2008 was $9,879, less than half the national average of $23,200 for graduates of four-year colleges and universities in 2008.

To show their support for the DREAM Act, eight leaders of institutions of higher education in Mass.—including University President Drew G. Faust—co-signed a letter sent to the state Senators yesterday.
The letter is signed off by the presidents of Harvard, Tufts, Boston University, Northeastern, MIT, UMass, Boston College, and the chancellor of UMass Boston. Addressed to Senators John F. Kerry and Scott P. Brown, the message urged for the support of a "critical measure that will assist thousands of students in Massachusetts and across the country to reach their full potential and contribute to their home communities."
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid introduced last week the possibility that this legislation—known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act—would make its way to the Senate floor today. If passed, the DREAM Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
"Each of us is deeply committed to access and believes that education and service are the pathways to better neighbors, stronger communities, and economic growth, as well as personal satisfaction and happiness," the letter stated. "The DREAM Act will offer them and us the potential of harnessing their full talents on behalf of all of us."
Faust, the first co-signer of the letter, has been consistently vocal about her support for the DREAM Act. In May 2009, Faust wrote a letter in support of the legislation to Mass. Rep. Michael E. Capuano. Faust also met with Brown, who has remained ambivalent about his position on the legislation, in part to urge him to support the DREAM Act.
Nicolas E. Jofre '13, co-director of Harvard College Act on a Dream, a campus organization that promotes equality for all immigrants, said that it was the President’s office that took the leading role in contacting the other universities attached to the letter.
"We hope that [this letter] will encourage [Senator Brown] to vote in favor, considering that the leading universities in Massachusetts are urging him to protect his student constituents this week," Jofre said. "The DREAM Act is not an issue of immigration reform anymore, it’s a basic human rights issue."
"If our Senators aren’t listening to the world’s leading institutions of higher learning, then there is something very wrong with Congressional response to the educational needs of my generation," he added.
As part of a trip to Washington, D.C. last week, Faust met with Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin to discuss the Act and share her appreciation for his support for the proposed legislation.
"[This letter] is the fruit of all our hard labor," said Melissa V. Perez '13, co-director of Act on a Dream. "This is the greatest thing that we feel [Faust] could have done for the movement. We are endlessly appreciative of her and of the student support at Harvard."

Women received more doctoral degrees than men did during the 2008-2009 academic year—a finding from which Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts slightly diverged by awarding only 40.9 percent of its doctoral degrees to women in the same year.
The report on American universities, released last week by the Council of Graduate Schools, stated that 50.4 percent of doctoral degrees during the 2008-2009 school year were earned by women, indicating a rise in the number of women awarded doctorates by 6.3 percent from the previous year.
Women received 60.4 percent of master’s degrees and 67.3 percent of all graduate certificates during that time period, according to the report. At the same time, however, the number of women earning doctoral degrees from Harvard’s GSAS decreased by 12.9 percent.
The numbers vary from one department of GSAS to another. GSAS Assistant Dean John M. McNally said that women traditionally make up about half of the student body in the Integrated Life Sciences Graduate Program.
The Harvard Business School, which awards more MBAs than doctoral degrees, is the only school in the University that has a lower ratio of women to men than GSAS does. During the 2008-2009 academic year, HBS awarded 35.7 percent of its degrees to women, an increase from 34.2 percent in the previous year.
According to the Council of Graduate Schools, women received 55 percent of the graduate certificates awarded in the U.S. in the broad field of business in the academic year ending 2009.
James E. Aisner ’68, the director of media relations at HBS, said that though the proportion of women receiving degrees from HBS may seem small, it is important to consider the figure in context. The average age of the entering student in HBS is 26—an age at which “people also begin to think about starting a family,” he said.
HBS makes efforts to encourage women to submit applications, he added. Aisner said that admissions officers visit college campuses and that women graduates have founded many alumnae groups.
Of all the schools at the University, the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which awards some Ph.D.s among many other degrees, awards the largest proportion of its degrees to women.
During the 2008-2009 year, women received 79.2 percent of its degrees. During the same year, women received 73 percent of graduate certificates awarded in the U.S. in the field of education, according to the report.
The proportion of women receiving degrees from other Harvard graduate schools during the 2008-2009 academic year ranged from 43 to 58.1 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A fight is brewing in the Massachusetts State Senate. On Nov. 2, state residents will vote on a measure to repeal the state sales tax on alcohol, also known as “Question 1.”
In May 2009, the Mass. Senate voted to lift the sales tax exemption on alcohol, applying the 6.25 percent rate to all over-the-counter liquor sold in the state for the second highest liquor tax in the group of six New England states plus New York.
The revenue from the tax is earmarked to fund addiction recovery and family support programs, according to Mass. State Senator Steven A. Tolman.
“It’s a stupid vote, to vote to repeal the sales tax,” Tolman said. “[The tax] ensures accountability in the recovery system, so that people who are sick will be able to get help when they are in need.”
But liquor salesmen and others unhappy with the removal of the exemption mobilized quickly to repeal the legislation, pushing for November’s ballot question regarding the “Sales Tax on Alcoholic Beverages,” as it is formally called.
In 2010 alone, the Committee to Repeal the Alcohol Sales Tax has received nearly $400,000 in contributions from state liquor distributors and individuals, according to public records.
Liquor salesmen in the state said that the tax has forced them to make cuts and lay off staff, causing harm to the Mass. economy. Four Seasons Wine and Liquor’s owner Sean Barry said the tax forced him to lay off one full-time employee and cut back on seasonal workers. He now works longer hours and has stopped advertising his business in newspapers and on the radio.
“There’s a snowball effect,” said Barry, whose business gave $1,000 to the Committee to Repeal the Alcohol Sales Tax. “It affects other industries. I’m not spending money on advertisements like I used to, nor am I employing as many people.”
Liquor salesmen said that residents who live near New Hampshire often chose to cross the border to buy liquor rather than pay the tax, an opinion supported by Harvard undergraduates.
“I know people who have gone to New Hampshire to buy alcohol for cheaper,” said Andrew A. Parchman ’11. “It’s bad for the state of Massachusetts.”
But supporters of the tax said that the benefits outweigh the costs.
“Alcohol is not a necessity and doesn’t deserve a special tax break,” said Vic DiGravio, the president and CEO of the Association for Behavioral Healthcare and the co-chair of the Committee Against Repeal of the Alcohol Tax. He said that the state desperately needs federally funded abuse treatment programs in light of the economic downturn, and that the tax is an effective deterrent against underage drinking.
While the debate may be bitter outside of Harvard Square, local liquor salesmen said that the tax has hardly affected their business. “It’s the month of September, business is good,” said DOMA Liquors manager Arjun Kunwar, noting that Harvard students’ return to campus always causes an increase in alcohol sales.
Still, some liquor salesmen in Harvard Square are not pleased with the tax.
“I’d like that tax to disappear,” said C’est Bon Market and Liquors Manager George Sarkis.

Amidst the dim magenta lighting, a red velvet backdrop, and soft musical numbers, three professors and a performer came together last night to discuss "Cabaret," which opened on Friday at Club Oberon.
Centered around nightlife in 1930s Berlin, the show—which originally came to Broadway in 1966—has seen many revisions and recreations throughout the past 40 years before coming to 2 Arrow St. this month.
Musician Amanda Palmer, who is performing in the two-month run of Cabaret as the emcee of the show, said that she first saw the show in Regensburg, Germany. In that particular showing, the performers distributed flags with swastikas to audience members, much to their dismay, Palmer recalled.
"Cabaret has something to say about the glittering, globalization shadows casting desperation and destitution all over the world," Director of the Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha said in his opening remarks last night.
During the talk, which was hosted by both the Humanities Center and the American Repertory Theater, discussion of the aesthetic aspects of the show gave way to a more historical and academic conversation.
Bhabha, who moderated the panel, empahsized questions that ranged beyond the A.R.T.’s rendition, exploring the musical’s history, music, and impact.
"It’s a richer world when you have a sense of the ideas of older eras," said panelist and Music Professor Carol J. Oja.
History Professor and panelist Charles S. Maier explained the signficance of Berlin, in the context of the show, as a place where young people went to be edgy and experimental.
Some attendees of the event said that they had expected a different focus during the talk.
"I had hoped to hear more discussion of the moral and political themes of Cabaret—and not just as a historical drama about Germany, but as a contemporary story about the uses of affluence and entertainment to sustain denial," Professor of Mathematics Curtis T. McMullen wrote in an e-mail.
The discussion ended with a more performative aspect as Palmer—who is also the lead singer of the musical duo The Dresden Dolls—performed a solo accompanied by her ukelele, much to the insistence of Bhabha.
"It was refreshing to see the usual suspects from Harvard’s Humanities Center on stage with the singer from the Dresden Dolls," McMullen wrote.
"Cabaret was a thought-provoking production," said Susanna B. Wolk '14, who attended the panel. “I’m a huge fan of Amanda Palmer as well, so it was exciting to see her in a different context."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The man who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Saturday on the top step of Memorial Church appeared to be a white male in his early to mid-twenties, according to an incident report released by the Cambridge Police Department yesterday.
The deceased, who appears to have been unaffiliated with Harvard, was found in a pool of his own blood with a "silver revolver style handgun" and a gunshot wound to his head, according to the report.
Officers, who responded after the shooting was reported at 10:49 a.m., found a bullet lodged in a nearby column of Memorial Church, according to the report submitted by Cambridge Police Sergeant Darcy Lowe on Saturday.
Witnesses informed the police that a tour group of 20 to 30 people was standing by the church when the male stood behind the group’s tour guide and then shot himself, according to the report.
The Harvard University Police Department led the police response to the incident, placing police tape around the perimeter of the scene before the Cambridge police arrived. HUPD declined to release its report on the incident.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, the CPD, and HUPD declined to provide the man’s name. Messages left with the Mass. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner were not immediately returned.
University officials described the death as an unfortunate and unexpected event, though they said that they were pleased with HUPD’s rapid response to the incident.
"I really don’t know how to describe it. It’s just a tragedy," said John "Jay" L. Ellison, associate dean of the College. "We’re an open urban campus and sometimes things happen."
Because HUPD determined that the death did not present an ongoing threat to the campus, Harvard did not immediately employ "Message Me," the University’s emergency alert system, according to Ellison.
Over an hour after the incident took place, College administrators reached out to students, informing them of what had happened and asking them to seek help if they felt affected by the death.
Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira said that a "handful of students" sought mental health assistance from University Health Services in reaction to the incident.
Barreira said that the Freshman Dean’s Office asked freshman proctors in particular to look out for "any students of concern" because most freshmen live in Harvard Yard, where the death took place.
"We’ve asked the proctors to reach out to any students that seem like they’re upset or distressed," said Sue Brown, resident dean of Elm Yard.
Though days have passed since the man’s death, Barreira urged students to continue to seek help if they have been affected by the incident.
"I would always encourage students that if they’re feeling distressed to go ahead and talk to us," Barreira said.

The Cambridge City Council met for a roundtable discussion last night, the first of four meetings to decide the city’s primary objectives for the next fiscal year.
Attendees included city councillors, ordinance committee members, central administrative staff, and Stacie N. Smith, senior associate and director of Workable Peace from Consensus Building Institute, who served as the moderator.
While most participants agreed that a "good goal" is one that is broad enough to bring together councillors, staff members, and the public, tensions concerning the budgets needed to achieve these potential goals were apparent, according to Smith.
"[An ideal goal] should be clear, achievable, and be able to be financed," said City Manager Robert W. Healy, who is in charge of creating a financial plan based on the objectives agreed upon by the councillors.
At the meeting, pamphlets were distributed stating the seven goals of the fiscal years ending 2009 and 2010, which included the promotion of a healthy environment and the creation of affordable housing. The priorities that the City Council sets during the course of the next three meetings are going to be in place for the following two fiscal years, yet the councillors only have 18 months left before elections, according to Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves.
"There is an operational problem," said Reeves, who has been on the Council for over 20 years and noted that the current City Council has more inexperienced members than in previous terms.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker expressed pessimism about the entire goal-setting procedure.
"I stand cynical to the effect it has on the day-to-day process," Decker said. "What the Council feels that Monday night and what the community feels that week sets the agenda for months."
Asking the Council to reflect on whether this is an effective use of time, she added that it is more important to spend time deciding how to reach recurring goals, emphasizing that she does not feel these goals drastically change year-to-year.
Councillor Craig A. Kelley noted other problems with the process, adding that although the Cambridge public had stated schools to be the number one problem and crime to be the second, there was no explicit focus on crime in any of the seven 2009-2010 goals. Yet most councillors were appreciative of setting broad plans, citing that the objectives of the past fiscal year had largely been met.
"While we may not have achieved each and every bit of the goal setting, we have made considerable strides," Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher said. Many councilors agreed that Cambridge has made progress both in affordable housing and public buildings.

The University has advised its schools to plan for a 4 percent rise in the value of the endowment payout for the next fiscal year, marking the first yearly increase since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008.
The figure—confirmed by University spokesman John D. Longbrake yesterday—represents the percentage of the endowment that will likely be available for University schools to spend during the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
The news comes less than two weeks after the University announced that the endowment had grown to $27.4 billion in the year ending June 2010, reflecting an annual investment return of 11 percent.
The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, adjusts the payout rate based on endowment performance and strives to keep a consistent amount of money available for budgeting. During the years before the financial crisis, the University aimed to spend between 5 and 5.5 percent of the total endowment value.
In an interview last Friday, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray said that she had recently been informed of the change in the payout rate.
According to Murray, universities often adjust their payout rates after looking at endowment performance over the past three years, rather than just the past year. Given the financial downturn over the three years, Murray said that the rise in endowment payout represented "good news."
"If you do a rolling average of the past three years, we would not be at plus 4 percent," she said.
The payout fell 12 percent last year and 8 percent the year before, reflecting the precipitous 30 percent drop in the value of Harvard’s endowment between June 2008 and June 2009.
The endowment payout will have varying effects on school budgets. For SEAS, which derives 40 percent of its budget from the endowment, the increased payout will loosen pressure on the school’s financial reserves, which it has been spending since the beginning of the financial crisis.
For the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which derives about half of its budget from the endowment, the increased revenue could provide financial relief. The school is seeking to close a deficit that stands at $35 million, according to spring predictions from FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
Other Harvard schools may be even more directly affected. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the unit most dependent on the endowment, derived 87 percent of its revenue from endowment funds in the year that ended in 2009.
Schools will provide their final budgets for the coming academic year by the beginning of next summer.
A number of departmental administrators said that they were not yet aware of a potential increase in the endowment payout rate.
"I don’t know the implication of [the payout rise] for my budget,” said Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey '64. "[The number] certainly hasn’t been officially told to me in the context of my budget planning, but I’m not engaged in that process yet."
Linda Wang, the assistant director for departmental finance in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, said that she had not yet been informed of the rise in the payout rate.
Wang added that while department administrators were anticipating that the payout rate would rise, the 4 percent number “would be on the optimistic side” of their expectations.

Stars will soon brighten the sidewalks of Kendall Square if the proposed "Entrepreneurial Walk of Fame" becomes a reality.
Located in what planners call the densest area of innovation in the world, the proposed sidewalk would honor local entrepreneurs to promote a culture of creativity and risk-taking, as well as increase job opportunities in the area.
William K. Aulet '80, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, first conceived of the Walk of Fame when he witnessed a celebration after a bull fight in Andalusia, Spain. Aulet, who travels around the world to lecture on entrepreneurship, decided to change the focus of his speech: he encouraged the celebration of entrepreneurs—similar to the honoring of matadors in Spain and movie stars in Hollywood.
"Look at the people who created the companies," said Aulet, who directs the MIT Entrepreneurship Center. "It’s about intrepid people who go out there with nothing in front of them, and they create something that inspires people."
Aulet presented his proposal for the Entrepreneurial Walk of Fame before Cambridge’s Economic Development, Training and Employment Committee last week. He named Mark E. Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, and Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corportation, as two possible stars for the walk.
"[Kapor] created a company that changed the whole mindset of Kendall Square," Aulet said. "We saw the guy driving around every day. He was like a rock star."
"Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation is a terrific thing for Cambridge to do," wrote Kapor, whose company created the spreadsheet software Lotus 1-2-3, in an e-mail. "I’d be honored to have a star."
At the committee meeting, Aulet discussed what he calls the seven elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem: government, demand, invention, funding, infrastructure, entrepreneurs, and culture. He emphasized culture as the key component to promoting innovation.
"You need the spark that celebrates entrepreneurship, fundamentally changing the culture so people are willing to take the risk and become an entrepreneur," Aulet said.
City Councillor Leland Cheung, one of Aulet’s former students, will lead the task force to discuss the project and bring it before the City Council by December. Cheung said that he had approached Aulet last month for ideas to promote entrepreneurship.
"As the chair of the Economic Development Committee for the city, one of my major concerns is promoting economic growth," said Cheung, a student at Sloan and the Harvard Kennedy School. "How can we promote entrepreneurship to increase jobs in Cambridge?"
Capital partners, representatives from Xconomy, Microsoft, and the Cambridge Innovation Center were also in attendance at the committee meeting.

European Commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard warned of the impending effects of climate change and lauded the benefits of clean energy at a panel on the European perspective on international climate policy yesterday.
"The past few months have brought tragic and shocking reminders of the messy human, economic, and environmental costs the world faces from climate change," said Hedergaard, the Danish government official responsible for the Copenhagen Climate Summit.
Hedergaard cited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s projections that inaction will most likely lead to a 1.8 to 4 degree Celsius increase in average temperature this century, though she said the increase could potentially be as high as 6.4 degrees Celsius.
Despite these sobering predictions, Hedergaard said the economic changes needed to combat climate change could prove beneficial for countries willing to invest in clean energy.
"As I see it—and as most people in EU see it—it is also a huge opportunity to reinvigorate our economies," Hedergaard said. "Technologies such as energy efficiency and renewable energy promise to generate new sources of economic growth and to strengthen our economies and energy security."
She also cited a study conducted by University of California, Berkeley Professor Daniel M. Kammen that found that every dollar invested in renewable sources of energy generates three to five times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuel energies.
In light of these potential incentives for investing in clean energies, Hedergaard expressed frustration with the U.S.' inability to pass legislation on the matter.
"It’s not for lack of information," Hedergaard said. "America leads the world in so many fields of research related to climate change."
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Project on International Climate Agreements, which hosted the panel, said that Harvard’s role in the issue is to educate, carry out outreach, and share results of research with people in positions of authority.
Stavins said that the biggest hurdle currently preventing the passage of climate change legislation is a lack of political agreement.
"This is a problem that is important, a problem that technologically and economically can be addressed, but a problem that, politically, we are not at this point capable of addressing," Stavins said.
He added that global climate change is a long-term issue, and he is optimistic that the United States will ultimately be a leader in addressing the issue.
"[There are] already policies in place in states and regions that appear to be moving forward, but centralized action from Congress will have to wait for the solution of fundamentally political problems," Stavins said.

Wearing green union T-shirts and white "REHIRE JOAN" stickers, about 30 Harvard employees, students, and community members staged a rally yesterday evening protesting the termination of Joan Frankel, a former University employee of 25 years.
"Justice for Joan! Justice for Joan!" the group chanted as it marched through Harvard Yard to Pierce Hall where Frankel was stationed as a School of Engineering and Applied Science financial assistant for 25 years.
Frankel, a member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, was fired on July 6 after receiving two disciplinary letters in May and June, according to a flier handed out at the protest. Frankel had received "excellent performance reviews for 24 straight years" prior to 2010, according to the flier.
"I have done nothing to justify this," said Frankel, who spoke at the rally. "If I don’t find a job soon, I’ll be receiving less than half of the pension I would get if I retired at 65. I can’t even pay my rent with that."
Many demonstrators described Frankel’s termination as "unfair," "ridiculous," and "unjust," claiming that Frankel was fired because her salary and full pension cost the University more than it would like to spend.
"I think this is outrageous," said Neal J. Meyer ’11, a Student Labor Action Movement member who participated in the protest. "Joan worked at Harvard for many years with great reviews, but it was too expensive for Harvard to keep her."
"Harvard fired her the day after her mother died," said Abigail S. Brown '11-'12. "I think there’s a lot of humanity missing there on the University’s part."
HUCTW representative Geoff Carens said the union’s contract allows employees bereavement leave. Frankel’s termination the day after her mother’s death "disregarded" the Union’s contract, according to Carens, who organized the rally with members of the "No Layoff Campaign," a group also known as "Reform HUCTW."
Since her termination in July, Frankel said she has unsuccessfully applied for 34 University jobs.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin and HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger declined to comment on the rally or Frankel’s case.
"We’re going to be doing this all year—as long as it takes for the wrongs that have been done to Joan are made right," Carens said.
"We’ll be back! We’ll be back!" the crowd chanted outside the Pierce Building at the rally’s conclusion.

The possibility of former Harvard professor Martin "Marty" H. Peretz—who has stirred controversy with his statements regarding Muslim life—speaking at the upcoming 50th anniversary celebration of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies has grown increasingly vague.
Peretz, who wrote that "Muslim life is cheap" in a recent blog post, is no longer listed to speak on the final schedule of the anniversary celebration, which can be found on the Social Studies website.
Though Social Studies Director of Studies Anya Bernstein could not confirm that Peretz will not be speaking at Saturday’s event, she said that the schedule was updated yesterday. She added that Peretz will be recognized in some fashion at the celebration.
The development follows a meeting held by the Social Studies Standing Committee yesterday in a follow-up to last Friday’s meeting, during which committee members discussed how to respond to student, faculty, and alumni criticism of Peretz’s inflammatory comments.
The committee did not release an official statement yesterday, as it had said on Friday that it would, on its decision to accept an undergraduate research endowment fund in Peretz’s name created by his family and friends.
The fund’s proposed amount has increased from $500,000 to $650,000 in the last week due to alumni contributions donated by those outside of Peretz’s close circle. Some Social Studies professors are interpreting the increase as an indication of alumni support to honor Peretz at the anniversary, according to Simon L. Sternin ’01, a Social Studies alum and an organizer of the petition.
"We have been carefully reviewing all of the material we have received, and those views are being taken into consideration," Bernstein said.
The material includes an open  letter sent by the presidents of five different student support groups and a petition that has received nearly 500 signatures—including those of First Head Tutor of Social Studies from 1960 to 1961, anniversary principal speaker Robert P. Wolff ’53-’54, and 15 current Social Studies staff members—in five days and was organized by Social Studies alumni.
The standing committee will report its conclusions today about the Peretz fund in an official statement to Social Studies concentrators and the national press.
“This is a really difficult issue, and the pain it’s causing students, faculty, and alumni is incredibly distressing,” Bernstein said. “We are paying close attention to this issue, and we are taking into consideration all views as we deliberate.”
In Peretz’s original blog post, he wrote, "Muslim life is cheap, especially to other Muslims" and added that Muslims did not deserve protection from the First Amendment. Since then, he has apologized for his latter remark but reaffirmed his belief in the cheapness of Muslim life. Yet on the eve of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur—"the Day of Atonement"—Peretz asked for forgiveness for his “sin of wild and wounding language” over the past year.
Sternin said that the apology was irrelevant, as it disregarded Peretz’s history of comments.
"He’s not apologizing for his 25 years of bigoted sentiments," Sternin said. "He’s also not apologizing for his history of racism against Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and Muslims, all of whom he has maligned."
Sternin also criticized the University for its lack of appropriate response to the controversy and said that University President Drew G. Faust, to whom he also  sent the petition, "has been silent."
"If they go forward and accept the money, they are going to look like fools," Sternin said.

The Administrative Board plans to release this fall a comprehensive set of data detailing its decisions, casting light upon a confidential disciplinary process often seen as shrouded by the student body.
The database, which includes brief descriptions of some cases, will be made available to undergraduates on the Ad Board’s website sometime this semester, according to John "Jay" L. Ellison, secretary of the Ad Board.
As the College’s primary disciplinary body, the Ad Board hears many academic appeals, including petitions to take a leave of absence, to enroll in the College for a ninth term, or to enroll in two overlapping classes.
The College recently hired Megan R. Mitrovich as the Ad Board’s management fellow to help improve its efforts at transparency and organize the Ad Board’s data.
"At the end of the year we want to have a pretty comprehensive database that would be very thorough and exact in articulating the different sanctions and outcomes," said Mitrovich, who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education last spring.
In addition to providing more statistics about the Ad Board’s decisions, Mitrovich said some limited information would be available about past cases.
"The hope is that students will be able to use this as a ground for appeal or to determine that they have no grounds for appeal," she said.
The new information could provide greater insight into how the board makes its decisions.
"I think part of the transparency of the Ad Board is to let people see the statistics of what we actually do," Ellison said.
Currently, the board releases yearly statistics but does not provide details about specific cases.
For over a decade, the College has published a five-year summary with limited information about the Ad Board’s decisions. For example, one summary lists the number of students who were required to withdraw during the 2009-2010 school year for academic dishonesty, but does not provide any specific information about why those cases resulted in the decision.
Additionally, some categories of infractions listed in the summaries—such as "social behavior ~ alcohol"—can be difficult for undergraduates to understand without more context, Ellison said.
The Ad Board underwent a series of reforms last year, including reshaping the role of the resident dean and changing its process for interviewing students before the board.
Starting next month, Mitrovich will also work closely with the Office of Undergraduate Education to examine the issue of academic dishonesty at Harvard. As Harvard considers hiring an outside researcher to study academic dishonesty, Mitrovich will assist the College in studying the issue on campus.

An adjustment in grading policy at Harvard Law School has caught students off guard and incited concern that employers will use the new metrics to differentiate among job candidates.
The changes, which will allow the Law School to calculate Latin Honors more precisely, were put in place over the summer and included in the 2010-2011 Handbook of Academic Policies, but were never publicly announced.
The biggest change is that each grade will now correspond to a point value—four points are awarded for a High Pass, three points for Pass, two points for Low Pass, and zero points for a failing grade.
When the Pass-Fail system was adopted in 2008, it was made clear “that there would be tweaks along the way,” said Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber.
The changes this year are simply “fine tuning a process which everyone knew about,” he added.
The point average will not be printed on students’ transcripts, but the explanation of the point value system will be included on the back of the transcript.
Another change is that professors will now have increased discretion over the number of Dean’s Scholar Prizes they award.
Previously, a maximum of two Dean’s Scholar Prizes—which recognize execellent academic work—could be given per class.
A Dean’s Scholar Prize will also be worth five points in the new scale and will be factored into Latin Honors calculations.
Law School Student Government President Jennifer D. Dein expressed concern that the five points assigned to the Dean’s Scholar Prize, combined with the more liberal allotment of the prizes would effectively make the prize the equivalent of an “A.”
“Now it feels like a High Pass is a B and a Pass is a C,” Dein said.
Weber said he believes Dean’s Scholar Prizes should be regarded as an A+ for especially extraordinary work and these awards will not devalue other grades.
Some students expressed concern that assigning a high numerical value to Dean’s Scholar Prizes retroactively would reward effort in a certain way that was not intended at the time it was awarded.
According to the Law School, attaching numerical equivalents to the grades on the transcript is not unprecedented.
Previously, an 8-point scale appeared on the back of the transcript under the old letter-grade system.
“With the information provided on the transcripts, students and employers have been able to figure out GPAs on their own and can still do so now,” said Law School spokesperson Robb London.
Students said that the change is understandable, but that they would have appreciated an explicit notification of the adjustment, especially considering the relatively newness of Pass-Fail.
“I really don’t care what system I am graded under,” said third-year law student William O. Scharf. “But I want to know my grading scale before going into my classes. It’s that lack of sureness that bothers everybody.”
Dein said she is currently compiling students’ concerns in a letter to Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow.
“At the very least [the administration] should send out explanatory e-mail about the changes,” Dein said.
She added that some students have suggested using the formulas internally for Latin Honors but leaving it off of the transcript.
Regardless of the new system, “if you’re looking through a stack of Harvard transcripts, it’s easy to see who is doing well and who isn’t,” Scharf said.
He said he does not believe the school is obligated to spell out its grade distribution, but that a system needs to be in place long enough that there is “precedent and accumulated wisdom” about what each grade means.
“Now we are out at sea,” Scharf said. “I could not pin-point my position in my class within 20 percentiles. I have no idea where I stand.”
Weber said he believes the heightened anxiety is a result of the uncertainties in the job market.
“If we were in a booming market, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion,” Weber said, pointing to stable employment rates in the last few years as proof that even in the worst economic times, Harvard graduates are desirable hires. “It has nothing to do with what our grading system is.”

During a lecture at the Kennedy School of Government yesterday, Kosovo’s president, Fatmir Sejdiu, said that his country—the youngest state in the world—has started to recover from ethnic cleansing and genocide.
Speaking in Albanian through a translator as part of the Kokkalis Program on Southeastern and East-Central Europe, Sejdiu said that Kosovo has made efforts to ensure that there is strong minority representation in the legislature and local governments.
Bleak prognoses of ethnic violence against the Serbian minority have largely been avoided, and Kosovo has been formally recognized by 70 nations and the United Nation’s highest court.
“It has not been easy,” Sejdiu said. “In addition to the political issues, [Kosovo] has an obligation to make a complete transformation of the economy.”
Though the developing nation of about 2 million people has increasingly privatized businesses and encouraged foreign investment, the existence of the state itself remains a contentious issue.
On July 22, the United Nation’s highest court, the International Court of Justice, found that the independence of the state of Kosovo did not violate international law.
“The ICJ has concluded that the independence of Kosovo was the result of specific circumstances,” said Sejdiu, referring to the period of mass ethnic violence. He called the decision “meritorious” and said that Kosovo is committed to having friendly bilateral relations with Serbia, though that state has neither apologized for crimes committed in Kosovo nor acknowledged the sovereign state.
“Despite this very clear opinion of the court, unfortunately, Serbia continues to make efforts to distort the opinion of the ICJ,” Sejdiu said.
Gresa Matoshi ’13, who moved to New York City from Kosovo when she was nine, said that the lecture was particularly poignant because of the UN court’s recent decision.
“I thought [Sejdiu] presented the view of the government very well,” Matoshi said. “I was happy that Harvard invited him to speak, considering all that has happened in the past couple years in terms of independence and the recent ICJ decision.”

Updated 8:00 p.m. 
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers will return to Harvard after stepping down from his White House position at the end of 2010, according to a statement released by the White House.
Summers, who emerged as one of President Barack Obama’s closest economic advisers during the presidential campaign, has played a key role in crafting economic policy during the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.
“Over the past two years, he has helped guide us from the depths of the worst recession since the 1930s to renewed growth,” Obama said in a statement. “And while we have much work ahead to repair the damage done by the recession, we are on a better path thanks in no small measure to Larry’s wise counsel.”
Summers will continue to advise Obama as a member of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
“I’m looking forward to returning to Harvard to teach and write about the economic fundamentals of job creation and stable finance as well as the integration of rising and developing countries into the global system,” Summers said in a statement.
It is unclear what courses Summers will teach in the spring—he taught at the Harvard Kennedy School before leaving for Washington—but economics faculty are already anticipating his contribution.
“It’s great news for Harvard; I think it’s good news for Larry; I’m not sure it’s good news for the country. I think President Obama will have an impossible time replacing him and I expect he won’t try,” said Richard J. Zeckhauser, professor of political economy at the Kennedy School.
Currently the head of the National Economic Council, Summers has been tied to unpopular economic policies. Many of those policies, like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, helped end the economic contraction but have become politically unpopular as the current administration faces a backlash.
Summers has been at the center of economic policy making over the past year, serving as the head of the task force that oversaw last year’s bailout of the auto industry. He also structured large portions of the $787 billion stimulus act.
At Harvard, Summers’ five-year presidency was marred by controversies, feuding with prominent scholar Cornel West and supporting economics Professor Andrei Shleifer admist a federal lawsuit for alleged financial misconduct.
Though perpetually popular with undergraduates, Summers received a vote of no-confidence from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2005, a step that led to his 2006 resignation.
After leaving Mass. Hall, Summers took a one-year sabbatical before returning and left again in 2009 to join Obama’s economic team.
“Larry Summers is one of a number of distinguished Harvard faculty who took leave to serve the Government, continuing a long tradition of public service by Harvard faculty,” said Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin. “We look forward to his return.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing their stiffest competition so far on the young season, Harvard’s top coed and women’s sailing teams came away from this past weekend with some very promising results.
Competing against teams from up and down the Eastern seaboard, the Crimson relied on some key veteran leaders to hopefully set the tone for the remainder of the fall season.
“Overall, we had a very positive weekend and are looking forward to the next few weeks as we continue to face some of the best teams from around the region,” junior crew Alexandra Jumper said.
The coed squad provided the highlight of the weekend, as the team captured the Nevins Trophy over two days of competition at Kings Point, N.Y.
The women’s team used a strong finish in the A division to come away with a fifth-place showing at the Mrs. Hurst Bowl.
Two other coed contingents also competed on the weekend at regattas held in the New England region.
NEVINS TROPHY
Harvard sent its top coed sailors to the Nevins Trophy regatta held in Kings Point, N.Y., over the weekend, and the team edged out two sailing stalwarts in Georgetown and Boston College to bring home the team title in the 20-team field.
In the A division, senior skipper Alan Palmer teamed up with a fellow fourth-year, crew Quincy Bock, to place sixth, earning the Crimson’s only first-place finish among the 19 races that were contested across three divisions over the weekend.
Senior John Stokes skippered Harvard’s B-division boat to a runner-up effort, as senior Meghan Wareham and junior Marie Appel split time at crew.
Fourth-year veteran Tedd Himler finished fourth in the C-division, which was contested by individuals sailing in Laser boats.
“This weekend really proved a testament to our team’s depth in a quality field, as we were able to put together strong finishes in all three divisions,” Palmer said. “While we were not able to get in as many races as we would have hoped because of the lack of wind, it was nice that they called the regatta when they did, as we were the ones in the lead.”
WOMEN’S MRS. HURST BOWL
The Crimson women’s squad also had a strong showing this weekend, as the team placed fifth out of 19 teams at the Mrs. Hurst Bowl, hosted by Dartmouth on Mascoma Lake.
Junior skipper Emily Lambert and Jumper bested all of their A-division competition rather easily, finishing with a total of 25 points, which proved to be 18 points clear of the runner-up Brown Bears in the division.
Rookie skipper Morgan Russom and a fellow first-year, crew Isabel Ruane, had a bit more difficulty in the B division of competition, as the freshman duo sailed to an 11th place effort.
“Everything came together really nicely for us in the A division,” Jumper said. “The freshmen in the B division sailed well on Saturday, but it was a little rough for them on Sunday, which is to be expected as they continue to get used to being in the boat together and to the different tactics used in collegiate sailing.”
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
While Harvard’s top sailors finished strongly this weekend in their respective regattas, some of the Crimson’s other sailors experienced some difficulty, as a coed contingent struggled to a 17th place team effort in a field of 18 at the Hatch Brown Trophy regatta held at MIT.
Junior skipper Brendan Kopp and junior crew William White finished well in the A division of racing, placing second, but 17th and 16th place efforts in the B and C divisions, respectively, hurt Harvard’s overall chances in the team competition.
BOSTON HARBOR INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES TWO
Another Crimson coed squad placed 16th out of 18 teams at the Boston Harbor Invitational, hosted over the weekend by Boston College as the second installment of the Central Series of racing.
Coed freshmen and sophomores made up the contingent of sailors competing at this regatta for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike his journey back to Harvard, Andrew Hatch’s performance Saturday night could not have gone more smoothly.
The senior quarterback completed 20 of his 25 passes and had three touchdowns, leading the Harvard football team (1-0) to a sound 34-6 victory over Holy Cross (1-2) in the season opener at Harvard Stadium.
In front of 21,704 fans, Hatch passed for 276 yards, the most for a Crimson quarterback since 2008.
“I was a little surprised,” said junior wide receiver Levi Richards. “He played unbelievable. I thought he was going to play well, but I didn’t know he was going to come out guns-a-blazin’.”
Saturday night’s game was Hatch’s first in a Crimson uniform at the varsity level, last playing for Harvard as a freshman on the junior varsity team in 2005.
His Crimson playing career was then sidetracked by his one-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, two-year playing stint at Louisiana State University, and, after transferring back to Harvard, one-year restriction from play due to NCAA regulations regarding transfer students.
Thus, the season’s first contest had a special significance to Hatch.
“I’m just really trying to enjoy every minute of it and just really appreciating the chance to be out there,” Hatch said. “It just felt great.”
Hatch and the Crimson started the game on a high note, gaining three points on the first possession.
“It’s the first game, so there’s always a few butterflies for everyone going into it,” Hatch said. “It’s just nice to get some points on the first drive. That was a good way to start off.”
The Crimson did not relent, and with 1:52 remaining in the first quarter, Harvard scored its first touchdown on a four-yard run by senior running back Gino Gordon.
In the first possession of the second quarter, Hatch and the Crimson marched 82 yards downfield in just eight plays. The drive culminated in Hatch’s first passing touchdown of the season.
On the final play of the drive, Hatch quickly deciphered the Crusaders’ defense, noticing that Holy Cross planned to dissolve into a cover-three defense. This meant that senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi would only be covered by a linebacker.
“A receiver on a linebacker in most books is a mismatch,” Iannuzzi said. “So I think [Hatch] just identified the mismatch...and then he just threw a great deep ball there, and we caught it just inside the back of the endzone.”
Hatch’s strong play continued in the second half, as he threw two touchdown passes, both to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch.
The final score, a 43-yard pass, marked the end of a drive in which the Crimson required only three plays and 1:30 to travel 60 yards.
This efficiency characterized the Hatch-led offense, which had an average gain of 6.4 yards per play. In fact, the Crimson averaged 11.0 yards per passing play, as opposed to Holy Cross’ 4.3.
In addition to his strong passing, Hatch also ran for 39 yards, the second-highest total on the team. Often times Hatch’s scrambling ability turned near sacks into large gains.
In one instance, Hatch scrambled to his left, a difficult feat for a right-handed quarterback. He then dodged an oncoming Crusader, tucked the ball under his arm to run, and only at the last instant decided instead to throw a pass to Richards.
The junior wide receiver caught the pass, keying a Crimson score only moments later.
“[The Crusaders’ defense saw] he was going to run, and he made the choice to pull up and then pass the ball,” Iannuzzi said of the play. “It shows his field awareness [and] his quarterback smarts. He knows where his receivers are going to be.”
“I just think it shows overall athleticism,” he added.
Hatch has a tremendous impact as an off-the-field leader as well.
“He’s not a middle linebacker run-around [leader], he’s not like Sean Hayes of last year who would...dance around and get us pumped up in that way,” Iannuzzi said. “[He’s] more of a lead by example and lead by being a football player.”
“He’s just one of those quarterbacks who brings that calming presence into the huddle,” Richards added. “You’d walk off a cliff for the guy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some stories, you just know they’re  going to turn out all right.
They’re sad, their outlook is terrible, but you know they’ll get better.
There’s got to be a surprise happy ending, you think.
Because I hadn’t heard Jill Costello’s story before, I had thought I was listening to that kind of tale Saturday morning at crew practice.
Costello seemed like she had everything going for her. A coxswain for one of the top crew programs in the country, she led her California Golden Bears boat to a fourth-place finish at NCAAs three years in a row—twice in the varsity four and once in the first varsity eight.
So when I heard about the part where she got stage IV lung cancer, I figured she would have to recover, or that she must have already recovered.
I was wrong.
At only 21 years of age, Costello went to the hospital last year with what she thought was a stomachache—only to be diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.
She had never smoked a day in her life.
But impending death wasn’t going to stop Costello from living—or competing.
A look at Costello’s Twitter account reveals the following entry from May 25 of this year: “Practice at 10a, CT scans at 2p. Fingers crossed for good news please!!!”
The good news never came.
Fully aware that her days were running out, the coxswain led her crew to a fourth-place finish, pushing Cal to a second-place team finish at the 2010 NCAAs.
A few weeks later at the IRAs, Costello’s inspiration helped the Golden Bears’ men’s team to edge out Washington, the defending national champions, by 0.263 seconds to win the varsity eight national title.
Then on June 24, less than a month after placing fourth at NCAAs, Jill Costello passed away.
Though an ever-growing sport, the rowing community remains a small world, and when someone involved suffers, all are affected.
When Costello passed away, the news did not stay in California.
And now that fall has hit and students have returned to campus, athletes across the country are trying to further her message about lung cancer.
Some knew Costello personally, but many never had the privilege of meeting her; they have simply heard about her story through their shared connection to rowing.
Rowers nationwide have been participating in “Jog for Jill” events, sponsored by the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation.
On October 3, it will be our turn. The Radcliffe crew team will be participating in the  Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation Walk/Run for “Team Jog for Jill” in order to raise money for lung cancer research, in hopes of improving the survival rate of lung cancer patients from its current figure of 15.5 percent, essentially the same as it was 40 years ago.
For some reason, lung cancer often seems to fly under the radar.
Part of this is likely due to the obvious connection between lung cancer and smoking; for some, it’s difficult to sympathize with those who have a disease they seem to have brought upon themselves.
Unfortunately for people like Costello, while smoking can cause lung cancer, it’s not a prerequisite.
According to a July article in The New York Times, roughly 10 to 15 percent of those diagnosed with lung cancer have never been smokers and are left to suffer punishment for something they never even did.
While courage alone was not enough to keep her alive, Costello’s legacy continues to inspire those who knew her.
“I’ve admired Jill’s spirit since she was a senior at St. Ignatius and I was a freshman,” reflects sophomore rower Scout Moran, a high school teammate of Costello’s. “She was one of the upperclassmen who went to every trouble to make us feel included with her big smile and kind words.”
“I remember watching her in the boathouse, listening to her coach and engaging with her teammates, and she looked so excited to be there,” Moran adds. “While freshmen always look up to seniors on teams, Jill was something special.”
Before our coach Cory Bosworth, a Cal alum like Costello, had finished telling her story, my teammates and I had already silently agreed to participate in the Run, not only because we hoped the money our team could raise would make a difference, but also because we wanted to honor the memory of such a brave athlete.
We knew that we were “Just like Jill” (as her campaign is called), and that this could’ve happened to each and every one of us.
As Costello’s story proves all too well, lung cancer can touch anyone’s life—even a 21-year-old Division I athlete seemingly entering the prime of her life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University’s own Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 will get the nod this weekend at quarterback for the Buffalo Bills as they take on the New England Patriots. The alum played in 10 games last year for the Bills while fighting with embattled quarterback Trent Edwards for time. He completed 127 of 227 pass attempts for a completion rate of 55.9 percent while throwing for 1,422 yards, nine touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.
Fitzpatrick has wrestled the job away from long-time starter Edwards with coach Chan Galley intimating that Fitzpatrick could keep the spot if he performs well. While at Harvard, Fitzpatrick enjoyed considerably success, and ranks second on Harvard’s all-time list for touchdowns, yards passing, pass completions, and pass completion percentage. The two-time Ivy League champion earned the Ivy League MVP award during his senior season and is the only Harvard quarterback ever to rush for over 1,000 yards in a career.
Fitzpatrick takes the helm for the ailing Bills, who have failed to win either of their first two games of the 2010 campaign after another frustrating 7-9 season. One of the quarterback’s main goals will be to improve the worst-ranked passing offense in the league so far, a constraint that has certainly hurt the Bills to date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the men’s tennis team opens its fall tournament season this weekend, get the chance to get to know one of its top players, junior Alistair “Ali” Felton. In this exclusive interview, Felton reveals his coach’s addiction to a sandwich store, how tennis has prepared him for Quidditch, and his thoughts on the 2008 women’s French Open champion. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Alistair Felton 
Year: 2012
Stats: Last year, Felton went 6-8 in tournaments and 11-10 (6-2 Ivy) in dual play; he was positioned as high as the No. 2 court during the season. In doubles, Felton went 11-7 in fall tournaments, and 15-6 (5-1) in the spring. He will begin this season at the Northeast Invitational in Providence, R.I., this weekend.
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
For home matches, it'll be pasta and whatever HUDS cooked up. If it's an away game, we usually end up at the sandwich shop Jimmy John's, as our coach has a mild obsession with that place.
 
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I like to listen to some Scandinavian rock music whilst I'm walking over the river to the courts.
 
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
Columbia, because our matches are always very close and incredibly loud. Since I've been on the team, we've beaten them twice and they've beaten us twice, so a big rivalry has developed between us.
 
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Nothing much happens in our locker room, as it is so small that fitting more than four people in there at once is pretty ridiculous.
 
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
After missing an easy forehand in a match last year, I shouted, "I could have made that shot when I was 15!", which looking back was pretty pathetic.
 
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
A raccoon, as it can be both aggressive and cunning.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Against Yale last year, some fans cheered wildly and hung a letter 'A' from the viewing balcony every time our number one player hit an ace. There were 15 A's up by the end of the match, so I thought that was awesome.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Definitely the soccer team. It's the best sport in the world, and I love the atmosphere at the matches.
 
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
Erm, I guess a beater, as my skills at hitting a tennis ball might translate to batting away a flying bludger.
 
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
The Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanović; she's just beautiful and I think she'd be quite fun, too.

Every other Saturday the Peabody Museum hosts family programs, where children can interact with their parents in a well-disguised educational setting. This Saturday’s diversion was particularly sugar-coated. Hosted jointly by Taza Chocolate and the Peabody Museum, the event welcomed curious children, hungry parents, and a herd of chocolate fanatics in an exhibition called “Chocolate! From the Maya and Aztecs to Us.” Kids colored in drawings in the shape of Mayan ruins and taste-tested Taza’s delicious Mexican chocolate. Meanwhile, Roving Reporter attempted to milk the crowd for information, but as parents shook their heads and steered their children in the opposite direction, RR came to see that the event’s ending would be bittersweet.
Georgina Berard, volunteer
RR: So what is this drink?
GB: This is Chilean hot chocolate. It was the traditional Aztec ceremonial drink, which only the priests and lords were permitted to have. The Aztecs used the cacao drink for religious ceremonies in the same way that we use wine.
RR: Did it get them drunk?
GB: No, it was a sacred drink that was non-alcoholic. The French started all that stuff later on.
Alex Whitmore, Taza Chocolate employee
RR: They say life is like a box of chocolates—you never know what you’re going to get. You box the chocolates, so you know exactly what we’re going to get. How does it feel to have that kind of power?
AW: I don’t feel like it is power. I’m just a craftsperson who makes chocolate at the Taza factory on Windsor Street. There are twenty of us.
RR: Oh. How many kinds of chocolate do you make?
AW: Around twenty different kinds. Gaujillo Chili, Cinnamon, Vanilla Bean, Coffee—all kinds. We also make chocolate covered almonds and cashews. All our chocolate is dark. It’s all organic, all kosher.
Mariana Rodriguez, Cambridge-based psychotherapist with interest in chocolate
RR: What got you interested in chocolate?
MR: Boredom.
RR: Not hunger? Interesting.
MR: I’m fascinated by the history of chocolate and the effects of chocolate on the brain.
RR: What are those effects?
MR: Chocolate is an antidepressant. It lowers blood pressure. The endorphins in chocolate make us happy.
RR: Is chocolate like a drug?
MR: It is! Chocolate is called “The Love Amphetamine.” More women like chocolate than men. There is a saying that it makes women better kissers.
RR: Really? Do you give chocolate to your patients?
MR: I don’t, but I should!
Kathryn Kucharski, volunteer
RR: What did the ancient Aztecs use cacao for?
KK: The Aztecs used chocolate for religious ceremonies, but they also used cacao beans as currency. We use metal and paper because it grows in every area. It was the same with cacao for the Aztecs.
RR: And they could eat it?
KK: They would drink it.
RR: So they drank their currency?
KK: They made drinks out of the cacao, but also used it as money. When the Spanish came to Mexico they brought chocolate back to Spain and the American colonies, where people would invite one another over for chocolate just like we do for coffee.

In the break between your morning and afternoon classes this Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, you may decide to go back to your room for a quick nap or even get a bit of reading done. Or you could save three lives.The Harvard College Red Cross is hosting a blood drive at Northwest Labs and the Sheraton Commander Hotel (located on Garden Street, en route to the Quad) this week. The organization hopes to collect 207 pints of blood over the course of the three-day blood drive, according to Blood Services Director Christine H. Choi ’13. Most donors give one pint of blood, enough to help three separate patients in need of life-saving treatment. Your body can replace the pint of blood that it loses within just 24 hours, and the blood you donate might help an accident victim, a cancer patient, or a premature infant, according to the Red Cross website.
Blood of all types is needed. “For the summer, there have really been huge shortages of blood,” Choi said. “It’s been so hot that not a lot of people have been donating. It’s…a critical shortage. Definitely every pint counts.”
Most people who weigh at least 110 pounds are able to donate, though check the Red Cross eligibility guidelines to be sure. The entire process takes an hour or two, with the actual donation of blood just 5 to 15 minutes. Afterwards, you’ll be treated to cookies and juice. To donate right here at Harvard this week, sign up now.

Whether you want to blow off some steam after a six-hour pset session, get acquainted with the beautiful Cambridge outdoors, or are simply suffering from post-Annenberg fro-yo guilt, running around Harvard is a terrific solution. Not only are there spreads of scenic and quaint neighborhoods in our backyard, endless bike paths and sidewalks grace the entire Cambridge community. As fall approaches this is the perfect time to take advantage of cool breezes and autumn’s incredible foliage!
Even if you’re not a pavement junkie, you can always get out and run. So mix and match some friends, tunes, good shoes (or go au naturale like Harvard’s very own “Barefoot Professor,” Daniel Lieberman), and hit the street! We have come up with some especially popular routes for you to try. But you can always use Google Maps to make your own route.
 
Beginner Routes (1-3 miles) 
Along the River: Start from the intersection of JFK street and Memorial Drive. Run along the River to Eliot Bridge and back- 1.8 miles roundtrip. 
 
The Yard to Marathon Sports: Run north along Mass Ave. until you hit this large sporting goods store. 1.5 miles roundtrip. 
 
Up the Ante (3-6 miles) 
Fresh Pond: follow Garden Street (turns to Concord midway) all the way from the Yard to Fresh Pond. Try running around the pond for added 2.4 miles and some nature. 4.2 miles round trip. 
 
East Cambridge River Loop: Start from Memorial Church, run east to Broadway (street right before you hit Annenberg) until Ames Street (right after Galileo Galilei Way). Take a right on Ames and right again once you hit Memorial Drive. Follow Memorial Drive back to JFK Street. 5.3 miles with limited MIT territory. 
 
North Cambridge-MIT Loop: Follow Cambridge Street from the Science Center. Veer right (south) onto Edwin H. Land Blvd. Take another right onto Main Street (which becomes Broadway) and follow back to the Yard. 5 miles.  
 
Double Black Diamonds (6-10 miles) 
Charles Extreme: Eliot to Longfellow Bridge circuit following Memorial Drive and Soldiers Field Rd. This will get your heart racing. 9.2 miles. 
 
The Ocho: Run from Yard to Davis Square. Continue to Fresh Pond and then head down to Mt. Auburn Cemetery. Cross Arsenal St. Bridge and run along the Charles back to JFK. 8 miles. 
  
Before hibernating into the bitter and barren months of winter, trying out some awesome running routes is a great way to have fun and explore the area (while getting some exercise!). Harvard College Marathon Challenge has routes and more information about getting involved in the running community at Harvard. The Law School Running Club also has running support for all levels.
