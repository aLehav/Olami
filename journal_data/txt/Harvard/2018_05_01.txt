After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actress Lauren Kidwell plays Mother Abbess in the national tour of “The Sound of Music,” coming to the Boch Center Wang Theater from May 1 to 13. Kidwell was trained in Boston and has previously been seen in "Ragtime" and as a soloist with the Boston Gay Men's Chorus. The Harvard Crimson sat down to talk with her about theater, “The Sound of Music,” and what makes this show special. The only thing we didn't ask? How do you solve a problem like Maria?
The Harvard Crimson: Did you watch “The Sound of Music” as a child?Lauren Kidwell: Yes! 100 percent. I actually have three sisters and my dad, we all sing and so we were often compared to the von Trapp family.THC: If you're the von Trapps, which von Trapp are you?LK: That's a good question. It's a toss-up between Louisa and Brigitta, because I feel like I'm the nerdy one. I'll be like, "This is like this," and I'm always questioning, but Louisa's also kind of mischievous, so I have a little air of that too.THC: Did you have a favorite song that you liked to act out or sing along to?LK: It's funny that I'm actually playing Mother Abbess and singing “Climb Ev'ry Mountain” as my job now, because I grew up singing that song all the time. Like all of the wise older woman characters in every Rodgers and Hammerstein like "You'll Never Walk Alone" from “Carousel” and "Something Wonderful" from “The King and I.” I grew up singing all of those songs way younger than I should have been, but that's definitely one of those songs that I always sang, and of course “Do-Re-Mi,” and “My Favorite Things” that has now become a Christmas song, so “The Sound of Music” has always been a part of my life.THC: Speaking of singing older, how do you get into the headspace of Mother Abbess, who's older than you?LK: Well, that's something very new and specific that they changed about our production of “The Sound of Music” that they wanted the Mother Abbess character to be younger and not just kind of like sitting on her desk, older and doling out wisdom to Maria…[T]here's this journey that Mother Abbess goes through just as much as there is for Maria that if they made her younger that perhaps maybe she went through the same thing as Maria, you know? It was very typical of women in that time to get married and that was the only thing that they did and so perhaps she went through the exact same thing. Maybe she chose the church instead of marriage. So when Maria presents this situation to her, she actually has something to offer. And in the same sense that she's younger than her and Maria are more similar than they are different. There's actually a line in the show (it's a great moment in “My Favorite Things” which is actually sung between the Mother Abbess and Maria which is different from the movie) where we get to see the Mother Abbess kind of let loose and get in touch with her roots. Maria asks, "Where did you learn that song?" and [Mother Abbess] says, "I grew up on the mountains myself." So they have so much in common. I think that that's really great about what they've done with this production [when they] made her younger so that she can go on this journey and reaffirm her vows of faith.THC: That's a very cool twist. Are there any other changes that you think make this production special or different?LK: Oh yeah! I think most people are most familiar with the movie, so we are using the original production of “The Sound of Music,” so a lot of the song placement is different— “My Favorite Things” is different, “The Lonely Goatherd” is not with puppets or anything like that, so those are things that if you only know the movie will be different seeing the show for the first time on stage. But also, this particular production really wanted to focus—everyone knows that “The Sound of Music” is about family, and it's about the love story, and music. All of those are great themes and definitely present in ours, but they wanted to focus on the historical context and the humanity of the show: The von Trapps were real people. Austria 1938 with Germany knocking on their door was a real thing. And they wanted to infuse this production with a sense of urgency and energy and this lurking danger in the background that was very real for people in this time period…[This] keeps it moving and makes it incredibly powerful when the Nazis finally do make their presence known in the musical at the end.THC: Do you think that there's something about “The Sound of Music” that makes it either timeless or timely for the current moment?LK: Yes! Absolutely timeless. And it's because no matter what, there's always going to be some power that's doing wrong. That's been the history of humankind since we can remember. And, you know, when “The Sound of Music” was written it was so close to WWII and now we've had some time, but even now there's a huge political climate in this country and all over the world. What is powerful about “The Sound of Music” is, yes, in this story specifically it was Nazi Germany that was in power, but no matter what you want to replace...it's more important to tell the story of the people who say something about [this powerful regime], who do something about it, who react. That's what this story's about.
THC: You're coming back to Boston, which is where you went to school. Is there something in particular that makes theater in Boston special, compared to Los Angeles or New York City?LK: I fell in love with Boston the moment I got here: It was the first time I moved away from home. I had been in Southern California my whole life, and it's so exciting to be able to be in a city where I trained to be an actor and now I'm coming back as a professional actor, coming here through a tour. That's a surreal experience for me. I mean, Boston theater is really great, because it's such its own community. So much about LA and New York is that there are tours and there are people who are not necessarily New York-based or Southern California-based, they kind of travel through there. But Boston, the theater scene in Boston, the local theaters her—it's such a tight-knit group and there are so many people who've made their careers here.
THC: You are famously excellent at auditions. Do you have any advice for students when auditioning?LK: Yeah. My biggest thing that I tell people is to love it. And to choose material for auditions that you love. Not just material that you sound good doing, or that somebody gave you. If you go into an audition and you love who you are and you love your material, that reads volumes over the talent that you have. If you're talented, you're talented, and people are going to recognize that immediately as soon as you open your mouth. But what rings true is confidence and loving who you are and understanding who you are—that's as much a part of being an actor and being a performer. It's understanding yourself as much as it is understanding the material. THC: Last thoughts on what you would say to someone considering coming to the show?LK: I would say that if you're on the fence about coming to see “The Sound of Music” because you don't know anything about it, come see it because you're gonna love it no matter what. If you're on the fence because you do know “The Sound of Music” from the live recording, the musical, or the movie, I would say this production offers something completely fresh and completely new and if you think you know it, come see our show and we'll show you how you'll be surprised.

To the Editor:
In the April 27 op-ed entitled “The Case for Housing Reform,” the author asserts that for those students assigned to Quad housing, “[t]he housing experience is far more negative” than for those on the River. As a solution to this alleged problem, he proposes that all sophomores should suffer equally in the Quad before moving on to the promised banks of the Charles.
Not only does Levene offer no evidence to back up his claim, the evidence that does exist seems to point to the contrary: Though it is true that freshmen prefer River housing, the housing satisfaction levels of seniors graduating in recent years have been generally similar across all Houses. Despite the popular sentiment that the Quad is far away and undesirable, those who actually live there seem no less happy with their lot. Levene is proposing a solution to a problem that he can’t prove exists.
That being said, we do not disagree with Levene that the Housing Lottery is not one whose “benefits are distributed equally among the students.” It is truly unjust that no River House has its own student-run cafe or enormous lawn, and that most lack open social spaces akin to the Currier Treehouse, Pfoho Igloo, or Cabot Aquarium. It is a crying shame that not every Harvard undergraduate can enjoy a single room with square footage in the triple digits. That some students can graduate from Harvard having never learned how to make sense of a shuttle schedule (or even a shuttle-tracking app) really breaks our hearts.
We agree that “[i]t is fundamentally unfair that significantly worse housing options cost the same as significantly better ones.” In light of these inequities, we hope Harvard might refund what Levene has apparently been overcharged.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending time with the hundreds of women at the Business School’s 27th Annual Dynamic Women in Business Conference in February, I left motivated and inspired to find my next career. As I crossed Memorial Bridge back into Cambridge and to my own school, the Kennedy School, I grew ambivalent.
On Saturday, April 28, the Kennedy School hosted its first Women in Power Conference.
Why is this prestigious school of government only now joining the club?
It took 227 years since George Washington took office for Hillary Clinton to become the first female major party presidential nominee. Many hoped Clinton would break the presidential glass ceiling. But is it fair to expect we’d be ready for a female U.S. President when women are neither provided encouragement nor adequate training nor supported by their female peers to serve in these roles?
While a record-number of women are running in the 2018 elections, we still need to create more programming to encourage even more women to run.
Some such programs already exist. She Should Run aims to have 250,000 women running for elected office by 2030. Ignite hopes to get young women into politics through conferences and student-run organizations. Even HKS has an initiative, “From Harvard Square to the Oval Office,” run through its Women and Public Policy Program.
But although these steps are in the right direction, they do not get us far enough.
The next step is for women to unite in the face of male political dominance. We showed our latent political power when we banded together to fight sexual assault in the #MeToo movement and to fight wage discrimination in the equal-pay movement. The problem with these efforts, however, is that ultimately, they are only reactionary. These efforts came in response to women being victimized and treated unfairly.
Don’t women lack positive reasons to unite? Why does it feel like our wins have to be at the expense of men?
More importantly, why did it take Clinton’s loss for those of us at the Kennedy School to realize something may be off? As much as you slice and dice the data, she did not receive unanimous support from women.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came under fire for saying that there’s a “special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” We shouldn’t feel forced to support a woman simply because she’s the only woman there, but we need to get better at supporting and building morale and camaraderie among women.
A Harvard study that looked at entrepreneurs’ pitches found that when a man and a woman gave investors the exact same pitch, the investors preferred the pitches made by male entrepreneurs over the female entrepreneurs. Firms such as Female Founders Fund and Plum Alley combat this bias by pairing together female investors with female entrepreneurs.
Even then, financial support can only go so far.
So what should women do to increase female representation in positions of power?
We hear time and time again about the “boys’ club” in politics, business, and even academia. Having worked in finance, I’ve heard too many stories about women not getting invited to all-male golf outings or for after-work drinks. In a perfect world, we should be able to do all the things men can do, but the reality is that it’s much harder. Why not band together, embrace our femininity, and proudly form a “girls’ club”?
My proposal goes beyond forming an official women’s network or mentoring group. Women need to serve as both formal and informal mentors and sponsors for younger female colleagues. Women need to step in when our sisters get shut down in a meeting. We need to speak out for each other in good and bad times. I’m tired of hearing how women are our own worst enemies. We need to provide one another moral support.
Let’s get together as women to celebrate both the big and small victories. Let’s elevate one another and remember to pull other women forward as we advance in our own careers.
Only then can we really achieve the dream of being women in power.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You won’t have enough time for that.”
I sat across from my high school principal as she turned down my plan to give my graduation speech in English and Spanish. I couldn’t really fight back in the moment, thinking the time limit was very strict. I had a backup plan but was still unhappy that I couldn’t give my speech the way I had wanted to.
What had upset me the most was that what she was telling me in that moment was something I had been telling myself for a large part of my childhood: I didn’t have enough time for my parents. I didn’t have enough time to translate for them at parent-teacher conferences or doctor’s appointments. I didn’t have enough time to send an email for them or scan a document to be sent to Colombia. I didn’t even have enough time during my graduation speech for my own parents to understand what I was saying.
Having my principal deny my request to read my speech in English and Spanish helped me realize I took my parents for granted way more than I’m proud of. I thought we were experiencing the same things, but what I realize now is that my parents and I were growing up in the same household but in two different worlds. This Harvard education has given me the language to explain this, to explain the generation gap within my family. Though my parents and I all came around the same time, the gap of immigrating as children versus immigrating as adults shaped our experiences.
The spring of my freshman year, I took my first immigration class and learned the term “1.5 generation.” This describes people who immigrated before the age of 12. Before learning this, I had always considered myself a first-generation immigrant like my parents. Our immigrant identification and immigration status were supposed to connect us. We had a shared experience—a shared struggle.
It was only after learning more about what it meant to be part of the 1.5 generation myself that I started noticing just how much this generation gap presented itself in my life. I migrated with my mom and siblings when I was three years old. My dad came before us. My parents and I were destined to have different levels of difficulty navigating this country. While my parents did not have the opportunity to fully learn English, I was able to learn it in school. I was able to learn how to be American and speak this new language without an accent.
My siblings and I became everything my parents wished for us. They migrated to this country just so they could provide a better education for us. They lived vicariously through us. We went off to college and accomplished their goals. We became what they wanted us to become—but in the process, we grew further and further apart from them on our way to success.
I remember often being angry growing up because I felt like my parents were wasting my time. I was upset that they weren’t able to provide transportation for me. We grew up without a car because my parents didn’t want to risk driving without a license. I remember fighting with my siblings over who got stuck translating for my parents or teaching them how to use technology. I remember getting angry at them for wasting our precious time; now, I know very well how selfish I was being.
When the tables were turned, no request was too large for them. After all, they had left everything they had for us. They had left their family and home to give us the opportunity for a better future. We always came first.
For that, I’ve been working on being more grateful for the people who gave me life and the education I always thought I worked for on my own. I’ve been working on holding myself more accountable in acknowledging all I was able to do because of my parents. I’ve been trying to recognize where the generation gap most continues to manifest itself today.
On the day of my graduation, I dedicated a section of my speech to my parents, given in Spanish. Although I couldn’t give the whole thing in Spanish, I translated the speech for them to read themselves. They were responsible for my success, and deserved a million times more than I was able to give them.
I am now working on showing my appreciation for my parents by trying my best to integrate them into my studies. With the generation and language gap, it can be a bit difficult sometimes to explain what I’m studying. But after investing so much of their lives into me, it’s the least I can do. I may not have the exact language to explain things like fellowships, grants, or immigration theory in Spanish, but I’ll use the language they gave me as best I can to bring our worlds closer together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman self dreaded eating alone. Eating alone in Annenberg meant one of two things. I would either have to risk small talk with strangers, or come across as lonely and friendless. Dreading both, I tried my best to coordinate each of my meals with my roommates and fellow Cadets. When worst came to worst, I would message an acquaintance or two to join me, hoping to fill the gaps left by my friends’ busy schedules.
Surprisingly, my freshman self was largely successful in staving off lunchtime loneliness. My journal-sized agenda was full of lunches and dinners with “so-and-so,” each neatly checked off with blue or black ink. As I flipped through my agenda at the end of my freshman year, I was impressed with my capacity for last-minute scheduling. Almost every day was marked with a different meeting, and boy, it felt good to be busy. Back then, nothing was more fulfilling than reaffirming my worth with meaningless meals and meetings.
But something was missing. Though I met lots of interesting people, I had yet to truly get to know myself. It may sound strange, but one’s true self is an odd entity that, like any stranger, takes time to fully understand and befriend. In my case, getting to know my inner self was the result of two lessons: Learning to surmount unusual suffering, and learning to cope with loneliness.
Uncle Sam provided the first lesson. Though I’m no fan of tear gas, ticks, or hunger, I can now confidently say that the Army taught me how to control my primitive impulses and remain composed in the face of unusual physical and psychological stress. When you’re subjected to Fort Knox’s humidity and wildlife, as well as the ire and stupidity of your fellow Cadets, you’ll quickly learn how to subdue your cynical, uncivilized self.
However, your uncivilized self is only small part of your true inner self. The other major component—let’s call it your civilized self—is far less brutish and comprises a larger portion of your personality. To get in touch with it, you must spend time alone—not in an Army training camp, but in your room, in the dining hall, and just about anywhere else.
Now, I know what you’re thinking—that loneliness means nothing but sadness. But loneliness isn’t inherently harmful; like anything else, its impact comes down to how you approach it. And more likely than not, you’re letting your loneliness go to waste.
Most of us don’t fear loneliness itself, but rather the thoughts that come with it. When you’re alone, you’ve got no one to keep you company but your conscience, and for many of us, that’s absolutely terrifying. Luckily, the modern world gives us tools to distract us. Scrolling through Facebook, rewatching The Office, and drinking—these are fun distractions by which we regularly postpone conversing with our inner selves. Yet when that episode comes to an end and your hangover begins to recede, your inner thoughts are still there, waiting for you to acknowledge them.
Until recently, I had done a pretty good job of avoiding my inner self. ROTC-related work and my senior thesis provided me with plenty of stress to keep my conscience preoccupied. It wasn’t until I submitted my thesis that I was finally forced to acknowledge my inner self. You see, I had originally imagined my post-thesis life to evolve into a journey of drunk fun, not sober solitude. But though my schedule had suddenly opened up, everyone around me remained inundated with work.
With my thesis done and ROTC winding down, I had nothing to distract myself with as I ate alone and watched my friends work away. I tried listening to podcasts and music to keep the silence at bay, but quickly discovered that, when used to drown silence, even the most enjoyable songs become nothing but noise. Though podcasts and lyrics can provide us with glimpses of other lives, the stories they paint are largely forgetful when they’re used as nothing more than distractions for restless minds.
About a month or so ago, I decided to give instrumental music a try, hoping the lack of words would make a difference. I sat down, enjoyed a solitary dining hall breakfast, and let my mind forge thoughts to accompany my lyricless soundtrack. To my surprise, the experience was far from dreadful. For the first time in recent memory, I wasn’t thinking about the next day’s work or the following week’s to-do list; instead, I spent my breakfast calmly reflecting, reminiscing, and eating to the beat of some wordless electronic orchestra. As I walked to Russian class later that morning, I felt more at peace than I had ever felt during my last four years at Harvard.
Don’t get me wrong, I still like spending time with my friends and loved ones. But there’s something magical about setting some time aside to let your inner self wander. I now look forward to moments alone just as I do to meals with old friends. Because the truth is, once you’re content with your inner self, no lonely moment is ever truly spent alone.
A few mornings ago, I sat alone in my room, staring out over the Charles River as “rainy forest” by ihaveaface played in the background. I thought about my upcoming graduation. I thought about my family. I thought about meaningless things, like how to defeat the creatures from “A Quiet Place.” And you know what? There’s no other way I would have rather spent that morning, other than quietly thinking to myself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A troubling trend is emerging for consulting and financial firms’ recruiting efforts at Harvard. Recently, these companies have been shifting their recruitment schedules earlier and earlier in what has become a competition to attract talented students before other corporations can snap them up.
This trend parallels an even larger one: increasing student interest in finance and consulting jobs. Indeed, the culture that has incentivized finance and consulting businesses to start recruiting earlier is made possible by more students fighting for jobs in these fields. According to the Office of Career Services’ senior survey data, currently around a quarter of Harvard students choose to work in consulting and finance after graduation, a figure that ignores the percentage of alumni who come to those fields later.
Both of these developments are saddening, as they come at the expense of jobs in other fields such as public service. These careers, while not as financially lucrative, can greatly benefit society, which needs talented individuals who decide to pursue callings that fulfill both themselves and the public, even if these careers come with a smaller paycheck.
Ultimately, the job market is just that—a market. People weigh a variety of factors in their decision, but often choose the jobs that provide the greatest material incentives. We thus urge the University to make jobs that provide a direct service to society more enticing to students. Harvard offers a plethora of resources for students interested in finance or consulting, including on-campus interviews, an abundance of job postings on Crimson Careers, and targeted OCS advising. It should similarly offer more partnerships with outside public service groups such as non-governmental organizations, think tanks, and governments around the world.
This course of action will ameliorate the trend of students pursuing financial and consulting jobs, and it will combat the stigma that surrounds working in public service at Harvard. We have previously opined that this culture is a serious problem on Harvard’s campus, and support any measure that could mitigate this stigma’s damaging effects.
That the recruiting processes for finance and consulting firms is moving earlier also places an additional hurdle for low-income students. The finance and consulting industries already lack diversity, reflecting deeper systemic issues of privilege and bias. When Harvard’s culture overemphasizes the accessibility of finance jobs, and when Harvard allows financial and consulting firms to move their events earlier and earlier, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may feel increased pressure to enter these fields, while also having less resources available to them. They may lack the same family connections of their peers, and they may not yet have had time to develop close relationships with professors and other mentors. Additionally, they will not be given an opportunity to compare these jobs to public service opportunities, given the different time-frames. These students may feel more compelled to find a high-paying job, given their own families may not have as many financial resources.
The decision to pursue finance or consulting should never feel like students’ only, or default, option. This unfortunate scenario will occur if Harvard does not expand its support of students who are taking the road increasingly less traveled by pursuing public service after graduation.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust has formed a “review committee” to determine the exact “sequence of events” leading to the forcible arrest of a black undergraduate April 13 and to undertake a “systematic examination” of a wide variety of Harvard policies.
“The committee will start by determining the sequence of events leading to the student’s events,” Faust wrote in an email to students Monday. “This work must start with a focus on how the changing nature of our student body should influence the ways in which we address issues of College policy, mental health resources, and community policing.”
Harvard Law School and History professor Annette Gordon-Reed will chair the committee, according to Faust’s email. The group will include six other individuals including professors at the Business School, Kennedy School, Graduate School of Education, and Medical School, as well as a House faculty dean.
Faust wrote the committee’s work must “proceed with a special urgency” and that she has discussed the committee with President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow will take Harvard’s top job after Faust steps down from the presidency in June 2018.
“In consultation with President-elect Bacow, I have asked the committee to work intensively during the remaining weeks of the semester, to complete its work over the summer, and to make findings and initial recommendations in time for action before the start of the fall semester,” Faust wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson did not immediately respond to a question asking whether the committee's findings will be made public.
The forcible arrest took place roughly two weeks ago when three Cambridge Police Department officers and one Transit Police Department officer responded to calls about a naked man standing on Massachusetts Ave. around 9:09 p.m. April 13, the night of the College’s annual spring concert. In the physical altercation that followed, officers tackled the student to the ground before arresting the undergraduate—who was likely under the influence of narcotics—on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves toward the officers, spurring them to tackle the undergraduate. But eyewitnesses—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect and that the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by CPD shows the student standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers talk to him for at least several seconds. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality, and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Faust later called the incident “disturbing.” Harvard Law professors Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Dehlia Umunna, who lead the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, are now legally representing the student.
The arrest has roiled campus, generated national headlines, and drawn protest from Harvard students. In the days following the incident, a group of undergraduates formed a new advocacy group called Black Students Organizing for Change whose mission is to “hold Harvard University accountable for the safety of community members, particularly Black and Brown students,” as BSOC members wrote in an open letter to Harvard last week.
More than 300 University affiliates and 22 student groups had signed that letter—which demanded reform to certain Harvard structures and policies some say facilitated the April 13 arrest—as of Sunday morning.
The letter criticized Harvard’s initial response to the April 13 incident and called on the University to provide financial and academic support for the student and to publish a report detailing the events leading up to the undergraduate’s tackling and forcible arrest. The letter also demanded Harvard designate all drug and alcohol-related calls to Harvard University Health Services as medical emergencies, acquire a University-owned ambulance, and expedite hiring of “Black and Brown counselors” at Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services.
The letter requested that Harvard agree via written statement by May 1 to implement BSOC’s demands. Faust’s email—though it does not directly address all requests listed in the letter—meets that deadline.
Faust wrote Monday the review committee will begin its task by seeking input from Harvard affiliates and by “learning how other institutions address related issues.”
She wrote she has asked the committee to “ensure broad levels of student engagement” during this process and she encouraged students to share their thoughts with the committee via email by sending a message to reviewcommittee@harvard.edu.
A complete list of the members of the review committee is below:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 30, 2018 at 5:15 p.m.
University President Drew G. Faust has formed a “review committee” to determine the exact “sequence of events” leading to the forcible arrest of a black undergraduate April 13 and to undertake a “systematic examination” of a wide variety of Harvard policies.
“The committee will start by determining the sequence of events leading to the student’s events,” Faust wrote in an email to students Monday. The results of that determination will then "inform a more systematic examination of opportunities for improvement across a range of institutional activities," Faust wrote.
“This work must start with a focus on how the changing nature of our student body should influence the ways in which we address issues of College policy, mental health resources, and community policing," she added. 
Harvard Law School and History professor Annette Gordon-Reed will chair the committee, according to Faust’s email. The group will include six other individuals including professors at the Business School, Kennedy School, Graduate School of Education, and Medical School, as well as a House faculty dean.
Faust wrote the committee’s work must “proceed with a special urgency” and that she has discussed the committee with President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow will take Harvard’s top job after Faust steps down from the presidency in June 2018.
“In consultation with President-elect Bacow, I have asked the committee to work intensively during the remaining weeks of the semester, to complete its work over the summer, and to make findings and initial recommendations in time for action before the start of the fall semester,” Faust wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the committee's findings will be made public.
The forcible arrest took place roughly two weeks ago when three Cambridge Police Department officers and one Transit Police Department officer responded to calls about a naked man standing on Massachusetts Ave. around 9:09 p.m. April 13, the night of the College’s annual spring concert. In the physical altercation that followed, officers tackled the student to the ground before arresting the undergraduate—who was likely under the influence of narcotics—on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves toward the officers, spurring them to tackle the undergraduate. But eyewitnesses—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect and that the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by CPD shows the student standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers talk to him for at least several seconds. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality, and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Faust later called the incident “disturbing.” Harvard Law professors Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Dehlia Umunna, who lead the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute, are now legally representing the student.
The arrest has roiled campus, generated national headlines, and drawn protest from Harvard students. In the days following the incident, a group of undergraduates formed a new advocacy group called Black Students Organizing for Change whose mission is to “hold Harvard University accountable for the safety of community members, particularly Black and Brown students,” as BSOC members wrote in an open letter to Harvard last week.
More than 300 University affiliates and 22 student groups had signed that letter—which demanded reform to certain Harvard structures and policies some say facilitated the April 13 arrest—as of Sunday morning.
The letter criticized Harvard’s initial response to the April 13 incident and called on the University to provide financial and academic support for the student and to publish a report detailing the events leading up to the undergraduate’s tackling and forcible arrest. The letter also demanded Harvard designate all drug and alcohol-related calls to Harvard University Health Services as medical emergencies, acquire a University-owned ambulance, and expedite hiring of “Black and Brown counselors” at Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services.
The letter requested that Harvard agree via written statement by May 1 to implement BSOC’s demands. Faust’s email—though it does not directly address all requests listed in the letter—meets that deadline.
"If our faculty, students, and staff do not feel safe and supported, if they do not feel that the institution is committed to creating the conditions where they can succeed, then we must do better and we must act," Faust wrote. "It is clear, in light of the recent incident and the ensuing conversations, that there is work for us to do."
Members of BSOC declined to comment on Faust's announcement of the review committee.
But several students affiliated with the group sent emails over internal Harvard House and student group server lists Monday urging undergraduates to support the demands BSOC listed in its open letter. The BSOC emails suggested students email members of the review committee as well as various administrators.
"We're putting pressure on this committee and on some key administrators to o more than learn from it [the arrest[," one BSOC email reads. "We want Harvard administrators to take action and follow through on BSOC's concrete demands."
The email indicates HSOC hopes to ultimately convince at least 200 students to send four emails each to Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, review committee chair Gordon-Reed, and the review committee as a whole to "remind administrators that our concerns demand their immediate attention."
Faust wrote Monday the review committee will begin its task by seeking input from Harvard affiliates and by “learning how other institutions address related issues.”
She wrote she has asked the committee to “ensure broad levels of student engagement” during this process and she encouraged students to share their thoughts with the committee via email by sending a message to reviewcommittee@harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a new Ph.D. program at the Business School and will vote whether or not to approve course offerings for the 2018-2019 academic year at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
The Faculty first heard about the proposed Ph.D. program at its meeting last month, when Business School Dean Nitin Nohria presented a proposal to create a joint HBS and FAS Ph.D. degree in Business Administration. The proposal seeks to replace the existing Doctor of Business Administration degree currently offered by HBS to better reflect the scholarly nature of the work conducted by D.B.A. students.
The Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—voted to approve Nohria’s proposal in March, but its vote is purely advisory.
The Faculty will also vote on whether or not to approve a preliminary list of FAS courses for the next academic year, as typically occurs at the last faculty meeting of each academic year. The preliminary list includes courses for undergraduate students, graduate students, and Extension School students.
Though many course instructors have yet to finalize their courses' schedules and section information, the Faculty Council gave its initial approval of the courses at its meeting last week.
FAS is set to release a final list of course offerings in June.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris will also present a proposal concerning updates to the Q guide, an evaluation system students use to give feedback on professors and courses.
The Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy created a subcommittee last semester to reevaluate the Q guide in light of plans to move to the guide to a new platform in spring 2019, according to a report by the subcommittee.
“The decision to undertake this work was prompted by the recognition that the last review was conducted more than ten years ago, by faculty interest in improving the questions, and because our existing technology supporting the Q is obsolete,” the report reads.
The subcommittee is currently working with a survey design expert to draft new questions for the Q guide, according to the report. They also plan to hold focus groups with students to test the questions before piloting the questions with some courses in spring 2019.
At the meeting, Government Professor Dustin Tingley will also present a “syllabus discovery tool” he developed with the guidance of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 1, 2018 at 6:08 p.m.
Eight Harvard professors numbered among the 173 scholars, artists, and writers from the United States and Canada who won prestigious Guggenheim fellowships earlier this month.
History Professor Joyce E. Chaplin, Government and European Studies Professor Peter A. Hall, History Professor Jane Kamensky, Chinese Literature Professor Wai-yee Li, History of Science Professor Naomi Oreskes, Physics Professor Lisa Randall, Professor of Practice of Performance, Theater, and Media David M. Levine, and Sociology Professor Robert J. Sampson were awarded the 2018 iterations of the fellowship.
The Guggenheim Memorial Foundation—which awards the fellowships—was established in 1925. Out of approximately 3,000 applications, the foundation awards around 175 fellowships annually. According to the Guggenheim Foundation website, the purpose of the fellowship program is to “further the development of scholars and artists by assisting them to engage in research in any field of knowledge and creation in any of the arts, under the freest possible conditions.”
Hall received the fellowship for a project entitled “Renegotiating the Social Contract: The Politics of Economic Growth and Decline.” He said he plans to use the award to study the relationship between changes in the political economy and changes in electoral politics.
“Because I had been thinking about this project, I taught a new undergraduate seminar in government called ‘Revolt Against Globalization? How Political Economies Change,’” Hall said. “It was a great seminar, and it was an opportunity for me to think about some of the broad issues that this fellowship project involves with a group of really smart undergraduates.”
Chaplin was awarded the fellowship for a project entitled “The Franklin Stove: Heat and Life in the Little Ice Age,” which will examine climate change in colonial America. The first of its two parts is about settler colonialism and energy conservation in the 18th century, and the second is a compilation of manuscript notations on weather and climate from colonial almanacs.
“The Guggenheim Fellowships are really interesting in that they’re completely open-ended,” Chaplin said. “You don’t have to be in a particular place; you can go wherever you want to do the research, or the writing, or the art, or whatever you want to do.”
Sampson was awarded the fellowship for a project entitled “Becoming Marked: Navigating the Social Transformation of Crime and Punishment in America.” He plans to work on a book about the transition to adulthood under conditions of mass incarceration while on sabbatical next year.
“What I like about the fellowship is that it covers such a wide variety of disciplines,” Sampson said. “Artists, writers, and scholars alike. It’s pretty cool to be part of that community.”

CORRECTION: May 1, 2018

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis told a handful of undergraduates the College is reluctant to punish Harvard College Faith and Action—put on “administrative probation” after demoting a woman in a same-sex relationship—in part because Harvard does not want to be seen as waging war on Christianity, according to the students.
A small group of students met with Davis March 9 to discuss the terms of HCFA’s probation and whether Harvard plans to sanction the religious group further. The Crimson previously reported that HCFA’s probation will have little immediate practical effect—the group will not lose the ability to book rooms, recruit students, or receive Undergraduate Council funding as part of its year-long probation.
At the March 9 meeting, Davis said some administrators worried Harvard would be perceived as waging war on Christianity if the College punished HCFA further, according to four students in attendance who spoke only on the condition of anonymity to describe a confidential meeting.
In an email to The Crimson Thursday, Davis apologized for making this comment. He wrote that he spoke “off-handedly and flippantly.”
“There are no concerns on the part of the administration about being perceived as going to war with Christianity,” he wrote.
Davis specifically pointed in his email to remarks he made at the meeting that referenced University President Drew G. Faust. Two of the four students in attendance said they remember Davis asserting Faust does not want to be remembered as the Harvard president who declared war on Christianity, though two said they did not specifically remember this.
Davis was “referring to President Faust in my comments in such a way that I did not intend to be taken as they were,” he wrote. “I apologize for those comments and I am sorry for how the students I was meeting with took them.”
Davis noted he was not speaking on behalf of Harvard or on behalf of Faust. Referencing the alleged worry Harvard would be perceived as anti-Christian, Davis wrote “this was never a concern expressed by anyone involved with this situation.”
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson confirmed in an email that President Faust has not been involved in determining Harvard’s response to HCFA.
“As Associate Dean Davis pointed out, there is no suggestion that President Faust made the comments that seem to have been attributed to her. She did not,” Jackson wrote. “She has made no such comments, does not endorse the sentiment expressed, nor has she discussed the issue with Associate Dean Davis.”
“The matter has been handled by the College,” Jackson added.
Also at the meeting, Davis said there is still an ongoing investigation into HCFA and that the Office of Student Life is still trying to gather all the relevant facts, according to the four students. He said OSL administrators are meeting regularly with leaders of HCFA, the four students said.
Eunice A. N. Mwabe ’19 and Cooper B. Bryan ’19—the recently appointed co-presidents of HCFA—wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson they have been in communication with the OSL over the past few weeks.
“We have actively sought to engage with the OSL over the past two months,” Mwabe and Bryan wrote. “The OSL created a new category of punishment, ‘administrative probation,’ specifically for HCFA, and it has not outlined what is specifically required of HCFA to maintain status as a recognized student group.”
The OSL announced in February it had put HCFA on a year-long “probation” after finding the group had acted in a manner “grossly inconsistent” with the OSL’s guidelines for recognized student organizations—including Harvard’s non-discrimination policy. The Crimson reported Feb. 22 that the decision to punish HCFA was almost certainly linked to the group’s Sept. 2017 move to ask a woman in a same-sex relationship to resign from her leadership position within the organization.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane previously told The Crimson that, for HCFA to see its probationary status lifted, the group must disaffiliate from Christian Union, described as the organization’s “parent ministry” on HCFA’s website. Christian Union—a national organization that supports religious groups at all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford—currently provides HCFA with resources, funding, and ministry fellows who lead Bible courses.
“We have been and continue to be in compliance with Harvard’s policies,” Mwabe and Bryan wrote. “We have never received communication from the College that we are expected to cut ties with Christian Union.”
In early March, some students launched an email campaign urging administrators to more severely sanction HCFA. Earlier this month, undergraduates began circulating a separate petition criticizing OSL for not punishing HCFA more harshly.
“HCFA has never apologized for any wrongdoing, and while they have promised the OSL to disaffiliate from Christian Union, they clearly have not done so, as evidenced by their continued financial support,” the petition reads. “Harvard College can still stand by its queer and trans students.”
HCFA held a “Meet and Greet” at this year’s Visitas event for admitted students, according to the online Visitas schedule. The religious group was also present at the Visitas Activities Fair.
In response to HCFA’s presence at the activities fair—held in the Student Organization Center at Hilles—some students placed handwritten fliers around the building warning attendees of HCFA’s probationary status.
“ATTN: Visitors,” at least one flier read. “HCFA is on probation for anti-LGBT discrimination.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For months, the online voting records of the Undergraduate Council could be altered by any student with a valid College email address.
On being notified by The Crimson about the records' editable status last week, UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 changed the document on the Council’s website to “view only” mode, preventing non-UC members from altering its contents. He added  he would verify that the Fall 2017 records—the only records which appeared to have been affected—had not been changed by anyone who was not on the Council.
On Sunday evening, Boucher wrote in a text he had reviewed the spreadsheets’ “version history” and found no evidence the records had been “maliciously altered.”
The Fall 2017 voting records comprised two spreadsheets: one displayed a summary of all legislation passed by the Council, while the other showed how each representative cast their ballot on roll call votes—tallies in which individual Council members’ votes are recorded.
Boucher said the Council uses the minutes of its meetings, as opposed to these spreadsheets, for official record-keeping.
But the votes of individual representatives on roll-call votes—the contents of the second spreadsheet—do not appear on the minutes. It appears the formerly editable spreadsheet comprised the only documentation of this information.
Boucher confirmed in an interview that the spreadsheets could in fact be edited, calling it an “oversight.”
“The previous secretary of the UC was looking to compile all of the individual meeting minute notes from our general Council meeting into a single document of notes... and she had asked some other members of the Council to help her read through the records and consolidate it into one document,” Boucher said in an interview. “She had set it to ‘anyone at Harvard College... can edit’ so that [they] could append the document, and then had not changed it back afterwards.”
Boucher said he had seen no evidence that the minutes of past meetings, which also appear on the UC’s website, could ever have been edited by the public.
“We’re definitely confident that our original records were never able to be changed by anyone other than the secretary who had originally created them,” he said.
He added the Council plans to debut an entirely new website—a promise he and UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 repeatedly emphasized during their campaign—later this week.
Last Friday, a group calling itself the “Iran Cyber Security Group” briefly hacked the homepage of the UC’s website.

When Charles “Luke” McCloud entered Harvard Law School in 2008, he had no idea he would end up serving as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor.
“No, it’s not something I ever considered,” he said. “It was not something that I had given much thought to at all.”
In fact, McCloud said the idea of clerking hadn’t even crossed his mind until more than halfway through his time at the Law School.
“I decided that I wanted to clerk around the end of my second year,” McCloud said. “I’m not sure I knew exactly what a clerkship entailed before people started thinking about it at the end of the second year.”
He was able to land a clerkship with Judge Paul V. Niemeyer on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals before moving to D.C. to work at his current law firm, Williams & Connolly. Then, McCloud took another federal appellate clerkship—this time for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit, before finally making his way to the Supreme Court as Sotomayor’s clerk.
McCloud’s path from law school student to Supreme Court clerk is the dream of many law students around the country. Clerkships, which entail assisting judges and researching cases, are stepping stones to the most prestigious jobs in the legal world. Less than 40 newly minted lawyers get picked each year, and holding a degree with “Harvard” on it boosts their chances.
The path for some students who wish to clerk is not as smooth as McCloud’s, though. Following the highly selective process, some students find it challenging to navigate making crucial connections to land their ideal clerking jobs, while others face difficulties balancing their career choices with paying off student loans.
Landing a Supreme Court clerkship after graduation is not easy. Excellent grades and prior clerking experience are often prerequisites—and Ivy League pedigrees and law journal experience help.
The year-long position entails assisting a justice and researching cases, and those who aspire to be among the chosen few begin jockeying early for positions and accolades that will one day lead them to the nation’s highest court.
Since 2010, 310 individuals have clerked on the United States Supreme Court for all the current justices as well as retired Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O’Connor, and David H. Souter ’61 and the late Antonin G. Scalia.
Out of these 310 clerks, 292 had worked as a clerk for either a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals or another justice on the Supreme Court before taking their most recent clerkship position on the Supreme Court. Only 18 Supreme Court clerks since 2010 had previously clerked for judges at a U.S. district court or for a state court before clerking for a Supreme Court justice.
Procuring a highly coveted position at a lower court first, then, is a well-worn path Law students follow. More than a third of the clerks since 2010 had previously clerked at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in their previous clerkship job. Judges Merrick B. Garland ’74 and Kavanaugh had 25 and 23 of their clerks respectively move on to Supreme Court clerkships, the two highest represented judges.
“There is a perception among law students—and it bears out a little bit in the statistics—that certain judges are more likely to have connections to Supreme Court justices and to send their clerks onto the Supreme Court,” McCloud said. “So I think a lot of students who are thinking about possibly clerking for the Supreme Court are focused on getting their first clerkships with feeder judges.”
Harvard Law students have an advantage. “Feeder judges” like Garland and Kavanaugh often look to Harvard—Garland’s alma mater—when selecting their clerks, and Supreme Court justices up the legal food chain show similar preferences.
Currently, five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are Harvard Law graduates.
Since 2010, 78 of the 310 clerks on the U.S. Supreme Court came from Harvard Law School, the most number of clerks of any school. Yale Law School had the second representation with 74 clerks, meaning that Harvard and Yale combined for 151 clerks—almost half of all Supreme Court clerks since 2010.
Aaron L. Nielson, a Harvard Law School graduate and former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., said the Harvard name goes a long way.
“Harvard Law School is a name that gets looks. If you’re applying coming out of Harvard it’s helpful. Judges know that Harvard has a good law school,” Nielson said. “Often they know some of the professors there, a good number of them went to Harvard themselves, so coming out of Harvard certainly is an advantage on the clerkship hunt.”
The Law School has two full-time clerkship advisers, according to Kirsten Solberg, associate director of career services and director of judicial clerkships at the Law School’s Office of Career Services.
Harvard’s centuries-long relationship to the country’s top courts has entrenched an extensive network of individuals that students tap into as they go through the application process.
“We have a vast network of alumni judges, former clerks, and current clerks, not to mention faculty and staff, who actively support our applicants,” Solberg wrote.
Some justices are blunt about their preferences for applicants from Cambridge.
“I’m going to be picking from the law schools that basically are the hardest to get into,” the late Justice Antonin G. Scalia said in a 2009 speech at American University’s Washington College of Law. “They admit the best and the brightest, and they may not teach very well, but you can’t make a sow’s ear out of a silk purse. If they come in the best and the brightest, they’re probably going to leave the best and the brightest, O.K.?”
The path from Harvard to the Supreme Court is well-documented—and oft-criticized. Commentators and legal scholars have penned op-eds in publications like the Washington Post and USA Today, questioning the practice of recruiting heavily from Harvard and Yale.
The issue has divided Supreme Court justices themselves. Since 2005, Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan have hired a majority of their clerks from two law schools, Harvard and Yale, according to the National Law Journal articles cited by the Post. .
Justice Clarence Thomas, on the other hand, had hired from 23 different law schools between 2005 and 2017—including many outside of the top tier, according to the National Law Journal.
Thomas said in a 2010 speech that “smart bloggers” had referred to his crop of clerks as “third-tier trash.” That year, Thomas’s clerks hailed from Creighton, George Mason, George Washington, and Rutgers law schools. Addressing law students at the University of Florida, Thomas added, “That’s the attitude you’re up against.”
Even among Harvard Law students, though, the competition is tough.
According to McCloud, some students who wish to pursue clerkships feel that they need to participate in certain student organizations and develop strong relationships with particular professors to get there.
“I think the paths that people take to the Supreme Court are often pretty varied, but there certainly is a perception among students that you need to follow particular steps to set yourself up for success in getting clerkships generally and also specifically at the Supreme Court,” McCloud said.
There is some truth to this perception; Solberg wrote in her email that working for the Harvard Law Review can give prospective clerks a competitive edge.
“Working on a law school journal is common, because it involves substantive editing of experienced attorneys’ work and researching and writing shorter pieces of one’s own,” Solberg wrote.
Making the cut isn’t the final hurdle on the path to clerking at the Supreme Court; for those with hefty loan burdens, finances can pose an additional challenge.
Harvard came in sixth in a U.S. News & World Report ranking of American law schools whose 2017 graduates incurred the most debt. That ranking reported that the Class of 2017 graduated with an average of $162,672 in debt.
The Law School’s Low Income Protection Plan aims to assist students who choose to pursue careers in public interest and other low-paying legal jobs.
Students who participate in the Low Income Protection Plan have to be working in LIPP-eligible jobs which include government positions, clerkships, academic jobs, and low-paying private sector positions. Each month, participants pay back a portion of their student loans proportional to their income, and LIPP covers the rest.
Clerkships, however, comprise a special case. While students are clerking, their LIPP experiences are similar to any other LIPP-eligible job. After their clerkships have concluded, though, LIPP participants must work in another LIPP-eligible jobs or they are required to pay back the assistance they received from LIPP during their clerkship.
“If you take a position that’s not LIPP-eligible immediately after your clerkship, then you’re obligated to repay the clerkship you got,” Kenneth Lafler, assistant dean for student financial services at the Law School, said.
Lafler said this “long-standing policy” remains in place because the majority of clerks go into higher-paying private sector jobs following their clerkships.
“They will typically receive substantial signing bonuses when they go into those higher paying jobs,” Lafler said. “So they are looking at a relatively short period of time when their payments will be difficult to manage without LIPP assistance.”
Several LIPP participants—specifically those who have worked for several years in a LIPP-eligible job prior to clerking—have questioned the policy, though. Tanika P. Vigil, a 2014 graduate of the Law School, worked for an immigrant justice group before clerking for the Colorado Supreme Court. When she finished her clerkship, she took another LIPP-eligible job—but if she had moved to the private sector, she likely would have been obligated to pay back her clerkship.
“It’s an interesting approach because I also had completed several years of public interest service before clerking and they would not consider those years as essentially matching the clerking year,” Vigil said. “I think that’s a little bit concerning because it’s a relatively narrow way of looking at who should receive loan support while clerking.”
Last fall, a group of Harvard Law students and alumni formed the Coalition to Improve LIPP, an organization aimed at highlighting and addressing several issues LIPP participants had experienced while in the program.
Lafler pointed to other ways that students in that situation could pay back their loans, like transitioning into an extended payment plan or receiving an economic hardship forbearance.
“There are ways for people who are going to be in a high-paying position after their clerkship to manage their loans during that time and the tradeoff of having to put their loans in forbearance is more than compensated for by the bonuses they tend to receive when they go into high-paying jobs,” Lafler said.
The Coalition to Improve LIPP recently met with Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 and published an open letter outlining proposed changes to the LIPP program. Specific to clerkships, the Coalition wrote in a document attached to the letter that they are seeking to change the policy that says a LIPP participant who fails to maintain LIPP-eligibility post-clerking must pay back their loan in full. They propose making loans repayable based on the amount of money that a graduate’s new salary exceeds the LIPP eligible salary.
Joseph R. Kolker, a current law clerk at the U.S. District of Connecticut, has been working with the Coalition on this issue.
“There's an extremely simple solution for this,” Kolker wrote. “Instead of this cliff approach, LIPP could instead use a graduated scale (as LIPP already does in other contexts) to say that if your post-LIPP job isn't LIPP-eligible, then the amount of clerkship assistance that you repay to LIPP is based on the amount by which your salary exceeds your LIPP eligibility cap.”
In response to the open letter last month, Lafler wrote in a statement that he has been meeting with students in the coalition.
“The issues they raise are important and deserve careful consideration, and the Financial Aid Committee is engaged in that process right now,” he wrote.
LIPP participants are allotted a total of eight weeks of “transition time” in which they can receive LIPP assistance for the time between jobs. The transition assistance can be helpful to many students, but Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, president of the coalition, said that in the case of clerkships, it isn’t always enough.
“Clerkships have very definite start and end dates; those don’t always perfectly align with when a graduate’s next job starts or ends, and that leaves some number of weeks in between those jobs, and during that time graduates are whittling away at their eight weeks that they get over the course of the program,” Sandalow-Ash said.
Lafler again recommended that graduates put their loans into forbearance or defer them based on economic hardship.
Madison E. Condon, another Law School graduate and former clerk for Jane L. Kelly of the Eighth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, said in an interview that the fear of student loans certainly has deterred some Law graduates from entering into public interest careers.
“I definitely know a friend who went into a law firm job that would not have otherwise because of loans,” Condon said.
Condon took a LIPP-eligible job after her clerkship, so she is not required to repay the assistance LIPP gave her while she was clerking. Living in New York City on the salary of a LIPP-eligible job, though, has proven challenging, she said.
“I am on LIPP now. My salary is—I’m on a pretty standard fellowship salary which is $65,000, but I live in New York City so half of my after-tax income every month goes to rent and paying my percent of these loans back,” Condon said. “I’m 31, I just got married, it seems basically impossible that I would be able to stay in New York City and have kids on this income. That seems truly impossible.”
Still, Condon added that LIPP is extremely beneficial in supporting the work that she does.
“I do get a big check from Harvard twice a year which definitely is a help. Without LIPP, I couldn’t do this job, for sure,” Condon wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Over two dozen faculty, administrators, and students gathered in Leverett Library Theater Friday afternoon to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of proposed changes to undergraduate course enrollment in an off-the-record meeting.
The discussion came over a month after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences debated the merits of replacing “shopping week” for undergraduate with a pre-registration system at the March Faculty meeting
Currently, College students register for classes after “shopping week,” a one-week period at the beginning of the semester when students can walk in and out of classes before officially enrolling.
Around ten faculty members attended the meeting. Administrators—including FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris—were also present.
“We are committed to improving the academic experiences of our students,” Harris wrote in an emailed statement after the meeting. “We are seeking a reform of our current course selection process that will retain all or most of its advantages, while decreasing, ideally eliminating, its many disadvantages.”
“We are convinced that can be done,” Harris added.
Iris R. Feldman ’20 said shopping week has provided her an opportunity to explore classes outside of her comfort zone.
“I feel like it’s an amazing time to have an intellectual exploration that I feel like I wouldn’t be able to have otherwise,” she said.
Feldman added that if not for shopping week, her college career could have been different.
“I changed my concentration last month because of a class that I took during shopping period,” she said. “And I don’t think that would happen if we didn’t have this.”
Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Lecturer William J. Anderson said he supports switching to a pre-registration system, saying he views the issue “from the undergraduate educational perspective.”
Because enrollment numbers are not solidified until after shopping week, the number of teaching fellows for a class is often in flux.
“Especially in science classes, we really want to have students be able to take part in really cutting-edge research and you really need people who are well-trained to be able to supervise those labs,” Anderson said. “If we have to hire and screen people at the last minute...it leads to unnecessary restrictions in the numbers of students that can take the course.”
Anderson said he had compiled past enrollment data and found that teaching fellows who were hired late due to higher-than-expected enrollment figures fared significantly worse on the Q Guide—the College’s course rating website—than teaching fellows who were given earlier notice.
Social Studies Director of Undergraduate Studies Anya Bernstein Bassett said for some faculty members, the sight of students walking out during the middle of lecture to shop another class can be “stressful.”
"The fact that it’s the norm, that that’s okay, I think that sets up a relationship that then carries through,” Bassett said.
“It creates a dynamic where it’s okay to walk out on a class,” she said in an interview after the event. “And I think it makes the class, in the students’ minds, more disposable.”
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, said she was glad that the mixture of students, faculty, and administrators were able to meet and discuss the subject together.
“I hope everyone in the room was able to witness the complexity of this topic,” Palaniappan said. “It’s easy to get into our own minds and just think about it in terms of how this discussion impacts us.”
Harris wrote that potential changes to shopping week are still under consideration.
“We will continue to seek input from all those with a stake in this process—undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty—throughout the coming fall, and beyond, if necessary,” Harris wrote.
Palaniappan said she hopes student feedback “is taken into great consideration,” and that discussions are not held simply for the sake of having a discussion.
“I would definitely encourage more students to get involved in this conversation when we all get back on campus in the fall,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Neither Harvard nor the newly formed graduate student union have filed objections over the April 2018 unionization election within the seven-day period set by the National Labor Relations Board.
NLRB officials certified the results of the election Monday, after the deadline for appeals passed last Friday.
The unionization vote—which was the University’s second vote on the issue—took place April 18 and 19. The election saw 3,454 eligible student assistants weigh in on whether to unionize with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. The final tally, determined on April 20, fell in favor of unionizing with HGSU-UAW—56 percent of students who cast ballots voted to authorize the union to begin collectively bargaining with the University. Around 5,000 eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants are included in the proposed bargaining unit.
The absence of objections for the April election contrasts with the aftermath of Harvard’s first unionization election, held in Nov. 2016. In the days immediately following that election, both HGSU-UAW and the University filed separate objections before the NLRB.
In their arguments, union attorneys took issue with the completeness of University-generated eligible voter lists after over 1,000 ballots were cast by students whose legal names were either absent from or substituted with preferred names on voter rolls.  After two appeals, both the regional and national NLRB ruled that the lists did not meet agency standards and mandated the second election.
Union organizer Andrew B. Donnelly called the recent vote “smooth” both during and after the election. Several union organizers said in interviews last week that the union did not plan to file any objections and commended the University’s handling of election logistics.
University representatives have repeatedly declined to comment on whether Harvard plans to bargain with its newest union.
Donnelly wrote in an email that union organizers are “expecting the University to fulfill its commitment to bargain.”
“We’re taking [University spokesperson Anna G.] Cowenhoven at her word when she says, ‘Harvard appreciates student engagement on this important issue,’” Donnelly wrote, citing a statement from Cowenhoven to The Crimson immediately following the vote count.
In the days leading up to the election, members of the bargaining unit received a series of emails from administrators imploring them to familiarize themselves with unionization issues.
Since the vote count, the University has not sent any communications to students about the results of the election or the future of the union.
NLRB regional official Eugene M. Switzer and the NLRB Office of the Executive Secretary, which manages the docket of appeals and objections, could not be reached for comment.

This is part five of The Crimson’s five-part series analyzing exit polling data collected during Harvard’s 2018 unionization election. Read the first part here, the second part here, the third part here, and the fourth part here.
Students who voted “Yes” to unionization were two-and-a-half times more likely to disapprove of how Harvard handles issues of discrimination and sexual harassment than were students who voted “No,” according to an exit poll conducted by The Crimson.
Of those who reported disapproval, the vast majority—85 percent—voted in favor of unionization. By contrast, less than half—43 percent—of those who reported approval voted to unionize.
Of all respondents to The Crimson’s survey, students studying at the Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard College, and Harvard Law School were most likely to indicate they disapprove of the University’s handling of discrimination and sexual harassment. Each school saw over 60 percent of affiliated respondents indicate disapproval, respectively.
Overall, female respondents were roughly 20 percent more likely to report disapproval than were male respondents. A majority—53.5 percent—of women respondents indicated they disapprove of Harvard’s procedures for dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment. By comparison, 41.6 percent of male voters and 40 percent of gender-nonconforming voters did the same.
The Crimson’s survey also asked voters to give their opinions of individual administrators. A plurality of respondents indicated they approve of University President Drew G. Faust—48.6 percent. Reweighting responses by the official election vote count suggests that 50.5 percent of those who cast ballots in the election approve of Faust. Pro-union survey respondents were over six times more likely to disapprove of University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 than were their anti-union counterparts.
Eligible student assistants cast ballots April 18 and 19 to determine whether Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers would earn the right to collectively bargain with the University on their behalf. The final result showed 1,931 votes in favor of unionization and 1,523 against—a tally certified by the National Labor Relations Board Monday.
The Crimson conducted an exit poll on both days of the election, stationing reporters at the three polling locations in Cambridge, Longwood, and Allston for 78 percent of all hours the sites remained open. Reporters collected surveys from 1,295 voters, representing over a third of the total voting population.
The 23-question survey asked respondents for their opinions on collective bargaining, politics, and campus issues. Unless otherwise noted, the data presented in this story has not been corrected for any possible response bias (see below for methodology).
One exit survey question asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of the University’s handling of issues of discrimination and sexual harassments. Overall, 47.2 percent of respondents indicated they disapprove, 20 percent indicated they approve, and 32.8 percent indicated they have no opinion.
In the weeks up to the election, some union organizers argued establishing a union in Cambridge would help students advocate for better protections against sexual harassment.
Concerns over sexual misconduct recently spiked on campus—in March, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment over a 30-year period. Though administrators first sanctioned Dominguez for sexual misconduct in the early ’80s, he later rose through Harvard’s administrative ranks.
Following the Chronicle’s reporting, graduate students circulated a series of open letters expressing disappointment with how Harvard dealt with Dominguez across the decades.
Dominguez announced his retirement in March. The University has launched a Title IX investigation into the matter and the Government department has formed a committee to examine the culture that allowed Dominguez’s behavior to persist unchallenged for more than 30 years.
The Dominguez case and the #MeToo movement more broadly figured prominently in HSGU-UAW’s pitch to voters. Our Harvard Can Do Better, a campus anti-sexual assault group, endorsed the union in March and participated in organizing efforts in the weeks leading up to the election. The union also held events about the work of unions in combating sexual harassment.
Of survey respondents affiliated with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences students were more likely to report disapproval of the University’s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination than were their counterparts in the Sciences.
Specifically, 50 percent of respondents from the Arts and Humanities division and 65 percent of respondents from the Social Sciences division reported disapproval. By contrast, 34.9 percent of respondents from the Sciences division and 39.7 percent of GSAS students from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reported the same.
Another survey question asked whether respondents hold a favorable opinion, an unfavorable opinion, or no opinion of Faust.
Just 13.9 percent of survey respondents reported an unfavorable view of Faust. Around 49 percent indicated they view her favorably, while 37.5 percent said they have no opinion of the president.
Opponents of unionization were more likely to report approval of Faust than were supporters: 60 percent of survey respondents who voted “No” indicated they approve of the president, while 43.2 percent of “Yes” voters did the same.
Faust last gave an opinion on the issue of unionization in Sept. 2015, marking her only public remarks on the issue to date. At that time, Faust said she disapproved of the effort to unionize, arguing a union would change the nature of the “mentoring relationship” between graduate students and faculty.
She called the change “not appropriate.”
Asked for their views on Garber, a majority of respondents to The Crimson’s exit poll reported they have no opinion of the administrator—61.9 percent of pro-union voters and 61.6 percent of anti-union voters did so.
Anti-union voters generally held more favorable views of Garber than did pro-union voters. Of respondents who voted “No,” 34.5 percent indicated they have a favorable opinion of the Provost. Of respondents who voted “Yes,” 12.3 percent did the same.
Garber has played an active role in providing information about unionization since Harvard’s first unionization election in 2016. At the time, he wrote an email to students defending the University’s appeal to the National Labor Relations Board.
In the run-up to both elections, Garber sent emails highlighting resources Harvard provides for graduate students absent a bargaining unit.
During both elections, union organizers have criticized Garber’s communications to students, arguing his missives misrepresent graduate students’ ability to advocate for policy changes.
The data presented in this story is entirely sourced from the exit poll of eligible voters The Crimson conducted during the two days of the April 2018 unionization election.
Crimson analysis of the raw exit poll data indicated voters in favor of unionization were more likely to fill out the survey than were voters who voted against unionization. Specifically, The Crimson calculated an oversampling factor of 1.32 for respondents who reported voting “yes.” The Crimson’s survey specifically asked students whether they voted in the Nov. 2016 election and, if so, whether they had changed their mind on unionization since the first vote.
Using the responses to these questions, The Crimson calculated the 32 percent oversampling by taking the percentage of respondents who reported they voted yes in both the April 2018 and Nov. 2016 elections (out of all respondents who voted in the Nov. 2016 election and indicated they did not change their minds in the interim), then dividing it by the actual percentage of voters who voted in favor of unionization in Nov. 2016. The Crimson utilized this response bias factor, in addition to a geographic correction that reweighted the data by polling site, to infer that approximately 50.6 percent of eligible voters who cast ballots April 18 and 19 voted in favor of unionization.
The official vote count Friday revealed that roughly 56 percent of those who cast ballots voted in favor in unionization, leading to an overall oversampling factor of 1.23. Unless otherwise indicated, the data reported in this story is the raw data from the survey and has not been corrected for this apparent response bias.

UPDATED: May 3, 2018 at 1:45 p.m.
This is the first installment in a five-part series analyzing the results of The Crimson’s survey of the more than 1,000 members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s flagship faculty. Read the second installment here, the third installment here, and the fourth installment here, and the fifth installment here. 
A significant majority of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences—67 percent—believe the University should divest from fossil fuels, while a slightly smaller majority—55 percent—support the College’s controversial social group penalties, according to a faculty survey conducted by The Crimson.
While faculty broadly indicated they agree with Harvard’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life, a plurality of respondents reported they believe the administration handled the rollout of the policy “poorly” or “very poorly.” The sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from varsity team captaincies, campus leadership positions, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
The Crimson conducted a survey of Harvard’s flagship faculty over the course of two weeks in mid-April 2018. The results paint a picture of how the more than 1,000 members of FAS think about key University policies, life at Harvard, the national political climate, and pressing issues of sexual harassment both on campus and nationwide.
The 54-question survey garnered roughly 500 responses, representing over 40 percent of the faculty, though not all respondents answered each question. The survey, emailed to nearly every single member of the FAS, was open from April 17 to April 30 and was anonymous. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The past several years have seen the implementation of multiple milestone policies on campus, ranging from the historic social group penalties to updates to the decade-old General Education program. Then there are the policies yet to pass—including administrators’ repeated refusal to divest from fossil fuels and the possible elimination of “shopping week,” the class selection period held at the beginning of each semester and beloved by students.
The first installment of The Crimson’s faculty survey series examines how professors regard these key shifts.
Student calls for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels recently found new urgency—over the past three years, members of student advocacy group Divest Harvard twice occupied and shut down administrative buildings to protest Harvard’s ties to the coal industry. In April 2016, three Divest Harvard students were arrested for demonstrating in the downtown offices of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s endowment.
But University President Drew G. Faust has not budged, repeatedly arguing divestment would harm the health of Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment.
Most faculty agree with the protesters. In total, 67 percent of faculty respondents indicated they believe Harvard should divest from fossil fuels, while just 9 percent reported they disagree with that proposal.
Faculty opinions about divestment varied across academic divisions and by gender. The vast majority of Arts and Humanities respondents—81 percent—indicated they support divestment. A smaller majority of Sciences professors—55 percent—reported they support divestment.
Sixty-one percent of male respondents supported divestment, compared to 76 percent of female respondents.
Faculty also generally indicated they endorse the College’s roughly year-old social group policy. Asked whether they support Harvard’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life, 55 percent of respondents answered “Yes” while 25 percent answered “No.” The remaining 20 percent indicated they held no opinion.
Support for the policy differed along gender lines. Women were more likely to be supportive of the sanctions than were men—among female respondents, 66 percent indicated they support the policy, while 51 percent of male respondents did the same.
Faculty views on the sanctions also correlated with political leanings. Sixty-one percent of respondents who identified themselves as “liberal” or “very liberal” elsewhere on the survey supported the penalties, while just 35 percent of self-identified “moderate” or “conservative” respondents did so.
Professors reported feeling less content with the way administrators have debuted the policy. A plurality of respondents—46 percent—indicated they believe the College handled the rollout of the penalties “poorly” or “very poorly.”
By contrast, just 28 percent of respondents indicated they believe the College handled the rollout “well” or “very well.” Twenty-six percent reported holding no opinion.
Faust first announced the penalties in May 2016. Nearly two years of administrative deliberation followed—including the creation of two different committees, two Faculty-wide votes, and three separate reports totaling more than 90 pages. Administrators at times sought to revise the policy, once recommending Harvard ban social groups altogether. The Crimson reported in July 2017 that that suggestion garnered only seven votes from the 27-member committee that proposed it, making it the third-most popular option considered.
The committee later walked back its proposed ban and admitted it “did not reach consensus.” In Dec. 2017, the Harvard Corporation stepped in and voted to officially approve the original sanctions as debuted in 2016.
Nearly half of respondents—48 percent—indicated they approve of the Harvard Corporation’s decision to approve the social group policy. A quarter of respondents indicated they do not approve of the vote, while the remaining 27 percent said they neither agree nor disagree with the decision.
Faculty reported mixed opinions on whether administrative attempts to regulate undergraduate social life have affected their views of Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
Twenty-five percent of faculty respondents reported the sanctions have improved their opinion of Khurana’s job performance, while 28 percent reported the penalties worsened their opinion of his job performance. The remaining 47 percent reported the sanctions had no effect on how they see Khurana.
Faculty gave similar responses to a question asking how the sanctions affected their views of Faust’s job performance. Twenty-eight percent of respondents indicated the social group policy worsened their opinion of Faust’s job performance; 26 percent indicated the policy improved their opinion of her performance. A plurality—46 percent—indicated the sanctions did not affect their view of Faust.
Administrative attempts to regulate undergraduate social life also did not alter most faculty members’ opinions of Smith. The vast majority of respondents—roughly 70 percent—said the penalties did not change how they evaluate Smith’s job performance.
Respondents were split on whether the Faculty was properly consulted during the formulation of the College’s social group policy—a flashpoint for conflict across the past year-and-a-half. Thirty-five percent of respondents indicated they feel faculty gave enough input, while 29 percent reported feeling professors were not properly consulted. The additional 35 percent reported no opinion.
Overall, just 22 percent of those surveyed said they felt the University’s path to approving and implementing the College’s social group policy encroached on the authority of the Faculty.
Forty-four percent of respondents disagreed, while the remaining 34 percent indicated they had no opinion.
Faculty discontent with an alleged lack of involvement in crafting the sanctions led to at least two separate Faculty motions designed to kill the penalties over the past year. Only one of these motions came to a vote at a Faculty meeting, where it was ultimately defeated after 130 professors voted against while 90 voted in favor.
The Crimson’s survey comes at a time when administrators and faculty are plotting and positing major changes to Harvard’s undergraduate academic offerings.
At a faculty meeting early last month, professors discussed the benefits of instituting an early registration system and cancelling the long-running “shopping week,” a one-week period at the beginning of the semester during which students can freely walk in and out of classes before officially enrolling. The suggested registration system would require students to select classes they would like to take before the start of the semester.
A significant majority—about 66 percent—of respondents indicated they think Harvard should abandon shopping week and move to an early registration system. Twenty-three percent reported feeling neutral, while just 11 percent disagreed with the shift.
Professors in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences were more likely to support early registration than were Sciences and Engineering professors.
Faculty cited a number of concerns with shopping week. The Crimson’s survey offered a pre-written menu of possible complaints, though respondents could also write in their own grievances.
The most common complaint, selected by 39 percent of respondents, comprised “complications for graduate students and teaching fellows” inherent in the structure of shopping week. The second-most popular complaint comprised a “delay in teaching”—20 percent of respondents selected this option.
Administrators are currently reforming the College’s General Education requirements. The changes, approved in 2016, come in response to a May 2015 report that found the program was “failing on a variety of fronts.”  The changes—which would restructure and reclassify the classes required under the program—are set to take effect in fall 2019.
Professors offered mixed opinions on the General Education program currently in place at the College. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported they feel dissatisfied with the current program, while 30 percent reported they feel satisfied. The remaining 33 percent of survey-takers were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.
On average, respondents who identified themselves as tenured professors were less satisfied with the General Education program than were their non-tenured counterparts. Forty-nine percent of tenured respondents indicated they were dissatisfied, compared to 33 percent of non-tenured respondents.
Faculty held slightly more positive views of the new General Education program. Twenty-five percent of survey-takers indicated they feel satisfied with the new requirements, while 31 percent were dissatisfied. Roughly 44 percent reported feeling neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.
The Harvard Crimson collected electronic responses through the Qualtrics survey platform from April 17 to April 30, 2018.  A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,173 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced from Harvard directory information and departmental websites.
Of those faculty who received emails, 516 accessed the link to the survey.  A total of 498 participants answered at least one question, and 296 participants completed every question in the survey.  To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device.  This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University—information regarding gender, minority background, divisional affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents who identified themselves as ladder faculty, 34.5 percent were women and 16.2 percent were minorities. Based on data in the 2017 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 29.9 percent and 21.9 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
The Crimson previously reported that, in May 2015, 28.9 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty. By contrast, 42 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty with known divisional affiliations who were sent links to the survey, 317—or 28.5 percent—are affiliated with the Arts and Humanities, 341—or 30.6 percent—with the Social Sciences,  316—or 28.4 percent—with the Sciences, and 140—or 12.6 percent—with SEAS.  In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 39.9 percent reported an affiliation with the Arts and Humanities, 27.8 with the Social Sciences, 28.26 percent with the Sciences, and 7 percent with SEAS.
Broadly, the distribution of responses among each category tracked with the overall distribution of responses for the five central questions examined in the story.
Reweighting all responses by ladder status and divisional affiliation—the two demographic categories which saw the most significant areas of response discrepancy—produces nominal changes from the unadjusted results reported in the main body of the story.
Applying the adjustment to faculty opinion on divestment suggests that 30.75 percent of faculty strongly agree Harvard should divest, 33.48 percent agree, 25.82 percent are neutral, 6.49 percent disagree, and 3.46 percent strongly disagree.  By comparison, the unadjusted data shows that 33.15 percent of respondents strongly agree, 34.25 percent agree, 23.56 are neutral, 6.03 disagree, and 3.01 percent strongly disagree.
Adjusting data on faculty opinions of the College’s social group policy suggests that 54.68 percent of faculty broadly support Harvard’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life, 26.93 percent do not support the sanctions, and 18.39 percent have no opinion.  By comparison, the unadjusted data shows that 55.38 percent of respondents support the policy, 25 percent do not support the penalties, and 19.62 percent have no opinion.
Adjusting data on faculty opinions of the administrative rollout of the social group policy suggests that 3.59 percent of faculty believe the rollout went “very well,”  22.43 percent believe it went “well,” 32.30 percent believe it went “poorly,” 18.12 percent “very poorly,” and 23.68 percent have no opinion.  By comparison, the unadjusted data shows that 3.59 percent of respondents believe the rollout went “very well,” 24.84 percent believe it went “well,” 29.08 percent believe it went “poorly,” 16.67 percent “very poorly,” and 25.82 percent have no opinion.
Adjusting faculty opinion on the Gen Ed program suggests that 36 percent of faculty are dissatisfied, 36 percent are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 28 percent are satisfied.  By comparison, the unadjusted data shows that 37 percent of respondents are dissatisfied, 33 percent are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 30 percent are satisfied.
Adjusting data on faculty opinions of shopping week yields no changes greater than the precision of unadjusted data reported in the story.
Separately adjusting data on faculty opinions of all five issues discussed in the story by gender or minority background yielded no changes greater than plus or minus 0.8 percent to the response category percentages reported in this story. 
Editor's Note: This article has been updated to include a Methodology section discussing The Crimson's data-gathering procedures as well as the paper's understanding of the collected data, including corrections to the raw data made using publicly available information regarding the demographics of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 2, 2018
A previous headline accompanying this article incorrectly stated a majority of Harvard's Faculty of the Arts and Sciences support divestment and the sanctions. The headline has been amended to clarify that a majority of surveyed members of FAS support divestment and the sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one week, Penn will host the Ivy League Outdoor Heptagonal track and field championships. Harvard, however, sent 12 of its athletes down to the university a week early to get a test run of the facilities.
On Thursday, the Crimson track and field team made the six-hour trek down to Philadelphia for the historic Penn Relays, in addition to sending a few others on a trip to Stonehill for the Skyhawk Invitational, in this final week of preparation before the divisional championships. One of this year’s shorter treks for the team that has traveled to Texas and Kansas, Penn’s meet held annually since 1895 at the Franklin Field is no doubt the most historic.
The five-day meet is brings together athletes of all ages, from middle schoolers to Olympians. Seeking glory in the nation’s oldest and largest track meet, teams from around the world descend on the field. The stadium, housing 52,958 within its 122-year-old structure, stands proudly near the heart of the city.
Originally dubbed a carnival, the races are said to have popularized relays in America. This weekend for Harvard, however, long distance reigned supreme.
“Penn Relays has a great atmosphere,” freshman Anna Juul said. “It's so fun to race under the lights at such a historic meet.”
In a race of 102 contestants, Crimson freshman Hugo Milner pushed himself to the front of the men’s 5000-meter race group and crossed the finish line sixth. The rookie finished ahead of every other Ivy League competitor and behind only three other attached collegiate athletes. The sixth place finish took 14:09.77 to complete and was Milner’s season best in the event. Men’s cross country captain Tyler Spear finished 41st while freshman Matthew Pereira finished 45th in 14:33.07.
In the women’s variant of the race, freshman Abbe Goldstein ran in 16:41.33 to claim ninth among the field of 55. Sophomore Gillian Meeks finished not far behind in the 20th slot while classmate Brooke Starn took 43rd.
The 3000-meter steeplechase told a similar story. In front of a home crowd that included her parents, Philadelphia native Juul paced Harvard as the top finisher from the institution. The first-year grabbed 14th place in the competitive field, finishing second among Ancient Eight racers. Cornell’s Briar Brumley was the only Ivy League woman to finish ahead of Juul, outpacing her by just over a second to take the 13th spot.
“I was very happy with my performance,” Juul said. “The steeplechase has a huge learning curve, which can be very fun. It's not uncommon for newcomers, like myself, to drop as much as 20 seconds from race to race. It was awesome to ride that improvement curve at Penn, especially since my parents were able to see it.”
Senior Fiona Davis also landed among the top 20 for the Crimson, placing 12th in the women’s 10,000-meter race. The senior was the first Ancient Eight runner to complete the event, doing so in 36:10.21.
While 12 runners traveled to the City of Brotherly Love, eight more took the short trip to Stonehill’s Skyhawk Invitational held in Easton, Mass.
Overall, Harvard placed ninth in the men’s events and 13th in the women’s, though the group was competing with a reduced squad.
Freshman pole vaulter Erick Duffy headlined for the Crimson taking the only gold for the team in the meet. The rookie hit the 5.07 meter jump on his third and final attempt, just out-leaping junior teammate Ian West in the event. Missing the 5.07 jump, the junior finished with the silver medal and a successful 4.85 meter jump. The duo out-performed the next closest competitor by over a foot.
“Being able to go to a meet and get the win is very exciting for me,” Duffy said. “I struggled at the beginning of the season and finally feel like things are starting to come together for me.”
Freshman Kahlil Wassell doubled dipped on Saturday, placing in the top-10 of two different events. First, Wassell grabbed fourth in the 200-meter, crossing the line 22.84 seconds after the gunshot. In the 100-meter, the rookie sprinted into a headwind, taking eighth on 11.27 second race.
The 800-meter event merited two top finishers for Harvard. Senior Annika Gompers hit a personal record and finished eighth in 2:14.51. Eliza Rego followed three seconds and three positions behind her teammate taking 11th.
Next week, the entirety of both teams heads down to Franklin Field for the Ivy League Heptagonal Outdoor Championships. Right now, the Crimson women’s team is No. 1 in the division and No. 4 in the Northeast Regional rankings.
“I will be racing the steeple, and possibly a relay, at Heps,” Juul said. “The Ivy League has a very competitive steeplechase field, so it will certainly be a good race. I'm recovering from a cold right now, but I should be ready to compete on Saturday.”
The women’s team has won the meet the last four years in a row, while the men haven’t finished above fourth in the last three seasons.
“The team has been doing very well as a whole,” Duffy said. “People are coming back from injuries, setting college and all time bests, and looking really good coming into championship season. I’m excited to be a part of this team. We can do something really special if everyone does what I know they can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Year by year, victory and the Radcliffe heavyweight women’s crew have simply become synonymous at Eastern Sprints.
In an athletic display of prowess that can only be analogized to the dynasties of the Chicago Bulls in the 90’s and the New England Patriots of the 21st century, the No. 17 ranked Black and White captured the Eastern Sprints Championship for the fourth year in a row.
After a loss to No. 5 Yale last weekend in which the team had different lineups for the 1V and 2V boats, Radcliffe responded strongly against the rest of the field on Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester, Mass.
“We had a bit of a switched up lineup and changed our people around between the 1V and the 2V, so this week we really tried to just keep them the same and work with our new lineups,” said women’s heavyweight co-captain Sofia Donnecke. “I think that really helped both boats a lot in the race.”
After a morning race in which the first varsity eight, stroked by sophomore Grace Eysenbach and coxed by sophomore Katherine Paglione, won its heat by four seconds in 6:33.506. The team managed an even stronger performance in the afternoon with a 6:27.709 finish, almost four seconds ahead of second place Dartmouth.
“We did have a slower time than two other boats we were facing in the final, so we were pretty nervous, but in the end, we had a pretty good first 1000, but we were in second place,” Donnecke said. “Then around the 1000, we had a really good rhythm and in the third 500, we rowed right through Dartmouth, and it was actually pretty exciting. Then we finished ahead of them with open water. It was a very fun race.”
The second varsity eight and fourth varsity eight for the Black and White also both placed first in their respective grand finals, with times of 6:45.710 and 7:24.982, respectively.
The No. 6 Radcliffe heavyweight crew also traveled to Lake Quinsigamond for Eastern Sprints. The Black and White took fifth in the first varsity eight in 7:08.386, finishing 15 seconds behind No. 2 Boston University, the winners of the event.
Radcliffe’s best finish occurred in the third varsity eight, in which the team finished third in 7:50.397, edging out No. 4 Princeton, which finished in 7:50.945.
In Derby, Conn., the previously undefeated No. 1 Harvard men’s lightweight crew conceded its first losses of the season at the Goldthwait and Vogel Cups against Ancient Eight rivals No. 4 Yale and No. 5 Princeton.
In the first varsity eight, Princeton pulled ahead in 5:42.70 and Yale finished a second behind in 5:43.90, while the Crimson trailed five seconds behind in 5:48.97. Harvard would not take a race over the weekend except in the fifth varsity eight, which is won by over 20 seconds over Princeton.
Riding high on back-to-back victorious weekends, the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew entered its matchup against No. 6 Northeastern looking to end its dual race season on a strong note. The team took to the Charles River to battle against its neighbor.
“First of all, it’s a dual of the Charles, and we’ve got two home teams racing on the basin, and there’s a lot of pride in that,” senior Cole Durbin said. “Northeastern is a strong program, and we prepare hard for this race and I think that certainly some weight in it being the final race. We have a few seniors in the boat, myself included, for whom it was their last race. I grew up in high school coxing on the Charles, so it was my last race after 10 years racing on that river, so it was an important race for a lot of us, but I think we were happy with how it went and how we prepared for it. It was a good one.”
With a methodical patience and unwavering grit that can only be compared to the colonists during the Battle of Saratoga of the Revolutionary War or to the cool composure of Michael Jordan as he drained a jump shot over Bryon Russell to win the 1998 Finals for the Bulls, the heavyweight A boat, stroked by junior Arthur Doyle and coxed by Durbin, relied on a last second surge to pull away from the Huskies to capture the Smith by less than half a second in 6:06.800. Northeastern’s boat finished in 6:07.229.
“We were very strong out of the start and took an early lead in the race,” Durbin said. “Northeastern, to their credit, had a very strong middle of the race and fought back and didn’t let us go. It took a good sprint in the last 200 meters or so to get our bow in front, so it was certainly a hard fought race. It was close racing. Those are the most exciting races, the most fun in some respects.”
Although Durbin said that the team wants to continue to improve its margins, he said that the team is ultimately excited for the what the championship season will bring.
“There’s a lot of excitement moving into the championship season,” Durbin said. “We look forward to these races all season. The dual races are great and they are sort of one animal and the championships season is a whole different animal in terms of getting the lineups six boats across, and there’s a little bit more on the line. We’re looking forward to that. The whole team is really starting to dial in right now in terms of that goal and it’s really sort of crunch time right now in terms of both wrapping up the semester and also really starting to focus on these races that really matter the most for us.”

In case our tips for getting cuffed this semester didn’t come through for you, and the last few weeks  of school has brought on a wave of desperation, here are some last ditch attempts to snag your crush before the semester ends.
Be their sugar daddy/mommy (we all know you still got that BoardPlus to spend).
No dough? No problem. Now that the semester is coming to an end, we know you’re looking for ways to spend that BoardPlus you’ve probably been saving up (not by virtue of  being a thrifty saver but by virtue of forgetfulness). Now’s the time to impress your crush by flaunting all that BoardPlus and sweeping them off their feet at your romantic location of choice whether that be Lamont Cafe, Cambridge Queen’s Head, or any of these other charming BoardPlus-accepting dining options.
Be the company to their misery.
Misery loves company, and the only thing better than crying over your impending finals alone is showing your crush your sensitive side. Honestly, we all know you weren’t gonna start studying until the day before your final anyway, so why not find a buddy to Netflix & Procrastinate with? Pro tip: bring tissues to the library with you and show your crush that you’re a survivalist and always prepared.
Look hella good at formal.
Honestly, if you’re looking A1 at formal and your crush still isn’t into you, you might want to whip out that eye exam chart because there’s a good chance an optometrist appointment might be in order. Either that or maybe you need to invest in some dance lessons. Honestly, it’s probably both.
With these tips, there’s no way you’ll take the L (because we all know we’ve taken enough of those this year). Best-case scenario: you snag your crush. Worst-case scenario: you have the entire summer to forget about your failed attempts. Honestly, what do you have to lose?
