After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One effort springing from the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, is a concerted drive to register more voters in that community. Ferguson is 70 percent black, but its mayor, five of its six city councilors, and 94 percent of its police department are white.This disparity is partly attributable to the town’s poor voter turnout: according to the New York Times, the current mayor “won a second term…with 1,314 votes from…the city’s 12,000 registered voters.”
The situation in Ferguson underscores the extent to which local elections and down-ballot state races have an enormous effect on people’s lives. Sometimes,such elections have to do with the right to vote itself.In Florida, for example, an elected judiciary has recently waded into the issue of whether the state’s new congressional districts pass constitutional muster. In Ohio, the incumbent secretary of state has promulgated rules to limit early voting. In both cases, elected officials who lack the prominence of governors or senators have made decisions with serious ramifications for citizens’ political rights.
Down-ballot races affect American democracy in other arenas as well. Big business often targets judicial elections in an effort to elect justices more amenable to tort reform legislation. While intended to stop frivolous lawsuits, tort reform laws often restrict access to the courtroom for consumers and others with legitimate claims.  Meanwhile, recent mayoral ballots in New York and Newark have shown that local races have a profound effect on educational policy, as urban electorates have turned away from reform-minded mayors like Michael Bloomberg and Corey Booker and towards union-backed candidates like Bill DeBlasio and Ras Baraka.
These less noticed elections are also indicative of the growing influence of outside, special interest money at every level of government. To take one example, conservative groups produced negative ads aimed at North Carolina supreme court justices in that state’s May elections.
Given the power of less prominent office holders, voter engagement in elections that take place off the presidential cycle and which draw less attention than races with obvious national implications is crucial. As noted, sometimes engagement in off years can determine who can be engaged in bigger contests: Florida has twice proven that bad secretaries of state have broad consequences.
With the effect of these races in mind, Harvard students and people in the wider community should not forget that Tuesday, September 9, is primary day in Massachusetts. In a crowded Democratic field, 21 percentof voters are still undecided in the race for governor, a number that balloons to 74 percent for the lieutenant governor’s race, 50 percent in the attorney general’s race, and 60 percent in the race for treasurer.
All three of those down-ballot contests deserve more attention from the electorate. The Massachusetts’ lieutenant governorship is not the most useful office; the Commonwealth hasn’t had one for over a year. But consider what other holders of the position have done: voters elected then-Lieutenant Governor John Kerry to the United States Senate in 1984.  Might Democratic candidates Steve Kerrigan, Leeland Cheung (a Cambridge City Councilor), or Mike Lake be next?
For its part, the attorney general’s office has more powers than many might believe. Candidate Warren Tolman has pledged to use Massachusetts’ consumer protection laws to mandate smart gun technology on new guns. His opponent, Maura Healey ’92, has argued that such a mandate must come from the legislature. In short, voters have a real choice: A candidate with a clear plan for immediate implementation, or one with a more staid perspective. (Full disclosure: Tolman is a longtime family friend and I’ve worked on Mr. Tolman’s campaign.)
Finally, with its control over the investment of the state’s money, its management of the lottery, and its influence on pension policy, the treasurer’s office can have a significant effect on what revenue is available for infrastructure and education. Voters should spend time determining whether Deb Goldberg, Barry Finegold, or Tom Conroy will be a better steward of their tax dollars.
No matter whom he or she chooses, every resident of Massachusetts should head to the polls on September 9. Whether as a political stepping-stone, a champion for victims of gun violence, or a smart conservator of our common wealth, each down-ballot office presents voters with a real chance to influence their state. They should not pass up the opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Allston Education Portal recently revealed new plans for a community facility that will include performing arts space, an innovation studio, meeting spaces, and an art gallery. The development is part of a broader community benefits package that is one aspect of Harvard’s long-term plan for building in Allston.
We support the creation of a community space in Allston as part of Harvard’s development in the area. Harvard should continue to demonstrate its commitment to the community of Allston by providing tangible, important benefits to the community. To that end, while we greatly support the development of the community facility, we also stress the importance of Harvard’s previous promise to fund ideas related to housing and education, which would provide many opportunities for the community.
Harvard has an obligation to support and assist the community in Allston, especially since Harvard will not pay taxes on its land holdings there. Harvard’s efforts will also compensate for some of the potential disruptions to the Allston community, from traffic noise, as construction begins.
But it is not just because of Harvard’s obligations that we support this plan. We believe that Harvard has the potential to create remarkable opportunities for the community. Bringing more students, professors, and staff to the area would increase traffic to stores and boost the area’s economy, while the educational opportunities that Harvard can offer to community members is unparalleled. Harvard, as an institution with vast resources and great academic strength, has the ability to strengthen Allston by providing great economic benefits, offering innovative housing packages, and putting forth new educational opportunities.
We believe that Harvard is on the right path to accomplishing these objectives. We applaud its efforts, and stress the necessity of continually revisiting its plans and meeting with members of the Allston community to ascertain that it is doing its utmost to fulfill its obligations and seize the opportunity to make Allston a more vibrant community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard recently renovated and renamed Old Quincy, a single-building portion of the College’s larger Quincy House, and originally part of Leverett House. The College reopened the new building, now dubbed Stone Hall, in fall 2013 after a yearlong renovation. On a return to campus this summer, I had the opportunity to tour the remodeled Old Quincy—a place I lived for all three upper-class years a decade ago—and was quite disappointed with the focus of the remodel: single rooms. As the College continues remodeling our houses, it should consider some national trends and be patient enough to ensure the new designs ensure a good student experience.
Old Quincy’s renovation and reorientation mark the first renovation in a full-scale facelift that the school plans to give to its residential Houses. Calling the project “House Renewal,” Harvard has plans to revamp all of its Houses—in terms of both their programs and their physical appearance. The plan began in 2008, and the opening of Stone House officially marks the first complete construction project. Students are living in Leverett’s newly-renovated McKinlock Hall this fall.
It's obvious that providing students with adequate space and updated resources is a positive step. However, despite the College’s best efforts, the renovations to Stone Hall—and the plans for other House renovations—fall short in one specific and significant way: they offer more single-room living to students than ever before. Old Quincy, once dominated by shared rooms or suites, now is dominated by individual rooms with no suite connection; students don’t have roommates. While the option to have a room of one's own might appeal to many students looking for privacy and independence during college, having a single room instead of a shared space could very well be a huge detriment to new college students in terms of socialization and development.
My Harvard experience was shaped by shared space. It was the friendship with my roommate, our use of common spaces to host friends—and, as it were, to plan an activism campaign or two—getting to know so very well those who shared our entryway, some who remain close friends and colleagues, and really being able to “own” a part of the house that gave the experience character and charm and quirk. It forced us to not be too inward, to not use our room as a monastic cell of academic pursuit, but rather to make the campus our respite and our studies borne with perspective. My study carrel in Widener was where I went for quiet, focused isolation. I didn’t need to go often.
We live in a world where few notable endeavors are singular in nature. Whether in academia or business, politics, or journalism, our professional lives require us to constantly interact with and depend on our peers. Living a social, engaged life in Old Quincy was a perfect setup for leaving the ivy walls of Harvard and hitting the ground running. These days I spend my time building and investing in startups. The rise of co-working spaces and open labs should come as no surprise; they are effective and efficient and useful. Important work happens in an inherently social environment with little appreciation for personal space but a large premium on collaboration.
But the data go further. Although there is no conclusive study proving the drawbacks of living in a single dorm room, there are many experts who agree that isolating students in the early years of college can hinder their socialization. In an Atlantic piece exploring single rooming situations, Miami University of Ohio Professor Marcia Baxter Magolda addressed the risks of housing a college student alone, stating, "Learning to interact effectively with others is a central element of success in adult life in both work and personal contexts." Magolda conducted a longitudinal study on young adult development and explained that it is beneficial for students to learn to handle the complex world they live in by being regularly exposed to different perspectives, ethics and relationships, and that a great way to do this is having a college roommate. Dalton Conley, Dean of Social Sciences of NYU, agrees.  He explains that living with roommates, rather than in a single dorm room, is a great way to teach young adults to be tolerant and adaptable.
The College’s view is that these exceptionally small rooms will in fact encourage life in similarly revamped common rooms. But I fear the opposite will be true: Students will instead shut themselves in their rooms, spending their time in solitary pursuits and moving their socializing online. When instead your personal space is more communal, you are forced to do the hard work and be social – not just virtually so. Dorm rooms should not turn us inward.
By providing students with private space in which they can engage in “social” media rather than facilitating face-to-face interactions in shared dorm rooms, Harvard is actually impeding the growth of its undergraduates. Before the school finishes renewing the rest of its housing, it might consider improving facilities as they are—spaces truly social in nature—rather than creating buildings of monastic cells.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,”which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, events unravel over the course of one tense, hot day in New York’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. In one particularly memorable scene that has little relation to the main characters or plot, an oblivious, brownstone-owning cyclist scuffs the sneaker of the hotheaded character Buggin’ Out.
While surely a caricature of racial and economic tensions, their ensuing fight also highlights a highly complicated and contentious issue that faced major American cities at the time of the movie’s release: gentrification. And unlike the Larry Bird jerseys and frizzy hairstyles of the late 1980s, gentrification has not gone out of style.
Broadly, gentrification is a phenomenon that involves an influx of wealthier people into a poorer urban neighborhood. The cycle is predictable at an almost scientific level: It starts with a poor area of little interest to economic elites. Soon, low prices draw artists to the scene, and these artists adopt the regions as homes and places of work. The neighborhoods become cultural hubs, drawing the interest of upper classes. Finally, the rich move in, bringing with them raised property values and higher prices for basic goods, which often leads to better city services and even safer streets. At the same time, many of former residents with less money end up having to move out.
On an everyday level, gentrification comes with both boons and pitfalls. For a family living in a neighborhood undergoing the process, it may become more difficult to afford groceries or trips to the bowling alley. At the same time, that same family may be able to send its children to better public schools and access better municipal services—however unfair it may be, areas with wealthier residents are often politically better off than those with poorer residents.
But neighborhoods are made of more than the day-to-day activities of people who happen to live near each other. They are the fundamental, social units of cities. They provide a sense of community, history, and common ground to their inhabitants. And so the biggest challenge posed by gentrification is not an economic one, but a cultural one.
There is nothing inherently wrong with wealthy individuals moving into historically poorer neighborhoods. As Clifton­—the aforementioned gentrifying cyclist—says, “As I understand, this is a free country; a man can live wherever he wants. And the intermixing of people from different economic backgrounds in the same physical space is one of the joys of city life: Diversity helps to broaden the experiences and understanding of city-dwellers, and its spread is among the most paramount functions of cities. As Jane Jacobs wrote in “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,”“Lively, diverse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves.”
The trouble comes when new residents neglect to take an active part in respecting and preserving existing neighborhood culture. They’re not always just scuffing sneakers—often, they change a neighborhood’s composition to suit their needs. For example, take a look at the changing physical landscapes in urban areas, where high-rise residences often replace or obstruct historic buildings with deep connections to their surrounding neighborhoods and those who dwell there.  In Boston’s Chinatown, the 121-year-old Dainty Dot Hosiery Building was demolished to make way for a 26-story apartment building. (Chinatowns around the country, true hubs of cultural activity, are undergoing rapid gentrification and are on the “verge of disappearing,” according to the Asian American Legal Defense Fund).  Luxury apartments are in demand and are necessary components of cities. But they must complement, not overtake,other structures and areas that give cities the vibrancy and diversity that defines them. Otherwise, America’s metropolises will become little more than dense suburbs.
Gentrification is a subtle phenomenon that will continue to creep from neighborhood to neighborhood. It is happening right here in Boston, our backyard. And while it may seem benign from afar, it poses a threat to city culture that cannot be solved with government actions. Instead, everyone—the gentrifiers and the gentrified—must recognize that our cities are worth preserving, and that our neighborhoods are worth respecting.

Following a successful student-run pilot program last spring, several offices across the College have collaborated to roll out a comprehensive residential composting program in all 17 freshman dormitories.
Green ’17, a group of students from the Class of 2017 focused on sustainability issues on campus, first spearheaded the composting initiative, after running a pilot program in which they personally transported compost from Mower and Greenough Halls to dining halls three times a week.
The Law School and Harvard University Dining Services already host composting initiatives.
When the program proved popular among students, Green ’17 then worked to develop a larger-scale initiative. The students worked with the Freshman Dean's Office, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Green Program and Office of Physical Resources and Planning, the Office of Sustainability, and Harvard Recycling.
Dorm Crew deployed more than 600 specially marked compost pails to individual suites across the freshman dormitories over the summer. Freshmen can deposit organic waste into these pails and are responsible for bringing the compost to the trash rooms or kitchens in their dorms. Students can decide whether or not to participate in the program.
Once collected, the compost is taken to a compost farm off campus. This compost is eventually sold to other organic farms that produce food purchased by HUDS.
“About 30 percent of the waste Harvard students produce is organic, compostable matter,” said Cliff F. W. Goertemiller ’17, co-head of Green ’17. He said that the pilot program indicated that a larger initiative could be successful.
“We knew that people could [compost], and we knew people would use it,” he said.
Kelsey Grab, residential coordinator for the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program and an advisor for the Green Team program, praised the composting initiative.
“We’re going to divert literally tons of waste, and it’s going to improve the University in so many ways,” she said. “It’s setting a model.”
The Green Team, a group of undergraduate representatives who will monitor the initiative’s progress, will collect data throughout the year to improve the program for the future.
Steven B. Tan '18 said that he believes the composting program is an effortless way to protect the environment.
“It’s the first time I’ve been introduced to such sustainability measures, but [the compost program] is integrated very well into our daily lives,” he said.
Goertemiller, who said the program has generated “almost uniformly” positive feedback, said that the group hopes to expand the initiative.
“The ultimate goal would be that every single dorm suite at Harvard would have a compost bin,” he said.
Grab added that since the launch of the composting program, many upperclassman students have conveyed interest in implementing a similar program in their House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six students will be returning to their rooms in Dunster’s swing housing on Prescott Street Thursday after large amounts of toilet water spilled out onto their bathroom floor just four days earlier, forcing them to relocate to other Harvard housing.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning wrote in an email statement Wednesday night that the water overflow, “was not a sewer or plumbing issue. Rather, someone attempted to flush paper towels, which clogged a toilet in a second floor room and caused water to overflow.”
The clog also damaged the ceiling of the floor below, displacing a total of six students to other upperclassman houses, Manning wrote. The damage has since been fixed, he added.
For the students affected by the overflow, the mess—although resolved quickly—proved to be an inconvenience adding to what they said was an already stressful beginning week of classes.
Shortly after arriving back to his room Sunday night, Ryan M. Rule ’15 said he saw several maintenance workers in his suite “freaking out” and cleaning what he described as “nasty sewage water—poop and whatnot—all over the ground.”
Rule further explained that the bathroom in his apartment had “sewage on the floor.”
In under an hour, Rule said he and his two roommates Max T. Murphy ’15 and Kyle P. Rehkemper ’15 received an email from Dunster Building Manager Brandon Fernald, requesting that they pack belongings for three to five days, turn in their keys, and relocate to Adams House.
Fernald’s email, forwarded to The Crimson by Rule, thanked the three for their “patience and understanding” and also made clear that the instructions were “mandatory.”
In an email to all Dunster residents the next day, Fernald warned occupants against “flush[ing] items down the toilet that don’t belong down the toilet.”
Rule, who along with Murphy said he is yet to be informed of the cause of the leak, confirmed in an email Thursday that, to his knowledge, he and his roommates were not responsible for the misuse of the toilet that Manning referenced.
Both Rule and Murphy agreed that Harvard Campus Services did what was required of the situation and expressed relief at moving back into their suite.
"It was definitely an inconvenience at the start of classes, but we tried to make the best of it," Murphy said.
“I wasn’t happy about the situation, I'm still not happy about the situation, but I truly understand why they did it because I don’t want to stay in a room that has a massive sewage leak,” Rule added.

The Harvard Club of Boston in Back Bay closed an $8.8 million deal with SeaDar Real Estate and CW Partners late last month to turn over most of its adjacent annex building, which will be converted into five luxury condominiums.
Following a year and a half of trying to leverage the space on Commonwealth Avenue for capital, the real estate transaction will help to “to reverse the trend of annual operating losses that had burdened the Club in recent years,” its president Michael H. Shanahan wrote on his blog.
The sale results in the loss of 17 overnight rooms, but the Club will retain ownership of its main dining room, the Back Bay private dining room, and the basement for administrative offices, all of which are housed in the annex. Though its members primarily consist of Harvard alumni, the club is not affiliated with the University.
The club's recent financial burdens can be traced in large part to Septemeber 2012, when management agreed to a legal settlement after its wait staff alleged that the club had violated the Massachusetts “tip law.” The settlement cost the club $4 million; a final payment of $1.4 million is scheduled to be made in December 2015.
Shanahan also wrote that many of the overnight rooms lost through the sale shared a hallway bathroom and were not elevator accessible. He added that the Club’s “overall occupancy rate has run in the low 50% range for the past few years [...] the occupancy on the rooms we are losing was less than half the overall rate.”
In addition to putting the annex up for sale, the Club began imposing a monthly “facility renewal assessment” fee last year, ranging from $10 per month for full resident members to $2 per month for those under 30. These funds, amounting to about $300,000, in addition to another roughly $700,000 in other funds, will be allocated to infrastructure and facilities improvements. They include a renovated Boston Room, a new handicap-accessible rear entry, updates to the remaining 25 overnight rooms, and the installation of an additional elevator.
The club's vice president Karen M. Van Winkle ’80 said that she was “extremely excited” about the upcoming rennovations, which she considers to be “a great benefit to members.”
Overall, the organization rebounded from a $200,000 operating loss in fiscal year 2013 to an expected operating surplus of $1.3 million in fiscal year 2014, according to the Club President’s blog.
“As a not for profit entity, the Club is required to reinvest the proceeds from this sale of property back into the Clubhouse within a three year period, so we have every intention of using the funds from this sale to make improvements that will prepare the Clubhouse for its next 100 years,” Shanahan wrote.

Ari R. Hoffman ’10, a resident tutor in Lowell House, will serve as the acting Kirkland House dean this semester, while Cory T. Way, a sociology lecturer who usually holds the dean position, is on sabbatical.
Hoffman, a Ph.D. candidate in the English Department studying Jewish literature, lived in Quincy House as an undergraduate. He will continue to live in Lowell as a tutor while he serves as House dean in Kirkland.
In an interview Wednesday, Hoffman said he was excited to join the team in Kirkland. “I’ve had extraordinary resident deans myself,” he said, referring to a previous name for the position. “I’ve been inspired by the ways in which they’ve worked with students and supported students.”
“I’ve been here for a long time,” he added, saying that he cares “deeply” about Harvard and looks forward to any chance to try to “make it a rewarding and impactful experience for students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part III of a five-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018, based on data collected by The Crimson in an email survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday. Part II ran on Wednesday.
Last spring, academic integrity remained at the foreground of campus dialogue when the College passed its first-ever honor code, formalizing expectations of academic behavior and creating a new judiciary board to handle violations of the code.
That attention is well placed, the results of a survey conducted by The Harvard Crimson show. One out of ten surveyed students in the incoming Class of 2018 admitted to cheating on an exam—a rate almost identical to that of the Class of 2017. More broadly, about a quarter of this year’s respondents reported having cheated in an academic context.
In many ways, the academic and extracurricular interests of Harvard College’s newest members mirror those of their sophomore peers when they began their college careers a year ago. Thirty-six percent of survey respondents reported they intended to choose a social sciences concentration, similar to the 38 percent from the Class of 2017. Like their sophomore counterparts, a plurality of surveyed freshmen reported studying 11-29 hours per week during high school.
Survey results also reflected issues prominent in higher education, including an even smaller interest in concentrating in arts and humanities, with only 9 percent of the respondents reporting they planned to concentrate in the division. Interest in concentrations in the sciences were divided between genders—for instance, 26 percent of males who took the survey indicated they would choose concentrations at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as opposed to only 16 percent of females. Recruitment for varsity athletics correlated with concentration choice and hours respondents expected to study every week in college.
The Crimson emailed all incoming freshmen the survey on Aug. 6, and the survey closed on Aug. 28. The survey received responses from 1,172 members of the Class of 2018, or about 70 percent of the class.
The class was asked to answer questions on a range of issues, including many regarding their academic and extracurricular careers in high school and intentions as they begin their careers at Harvard. The survey was not adjusted for selection bias.
Sorting Out Academic Integrity
Two years have passed since the University went public with an investigation of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, which implicated groups of student-athletes, among other students. Last year, The Crimson found that 20 percent of surveyed recruited athletes admitted to cheating on an exam, as compared to 9 percent of survey respondents who were not recruited to play a varsity sport.
This year, however, the gap is smaller. The percentage of surveyed recruited athletes who said they have cheated on an exam decreased to 11 percent, compared to 10 percent of surveyed non-recruits in the freshman class.
Twenty-two percent of the surveyed members of the Class of 2018 said that they had cheated on a problem set or homework assignment, while 10 percent said they had cheated on a paper. Sixty-six percent of respondents who said they had cheated on any type of assignment attended a public school, while 33 percent said they attended a private school.
Surveyed men were more likely to admit to cheating than women. Twenty-eight percent of male respondents admitted to cheating, compared to 19 percent of female respondents.
Meanwhile, 17 percent of graduates of the Class of 2014 surveyed by The Crimson said they had cheated during their time at Harvard, according to last semester’s senior survey. Fifteen percent of surveyed seniors admitted to cheating on a homework assignment or a problem set, and 6 percent admitted to cheating on a paper or an exam.
Hitting the Books
Like many classes before them, the survey suggests the Class of 2018’s academic interests lean toward the social sciences.
Twenty-eight percent of surveyed freshmen reported that they intend to study either economics or government, the two most popular concentrations at the College, compared to 26 percent last year.
Economics, the most popular concentration among surveyed freshmen, was particularly desirable among surveyed recruited athletes. Thirty-five percent of recruits said that they intend to study the discipline, compared to 14 percent of non-recruits.
Gender also appears to play a role in concentration choice. More male respondents expressed interest in the physical sciences, computer science, mathematics, and engineering than female respondents, who were more like to indicate interest in life sciences.
And at a time when the University, and the higher education community at large, is grappling with a decade-long decline in humanities students, only 9 percent of respondents said that they plan to concentrate in the arts and humanities.
The survey results also found disparities among respondents in academic background. Surveyed males were more likely to have taken a higher-level math class than females, with 68 percent of male respondents indicating that they had taken a math class at the level of BC Calculus or higher, compared with 60 percent of female respondents.
High school study habits varied between respondents who went to private and public school. For instance, 32 percent of public school respondents reported studying fewer than 10 hours a week in high school, compared to 16 percent of non-denominational private school students.
Recruited athletes indicated that they spent less time overall studying in high school, with 35 percent saying that they studied fewer than 10 hours a week, compared to 26 percent of non-recruits.
Similar to last year’s class, 81 percent of respondents reported that their greatest source of pressure was their own expectations.
In the Clubs
Surveyed freshmen reported spending their time outside of their high school classrooms similarly to their sophomore counterparts.
Eighty-five percent of respondents reported involvement in community service, the most popular extracurricular activity. Female freshman respondents were more likely than their male peers to participate in drama and visual arts, though most activities were nearly evenly split in terms of gender.
Athletics was the second-most popular high school activity for the Class of 2018. Eleven percent of the respondents will continue competing at Harvard as recruited athletes, while a 9 percent of the class plans to walk onto a varsity sports team.
Athletics was the only high school extracurricular activity in which the respondents’ participation level varied with income level. While 54 percent of respondents from families with an annual combined income below $40,000 reported participating in athletics in high school, 81 percent of respondents from families making over $500,000 a year said the same, with the percentage increasing with every income bracket.
Nearly half of the respondents expressed some  level of interest in joining a final club, sorority, or fraternity. Fourteen percent reported feeling “very interested.” Overall, male respondents reported a greater interest in joining a final club or Greek life than female respondents, who were more likely to report being unsure about joining one of those social organizations. Surveyed students from private schools reported greater interest in final clubs and Greek life than did students from public school, and students from rural upbringings were less likely to report interest in joining those organizations than their suburban and urban counterparts.
Levels of high school leadership varied little by legacy status, gender, income level, or school type, with a plurality of respondents—27 percent—leading one club in high school.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed freshmen reported being leaders of at least one club in high school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than six years after student activists created a group to research the issue of smoking on campus, the College has banned the use of all forms of tobacco—including cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco products—in Harvard Yard, Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira and Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde announced over the summer.
Prior to this policy change, which took effect on August 15, individuals were permitted to smoke in parts of Harvard Yard, but smoking was banned within 25-50 feet of any University building.
The debate over on-campus tobacco use dates back to 2008, when student activists founded the Tobacco Control Policy Group at the Institute of Politics. The Committee on Student Life considered a Harvard Yard smoking ban in 2012 after the group released a memo detailing their research findings and recommending a University-wide smoke-free policy.
Mackenzie J. Lowry ’11, a co-founder of the policy group, said that she is proud of the impact the policy memo and was “thrilled” when she heard about the policy change because she believes that it will benefit the health of the Harvard community.
Professor Allan M. Brandt, an early advisor to the IOP policy group who has previously written an acclaimed book on the history of cigarette use in America, said that he believes the impact of the policy change will extend beyond just the Harvard community.
“We have so many visitors that it was actually a type of global health intervention at the micro-level,” he said.
However, the policy change has sparked mixed reactions from Harvard students.
Daniel Hughes ’18, a self-described “occasional smoker,” said he thinks that the ban is unnecessary.
“I’ve been to Harvard Yard previously, and it wasn’t exactly filled with cigarettes. It’s a fairly small thing,” he said, adding that individuals who choose to smoke are likely to be aware of health risks related to the habit. “I have noticed a trend that people who do smoke at all get sort of vilified by society.”
He also said that he thinks that a ban on e-cigarettes is “ridiculous” because e-cigarettes do not pose the danger of secondhand smoking. Current research is inconclusive about the health risks associated with e-cigarette secondhand smoke.
While Leila Y. Islam ’15 said she applauded the change as an extension of Harvard’s effort in recent years to promote green living and “healthiness inside and outside of student lives,” she said she remains doubtful that the policy could be enforced given the sizeable number of tourists the Yard receives each day.
According to an emailed statement from HUHS, members of Harvard University Police Department, Securitas, and Yard Operations are all authorized to ask tobacco users to desist or leave the Yard. In the statement, HUHS also encouraged all Harvard community members to feel comfortable doing the same if they were to encounter smokers in the Yard. For student smokers, HUHS will be publicizing and strengthening Harvard’s tobacco cessation resources to complement the policy change.
This policy change follows previous steps taken by the University to extend its tobacco-free policies. Harvard Medical School, the School of Public Health, the School of Dental Medicine, the Kennedy School of Government, and the Radcliffe Institute are all tobacco-free campuses. It also follows national trends towards prohibiting tobacco use on campuses. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services founded the National Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative in 2012, with some states requiring all public universities to be smoke-free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the summer, members of the Undergraduate Council negotiated with administrators in an effort to reverse the Faculty Council’s decision on removing course difficulty scores from the Q Guide starting in 2015. Following conversations with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, UC representatives have drafted a position paper summarizing the opinions of the student body which will be soon sent to administrators and faculty.
The UC has been soliciting student input on the council’s decision to generate this position paper since Harris sent an email announcing the Q Guide changes last May. UC vice president Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said that these are efforts are a response to the fact that students were not consulted on an issue that directly concerns them.
“This episode over the summer really highlighted a disturbing and important trend across the college,” Goffard said. “Over and over again, across the board, students are not being sufficiently consulted when it comes to matters that concern them.”
The position paper, co-authored by education committee chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 and Quincy House representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, argues that students must have access to a difficulty rating in order to balance their course load.
Additionally, the authors argue that the decision, which was made in September of 2013, was poorly communicated to students.
“Any decision [The Faculty Council] make[s] that will directly affect the academic or core curricular life of students should be communicated in a timely manner,” Goyal said. “Seven and a half months later is not appropriate.”
While the UC acknowledges the arguments against posting a difficulty score on the Q Guide, such as student exploitation of the score solely to take an easy course load, Goffard said he believes students should have access to some metric of difficulty, be it qualitative or quantitative. More importantly, Goffard said, is that students should have had a voice in the decision-making process.
Goffard said the issue over the difficulty score has provided the UC a platform on which to campaign for greater student voice in the University.
“Ideally we would like to have some sort of vote [in the Faculty Council], but obviously a vote is ambitious, so some sort of sustained consultation when it comes to the Faculty Council trying to make decisions,” Goffard said.
Though the UC has not officially taken a vote on an initiative to reinstate the difficulty rating on the Q guide, Goffard said that an “overwhelming” number of members support the effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services will begin serving brunch on Saturdays in Annenberg Hall and eleven of the twelve upperclassman Houses this week.
The addition of Saturday brunch comes as HUDS is rolling out the latest round of changes to its menu and services, based on a semesterly student feedback survey and perennial efforts to improve food quality. Other changes include opening all dining halls between traditional meal times to provide staples like cereal or peanut butter to students, as well as new grill and bagged lunch options.
Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications, said that the decision to add Saturday brunch came directly from last spring’s student feedback survey. On the survey, 66 percent of respondents said that they would prefer Saturday morning meal service to include a brunch like the one offered on Sundays.
“Students love brunch best. I think it’s the favorite meal of all the ones that we serve,” Martin said. “Lots of students often commented that they would rather have brunch [on Saturday].... So it’s a great response and worth the change.”
In recent years, Saturday breakfast has not differed from weekday offerings, including a mix of dried cereals, fruit, oatmeal, and hard-boiled eggs. Under the new arrangement, a scaled-back, Saturday continental breakfast will be served from 7:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and full brunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. Kirkland House will be the only exception to the change and will continue to serve regular hot breakfast early on Saturdays rather than brunch.
Changes to grill service, on the other hand, were based primarily on making offerings healthier, Martin said. Instead of items like the Boca Burger and the Chickwich, the grill now offers items like a Ruby Beet and Kale Vegan Burger, as well as the option to add fries to your order. A rotating weekly grill special has also been added.
“The grill is a vital station, as if you don’t like anything else that day you can go to the grill and order something,” Martin said. “So our overwhelming desire was to make it healthier and that we could feel proud of everything that was there.”
Though many students have praised the changes, some said they wish they were better publicized. Some Houses have emailed students about the changes, but others have relied on signs, table tents, or word of mouth.
“Why is there no publicity for this?” Blessing Jee ’17 asked. “These are such awesome options that should be announced more. If it is not, no one would know about it.”
The changes may not be without some drawbacks, others said, particularly the changes surrounding Saturday brunch.
“My concern lies with the decision that was made to change hot breakfast [in Annenberg] on Saturdays to continental, [which] in my opinion all too often [is] an inadequate breakfast,” Gurbani Kaur ’17 wrote in an email. “But I haven't had the chance to see what they have on Saturday/Sunday morning in Kirkland so we'll see if that works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 5, 2014, at 12:02 p.m.
TripAdvisor co-founder and CEO Stephen Kaufer ’84 and internet expert Susan P. Crawford agreed that government policies can both fuel and inhibit internet entrepreneurship while speaking at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
The forum marked the start of an internet policy symposium that continues Friday morning on the Kennedy School of Government campus and is hosted by the IOP, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, and the Internet Association. It was also the first forum event of the academic year and the first under the IOP’s new director Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams, who filled the position after C.M. Trey Grayson '94 stepped down last spring.
Kaufer began by saying that the government’s enforcement of software patents can inhibit the birth and success of online businesses such as his own website, which hosts customer reviews of hotels, restaurants, and travel destinations, among other topics.
At the same time, Crawford—who served as special assistant for science, technology, and innovation policy to the president of the United States—emphasized the government’s role in the growth of the world wide web.
“The idea of the internet is so rich, it’s so interesting, it is the ultimate level playing field,” Crawford said. “That idea could not have swept the world without government research and assistance.”
Kaufer said that websites like TripAdvisor, which rely on the freedom of the press through its user-generated comments, reflect the future of websites.
“I think the world has spoken that the TripAdvisor model of crowdsourcing always just yields better results than...the one person, professional guide book,” Kaufer said.
Looking forward, Crawford said that certain internet-related areas may demand additional government regulation.
In an interview before the forum, Internet Association CEO and president Michael Beckerman said that universities like Harvard can also play an important role in propogating internet growth.
“We want to make sure that policy makers understand that the next great idea is going to come from a dorm room here or some other university,” Beckerman said. “And you want to make sure that the regulatory policy landscape is such that allows the next great idea that you have to take hold.”
The forum was moderated by Archon Fung, who assumed the position of academic dean at the Kennedy School this summer.
Friday’s events will feature two roundtable discussions with more than 30 Internet industry stakeholders, including eBay Vice President Tod Cohen and Google Director of Public Policy Adam Kovacevich.
The discussions will be livestreamed on the IOP website and later aired on CSPAN, Williams said.

CORRECTION: September 5, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Kaufer's opinion of the impact of the government's enforcement of software patents on online businesses. In fact, he believes that the enforcement of software patents can inhibit internet entrepreneurs and did not contribute to the growth of TripAdvisor.

In last year’s season, the Harvard men’s golf team turned heads after winning two tournaments during the spring season and clinching third place in the Ivy League tournament. In the two wins, the Crimson set tournament records for team scoring and individual scoring.
“The team is in an exciting place right now,” coach Kevin Rhoads said. “I started coaching...two seasons ago, and the team was on the rise even before that. Last season there was a lot of foundational work done, which really started to show in the spring of last year.”
This fall season, the team is looking to integrate the two incoming freshmen, Hale Furey—from Newport Beach, California—and Gregory Royston, from Durban, South Africa, into the program. Royston is ranked 18th in the South African Golf Association men’s amateur rankings, while Furey has been a member of Team Southern California for two years.
“Our director of golf, Fred Schernecker, does a really good job of getting recruits that would fit in well with the team culture,” sophomore Kendrick Vinar said. “We got to meet [the freshmen] last year, and we’re thrilled to have them on the team...I know these guys will put in the work and give their best effort.”
The Crimson lost Theodore Lederhausen ’14, who captained the team last year and won the individual Ivy League championship, as well as Seiji Liu ’14 and Kevin McCarthy ’14.
All six returning golfers were key members of the team last spring and are players Rhoads expects to be able to trust to perform well.
“We’ve got a really well rounded team,” Vinar said. “Everyone on the team is very strategic and level-headed out on the course. You don’t see anyone losing their temper or conducting themselves poorly. Besides being the image we want to represent for the university and the program, it strengthens your golf game to be able to control your emotions like that and everyone on the team this year can do a really good job of that.”
Junior Rohan Ramnath, who claimed his first individual win at Yale last spring season, and captain Akash Mirchandani, who won the Princeton tournament individual championship in April, lead a strong team of returning players. Last year, the Crimson notched seven top-five finishes as a team.
“I feel very confident that all eight of our players could travel in any given week,” Rhoads said. “And not just travel but also give us a chance [to win]. If last spring was any indication, for us to have almost all returners and then two other strong players is going to be very good for us.”
Rhoads is starting his third season with the men’s team. After training his team up to five top finishes last season after just one in 2012-2013, Rhoads has focused on internal improvement rather than a specific number of finishes.
“The goals we set are generally more internal,” Rhoads said. “A lot of it has to do with working within our process. The biggest thing I want us to do is know...is to make each individual player the best, and to really work to make sure we’re getting close to 100 percent focus on these things day in and day out.”
The Crimson’s first challenge is at the University of Michigan Golf Course, where they will be competing in the Wolverine Collegiate this weekend.
“We have an awesome coaching staff,” Vinar said. “I’m just going to be trying to pick their brains and try to learn and grow as much as I can, and hopefully the team is in a good place and we play well this fall. I’m just going to try to focus on the things I can control, and I’m excited about that.”

For many rowers on the Harvard men’s crew team, the end of their Harvard season was far from the end of their personal competitive season. A handful of Crimson athletes took their talents to the international stage this summer, representing their respective countries at the World Championship Regatta. With 11 rowers at the U23 World Championships and three at the senior regatta, the Crimson was well represented at the international level.
“Across the board, our guys did really well this summer,” sophomore Chris Wales said.
The athletes trained throughout the summer to make sure to post their best performance when representing their country.
“The coaches here are really supportive about national team stuff,” Wales said. “They are always willing to help us in anyway that they can when it comes to making these teams.”
Prior to the international competition, in June, Wales competed at the Under 23 US Championship Trials held in New Jersey. With a time of 6:49:34, Wales and his partner outraced their opponents by almost a six-second margin to land the first place finish in the final of the U23 double scull division, winning the bid for the United States. Following the team’s qualifying victory, the duo headed to Italy to compete at the U23 World Championships.
“It went pretty well,” Wales said. “My boat got fifth in the B Final, and with 19 entries in our division, we felt it was a really good result for us.”
Andrew Campbell ’14 also competed at the U23 Championships, putting up a time of 7:21:19 to snag the lead in the single sculls division. With his closest opponent 18 seconds behind, the graduate won with time to spare.
On the heavyweight side, junior Vincent Breet represented South Africa at the 2014 World Championships in Amsterdam. Breet and his partner picked up a bronze medal at the competition. The South African team fell to New Zealand duo Eric Murray and Hamish Bond, who have not lost a race since they began competing together in double scull back in 2008.
Another Crimson competitor this summer was sophomore Chase Buchholz. The heavyweight oarsmen went through a lengthy selection process to book his ticket to worlds, participating in a three week long selection camp in California.
“Being the youngest guy at the camp definitely made me feel like I was up against pretty big odds, but I looked at it as an opportunity to get better,” Buchholz said. “I felt like if I made the team it would be great, but if I didn’t it was still an amazing experience to just be there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 14, 2014, at 1:15 p.m.
Junior Michael Hall, a backup center for the Harvard men’s basketball team, has transferred to Morehouse College, Athletics Department spokesperson Andrew D. Chesebro told The Crimson early Thursday morning. Hall, who played in 11 games in his Crimson career, would have entered the season competing for a spot in a crowded Crimson frontcourt rotation.
As of print time, neither university had updated its basketball roster to represent the move.
Hall was a heralded two-star recruit coming out of Woodward Academy in Atlanta, Ga. ESPN ranked him as the No. 8 high school basketball recruit in the state and Rivals.com named him a top-150 player nationally. He was selected as the preseason Ivy League Freshman of the Year by College Sports Madness for the 2012-2013 season, an honor later officially won by teammate Siyani Chambers.
He played in seven games his freshman year, highlighted by the first start of his career against Fordham. During Ivy League play, Hall played little as Harvard coach Tommy Amaker switched to a seven-man rotation, with then-sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi, Kenyatta Smith, and Jonah Travis playing the forward positions.
With the departures of Hall and sophomore Hunter Myers, who has been granted a medical leave for the fall 2014 semester, the Crimson will begin the 2014-2015 season with a depleted frontcourt. Co-captain Moundou-Missi, a Second Team All-Ivy selection a year ago, will likely take one of the starting spots. Classmates Smith and Travis, junior Evan Cummins, sophomore Zena Edosomwan, and freshman Chris Egi will compete for the remaining minutes.

While you're all enjoying the next few days of shopping week, take some time to remember that just over a decade ago this treasured period of no homework and leaving classes halfway through was in grave peril. In the fall of 2002, Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby expressed a desire to replace shopping week with “preregistration.” Preregistration (which sounds a lot like “pre-term planning” and probably would have sucked even harder) would have required students to register for classes without ever having seen a lecture. And as current students know, it’s really important to take as much care as possible when selecting which classes you’ll be sleeping through all semester.
Fortunately, the Crimson Staff was on top of it and penned an op-ed in defense of shopping week. The editorial noted the importance of letting students have time to carefully sample classes to get the most out of their academic experiences. Here, we review some of the article’s most salient points:

College students can barely take care of themselves, much less their pets. This hasn’t stopped a few brave souls though—read their horror stories, their delights, and that one time they brought their mouse to Lowell Lecture Hall in a Starbucks cup. Enjoy the second in this miniseries here!:
Flyby: When did you first get your pet?Pet owner: I got my pet about a month into school from a really ratchet pet store in Allston. She was on sale.
Flyby: How easy was it raising a pet? How did you find time to take care of it?Pet owner: It was much less difficult than I had anticipated. I would hold her while I was doing homework and put her in a pouch in my sweatshirt, so I would just be doing my reading and she would just be chilling. I live in a single, so it was nice to have something there I guess.”
Flyby: Did your pet have any cool tricks? Weird tricks? Any tricks?Pet owner: She loved to swim in my sink, so I would just put the stopper in my sink and fill it up and she would swim around, and I thought that was pretty awesome.
Flyby: How’d you lose your pet?Pet owner: I thought that she was getting really fat, so I was really concerned and started limiting food intake and exercising her on her wheel and everything. And then one day, I came back from class and there were about five worm-y things in the cage. I thought she had exploded, I’m not even kidding you. And then I was like, ‘Holy shit, those are babies!’ They were so weird-looking and I was really freaked out. And I told my friends, ‘Guys, my hedgehog just had fucking babies and I don’t really know what to do!’ So I found a home for each of them. My research told me that hedgehogs will often eat their first litter if they feel threatened. It’s just easier for them to have more babies than to try to keep them alive so I tried to keep it really quiet in my room and everything.
But one day, a week after she gave birth, I decided to clean her cage and I picked up one baby and then another one and so on. Then I picked up the last one and instead of moving, it rolled over on its back and the hedgehog had eaten out its face and brains. It was literally just the back part of its skull and the hedgehog body. I screamed and I group-texted, and my friend got rid of the body for me while I freaked out. And then I was so afraid she would eat the other babies and it would happen again so I just brought her back to the pet store.”

Most students will graduate Harvard with a transcript of courses that seem academic, or at least vaguely recognizable. After all, who would argue with “Virology 307: Genetics and Biochemistry of Prokaryotic Transposable Elements and Yeast Meiotic Chromosome Metabolism”? Certainly no employer that we know of.
Yet for those students with a whimsical taste, the Harvard Course Catalog never fails to provide the kind of classes that will leave your grad school admissions officer shaking their head. And so, as a break from shopping week, we present this pleasant diversion: Can you tell which titles belong to real Harvard College courses, and which do not? Click the links to check your score!
