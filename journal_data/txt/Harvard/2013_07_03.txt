After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Summer is officially in session, and that means it’s time to hit the beach—unless there’s a thunderstorm, rain shower, or some other form of inclement weather that seems to increase in frequency during the summer months. In that case, the only option is the multiplex; summer means a whole new crop of blockbuster-hopefuls.
 
Past summers have presented spates of sequels, threequels and based-upons, but this summer has seen studios venture into newer territory for blockbusters. For each sequel ("Iron Man 3," "Monsters University"), there’s a fledgling franchise ("World War Z," "The Lone Ranger") or original premise ("Pacific Rim") testing its pull at the multiplex. The results have not all been good, but have remained less predictable than the past couple years’ comfort-food action tentpoles.
 
Animation abounds, too. Mostly Pixar’s game in summers past, the family animation landscape this year sees strong showings from "Monsters U" competitors such as "Epic," "Turbo," and "Despicable Me 2".
 The Crimson will continue to update this page with new film reviews throughout the summer. Check back for our take on the box office’s smashes and flops.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A $10 million gift to Harvard Business School will launch a new curriculum innovation program focused on second-year MBA courses, the School announced Monday.
The benefactors are the family of the late Boston business leader William F. Connell, and their gift, which establishes the Margot and William F. Connell Family MBA Program Innovation Fund, honors Connell’s 50th reunion from the Business School. 
“This new donation from the Connells provides us with the financial support we need to enhance our second-year curriculum and make it a deeper, more cohesive, and more innovative experience that will have a lifelong impact on students,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in a press release posted on the School’s website.
Following its review of its first-year courses over the past several years, the Business School faculty will use the newly created fund to redesign the MBA program’s second-year curriculum, according to the School’s website. Those changes will include more integration between the program’s first two years, as well as “an expanded array of learning opportunities” and “more engagement in practice.” The program’s second-year redesign is expected to take around three years to plan and put into practice.
Nohria noted that the Connell family’s gift is only its latest donation to the Business School and follows a 2003 gift that launched the School’s Leadership Initiative.
Connell, who died in 2001, received the Business School’s Alumni Achievement Award earlier that year, topping off a career that included the creation of the Connell Limited Partnership and its growth into one of the largest privately owned industrial equipment companies in the world.
In addition to Connell himself, two of his six children are Business School alumni, including one who graduated this past May.
The Connell family’s philanthropic interests have not been limited to Harvard, as they have also supported institutions such as Massachusetts General Hospital, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Boston College, where Connell received his undergraduate degree.
“We are very grateful for the generosity and support of [Connell’s widow] Margot and the entire Connell family,” Nohria said. “They are a remarkable success story, all of them eager to add value to the community and give back to society.”
Monday’s announcement of the Connell family’s donation comes just a few months before the public launch of Harvard’s ambitious University-wide capital campaign, which is widely expected to reach for a goal of more than $6 billion—a sum that would likely make it the largest fundraising drive ever run by an institution of higher education.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has collaborated with the Instituto Cervantes, a nonprofit organization that was created by the Spanish government and promotes the study of Spanish language and culture, to create a Harvard-based observatory for scholarship on Spanish language in the United States.
 
The collaboration, which will be called the Instituto Cervantes Observatory of the Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultures in the United States, was recently established through a pact signed by University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen, and Instituto Cervantes director Víctor García de la Concha, according to a press release.
 
The new observatory, which will be housed in a building on Arrow Street, joins on campus the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, a 19-year-old hub for regional scholarship, though it will be the only space of its kind at Harvard devoted specifically to the study of Spanish language and culture within the United States.
 
“We want Harvard to be a reference of culture and thinking expressed in Spanish in the United States,” Francisco Moreno-Fernández, a professor at the University of Alcalá who will serve as the observatory’s executive director, wrote in an email from Spain.
 
While in the past critics have questioned Harvard’s commitment to the study of Latino languages and culture both within and outside the classroom, organizers emphasized the opportunities the new observatory hopes to create for students.
 
Sorensen, who will direct the initiative, said the observatory will look to engage student groups, such as Latin American student organizations. She said she expects the new initiative to have a positive impact on the study of linguistics as well as on Hispanic students, whom she hopes “will gather around the study of their language and their culture.”
 
The new observatory, Moreno-Fernández added, will provide Harvard students with the chance “to get up close to many of the most important thinkers and experts...from the Spanish-speaking world.”
 
For her part, Kay K. Shelemay, chair of Harvard’s Standing Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, called the new observatory a “terrific initiative.”
 
“It should enhance so many things that we’re doing,” she said. “It's very exciting.... I must say, I'm sure everyone will welcome the [Instituto] Cervantes Observatory to campus.”
 
The Department of Romance Languages and Cultures, the David Rockefeller Center, and the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights will play a role in advising the observatory, according to Moreno-Fernández. The Division of Arts and Humanities will manage the observatory, which will also collaborate with the Polinsky Language Sciences Lab.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 7, 2013, at 2:00 p.m.
Former men's basketball co-captain Christian Webster '13 is not going far post-graduation. According to a Harvard Athletics press release, basketball coach Tommy Amaker has named Webster an assistant coach for the 2013-2014 season following a reshuffling of the coaching staff after the departure of former assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel. Brian DeStefano, a 2012-2013 assistant coach, will become the 2013-2014 associate head coach.
"When the coaching positions became available, I pushed [Webster] and just wanted to see where the sparks would be about the idea of this because I’ve always thought of him as an ideal candidate for coaching," Amaker said. "I think Christian has a great deal of patience, I think he has a keen eye for the game, an eye for talent, [and] he certainly knows our program inside and out."
Filling out the bench is Adam Cohen, a former coach of the Rice Owls whom Amaker hired away from the Conference-USA program earlier this offseason. Cohen, who worked on recruiting for Rice, will be part of the group’s collective effort to replace Hufnagel’s contributions to the Crimson’s recruiting efforts.
"He’s incredibly well thought of in the coaching profession and the community, and we’ve loved him and known him for some time," Amaker said. "He’s worked with some great, great coaches."
Each member of Amaker’s new team will bring a new set of experiences to the bench. Webster is the only former college player of the three, but both DeStefano (Duke University) and Cohen (University of Arizona) spent time as student managers in college working under 750-win coaches in Mike Krzyzewski and Lute Olson, respectively. DeStefano and Cohen worked with a combined 15 NBA players at their respective schools, while Webster, the winningest student-athlete in program history, shared the court with only one—Jeremy Lin ’10.
While Cohen is entering his first season as a member of the Harvard basketball program, it will be Webster’s fifth and DeStefano’s seventh season involved with the team. During that time, the team has posted four straight 20-win seasons and earned two NCAA tournament berths, including Harvard’s first-ever NCAA Tournament win in 2013 over third-seeded New Mexico in the tournament’s second round. The group will be looking to help Amaker capture a fourth straight Ivy League title when the season tips off in the fall.
"All [members of the coaching staff] are outstanding candidates for the fit of our program and our school, and we think we have two ideal candidates for that for where we are,” Amaker said.
