After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs.” — Ansel Adams
Since my junior year of high school, I have been taking photographs. It began in a state forest in West Virginia when a friend needed senior photos. I traipsed out with my father’s Canon 40D, an 85 mm 1.8 lens, and a small amount of intuition. Surprisingly, upon returning home and handing the camera to my dad, who was waiting to assess my work, I had done well enough that it was deemed a success.
Over four years (and tens of thousands of images) later, I am still taking photos. After high school, I expanded in my pursuits, taking up sports, event, and macro photography. At Harvard, I have taken photos of student productions, sporting events, and graduating seniors. As of late, some may know me only as the guy who walks around CS50 lectures with a camera. To the subset of those people who asked, “Who are you taking photos for?” and then shrugged uncaringly when I facetiously said it was for myself, you should have called the police.
There are many things you learn when you spend time behind a camera. You become acutely aware of how wary people are when a camera is in the room, but also that society is collectively very respectful of people with cameras — always worried they are in the way, ready to let you stand wherever you need to be. You become better at spotting insects on flowers when you walk along the streets, something that can lead to a feeling of missed opportunity when a camera is not in hand. For those who are philosophers and photographers, you may find that you uncover some rather funny notions of truth through photography.
When I was in high school, my godfather told me, “In the olden days, teachers were respected not because they knew everything, but because they knew what was worth knowing.” This lesson came from the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard, a topic with which he is well acquainted. I have used this quotation on many occasions to describe the ideal teacher, a future ideal self, and in many ways what makes attending Harvard ideal.
Something I have learned from many people who hire me as a photographer is that most people in modern times, respect photographers for knowing what is worth photographing. The role of a photographer is not simply to capture an image. Instead, one must notice the lighting, the background, the camera settings, the subject(s), and a milieu of other factors.
In capturing these photographs, there’s a sense in which one is a reporter — accurately depicting what happened, what someone looked like, where people stood. This view of photography feels artistically hollow. Photographs are not perfect depictions of scenes. They tell a story (anyone who took an Expos 20 course in which photographs were analyzed knows they can tell many). They are an expression of what the photographer wanted the viewer to see because that’s what they themselves noticed.
Despite this admitted subjectivity, we can recall another of Kierkegaard’s often inflammatory lines, “Truth is subjectivity.” Photography admits a certain amount of subjectivity all the while bearing a certain amount of truth. We might imagine the overzealous artist exclaiming that they have captured “their truth” in a work of art and so too might we view photographs.
When we apply to Harvard, we represent a picture of ourselves. It develops through our Common App essay, our supplementals, our interview report. Some people worry that when they get here, they lose sight of that picture. It goes out of focus. A career in medicine is dropped for one in investment banking. History goes by the wayside in exchange for consulting.
One would do well to remember Ludwig Wittgenstein’s warning in the introduction to his “Philosophical Investigations,” “Very many of these [sketches] were badly drawn or lacking in character, marked by all the defects of a weak draughtsmen.” We can rest easy in the knowledge that in capturing ourselves we are not paying for film or paper, we can continually reject bad sketches of ourselves in order to generate new ones.
Additionally, the beauty of photography is that we can edit our pictures. There is not one correct photograph, it is an expression of what the photographer thinks is worth capturing. So as we enter the darkroom of Harvard each year, our negative tucked under our arm, we are presented with a series of options for how our picture is going to change. And for those wondering how they should develop their photos, remember Ansel Adam’s words, “... there are only good photographs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, in the dead of night, flag-adorned tabloids appeared by the dozens in dining halls across campus. Three copies arrived at my door.
This issue of the Harvard Salient — a conservative publication freshly resuscitated after disappearing in the 2010s — featured articles such as “The Universality of the American Founders” and “Utah: A Model for America.” The authors? Hidden behind pen names like “Thucydides” and “Marcus Porcius Cato.”
I laud my peers taking the initiative to produce this self-branded “alternative platform” aimed at “the pursuit of truth.” It stimulates a great deal of dinner conversation. The other night, I spotted two of my most liberal friends furiously highlighting passages at Eliot Grille. Love it or hate it, the Salient gets Harvard students talking — and thinking.
I enjoy tradition, even tradition preserved for the sake of tradition alone. But I challenge Harvard conservatives to reconsider whether pseudonyms advance their pursuit of salience. Anonymity is directly contrary to their cause.
Self-censorship in the ivory tower is real. I have friends in Social Studies seminars who keep JPMorgan internships and anti-abortion convictions to themselves to avoid stirring the pot. There’s little immediate upside to sharing unpopular opinions, but the downside can be considerable: from strained friendships to outright “cancellation.” So students are afraid to speak their minds.
But speaking behind the mask of a Roman senator only reinforces the perception that such perspectives are dangerous. The liberal majority may misinterpret this as signaling ideas so extreme, their authors could not bear to claim responsibility for them. That the writers worry for their law school applications or confirmation hearings decades down the line.
In fact, articles in this edition of the Salient are not radical at all, considering the broader political landscape. They might be criticized and rebutted — as any speech should be on the road to Veritas — but plenty of beliefs on Cambridge’s ideological fringe are common to half the American public. Secret authorship conveys an air of self-conscious transgression that keeps lay readers from considering them seriously.
There’s a chilling effect, too, when freshmen arrive on campus to find right-of-center speech shrouded in anonymity. Is it not the mission of a university to encourage free and open exchange of ideas? Students should be shown a model of courage, of standing by values even and especially when such views are unpopular. Pseudonyms convey that there is something to fear. The editors of the Salient are reinforcing exactly the climate they condemn.
Campus speech climate aside, hiding behind “Publius” constitutes self-coddling. It means avoiding ideological challenge when in fact debate is an altogether constructive exercise. Confrontation, though sometimes uncomfortable, can change minds. It helps both parties refine their ideas and understand points of disagreement — and shared principles, too — with more nuance. Writing will be a far more enriching intellectual feat for Publius if she invites criticism. Publishing a piece should be only the first step in a campus-wide conversation.
Some feel free speech in contemporary academia is a lost cause. Former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers and Psychology professor Stephen A. Pinker have been helping launch the University of Austin, a new liberal arts university dedicated to the “fearless pursuit of truth.” It’s a mission UATX’s founders say other American schools have abandoned. But must we give up on Veritas at Harvard?
Simply creating more venues for speech will not break the cycle of self-censorship. It matters how we engage with one another’s expression — and take ownership of our own.
Indeed, there is room on campus for far more political speech of every ideological persuasion. I would just as well love to see the Harvard Communist at my door and, despite my love of free markets, look forward to reading every page.
Harvard should celebrate forums for speech beyond the scope and sensibility of The Crimson’s Editorial pages. But self-ostracism only perpetuates a culture of political orthodoxy. I challenge my peers to eschew anonymous bylines for the public square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An outside observer might assume that the Harvard College Undergraduate Council is a high functioning and esteemed body, respected by the students it purports to represent. They would be wrong — at least in 2021.
This November, the UC’s election cycle vindicated a majority of our fellow students who believe that the student government is in some ways a joke: The infighting, ad hominem attacks, shifting campaign policies, rule breaking, and pandering platitudes gave way to a victorious ticket with the stated goal of “defunding the UC,” by decree of about 33 percent voter turnout.
To quickly recap: One ticket accused the UC of tax fraud. Another presidential ticket was disbanded amongst allegations of “seriously undermining the spirit of the election” and then reinstated after the Dean of Students Office had to intervene. This pushed back the entire campaigning and voting period. The winners hazily co-opted a political buzzword: What comes of their defund promise is anyone’s guess. The Election Commission had to nullify all votes cast in the first five hours of voting due to a technical error that made it impossible to vote for the election’s ultimate winner. One candidate announced in the debate that they were “tired of the lying and the backstabbing that has occurred.”
Acknowledging the UC’s abject brokenness became a campaignism in and of itself, as the race’s two “establishment” tickets sent out campaign materials saying these controversies “show how broken the UC is” and “just how terribly the UC has been run.”
Last week was truly a masterclass in the worst of representative democracy in the microcosm of a college campus. So it’s no surprise that nearly 70 percent of the student body did not vote in the election — we don’t blame them. So where do we go from here?
We affirm our decade-old precedent that the UC’s duties should be drastically scaled back to that of a funds distributor. Good, but unfortunately impotent campaign promises like the age-old call for a multicultural center highlight the limited ability of the UC to actually move the University on issues dear to students. We believe that Harvard students are plenty capable of advocating for themselves, and maintain that activists are better at securing change than admittedly dedicated, but often showboaty, UC reps.
It hasn’t always been this bad. As the current UC President and Vice President, Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22, wrote in an op-ed asking the student body to vote in the election (they didn’t), past UCs have been able to advocate for great things for the College: fall finals before winter break and Yardfest, to name a few. If the body must continue to exist, which we expect it will, it needs to be all that the UC currently isn’t to secure real improvements: a focused, ethical, and unified voice that is in-touch with the student body. Then, maybe students will associate the body with the change it has brought to pass — not its notorious infighting.
The winning ticket — Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 — promised to rewrite the UC’s constitution, and they have their work cut out for them. Their efforts should focus on shoring up the institution: addressing why the UC elections have shockingly low voter turnout, and the root of why nearly every ticket campaigned on the idea of the UC’s utter dysfunction.
If the students who are in the UC don’t even like it, how can they expect the rest of us to buy in?

BOSTON — Michelle Wu ’07 was sworn in as the first female and person of color elected mayor by the city of Boston during a brief ceremony in the Boston City Council chamber Tuesday.
“I am so honored to stand here in this chamber, that has meant so much to me, as your next mayor,” Wu said after taking the oath of office, two weeks following her historic election. “I learned the ropes of city government and politics on this floor, held the gavel on this floor, nursed babies on this floor.”
Though she said she initially felt “swallowed up” and “invisible” upon first entering city hall, the space now feels like home.
Wu is the first woman and first person of color popularly elected mayor of Boston. Kim M. Janey, Wu’s predecessor, was the first woman of color to hold the office after former Mayor Martin J. Walsh left the post before his term ended to join Joe Biden’s cabinet as secretary of labor. Janey, as Boston City Council president, became acting mayor.
Wu is also the first Harvard College alum in nearly 100 years to serve as mayor of Boston.
Wu’s swearing-in, scheduled to last an hour, concluded roughly fifteen minutes early — which Council President Matthew O’Malley called an “indication of the efficient government that Mayor Wu will run.”
Among those in attendance were Janey, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — Wu’s former Harvard Law School professor and an early endorser of her campaign — U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), and Governor Charlie D. Baker '79.
During the transfer-of-power meeting, Janey congratulated her successor.
“As I leave office now as mayor, I feel good knowing that you share my love and my passion for Boston.” Janey said. “I’m confident that you will lead our city with integrity, and that you will center equity in all that you do.”
“I am so proud to call you Madam Mayor,” she added.
In a press conference following the inauguration, Wu said she would encourage students inspired by her example to “step up and serve” those around them.
“We need you now, we need your leadership in this moment,” Wu said. “I look forward to opening those doors and making sure that as many of our young people as possible are sitting in seats of decision making.”
Jovita Solorio-Fielder, a student at the Graduate School of Education, said she is glad to see representation in Boston’s highest office.
“Just knowing that I can always point to her as an example of leadership is really cool,” Solorio-Fielder said. “She's going to have an impact and also be a role model for so many other young women and young people of color.”

With the inauguration of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 on Tuesday, Allston residents said they are optimistic her plans to reconfigure urban development and city planning in Boston will positively benefit the neighborhood as it handles an influx of Harvard development projects.
Wu, the first woman and person of color elected to the mayorship in Boston, assumed office on Tuesday.
According to her campaign website, Wu plans to “abolish” the Boston Planning and Development Agency, a body she charges with having exacerbated Boston’s “structural inequality” and with displacing residents of color in recent decades. Her administration also plans to prioritize more environmentally-conscious development, according to her campaign’s website.
Legally, the City of Boston cannot dissolve the BPDA without state approval. Wu plans to cut the organization’s operating budget and strip its authority over zoning and development in order to functionally “dismantle” the organization, per the campaign.
Elizabeth A. “Liz” Breadon, a city councilor for Allston-Brighton, wrote in an email that she was “delighted” by Wu’s historic election.
Breadon wrote she anticipates Wu will be attentive to the interests of residents of the neighborhood. She added she anticipates Wu will support a more “integrated” development approach by the Harvard-Allston Land Company in lieu of the firm’s past approach of pursuing individual development projects in Allston.
State Representative Michael J. Moran said he hopes Wu will take the time to appoint staff to help her “implement her vision” for city development.
Moran said one reason he supported Wu was because they agree that the government can affect “people’s lives in a positive way.” Like Breadon, he said he hopes for a more cohesive, long-term strategy of urban development.
“I’m hopeful that in projects that are coming forward, that we see greater affordable housing numbers, we see better sustainability and more of a long term planning as opposed to a piecemeal type of planning,” Moran said.
Moran said he hopes to see greener projects and more open spaces in future Allston projects.
Jane McHale, an Allston resident and Wu supporter, said she is in favor of making the BPDA a “separate entity” from City Hall but is hesitant to support “abolishing” the agency.
McHale, who has also been involved in local development review processes, said the BPDA must be a “better facilitator.” She cited recruiting liaisons between residents and developers who can address questions and feedback on city planning as an example.
Harvard’s present affordable housing commitments, according to McHale, are “not enough,” and argued the city should make additional investments to address the housing crisis.
“The government has gotten out of the housing business many years ago, and it sort of leaves it up to cities and developers, and with the cost of building dramatically increasing through Covid, that margin has gotten much more narrow for developers,” she added.
Allstonian Daniel J. Navarro, who did not vote in the mayoral election and does not consider himself a supporter of Wu, said he feels that the “tight-knit” developments Harvard has created in the city “can be exclusionary” to the surrounding population in Allston.
In September, Harvard opened its $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex in Allston, which garnered mixed reactions from local residents.
Campbell Forbes, another Allston resident, alleged Harvard development in Allston has also led to a proliferation of rats in the neighborhood. He urged the city to address the issue.
“[The city administration] need to be responsible for exterminating little critters and not just let the little critters wander into the neighborhood,” Forbes added.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is eager to collaborate with the Wu administration on Harvard initiatives.
“We look forward to working with Mayor-elect Wu, her administration, and the Allston-Brighton Community as the University continues to advance innovative projects and offer exciting and responsive programs and initiatives across the City of Boston,” she wrote.

As Harvard’s graduate student union prepares to vote on a tentative agreement reached with the University, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 called the proposed deal “very fair” and said he hopes to avoid a second disruptive strike.
The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers’ bargaining committee reached a tentative deal with the University late Monday, bringing the sides close to a four-year agreement following eight months of negotiations and a three-day strike held last month.
HGSU-UAW members, who officially began another strike Tuesday morning, were advised by the bargaining committee to continue working while the union held a 24-hour vote on whether to end the strike. The voting closed early Wednesday with an overwhelming majority of members voting to end the strike, which caused little disruption across campus.
“All of us wanted our student workers to be able to return to work and continue with their work and their studies as quickly as possible,” Garber said in a Tuesday interview. “None of us believe that a strike really benefits anyone. It’s best to resolve these issues through negotiation.”
Still, some union members remain wary of the tentative agreement, which failed to secure two of the union’s three key demands — independent arbitration for Title IX cases and an agency shop that would require all student workers to contribute to union activities or a student health fund regardless of whether they join.
“What were we striking for to begin with?” HGSU-UAW member Stephen M. “Mac” Loftin Jr. said. “It’s been mentioned that we’ve been fighting for the last eight months, but what were we actually fighting for?”
While the union also originally hoped to secure a three-year contract, the tentative agreement accounts for a four-year period, raising concerns among some members that HGSU-UAW will lose support across campus before the next round of contract negotiations.
“For the fourth year, we won’t have a lot of institutional memory of the undergrads, so we will have to see if they will be behind us like that again in four years,” HGSU-UAW member Anca I. Wilkening said.
HGSU-UAW trustee Andrew M. Bergman also questioned the bargaining committee’s timing in approving the tentative agreement.
“Why would we not wait one more week?” he said. “And why would we not expect our bargaining committee to come and make that case before they [tentatively agree to] something and take that basically out of our hands?”
The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee wrote to members Monday night that “in order to secure” bargaining victories, including a 5 percent pay increase for salaried workers in the first year, it “had to make difficult concessions with the hope that future [bargaining committees] will be able to carry forward these fights.”
“We are recommending this contract to you for ratification with the clear recognition that this contract does not include everything that was important to us,” the 10-person committee wrote to members.
Garber said Tuesday he hoped union members would ratify the agreement later this week.
“We think that it’s a very, very fair agreement,” he said.
He declined to say how the threat of a strike impacted negotiations in their latter stages.
“A lot of work has been going on for quite a while to reach agreement,” he said. “So it’s hard for me to say how much the threat of a strike mattered. But we all agree a strike would be an unfortunate approach to resolving our disagreements.”

Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria A. Ressa discussed her time as an award-winning political journalist in the Philippines at the Institute of Politics’ annual Salant Lecture on the Freedom of the Press Tuesday.
Ressa, who shared the prize in October 2021 with Russian journalist Dmitry A. Muratov, spoke about her experience running and writing for Rappler, a digital news company that focused on the use of social media to challenge pro-government propaganda in the Philippines.
Ressa received the prize for her efforts to “safeguard freedom of expression” through her journalism, according to a statement by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
In June 2020, a Filipino court found Ressa guilty of “cyberlibel,” for which she could face up to six years in prison. Ressa also faces seven other charges, including accusations of tax evasion, to which she has pleaded not guilty.
Though Ressa originally planned to give the lecture in person, the IOP announced in an email Tuesday morning that the event would take place virtually after several organizers received notice of potential Covid-19 exposure.
In an hour-long lecture moderated by Kennedy School professor Latanya A. Sweeney, Ressa talked about Rappler’s work in uncovering the Filipino government’s alleged manipulation of social media in a practice she dubbed “patriotic trolling.”
Following a September 2016 bombing near the residence of Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, Rappler journalists exposed the circulation of a March 2016 article “Man With High Quality of Bomb Nabbed at Davao Checkpoint” — from nearly six months earlier — which Ressa claimed Duterte supporters used to justify declaring a “draconian” national state of emergency after the bombing.
Ressa said she first suspected Duterte’s supporters were using the article to “massage the conditions” for the government’s actions when she noticed the six-month-old article attracting large traffic volumes and found that the Facebook page “Duterte News Global” was circulating it.
In a three-part series entitled “Propaganda War: Weaponizing the Internet,” Ressa and her colleagues at Rappler alleged that other fake accounts spread “propaganda” about Duterte and former Philippines senator Ferdinand R. “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr.
“If you don't have facts, how can you have truth? How can you have trust?” Ressa said. “If you don't have these three, you don't have democracy.”
Addressing possible ways to combat misinformation and disinformation, Ressa said solutions must fix current social media companies’ “algorithms of bias,” which she added “prioritize the spread of lies, hate, anger, and conspiracy theories.”
Ressa also cited the European Union’s Digital Services Act as “the most effective” example of a policy that focuses more on changing “algorithms of bias” than limiting users’ speech.
In addition to changes to technology policy, Ressa also cited the importance of independent journalism in working against disinformation and informing readers “how they are being manipulated.”
“Most of the time, Americans will say, ‘Ah, that doesn't happen here,’ and then you see how quickly democracy can collapse,” Ressa said.
Ressa also noted that the challenges disinformation presents are not unique to the Philippines or the United States.
“One of the things that technology has shown us, and it is both good and bad, is that humanity around the world – we actually have far more in common than we have differences,” she said.

Harvard Law School announced the establishment of a $10 million endowment for its Animal Law & Policy Program last Wednesday, funded by the Brooks Institute for Animal Rights Law and Policy.
The program was renamed the Brooks McCormick Jr. Animal Law & Policy Program after philanthropist Brooks McCormick Jr., who passed away in 2015. The HLS program provides opportunities for scholars, law students, faculty, and policymakers to better understand and devise solutions to animal mistreatment through a legal lens.
Brooks Institute President Timothy S. Midura said his organization, an independent think tank focused on animal law, was ready to establish a partnership in honor of McCormick.
“We felt that it was about time that we created a significant grant that memorialized the name of Brooks McCormick Jr., and it merged with our confidence in Harvard Law School’s program,” Midura said.
Chris Green, executive director of the HLS program, said he and his team first met Midura in 2017. His colleague Kristen A. Stilt, faculty director of the program, became an advisor to the Brooks Institute shortly after, Green said.
“We had several years of funding already secured, and so we didn’t ask [Midura] for anything,” Green said. “We just offered ourselves as resources having learned so much in building out the program here about the landscape of animal law, particularly the academic side of things.”
Midura said he witnessed the decency of the HLS program’s leading members throughout his time working with them.
“The interesting thing — and this goes to the integrity of both Chris Green and Kristen Stilt — is that they’ve never asked me for money,” he said. “And so I really had to go to them and say, ‘We’d like to explore a naming brand, which would be an endowment.’”
Midura said that he believes the partnership was one rooted in mutual respect.
“I think Kristen and Chris have seen the integrity of the way the Brooks Institute runs and have gotten to know our reputation, the man Brooks McCormick Jr. and his love for animals, and how he ran his life,” Midura said.
Green said that the HLS program always sought to be a “complementary” rather than competitive force in the context of animal policy programs at other law schools. What differentiates Harvard’s program, he said, was its “robust focus on scholarship.”
Max Hantel, a second-year law student who works at the program’s clinic, said he felt an increased excitement among his colleagues following the announcement of the endowment.
“Everyone was sort of buzzing about the news,” Hantel said.
Hantel said that the clinic provides students with the opportunity to directly engage with animal advocacy and legal reform.
“It has an outsized reputation for doing incredible, cutting-edge work and really impactful litigation but also asking really, really important questions about bigger normative policy, philosophical issues,” he said.
Kelley S. McGill, an HLS alum, said that the program and clinic were “transformational” to her law school career.
“I was able to have a real-world impact through some of the projects I worked on with the clinic,” McGill said. “To actually be able to make that kind of difference in a cause area that I care about while still being a law student was pretty incredible.”
Amanda Yancey, a director at the Brooks Institute, said that the endowment was a “testament” to the Brooks Institute’s faith in the program.
“It’s a signal to the world that animal law is here to stay — it’s a great day for the animals,” Yancey said. “We feel like Brooks McCormick Jr. would be quite pleased and we’re thrilled to see what comes next.”

Director of the Harvard University Native American Program, Joseph P. Gone ’92, discussed how to improve mental health care for Indigenous populations at an online lecture hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health on Tuesday.
The event was part of the Yerby Diversity Lecture in Public Health series, which brings minority academics to HSPH.
“The problems of Indian Country are not going to be solved by more or better mental health services, more or better counseling or clinical activity,” Gone said. “Our problems are much, much deeper and much more expansive than that.”
Gone described a framework he developed called “Alter-Native Psy-ence,” which he said aims to recast “mainstream psychiatric and mental health professional discourse.”
Alter-Native Psy-ence addresses four domains — distress, well being, treatment, and evaluation.
“When it comes to this Alter-Native Psy-ence — when it comes to distress — it’s not mental disorders, but historical trauma,” Gone said.
“When it comes to wellbeing, we’re not talking about neoliberal individualism, but instead relational selfhood,” he said. “When it comes to treatment, we’re not talking about empirically supported interventions, but rather reclaimed healing practices.”
“In terms of evaluation, it’s not scientific studies, but Indigenous ways of knowing,” Gone added.
Gone explained the challenges of implementing traditional mental health treatment models for Indigenous people, which he said he first learned of during a research project at the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana.
He said he traveled to the reservation to engage in “open-ended and discovery-oriented inquiry,” instead of using traditional evidence-based practice to gauge the relationship between culture, drinking, and depression. Gone is a member of the Aaniiih-Gros Ventre tribal nation, whose people reside on the Fort Belknap Reservation.
After interviewing policymakers and service providers across Fort Belknap, Gone said he honed in on an interview with Traveling Thunder, a tribal member. Gone said he focused on Traveling Thunder because of the “explanatory model” he used to understand Indigenous mental health challenges.
According to Gone, Traveling Thunder described four historical eras in his explanatory model: pre-colonial existence, colonial contact and alienation of Indigenous custom, post-colonial loss and psychological unrest, and post-colonial revitalization. Traveling Thunder’s account was historical instead of biological or psychological, Gone said.
“He deliberately and clearly identified colonization as the original cause of Indigenous distress,” Gone said. “In doing so, he emphasized systemic factors over interpersonal factors.”
Gone said that when he asked Traveling Thunder if he would bring a loved one to the Indian Health Service — an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — he responded that the agency’s mental health services were a “cross-cultural encounter for many Indigenous people” and acted as “a kind of conversion effort.”
“I guess a lot of people want to end up looking good to the white man — then, it’d be a good thing to do,” Gone recalled Traveling Thunder telling him. “Go to the white psychiatrists in the Indian Health Service and say, ‘Well, go ahead and rid me of my history, my past, and brainwash me forever, so I can be like a white man.’”
“I guess that’d be a choice each individual will have to make,” he added.

It was move-out day at Currier House as the summer of 2007 began, and Michelle Wu ’07 was saying goodbye to the college that had been her home for four years — the weekend trips to Chinatown, her large and loving blocking group that filled an enormous 10-person suite, and a place she built the foundations for a career in public service.
Among those goodbyes was Rolando Flores ’07. Like Wu, he was a child of immigrants, his parents coming to America from Mexico. They were with him as he packed the last of his things and prepared to conclude this chapter of his life. For his mother, it was her first time on Harvard’s campus.
Flores had mentioned to Wu that his parents did not speak English. On that last day, she found the three of them amid a sea of boxes.
“I remember, in the middle of all the chaos, Michelle made sure that she walked over to my parents, introduced herself, made them feel welcome, and did it in perfect Spanish,” Flores said. “It meant a lot to my parents to have that.”
Fourteen years later, Wu would be sworn in Tuesday as the 56th Mayor of Boston, the first woman and person of color elected to the office, as well as the first Harvard College alum to serve as mayor in nearly 100 years. She carries to City Hall the same spirit of “welcoming,” as Flores calls it, that she had on that last day of college.
During her election night victory speech, she reaffirmed to the crowd that “all of this is possible” — in English, then in Spanish, then in French, and finally in Mandarin. In a tweet the day before her inauguration, she showed off her mayoral business card, featuring her title in twelve different languages.
“We are ready to become a Boston for everyone,” Wu said in her speech.
A daughter of Taiwanese immigrants born on Chicago’s South Side, Wu had never truly been away from her family before coming to Cambridge in August 2003. Her entire family — including her parents, and her three siblings — made the nearly 1,000 mile drive from Chicago to Harvard Yard in a minivan together.
“I remember just standing in Harvard Square as my family drove away, just crying and crying,” Wu said in a Boston University student forum this October. “It took a while to really feel like this new way of life and this new city was home.”
Fortunately, Wu arrived at Harvard already friends with roommates she’d spent the summer getting to know through an AOL Instant Messenger chatroom — including a woman who would become a lifelong friend, Elizabeth C. Likovich ’07.
In an email to The Crimson, Likovich reminisced about her first time meeting Wu in-person on move-in day.
“Our fathers commiserated about having to move their daughters up five flights of stairs,” Likovich wrote. “Her sister, Tori, was only six and had the cutest pigtails. We all doted on her.”
According to Likovich, she and Wu’s first stop after move-in was J.P. Licks, the ice cream shop — the pair’s first taste of Boston.
One of the earliest encounters Wu had with her future constituents was through the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus, which, according to then-director Kevin Leong, featured vocalists from all across Boston and its surrounding areas. Wu sang soprano alongside not just Harvard students, but Bostonians from all walks of life.
“It could have been an important experience for a Harvard student to have that contact with the people in the community and the surrounding communities, and working on something like this which is musical and collaborative,” Leong said.
A crucial part of finding a home in Boston, Wu said at the student forum, were her trips to Chinatown as part of the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Chinatown Citizenship Program — a program she would eventually helm.
“It very quickly became a tradition that I would go from Harvard to Chinatown every single weekend,” Wu said. “We were teaching citizenship classes and volunteering and getting great food and getting to know the community.”
“By my second year, I knew this was where I wanted to stay and put down roots,” she added.
Many classmates who met Wu during her time at Harvard described her in much the same way as Flores — welcoming and caring above all else.
Likovich wrote that Wu’s nature was “sweet, upbeat, and inclusive,” and that she had a “talent for shining a spotlight on everyone else.”
Wu quickly developed a reputation for that kindness and empathy in her freshman entryway, Canaday D. Geoffrey D. Kearney ’07, a member of her entryway, said she always struck him as someone who “radiated goodness.” Erik A. H. Sand ’07 recalled the study breaks her suite ran, which he said were some of the best in the entryway.
When she arrived at Currier House in her sophomore year, bringing along many of the friends she’d found in Canaday, she also brought her reputation for compassion.
Joseph L. “Joe” Badaracco, one of Currier’s House Masters — now called Faculty Deans — during Wu’s time at the College, wrote in an email on the day of her inauguration that he saw the same kind traits in Wu then that he does now.
“The Michelle we knew in Currier House is the same Michelle who will become mayor today – very bright, thoughtful, hard-working, and a great listener,” Badaracco wrote. “Her traits and talents make her an ideal leader for our cynical and polarized times.”
Flores, who joined Wu’s 10-person blocking group during their senior year, said she was always “encouraging” to him — particularly when he decided to learn the piano.
Wu, a pianist who performed a solo of “Rhapsody in Blue” at her own high school graduation, would often use the practice room in Currier and check on Flores’ progress when they happened to meet.
“I remember her checking in on me to see how my lessons were going and encouraging me to continue, and it was a nice touch,” Flores said. “It felt like she really did care and she had no reason to.”
Wu maintained many of these friendships long after leaving the College. She invited Flores and other friends to her wedding, which Likovich helped organize. Likovich described staying awake “well past midnight” with Wu to ensure that everyone who had RSVP’d late could come.
“Michelle took it all in stride,” Likovich wrote. “She didn’t get irritated or say it was too late to make the changes. It was more important to her to be welcoming to all than any personal stress.”
“That is Michelle in a nutshell - an incredibly hard worker and more focused on others than on herself,” she added.
Edward L. “Ed” Glaeser’s class Economics 1011a: “Microeconomic Theory” had a reputation among Harvard students. A Crimson article from the fall of Wu’s senior year describes the course as “either loved or hated,” with a “break-neck pace” and “impossibly difficult exams.”
Naturally, Wu decided to take it.
She had been an academic all-star during her time in high school, with a score of 1600 on the SAT and a composite 36 on the ACT. According to Glaeser, she was no different in college — he remembered her as a “very smart” and “extremely eloquent” student.
“I don’t remember anything about her that would have keyed to you, ‘Boy, this is a person who’s going to become the leader of a great city,’’' Glaeser said. “I would have thought she was either on the track toward getting a Ph.D. or becoming a superstar consultant.”
As for lessons Wu may have taken from his class, Glaeser said he’s “fairly amused” with one she didn’t pick up.Glaeser said he has a rule to avoid making direct public policy conclusions in his classes as “different perspectives get you to different things” — with just one exception.
“Literally, the one case I break that is about the dangers of imposing rent control,” he said.
Rent control is one of Wu’s signature campaign promises — though Glaeser said he considered “rigorous thinking” as well as “wisdom and a belief in the value of knowledge and evidence” to be among the most important lessons from his class, rather than any specific policy position, qualities he said Wu possesses in abundance.
After graduating cum laude in field from the College, Wu joined the Boston Consulting Group — as Glaeser had predicted she might. After less than a year, however, she returned to Chicago to care for her mother and sisters.
She would bring her family back to Boston in 2010, when she enrolled at Harvard Law School. There, a contract law professor — future U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — helped draw her into politics, along with an internship under former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
In 2013, she was elected to an at-large seat on the Boston City Council.
In a May press conference, Wu called her time at Harvard “foundational” to everything that followed.
“There’s no way that I would be in this role if I hadn’t had so many doors opened through the incredible education that I’ve been able to experience, and the connections to community that started when I was at Harvard,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its season-opening matchup with Boston College, Harvard women’s basketball looked to a pair of weekend contests to deliver Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith the first victory of her 40th and final season leading the Crimson program. Although Harvard lost a hard-fought road game against the University of Massachusetts on Friday, 80-71, the Crimson — playing at Lavietes Pavilion for the first time in 20 months — won in dominant fashion over Northern Illinois (NIU) on Sunday, 70-53.
HARVARD 71, MASSACHUSETTS 80
Harvard (0-2) began its Friday afternoon bout with in-state rival Massachusetts (2-0) boasting its depth and three-point shooting ability. Entering the fourth quarter, the Crimson led 57-54 and had connected on 10 of 22 three-point attempts. However, a late run by the Minutewomen and Harvard’s colder shooting from deep opened the gates for Massachusetts’s 80-71 victory. Coach Delaney-Smith returned to her four-guard starting lineup, led by sophomore guard Lola Mullaney, who finished with 14 points, five rebounds, and four three-point field goals.
In this back-and-forth scoring affair, Delaney-Smith turned to a pair of newcomers, sophomore forward Lindsey Lawson and first-year guard Elena Rodriguez, for key minutes off the bench. Junior guard Annie Stritzel provided important contributions as well, but it was the season debut of junior guard McKenzie Forbes off the bench that left a significant mark on this game. Forbes, a 2018 McDonald’s All-American recruit and transfer from California, Berkeley, finished her opening Crimson performance with 20 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists. Although she only shot six of 19 from the field, Forbes’ play-making skills and natural ability to score the ball excited Delaney-Smith.
“[Forbes’s] skill set is undeniable,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has a fabulous skill set, and she has a great court IQ. Again, she's been one of the [incoming players] that has been sidelined and has missed some practices that I think would have been very valuable to her. So to be able to come back after being sidelined and make that impact for us in the UMass game [and] in [Sunday’s game] is just a sign of the future, that she's just going to get better and better. I'm looking to have her rebound a little bit more for us and continue to play the defense that she's capable of, which is high-IQ defense.”
While losing in a road battle was not the outcome Harvard sought entering Friday night, the Crimson gained from Amherst a better sense of its rotation and identity as a team.
“We’re very deep and very talented,” Delaney-Smith said. “Unfortunately, right before we had our opening game we got hit with some injuries that sidelined a lot of [Harvard’s newcomers], and that's a little bit unfortunate because they are all newcomers, and the offensive system is new. We're still working on who we are [and] what our offensive identity is.
“We've lost a lot of valuable time together playing and just sort of connecting with each other,” Delaney-Smith continued. “They're all back now, but they haven't been in practices. So it was great to see them able to connect without a lot of practices under their belt, and I think that connection is just going to get stronger and stronger.”
HARVARD 70, NORTHERN ILLINOIS 53
Playing under the lights of Lavietes Pavilion for the first time since Feb. 29, 2020, the Crimson (1-2) turned in a thoroughly impressive performance against the Northern Illinois Huskies (1-1) to prevail, 70-53.
The story of the first half was Harvard’s defensive length stalling the Huskies’ offense, which led to inefficient shooting (Northern Illinois shot six of 29 before halftime), turnovers, and fastbreak opportunities for the Crimson offense.
“We weren't mistake-free [on the defensive end], which we never will be,” Delaney-Smith said. “But I do think that my team stuck to the defensive scout for the most part, with a couple of breakdowns in the fourth quarter. [Our] length bothered their point guard. [...] Starting with [first-year guard] Harmoni Turner, everybody who switched on to her did a great job. I'm pretty pleased with our defensive effort.”
After her promising start to the season on Friday, junior guard McKenzie Forbes made her first start in a Crimson uniform in Sunday’s contest. Coach Delaney-Smith paired Forbes alongside four other guards — Turner, sophomore Lola Mullaney, junior Maggie McCarthy, and senior captain Tess Sussman — to form an athletic, fast-paced starting lineup. After Harvard raced out to a 13-point halftime lead, Forbes recorded nine straight points to begin the second half and keep the Crimson scoring advantage in the double digits.
“I think [the lineup of Forbes, Turner, Mullaney, McCarthy, and Sussman] all can shoot the three, and many of them can attack on all three levels. That number 25 for Northern Illinois [A’Jah Davis] is generally much more of an inside presence. I think that we just played the defense I wanted and maybe took [Davis] back on her heels a little bit early and got her in foul trouble. That really helped us. There's not a true five player [in this lineup], and we're very undersized, but I love our teamwork, and I love that we're handling, for the most part, the bigs in the paint. So it's a work in progress for us to be honest with you.”
In addition to Forbes’ strong play, the Harvard offense was led by McCarthy’s highly efficient 16-point performance on 75 percent field goal shooting, including four of her five three-point attempts. The Massachusetts native provides a steadying presence and leadership to an inexperienced Crimson squad, as she saw important minutes in her 2018-2019 freshman campaign before emerging as a starter on the 2019-2020 Harvard team.
“[McCarthy is] our rock. She's our foundation. She has a calmness to her and a leadership [ability] on the court that really helps us connect all of our new and young players. The problem with that is we don't get her into scoring positions as much as we want. So I think that the intention to get her to score a little bit more is something we're trying to do. It was great to see her finally get more shots that I want her to get.”
McCarthy, Forbes, and the Crimson will return to the hardwood this Friday at 7 p.m. as they travel to Piscataway, N.J., to face Big Ten power Rutgers (3-1).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 8, 2021, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) USA announced that former Harvard standout and professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 would be the newest addition to its team as a UNICEF Ambassador. In this role, Lin will be helping children in a variety of different ways; however, he is specifically focused on advocating for the mental health of America’s young population.
“I do think the conversation has been started,” says Lin of the youth mental health movement, “and I just want to keep being a part of that.”
Lin’s biggest goal, he says, is to continue that conversation however he can.
Already taking steps toward achieving that goal, Lin represented UNICEF USA at the State of the World’s Children Report launch event with Congress and was also a keynote speaker at The Aspen Institute Project Play Summit. With his participation in these two events, Lin grew as a leader and mental health advocate in new ways.
“What I learned from those instances is that there are a lot of people that care about it,” said Lin, referring to children’s mental health advocacy. “For me, when I find a conviction or passion around something, sometimes it can feel like I'm the only person, or I'm one of the few people that is trying to do this. … The fact that I even got a chance to do that and be a part of that shows that there are a lot of people that are trying to talk about [mental health].”
The topic of mental health is indeed garnering more attention in the media today. Tennis phenom Naomi Osaka, the highest paid female athlete, withdrew herself from Wimbledon, the oldest and arguably most competitive tennis tournament in the world, referencing her prioritization of mental health as the reason she removed herself from the competition. Similarly, during the 2020 Summer Olympics, superstar gymnast Simone Biles pulled out of the all-around competition in order to focus on her own mental well-being. In light of the media attention and subsequent national discourses spurred by these decisions, Lin recognizes that, although the conversation about the importance of mental health has begun, it is still met with resistance by some.
“I think the conversation is happening, for sure, but I think it is still very divisive,” Lin added.
However, even in the face of stigma and adversity surrounding mental health, Lin is confident that there is progress being made.
“As long as that conversation is being had, I do think in general, we will trend towards the right direction,” Lin said. “It’s worse when you're not having a conversation at all.”
A member of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community himself, Lin recognizes the unique mental health challenges present within the AAPI community — challenges that have only been exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Lin thinks there are three main obstacles that members of the AAPI community face in regards to mental health: cultural stigmas, impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on children’s well-being, and the prevalence of anti-AAPI sentiments throughout America.
While every AAPI household is different, Lin believes that, as a cultural group, there is room to grow and work to be done in mental health literacy.
“I don't want to just over-generalize and say every house is like this, but in many Asian cultures, [mental illness] isn't talked about all that often,” Lin said. “When you talk about getting a therapist or something like that, immediately somebody thinks something is gravely, gravely wrong versus just saying: ‘Hey, I need mental health resources. I need help.’”
Lin’s second point is that the Covid-19 pandemic presents challenges for children specifically as well. He cites the unique circumstances that children face growing up in a pandemic.
“Because of the pandemic, because of isolation, because of how much things have changed, and how life has changed, it's really hard for kids who grew up knowing life to be a certain way, and then all of a sudden it's never going to be the same or hasn't been the same in a long time,” Lin said.
Lin also points out that the AAPI community has faced increased racism in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Anti-AAPI hate crimes have been reported to be up 149 percent, and that is even before the deadly shootings that occured in March.
“Now we're seeing something [racism against the AAPI community] even worse in terms of mental health, compounded right on top of the pandemic,” Lin said. “The Asian American community right now is really struggling.”
Unfortunately, Lin is no exception to the anti-AAPI sentiment and has had to brace himself in the face of racism's impact in his own life. With this has come subsequent mental health challenges, many of which he feels other members of the AAPI community would be able to relate with.
“I think the biggest thing is I didn't even know,” said Lin looking back on the racism he’s faced. “[Traumatic experiences] almost subtly at times shift how you view everything, and you're not even aware of it. ... That's the scary part about it.”
Being an elite athlete playing at the highest level possible comes with a certain level of pressure that few people will ever experience in their lives. Lin has faced these pressures and anxiety throughout his career, and he believes that if he had sought help with them earlier, the resources would have been beneficial to his own mental well-being.
“As I've begun to unwind and unpack these things, I've almost felt like the richness of life has kind of been robbed from me because of certain things that maybe I hadn't handled in the past,” Lin said.
Having an immense passion for helping the next generation was a contributing factor in Lin wanting to join UNICEF USA as an ambassador. Lin accredits this to the inspiration he draws from his parents, Gie-Ming and Shirley Lin. First-generation immigrants, they moved to the United States without English literacy in order to give their children the best chance possible at accomplishing their dreams.
“They were basically saying ‘We're gonna forgo all of our dreams to try to become an immigrant so that you guys [Lin and his siblings] can have a chance to have a better future,” Lin said. “So for me, me being able to be an NBA basketball player for nine years and to be able to be a professional basketball player for 12 years and to be able to do what I've done, it's because of them.”
The sacrifice made by Lin’s parents has left him determined to help the next generation.
“I'd be crazy not to try to be heavily thinking about the next generation as well and saying ‘What can I do to make their lives a little bit easier, a little bit better and to pass along the legacy of what the previous generation has done for us?’” Lin said.
The UNICEF USA Ambassador believes that there is still plenty of work to do in order to help youth with mental well-being.
“I really hope we start having many more resources available,” the Palo Alto native remarked. “Even when I talked to some of the students who are members of our foundation grantees, they say, ‘There aren't that many mental health resources available at our middle school or at our high school.’ And even if they do, the students don't believe that they'll work or they’ll do anything, or they don't even know that it’s there.”
However, Lin has a plan to help rectify some of these gaps in the mental health system.
“What I hope to be doing with UNICEF, is actually providing really effective tools, resources and conversations so that children, when they are dealing with things that can be traumatic or things that they need to process, they can immediately know ‘Where do I go to to be able to handle this and to be able to process this?’” Lin said.
Lin thinks that we have a long way to go, but if he can help make even a small amount of progress as a UNICEF USA Ambassador, he will consider that a success.
“I don't necessarily think that in my time as an ambassador, we're gonna see everything that we want done,” Lin said.“I think it's going to take so much time, so many different people, so many conversations.”
However, Lin sees the power in numbers and has hope for the future.
“Even when I go through certain things, or when I see even family members go through certain mental health issues, it's always comforting to see that there are a lot of other people that can join alongside each other to really inspire each other and help each other,” Lin added.
The NBA champion has done a lot for the AAPI community, the game of basketball, those who struggle with mental health, and many others already, but this next matchup he chose to take on — helping children in need — may be the most challenging one to date.

So, you finished all your midterms? You’re feeling extra liberated? So relaxed that you spent this entire past weekend… Having fun? Absolutely unacceptable! (Just kidding — relax and remember that school isn’t everything).
It’s time to sit down and face reality. You have two papers, a capstone project, a presentation, and a final coming up, and I know what you want to do. I know you want to leave the papers to the last possible minute, because well, don’t we all.
But if you want to have some peace of mind and enjoy Harvard-Yale, Thanksgiving Break, and Reading Week a little bit more so that every week before winter break isn’t yet another “Hell Week,” here’s your guide on how to not procrastinate on all those pages of writing.
Step 1: Lie to yourself. 
The paper is due next Monday? No, the paper is due this Friday. You have another paper due Friday? That due date is now Wednesday. Fake it (earlier deadlines) till you make it (the real deadline). Get yourself to start early, no matter what it takes!
Step 2: Make a schedule. 
Break up the work over a few days. Brainstorm your thesis today, do the outline tomorrow. But if you’re like me… then it’s time to put on your PJs & head to Lamont on Monday morning and not come out till the next day. If the paper is done early, does it really matter how you get it done? The answer is no. (Ok, it matters a little, but we’re not worrying about that right now.)
Step 3: Set your alarm for 5 a.m. everyday (JK).
Obviously, this is going to work especially after you went to bed at 3 a.m. and have a 9 a.m. I’m just kidding, please don’t try this at home. If you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t get any productive work done. Eight hours of sleep is key.
Step 4: Book out the Smith Campus Center meeting rooms. 
Lock yourself in there all day (or for the 2 hour max booking). Bring your phone, laptop, speakers, popcorn, soda… wait a second, Shang-Chi is on Disney Plus for free now? Don’t be like me and do this to yourself: make sure to be in a distraction-free environment every time you work on your paper. Motivate yourself by booking a room or scheduling a work date with yourself in Widener.
Step 5: Work with friends? Maybe rethink that choice... 
Work with friends? Absolutely not. Not even your latest section crush. I don’t care how nice they are— they can edit the paper after it’s done.
Step 6: Start beef. 
Who said you have to start the paper with the introduction? No one ever. Write your counter argument. Let it all out. Start with whatever concept you feel most confident about to really get the ball rolling. Just write. Don’t think.
Step 7: Bonus: Reference “Should You Drink That Coffee At 4 a.m.”
Energize. Write. Sleep. Repeat. Finish work. You got this! Get that paper done early.
Honestly, if you can finish the paper two hours before the deadline — I’m proud of you and you should be too! It is not easy keeping up with deadlines and starting early can feel impossible. Hopefully, with these tips, Flyby can help you ace your final papers! Relax, take a deep breath, and get started.
