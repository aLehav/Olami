After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How are you going to pay for that?” You’ve seen it a hundred times: some serious-looking pundit with glasses and a suit interrogates some over-eager politician who actually wants to do something meaningful with their elected position. They recite some jargon about taxes and savings, bicker briefly with the pundit, and then the segment ends. The pundit is proud to have done their job holding this politician accountable to fiscal responsibility; what could be more important? After all, there isn’t an infinite supply of money. Except, in a very important sense, there is.
Let’s go back in time. Prior to 1933, the U.S. dollar, like most currencies, was on the gold standard, limiting the amount of money the U.S. could create. However, this is no longer the case.
Today, the United States is the sole issuer of the U.S. dollar. As a fiat currency, it is inconvertible into any real resource. In 1946, then-chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, Beardsley Ruml, published an article declaring that, as a result, “our Federal Government has final freedom from the money market in meeting its financial requirements.” This is stated in plain English in the article’s title: “Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete.”
This may be surprising; it certainly contradicts mainstream discourse about spending. Concerns about debt or inflation are still valid, and it is still reasonable to debate by how much government spending should exceed tax revenue. But there is no physical restriction on the amount of money the U.S. can spend.
If the federal government wants to pay you $100, they can tell your bank to increase the number in your bank account by 100. There is no need for physical dollar bills or borrowing money; all that is required is an update in your bank’s computer system and now you are $100 richer. The opposite occurs when you pay taxes; you give a bank account to the government and they subtract from the number in your account. There is no exchange of actual dollar bills here, but money is removed from circulation nonetheless. The government creates money by spending and destroys it by taxation, and it does both without worrying about the supply of coins and bills. This means there is no physical restriction on the amount of money it can create.
The implications of this process are profound and far-reaching. No longer do politicians have to play the “how do you pay for it” game; the government can simply create new money. The government may want to tax to reduce inflation resulting from an increase in the money supply, but this does not prevent them from spending it in the first place. The true constraint on government spending is resources. Can the U.S. government buy everyone a Ferrari? Sadly no, because there are far less than 327 million Ferraris in existence. But if there were 327 million Ferraris up for sale, it would theoretically be possible for the federal government to buy them all and give one to every American.
Recently, Bernie Sanders proposed universal childcare and pre-K plan that he claimed would be paid for by a wealth tax on the richest Americans. Can we achieve universal child care? If there are enough people willing to work in child care to meet the demand, yes. But reducing the number in Jeff Bezos’ bank account will not create new child care resources. It may be necessary to increase taxes to deal with the economic effects of this increased spending, but taking dollar bills from billionaires is not necessary for spending in the first place.
The taxpayer money myth is the antiquated belief that taxes fund government spending, and the existence of this idea is an existential threat to progressive policy. This myth legitimizes harmful ideas such as “welfare recipients mooch off of taxpayers” and makes cutting welfare programs much more popular. The myth establishes “taxpayers” as a privileged class. If taxpayers fund the government, then it follows that they should decide what the government does — after all, it’s their money. As a result, the most marginalized and disadvantaged people are seen as the least worthy recipients of government assistance while the rich and powerful rig the levers of power to receive favor after favor.
It all comes down to protecting wealthy interests. The rich and powerful oppose universal healthcare because it would prevent employers from using the threat of a lack of healthcare access to coerce their employees; programs like universal healthcare transfer power from the rich to ordinary people. Of course, they would never say that they’re willing to let poor people die to protect their own interests. They complain that it will raise middle-class taxes, which is equivalent to stealing people’s hard-earned money. Why should taxpayers pay for other people’s healthcare? Progressives can try to respond to this objection, but we don’t have to. We can reject the premise of the question altogether by realizing that we already have the resources to provide healthcare to all Americans, we just need to make them accessible to everyone.
The progressive movement in the United States should stop playing the “where is the money” game. If we are serious about getting things done — universal healthcare, basic income, solving climate change — we need to reject the taxpayer money myth in its entirety. We waste the power of the federal government by not taking advantage of all of the resources at our disposal to make our lives better. If we spend our time scrounging around for tax dollars, we will never accomplish what needs to be done. Let’s start getting things done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, Harvard College’s houses, dining rooms, and lecture halls were filled with nearly 7,000 chattering students. By Monday evening, though, those spaces nearly emptied amid an unprecedented evacuation order by administrators in response to the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
Just last Tuesday, many students woke up to a pair of emails from University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana informing them that classes would move online for the remainder of the semester and that undergraduates had five short days to vacate their dorms. House administrators wrote in a series of subsequent messages that exemptions to stay in Cambridge would be few and far between.
As most College students transitioned out of their dorms before Harvard’s 5 p.m. Sunday deadline, around 100 joined an undergraduate-created group message for the rare students who College authorities approved to stay until May 17.
One of those students, Currier resident Mike T. Shirek ’20, said the practical changes to life on campus brought with them a sense of loneliness.
“I think those of us remaining are still trying to maintain a sense of community for each other. But that is not to say that it doesn't feel changed,” Shirek said. “I think a lot of us still are kind of facing a level of loneliness. I think the thing that really struck me with Currier is our dining hall is this community center.”
“Someone was talking at lunch today about how you just walk by and now it’s just empty. There's a sadness in that, I think,” he added.
Students like Shirek have received a series of updates about the shape of College life for the next several months.
Remaining students will move to new rooms on Wednesday, according to emails sent to them by the College’s Housing and Residential Life Committee. Among the houses remaining open are Adams, Kirkland, Eliot, and Quincy.
The committee’s email also laid out a series of new “residential life policies” aimed at combating the spread of the coronavirus.
In accordance with state and University recommendations, each student will have their own bedroom and bathroom. They may not host parties, overnight guests, or meetings of more than five people. Even if they are over 21 years old, they may not use drugs or drink alcohol.
“This is an extremely important rule,” the committee wrote about the drug and alcohol policy. “We need students to be especially vigilant to prevent situations where they need medical help from the overuse of alcohol and drugs. We cannot contribute to what, in the coming weeks, is very likely to be an overburdened healthcare system.”
Students who remain on campus will also adjust to a meal system different from the bustling dining halls Harvard normally operates. Harvard University Dining Services will provide each student three takeaway meals and a snack from their assigned dining location daily, in accordance with new Massachusetts rules against on-site food and beverage consumption.
University libraries, including Widener, Lamont, and Cabot Science Library, will remain closed to students indefinitely as they begin online classes. Recreation facilities, including the Malkin Athletic Center, Hemenway Gym, and Murr Center, have also closed for the semester.
Guillaume A.P. Bouchard ’23 said he was grateful for the accommodations announced Monday.
“On the whole, I've been really pleasantly surprised by their response, and by just how alert and aware of our concerns the administration is,” he said. “They’re very conscious of our concerns and are trying their very best to accommodate us.”
Shirek also said he expected to discover some less grim aspects to life on campus.
“I am confident that those of us remaining are going to provide at least a safe form of community for each other and honestly kind of looking forward to maybe making some last friends,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several academic departments announced to Harvard undergraduates this week that they are adapting concentration requirements to allow for increased flexibility under the “extraordinary” circumstances wrought by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Some degree programs — including Applied Math, Computer Science, Neuroscience, Social Studies, and Linguistics — are now allowing spring courses graded on a pass-fail basis to count for concentration credit.
The Government department will permit concentrators and those pursuing a secondary to take two pass-fail courses this semester, in addition to the one pass-fail course they are typically allocated in their full four years. The Philosophy department is currently soliciting student input on how to implement pass-fail options for concentration requirements.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced last week that, as all courses transition to an online-only model, the deadlines to drop courses or to switch them to pass-fail grading would be extended to April 13.
Beth Musser, undergraduate program coordinator for Computer Science, wrote in an email that the Computer Science department took this step in recognition of stress related to the pandemic.
“I know at CS we just want to try to alleviate some of students’ stress in this difficult time,” she wrote. “We’re thinking about all the barriers to learning students will face—new expectations on their time at home, access to the internet and the right tools to access their courses, the potential of becoming ill, general anxiety about the pandemic, as well as the transition to online learning for both faculty and students.”
“This is an extraordinary time for all of us,” she added.
Bernhard Nickel, director of undergraduate studies for the Philosophy department, also said he hoped the change would remove a “barrier” for students.
“We recognize that there are many challenges involved in the College going to online-only courses in addition to the fact that a lot of the students face a lot of threats just from the broader health pandemic,” he said.
Nara Dillon, director of undergraduate studies for the Government department, said the department made its decision in light of the large volume of pass-fail petitions it has received.
“Given the number of petitions that we've gotten, we thought we would go ahead and roll out this policy to give students some assurance that no matter what, we're going to take into account what they're dealing with,” she said. “We're trying to respond to that and to try and make sure that we'll be treating students equitably.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard athletes who were sidelined by the Ivy League’s decision to ax the spring athletics season due to coronavirus will likely receive another year of eligibility, according to a statement put out by the National Collegiate Athletic Association last week.
A day after the NCAA canceled all winter and spring sport championships, the association posted on Twitter that “eligibility relief is appropriate for all Division I student-athletes who participated in spring sports.” The statement added that leagues within the association would sort out the policy’s details “in the coming days and weeks.”
How the NCAA’s statement will affect Harvard athletes remains unclear. Harvard Athletics spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson wrote in a Monday email that Harvard is waiting for the NCAA to release more information on what form relief will take. Ivy League spokesperson Matthew J. Panto wrote in an email that the season’s cancelation is “an unprecedented situation” and also wrote that the Ivy League schools are working with one another to deal with its ramifications, including the “ongoing eligibility of senior spring student-athletes.”
Despite the uncertainty the new policy presents, many Harvard athletes said it represents a step forward for athletes benched by recent cancellations.
Harvard baseball player Kieran K. Shaw ’20 said he was “ecstatic” when he heard the news.
“Having your season taken away from you by circumstances out of your control is frustrating,” he said. “But then being hopefully awarded with another chance to continue to play baseball for a lot of us seniors is a pretty amazing feeling.”
Shaw said he hopes to enter the June 2020 draft for Major League Baseball. Another year of eligibility to play collegiate baseball, he said, provides him with more options.
Harvard runner Anna M. Juul ’21 said the decision did not surprise her.
“It makes a lot of sense,” she said. “I don't know why they wouldn't give the eligibility back considering no one's competing, right?”
If Harvard spring athletes receive another year of eligibility to play collegiate sports, under current policies, they would not be able to do so in Harvard — or at any of the seven other Ivy League schools.
Student-athletes are only eligible to compete for Harvard during their eight semesters of active enrollment at the College, according to the most recently released Harvard student-athlete handbook. Williamson also noted in his email that the Ivy League does not allow graduate student participation in varsity athletics.
Juul, who said she is interested in earning a graduate degree, said she plans to take advantage of the NCAA’s eligibility relief. She acknowledged she will most likely have to enroll at a non-Ivy League institution to do so.
“Harvard on the whole is usually a great place to study and be an athlete. So it's sad,” she said. “There are other great places out there as well, I'll just have to look really hard to try and find something that can compare.”
Harvard baseball player Matthew Thomas ’21 said there are too many unknowns for him to immediately decide whether he plans to take advantage of eligibility relief.
“It totally depends on the other opportunities I have,” he said.
Harvard heavyweight rower Max G. T. Shakespeare ’23 said he does not think he would find fulfillment rowing for a school other than Harvard.
“Suddenly leaving that and going and competing for the opposition,” he said. “I don't think it would mean that much.”
Former Harvard basketball player Kirby P. Porter ’18, who founded Court to Corporate, a media platform that advises athletes, said an athlete’s decision to use their eligibility relief is a personal one.
“There's 98 percent of [college] athletes that go through the process of transition and closure and reidentifying your confidence and leveraging that to succeed in your career,” she said. “But none of us have dealt with this abrupt closure.”
