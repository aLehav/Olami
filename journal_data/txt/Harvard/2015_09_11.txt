After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was 13, the words “practical” and “Jansport” gave me hives. Anything featuring a mesh pouch specifically engineered to hold a water bottle made me want to vomit. Entering high school, I couldn’t think of anything more preposterous than buying a backpack for my books.
To understand my singular opinion on backpacks and their ridiculousness, you need to know a bit about six-year-old me, who had so many thoughts and opinions to share that she almost never shut up. When adults struck up conversations with me, likely assuming that I was a shy and benign kindergartener, I could launch into hours-long discussions peppered with observations from snack time, ranging from my dislike of Goldfish to my theories on our class pet’s level of emotional fulfillment.
But as I—voice squeaky, toothpick-thin arms gesticulating wildly—chatted with any adult who would listen to me, I noted with chagrin that people saw me more as “adorable” than “adult.” I winced when people called me cute. Surely they thought my ideas were darling and tiny like me.
I was no fool. I knew what grown-ups looked like—we had plenty of them at my high school—but I didn’t fit the bill. What was I missing? A shoulder bag.
Girls in my high school carried bags from class to class like adults carrying purses. Though school rules prohibited kindergarteners from doing the same, I found a surprising amount of solace in knowing that, in nine short years, I would sling a bag over my shoulder and stylishly saunter towards the horizon of my adult life.
Like a Harvard freshman waits for the last day of Expos, I spent much of my young life looking forward to the day when adults would look at me and see a peer. And everything I wanted—to be in high school, trusted with responsibility, viewed as an adult—became inextricably linked to the bag I envisioned on my arm.
Nine years later I did find myself slinging a book bag over one shoulder and walking into high school with untouchable confidence. I didn’t know who my friends would be, I feared that the workload would batter me, and I was unsure of the location of the cafeteria, but any emotional luggage I brought with me to ninth grade fit into my purse. Every time I needed a notebook, I encountered its loud, graphic zebra-print and remembered that I was a spiffy, capital-G Grown-Up, and I could handle anything.
My trusty book bag held up like a champ through four intense years of studying and friendship drama. Save a certain air of jaded worldliness (read: layer of grime) it didn’t have before, it came out relatively unscathed. But by then, I was tired of looking at it. It had been the primary accessory of every outfit I’d worn for the past four years. And everything it represented—high school and its side order of wisdom, knowledge, and responsibility—was already mine. The four-year stint that had once seemed a far off dream, the capstone to my education and maturation, had now become a sweet-and-sour memory.
It was delicious, but I was full.
Now, I’d be shouldering a different load.
For one, I wasn’t so anxious to get my youth out of the way. As teachers expected more of me, I had likewise become harder on myself, and I began to see that being a “Grown-Up” was difficult and often unglamorous. I yearned for the days when I believed that being a Big Girl was as easy as wearing a purse.
And despite my first few run-ins with the grit and grief of growing up, I was excited for a fresh start and a new set of promises. Namely that I could leave behind my uniform, live with my peers, and choose what I would learn. That the things I needed most, like a new measure of independence and better friendships, would be mine.
I wanted professors, TAs, failures, entryways.
And listservs. So many listservs.
And I needed a new backpack to convey all of these things.
Fickle? Wasteful? Vain? I don’t think so. Much valid criticism launched at the fashion industry is that it perpetuates a culture of wastefulness and superficiality. But barring issues of brand-name elitism and pure vanity, shopping isn’t always just a question of handing over money and getting a commodity in exchange.
Though fashion is foremost a visual expression, sometimes sartorial statements are selfish. That is, they reflect an internal shift in the wearer. My backpack is just as obnoxious as it was before. (I traded in the zebra stripes for a camouflage print that I believe is cool, but my most style-conscious friend tells me otherwise.) But these days, I don’t dress myself in the hopes that I can change the immutable: that I’m young, that I go to school, that there’s a lot I know but much more I don’t.
I bought a backpack because I’m a student, and that is what students buy. Younger iterations of me would scoff at the way I earnestly don my book-filled backpack each morning. But I love being a girl with so many interesting classes—and books to match—that my backpack simply must distribute their weight to both sides of my aching spine.
That, and camo is totally in these days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday and Sunday, Harvard men will audition for the cast of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a theater troupe famous for its all-male, burlesque, cross-dressing performances—just as Harvard men have done almost annually since 1844. This year, however, at least 17 female students plan to take the stage alongside them.
These women have signed up for this year’s auditions to protest the unfairness of an all-male cast: Although women are involved in the production, technical work, band, and other aspects of the Pudding’s productions, cast roles are occupied exclusively by men, regardless of the gender of the part. In light of the protest, HPT President Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16 wrote in an email to The Crimson that the question of including women in the performances had been brought up last spring and is a “topic of serious conversation.”
The issue at hand demands more than just a conversation. After 171 years of all-male performances, it is time for the HPT to open its cast roles to everyone with the talent to fill them—regardless of gender.
There's value in certain single-sex artistic forms, such as barbershop quartets and other acapella groups. But in most cases, there's also a female alternative to the performances or organizations: At Harvard, for example, boys can sing for the Harvard Krokodiloes or Din and Tonics, and girls may join the Radcliffe pitches. There is no female counterpart to the Hasty Pudding cast, and given the unparalleled opportunities being a cast member can offer to an undergraduate interested in theater, that's a big problem.
The Pudding is the third oldest theatrical group in the world, known for its prestige, professionalism, and talent from Cambridge to New York City to Bermuda and beyond. It provides its members a rare chance to make connections at an international level, and gain knowledge and experience in ways that are unattainable in most other groups—ways that could help launch the professional careers of aspiring performers. To exclude women from the Pudding’s casts is to deny them this same opportunity.
In a better world, students today could found an all-female equivalent to the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, providing women the same resources, opportunities, and experiences that the male group provides men. In an ideal world, such an equivalent would already exist. In the real world, though, there is no female Pudding and neither is there a viable way to create one. The Pudding has a long and established history, deep connections with its professional partners, and a quality alumni support apparatus—all near impossible to replicate.
This history and these connections shouldn’t be an excuse for the Pudding to cry tradition and remain all-male. Instead, they should be a reason for the organization to take a chance and make a change: Over years of creative and comedic productions, the Pudding has built up a legitimacy few other college organizations can claim. That legitimacy won’t disappear with a change alumni and some current members are already clamoring for. It’s time for the Pudding to stop dragging its feet and open its doors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His trial concluded only last month, but Owen Labrie—the St. Paul’s School graduate who was planning on joining the College’s Class of 2018 before he was accused of sexual assault and faced heavy scrutiny in the media—has not been enrolled at Harvard since last year. 
The 19-year-old, accused of raping a then-15-year-old girl during his final year at the prestigious New Hampshire boarding school while participating in a tradition known as the “senior salute,” was found guilty of multiple misdemeanors and one felony charge of using the internet to solicit a minor, but was acquitted of aggravated felonious sexual assault. He faces a maximum sentence of 11 years and will have to register as a sex offender.
Although Harvard has declined to confirm that it revoked Labrie’s admission to the College—he could have withdrawn after the allegations surfaced, and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment—legal experts say that rescinding his offer to come to campus is well within Harvard’s rights.
It is also not without precedent. In 2003, the College revoked its admission of controversial admit Blair Hornstine following charges that she had plagiarised articles she had written for her local newspaper. Hornstine notoriously sued her school district to ensure that she would be its sole valedictorian.
More recently, in late 2013, then-sophomore Eldo Kim emailed hoax bomb threats to Harvard officials during the College’s exam period, prompting the shutdown of three academic buildings and Thayer Hall. Kim, who is no longer enrolled at the College, has agreed to complete an 18-month deferred prosecution agreement, but it is uncertain whether he will be allowed to return to Harvard to complete his studies.
Harvard has declined to comment specifically on Labrie’s case, but released a statement defending the College’s right to revoke the admission of incoming students.
“Harvard College reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission under certain conditions, which are clearly expressed to students upon their acceptance,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement. “An offer of admission may be rescinded if a student engages in behavior that brings into question his or her honesty, maturity, or moral character.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 declined to comment.
Legal experts agree with Harvard’s stance. Harvey A. Silverglate, a longtime Cambridge lawyer who has advised Harvard students facing Administrative Board investigations, said private schools are entitled to write their own disciplinary codes and are not bound by the norms of the federal justice system.
“Innocent until proven guilty is a concept and standard within the criminal justice system and does not restrict a private school unless that school has voluntarily bound itself to such a high and exacting standard of fairness,” Silverglate wrote in an email.
But while experts and Harvard agree that the University may rescind an admissions offer to incoming students when it so pleases, administrators still must weigh the need to keep their campus safe and the possibility of a student’s innocence when deciding whether to revoke an admissions offer, according to experts. Harvard’s decision to rescind a student is final, according to a University official, but people charged with crimes are not always found guilty.
Labrie, for example, had not yet been convicted of a crime when he was scheduled to come to Cambridge.
He was no longer enrolled at Harvard by September 2014, even though his trial did not commence until this summer. Laura Bennett, the president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, attributed that arrangement partly to the seriousness of the charges he faced. Because anti-sex discrimination law Title IX requires colleges to protect its students from sexual violence, she said, “the campus process can often happen more quickly than a criminal process does.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said the novelty of cases like Labrie’s and Kim’s means that decisions to revoke or expel students are frequently made on an individualized basis.
“You have to make some pretty educated guesses about whether this individual does or does not pose an ongoing threat to your community,” he said. “Each situation is unique.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee tasked with reviewing the College’s General Education program is nearly finished with a draft of its final recommendations and will present them to Faculty at town hall meetings in the next month, according to committee chair Sean D. Kelly.
The committee has worked for the past year soliciting feedback about General Education at the College and at the end of last semester presented an interim report of recommendations on how to change what it has deemed a “failing” program.
Members of that committee, which is composed of seven professors from across the Faculty of Arts Sciences, said they are optimistic that they can complete their final proposal by the end of this semester.
According to History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the committee met several times over the summer to discuss feedback they had received about their interim report and begin drafting a final proposal. She estimated that there will be about four town hall meetings for faculty members. 
Jasanoff called review of the Gen Ed program “the most important issue” of the semester.
The interim report, presented to the Faculty in May, says that while the principles behind the program are solid, its implementation has been faulty. The committee found that students generally do not understand the purpose of the program, find its courses too easy, and do not take the program as seriously as courses in their departments.
Since Gen Ed comprises about a quarter of an undergraduate’s courses at Harvard, the program is the “single most unifying experience that students across the College share,” according to the report.
“It is disturbing to discover, therefore, that despite strengths, and serious efforts by many constituents, the Program is failing on a variety of fronts,” the report says.

Since the end of last semester, Kelly and his committee have met with faculty to discuss the interim report. According to Comparative Literature Department Chair David Damrosch, Kelly met with all of the humanities department chairs at the end of the spring to present the report and discuss the program.
“We’re feeling quite upbeat about that. He and his group are really taking a stand in trying to make [the program] better,” Damrosch said.
Jasanoff, who has been a member of Faculty Council and various committees across FAS, said committee work has been enjoyable and “intellectually challenging.”
“The most difficult thing is articulating a short, sweet executable vision” for a program central to the College, Jasanoff said.

In another eight-figure gift to the University’s capital campaign, New York financier Eric M. Mindich ’88 and his wife Stacey have donated $15 million to endow public service initiatives at Harvard College.
The newly established Mindich program will help fund the development of 14 classes with a focus on bringing public service to the academic realm, building on established courses “Poverty in America,” “Reinventing Boston,” and “Practicing Democracy,” the University announced on Thursday. The initiative comes amidst advocacy on campus for public service work, including from University President Drew G. Faust.
The gift will also financially support up to 75 students annually to pursue summer service work, which often offer little or no pay. The Mindich Service Fellows Program builds on a Massachusetts Hall initiative started in 2011 that supports 10 students each year in summer public service internships. The Phillips Brooks House will help administer the new programming and will be renamed the Phillips Brooks House Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship. 
“It will both enable people to go beyond the curriculum in some experiences but also to have as part of the curriculum a more robust presence for public service,” Faust said in an interview this week. “It’s exciting to see the campaign make things like this possible.”
Mindich, who graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the College and was active at the Institute of Politics, became the youngest Goldman Sachs partner in history at age 27 before founding Eton Park Capital Management, a hedge fund now valued at $2.8 billion by NASDAQ. Stacey Mindich is a Tony Award-winning theater producer.
“This innovative program will allow future generations of exceptionally talented and passionate undergraduates to pursue their natural interest in public service, enrich their own experiences, and engage with and benefit the world around them,” Mindich said in a press release.
The gift is well-timed for Faust, who last year heard student concerns about the challenges of affording public service internships at an Undergraduate Council open forum in March. College students lined up to tell the president that they hoped she would provide more financial support for interested students to gain work experience in the public sphere, an experience some said they could not otherwise afford.
“Knowing this gift was being talked about and planned and thought through, when I got all those questions at the UC, I was really happy to see how much this mattered to students because I thought, ‘This is something we’re going to be able to deliver on,’” Faust said.
Mindich’s $15 million donation also boosts Harvard’s capital campaign, which is on track to become the most ambitious fundraising drive in the history of higher education with a $6.5 billion goal. Two years in, the University has raised more than $5 billion in gifts and pledges, according to the last public disclosure of figures in early 2015. If Harvard has continued to raise money at pre-public phase levels since the last public count, the campaign is likely now in the area of $6 billion.

Harvard Student Agencies has acquired College Copywriters, a startup co-founded by Christopher A. Smiles ’15 that connects student freelance writers with websites in need of content services.
HSA, a student-run company that employs hundreds of Harvard undergraduates, includes more than a dozen businesses. Patrick F. Scott ’16, the company's president, said in an interview that the organization viewed the deal, which it officially closed Thursday, as an opportunity it could not pass up.
“College Copywriters fits in perfectly with HSA’s mission, providing student jobs on a very flexible basis,” Scott said.
Scott said he hopes that HSA will take a more active management approach to the company, focusing on developing its customer base to match the supply of students willing to take on copywriting jobs.
“We are planning on directly reaching out to companies to expand the demand for our services,” Scott said. 
HSA has selected Amy Zhao ‘18 to serve as manager of the new arm, according to Scott. Zhao led HSA’s summer business academy this past summer.
Both Scott and Smiles declined to comment on the purchase price of the startup, but Scott said HSA had “more than enough” capital saved to make the acquisition.
Smiles and his high school friend started the startup last year after thinking of the idea a few years earlier while interning together at a search engine optimization company, where they saw how much websites needed copywriting services.
“We read a lot of the content and thought to ourselves, ‘We can do better than this,’ and the more we thought about it, we realized that a lot of our friends could do it better, too,” Smiles said.
Since its founding in mid-2014, College Copywriters has since expanded to 800 colleges and worked with 1,200 students across the country, Smiles said. But during the founders’ last year at college, their priorities shifted away from the company.
“[Co-founder] Brian Diener found a company that he really liked and took a full-time offer from them, and since I was really active in many activities on campus, we kind of let it sit and let the technology platform manage itself,” Smiles said. “We did not want to let this die since it has so much potential, and it is going so fast, and we thought that HSA could do a great job of scaling the operation.”

As "Theater, Dance and Media" held its first classes ever this week, some students are already starting to show interest in Harvard’s newest concentration.
The program seeks to draw its inaugural class of concentrators later this fall with an official launch on Oct. 1.
Martin Puchner, the English and drama professor who led the effort to create the concentration and is now the program’s chair, said the fall offerings unite the academic study of dramatic literature with practical experience.
Some of the courses were previously offered in other departments, such as English, while others, such as a course in acting and directing taught by a visiting professor from the Yale School of Drama, are entirely new. Thirteen "Theater, Dance, and Media" courses are currently listed for fall 2015 on the course catalog on the my.harvard portal.
Although the program’s faculty intend to accept their first concentrators from the Class of 2018, a small number of juniors who have already completed substantial study of theater have received preliminary approval to join.
“Really, the program is designed to welcome our first class of sophomores this year, but we understand that there were a few students who so much wanted to do this, who have been doing this for so long, that telling them, ‘Sorry, you were one year too late,’ seemed cruel and unusual,” Puchner said. “So we are working with a few juniors on allowing them to transfer in.”
Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, an English concentrator who intends to transfer, is one of two juniors currently enrolled in the "Theater, Dance, and Media" junior tutorial.
“I actually always really wanted to study theater in college,” she said. “When the announcement came out about 'Theater, Dance, and Media,' I initially heard that I wouldn’t be able to do it and found that very frustrating.”
Matthew H. Munroe ’17, who hopes to pursue the new concentration jointly with History and Literature, is also enrolled in the tutorial, whose syllabus he and Brophy will help design based on their interests.
“I’ve been involved in theater since elementary school,” he said. “By the middle of my freshman year, I was thinking seriously about doing a special concentration in theater, because that was where my passion was and what I wanted to do after college.”
For his part, Puchner said the program will continue to adapt to the needs and goals of its students as it enters its first year.
“We will tweak it and change it as we get feedback from students who are actually part of this,” he said. “As students, I imagine that it would be exciting to be part of a new program and to actually help shape it.”
He added that he sees the program’s adaptability as one of its strengths.
“Maybe you’ve been on stage a lot during high school, and you want to continue to develop and professionalize that. Maybe you come from more of the scholarly side, or maybe you come through dance,” he said. “There are just so many ways of entering the program, and the program is designed with that flexibility in mind.”
The new concentration was approved unanimously by a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in April after Harvard received a donation to fund it.

The Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning has released a new weekly e-newsletter with the intention of “provid[ing] faculty perspectives on timely, evidence-based teaching advice,” according to an emailed statement from Peter K. Bol, VPAL’s vice provost.
Earlier this week all teaching faculty received the e-newsletter, titled “Into Practice,” from VPAL. The email, which features Karen Brennan, an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Education, explains Brennan’s process of designing a syllabus and suggests that a course’s syllabus can be used “to introduce students to the course culture.”
The letter grew out of a 2012 HILT grant dedicated to creating a publication for teaching staff at the Graduate School of Education and will be sent weekly to all teaching faculty at the University.
The Office o the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, which was formed in 2013 shortly after the creation of HarvardX and edX, states its ultimate aim as “[ensuring] that Harvard remains the leader in teaching and learning innovation.”
Next week’s e-letter will highlight Philosophy professor Alison Simmons’ policy toward electronic devices in the classroom.
“Faculty have a lot to learn from each other about teaching,” said Simmons, citing her own experience learning pedagogy from fellow instructors of Humanities 10, a course taught by five professors, last year. “I learned more about teaching…[from] faculty colleagues than in seminars and conferences on pedagogy”
According to Philosophy professor and Chair of the Committee on General Education Edward J. Hall, there are often cultural barriers to providing pedagogical instruction to faculty members.
“There’s no mystery about this,” said Hall. “Of course you improve your research over time and you can only do that if you get some kind of feedback... We’ve never been trained to think of our teaching that way.”
Bol said the e-letter, designed to be “brief, friendly, and digestible,” was created with the knowledge that faculty don’t have much time to put toward pedagogical improvements.
“Few of us have opportunities to visit many classrooms, take a HarvardX MOOC, or scan the literature on teaching and learning as we are thinking about a syllabus or lesson plan,” Bol said.
Simmons, similarly, acknowledges that it is “hard to find the time to make use of [VPAL’s resources],” though she reports using the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning frequently.
Hall and Simmons both thought that a more bite-sized approach might yield more faculty engagement with VPAL, though Hall suggested that the percentage of faculty who read any given letter might be low.
“I did not read [the e-letter]. I skimmed it at best,” Hall said. However, the email looked “polished” once it was shown to him.
“[Pedagogical instruction] is there if you look for it,” said English professor Stephen Burt, who also did not remember seeing the e-letter. “Harvard is working hard to have pedagogy resources available… I have no complaints.”
“It’ll probably take a while but the first step is to try to change the norms around teaching so that faculty... think of our teaching... the same way we think about our research,” Hall said.

The hundreds of visitors who flock to Harvard Yard daily will have to be a little more careful about what they snap and where they stand this fall.
Under a new set of visitor guidelines, posted throughout the Yard, Harvard is asking its many visitors not to hold up cameras against classroom and dorm room windows, a common happening. Administrators also still prohibit videotaping, as well as public access to any University building without an accompanying Harvard official, according to a set of the guidelines posted online.
The rules also instruct tourists not to walk through private events held in the Yard and note that they are “expected to keep all foot traffic flowing to prevent any congestion within the pathways and to protect the campus landscape.”
They also rule out the use of megaphones, microphones, and loud speakers.
“In order to assure that our students, faculty, and staff have the ability to advance our primary mission of teaching and research as we accommodate our many visitors, we have put in place the following visitor guidelines,” the new rules say. “Failure to comply with these policies will result in termination of your visit and loss of future tour visit privileges.”
According to University spokesperson Tania M. deLuzuriaga, more than 45,000 visitors took the Harvard Information Center’s Guided Historical Tour alone in 2013. Many more people come to the University with a privately led tour group, for admissions tours and open houses, or as part of a self-guided travel experience.
Harvard students—especially the freshmen who populate the dorms in and around the Yard—have long complained about the regular throng of tourists who visit their home, many eagerly hunting for the perfect photo of Harvard undergraduates in their natural habitat.
“First-floor living means captivity—the need to shut out the scant sunlight that enters the room because your half-naked physique might offend a passer-by,” quipped Adam I. Arenson ’00 in a 1996 Crimson opinion piece. “And, if it is afternoon and you can reasonably assume no ‘inappropriateness’ will be going on, your open shades are greeted by telephoto lenses and the criss-cross pattern of the window screen on a stranger's nose.”

Ralph Nader, the former presidential candidate and Harvard Law School graduate, accused his alma mater of servicing corporate greed in a speech there on Thursday.
“Would you be proud of representing the corporate crooks in Wall Street?” Nader asked an audience primarily composed of Law students at Langdell Hall in the early afternoon. “What is the purpose of the Harvard Law School? Well, you know who knows what the purpose is? The corporate giants. They know exactly what the purpose of the Harvard Law School is. It’s to provide endless relays of lawyers who service their interests."
"Harvard Law is not an institution that provokes any kind of consternation or fear among the power structure, just the opposite," he continued. "It’s an institution, and I’ll get around to the exceptions. On the whole, it’s an institution that rationalizes corporate power brilliantly, services corporate power brilliantly with its graduates and some of its departments here….The sum and substance of legal education and its ultimate intellectual challenge has got to be the realization of legal systems furthering justice and fairness for all."

UPDATED: September 11, 2015, at 5:40 a.m.
In a historic move, the Spee Club, one of Harvard’s final clubs, has for the first time invited women to participate in its punch process, positioning it to become the first of the College’s eight all-male final clubs to go co-ed.
By early Friday morning, some sophomores—both men and women—had received envelopes under their doors inviting them to a reception next week at the Spee Club’s building at 76 Mount Auburn St., typical of how the social clubs punch, or put up for entry, prospective members each fall.
Early Friday morning, Spee Club president Matthew E. Lee ’16 confirmed to The Crimson in an email that the club’s members had “voted to welcome all genders in their Fall Punch.” He declined to comment further, and several other members could not be reached.
The move comes as Harvard’s final clubs—which are currently all single-sex and remain officially unrecognized by Harvard—face increased scrutiny from both administrators and some students. A vocal critic of the groups, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has been meeting with representatives from the clubs in private, including their graduate boards. And earlier this week, University President Drew G. Faust discussed the clubs at length with The Crimson and questioned their place at the College.
Amid this pressure, the male final clubs have been uncharacteristically quiet, hosting notably fewer parties at the start of this school year and weighing adopting members-only policies, although the Spee hosted at least one party over Labor Day weekend.
The Spee, founded in 1852, counts prominent alumni such as U.S. President John F. Kennedy ’40 among its former members. It was the first final club at Harvard, in 1965, to accept a black member.
Several women who received invitations to the first Spee punch event said the sight of the card—bearing cursive typeface and sealed with an ornate “S”—under their doors was unexpected, but mostly welcome.
One female sophomore described hearing the news of the change through The Crimson before she discovered the paper invitation that had been slipped under her door. The student observed that it was “crazy” to see that such a historical institution was changing.
Today, Harvard hosts five all-female clubs in addition to their male counterparts, but the women’s groups are relatively new additions to the College’s social scene.
Male final clubs have embedded themselves, structurally and symbolically, in Harvard’s history for more than a century. Previously, they were recognized institutionally by the College, but after they rejected administrators’ demands that they admit women, the clubs severed ties with the University in 1984.
To date, although Harvard still does not recognize any of the clubs, administrators navigate a precarious relationship with their leaders. Administrators meet with club officers regularly to discuss alcohol safety and sexual assault training, among other points, but also remain publicly critical of them.
Specifically, officials highlight the fact that the clubs are single-sex, raising concerns about alcohol use and the potential for sexual assault to occur on club property, which is off-campus. Khurana and others have also recently levied more general criticism of what they say is “exclusivity” in the club scene.
The Spee itself is no stranger to controversy. In March, the club apologized in the face of backlash after it circulated a party invitation that some students deemed sexist. Khurana publicly decried the invitation in a mass email to undergraduates, deeming the electronic missive “offensive.”
The Spee’s decision to invite women to participate in punch this year will change the dynamic of the established process. Annually, clubs host several rounds of events before winnowing down the pool of prospective members and ultimately extending membership offers to a small group.
It remains unclear how other male clubs, and their female counterparts, will react to the news. At least one other club, but not all of them, have begun punching prospective members. And although other male clubs—notably, the Fox—have discussed admitting women before this year, their graduate board members have previously pushed back.
Undergraduate presidents of several male final clubs could not be reached for comment early Friday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening up its season at the Doc Gimmler Invite this weekend, the Harvard men’s golf team enters the season with various new faces joining the squad.
However, the ultimate goal this season remains the same as it was during the previous campaign: to capture an Ivy League Championship.
The Crimson comes off a season in which it finished third in the Ancient Eight for the second consecutive year, placing behind Princeton and champion Penn.
Harvard last took home the Ivy League title in 1975.
“We fielded a strong team last year, and the vibe around this year’s squad is very similar,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We obviously wish some of our results last spring were better, but the culture around us is improving year in and year out and that’s a trend I see continuing into the foreseeable future.”
Despite the loss of senior captain Akash Mirchandani, the Crimson has made several key additions.
Harvard will be joined this fall by freshmen Aurian Capart, Paul Lei, a walk-on, and Seiya Liu.
The incoming class looks to bring a vast amount of talent and success to an experienced roster.
Capart, a native of Bousval, Belgium, was the winner of the Belgium National Matchplay Men’s Championship in 2013, as well as the Belgium Junior Masters Championship in 2012 and 2014.
Liu, meanwhile, was ranked 56th in the nation in the Class of 2015 by Golfweek.
This year’s team will be captained by senior Rohan Ramnath. Also returning to action is sophomore Gregory Royston of Durban, South Africa, who was selected as Ivy League Rookie of the Year last season.
Rounding out the squad are senior Un Cho, juniors Robert Deng, Daniel De La Garza, and Kendrick Vinar, and sophomore Hale Furey.
“We’ve been practicing quite hard this year, and I’m very excited to see how the guys perform out on the course this weekend,” Royston said. “I think with our three new incoming freshmen this year plus our returning cast of veterans we could really accomplish great things.”
The Crimson opens the fall portion of its split season participating in the Doc Gimmler invite hosted by St. John’s University. The tournament will take place this weekend at Bethpage Red course in Farmingdale, N.Y.
Last season Harvard finished tied for sixth out of the 14 teams competing, placing behind eventual champion and Ivy League rival Yale.
Vinar also finished tied for fifth place individually at the event, shooting a combined score of 205 over three rounds.
Additionally, Harvard will make its regular trips to Dartmouth and Yale this fall for the Quechee Club Invitational and the MacDonald Cup.
One new tournament that has been added to the schedule for this year is a trip out west to UCLA during the first weekend in November for the Gifford Collegiate Championship.
The team will then take a four-month hiatus before heading to Georgia over spring break to begin the second half of its campaign.
“The UCLA tournament will feature an elite field, and I’m very curious to see how well we perform in that environment,” Rhoads said. “We’re allowed to bring six players to that event when the tournament is normally teams of five, and I think depth is really one of our strong points this season.”
So far this autumn, Harvard has tried to get in as many practice hours as possible, given the extraordinary circumstances this past winter that only allowed the team two days on its home practice course prior to the conference championship.
“I think we need to keep preparing the way we did last year; that approach really sets us up well,” Rhoads said. “We had a couple of players who even made an extra push to compete over the summer more than normal and try to balance that with jobs and internships.”
With a strong core of players still in the ranks, Harvard hopes to focus its approach to the season on a week-to-week basis.
In doing so the team is planning on treating each tournament just as if it were the Ivy Championships while also being prepared mentally as well as physically.
Coach Rhoads has instilled within his team the sense that improving throughout the year will put them in a position to accomplish what they want come April.
“I think it’s easy to view the season through the lens of your result in the Ivy Championships,” Royston said. “However, that tactic is not the best way for us to approach our season. All we can do is focus on controllable factors every single week we take the course, and that is the way we are most likely to perform our best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just under eight minutes left, facing a 1-0 deficit for the third time in as many games, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2-1) evened the score on senior forward Oliver White’s second goal of the season, making it look as if its match with UConn (1-0-3) was destined for overtime.
However, just 38 seconds after the Crimson breakthrough, the Huskies delivered a blow of their own as senior midfielder Tyler Leeman finished off a three-man attack in transition which broke down the Harvard backline, giving UConn a 2-1 lead which would hold until the final whistle.
“It looked like our guys transitioned back, but we just didn’t find the guy in the back post,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “It looked like the effort was there, but we just missed [Leeman] on the back post.”
Leeman’s strike capped an offensive burst which saw the two teams combine for three goals in the span of a mere two minutes and six seconds, a stark difference from the defensive demeanor which had dominated the majority of the game.
After a defensive struggle in the first half which featured more offsides calls than shots—three versus two—the two offenses came to life in the second stanza.
The Crimson in particular seemed to gain a second wind, as the home team constantly pressured its opponents in the frame, taking eight shots after being held to none in the first half by the Huskies’ back four.
“We did a lot better with some dynamic forward movement,” White said. “We tried to make some improvements and link together the forwards and midfield, trying to be on the same page going forward in the second half.”
Though Harvard ultimately outshot its opponent 8-6, it was UConn who generated the most dangerous chances as Crimson keeper and co-captain Evan Mendez had some difficulty getting a hand on a low shot by freshman forward Abdou Thiam.
Following a few more opportunities on the Harvard end, the Huskies finally opened the scoring a few seconds after the 81 minute mark, as junior defenseman Jakob Nerwinski’s cross deflected off of Crimson junior Daniel Smith’s head. The ball landed at the feet of sophomore defenseman Andrew Geres, who booted it past Mendez.
Geres’ strike was also the first goal of the season for UConn after the team had been held to scoreless draws in their first three games, one of which was against defending Ivy League champion Dartmouth. It was also the redshirt sophomore’s first career collegiate point.
The goal, paired with White being substituted back on for freshman Cesar Farias, ignited the Harvard attack, as the Crimson became the first team to score on UConn all year.
White’s goal evened the score at one as the Belmont, Mass., native headed sophomore midfielder Sam Brown’s cross from the wing past senior keeper Scott Levene. Brown’s cross was the second assist of the season for the sophomore.
The celebration was short-lived, however, as UConn quickly moved forward in transition from the center spot.
A three-man attack consisting of Geres, Leeman, and sophomore midfielder Alex Sanchez used a series of quick passes to break down the Harvard defense.
The rush eventually ended when Geres crossed it to Leeman at the back post for the easy tap-in.
“We knew the whole time they were a fast team,” White said. “It just happened that, that play, things just came together for them. [They] put a couple good passes together…they got forward, [and] put in that cross.”
After a season which saw the team go undefeated at home, the Crimson hasn’t been as successful thus far within the confines of newly-renamed Jordan Field.
Harvard has conceded the first goal in all three of its matchups and has only held a lead for about eight minutes.
The Crimson also struggled with UConn’s offside trap, as Harvard accounted for all four of the game’s offsides decisions as the team continuously attempted to play its forwards through on goal.
The eight shots were also a far cry from the 17 a game average which the squad had managed in its first two games.
But despite coming away from its three-game homestand without a win, the Crimson has shown some positive signs moving forward.
After conceding an average of just over 12 shots a game against SMU and Loyola Marymount, the team held UConn to six shots. Harvard has also managed to outshoot all of its opponents.
Building on these positives and cleaning up the little details will be key for the Crimson as it goes on the road for its next five games, beginning with one against Stony Brook on Sunday.
“I don’t know if we make a lot of changes,” Lehrer said. “I think we just set down some habits, be good at what we do, and improve some stuff [such as] detail.”
