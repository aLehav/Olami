After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the first images in "Certified Copy" is of a book, "Copia Conforme," resting by itself on a table. The cover displays the visage of Michelangelo’s statue of David, gazing archly at its own face reflected in a white surface. Like this initial image, the first and second halves of "Certified Copy" address and mirror one another as enigmatically as David’s inscrutable expression. As its title suggests, the film explores the relative values of imitations and originals in art but also, more ambiguously, in life.
"Certified Copy" is Iranian auteur Abbas Kiarostami’s first feature filmed outside of his home country. Set in Tuscany, the film spans about half a day in the life of a couple who initially seem to have never met prior to that morning. Juliette Binoche plays Elle, a gallery owner living in Arezzo, in a flutteringly expressive performance for which she won the Best Actress prize in Cannes. William Shimell, in an impressive cinematic debut, portrays James Miller, author of the fictional book "Copia Conforme," a title whose translation serves as the film’s name as well.
Writer and director Kiarostami plays an elegant game with audience expectations in "Certified Copy." Elle and James appear to meet for the first time at a lecture where James introduces his new book. But Kiarostami soon calls into question the nature of the relationship between these two apparent strangers. As the two sit down for coffee, the middle-aged proprietress ‘mistakes’ James for Elle’s husband, and Elle does not correct her. The reality is then left to the viewer: is the truth about these two characters slowly being revealed, or are they playfully building up an imaginary relationship, piece by piece? What makes the film so remarkable is that either alternative is equally plausible. Nothing said before the turning point in the café contradicts anything that is said afterward.
The original title of James’s book is "Forget the Original, Just Get a Good Copy." A recurring theme in the film is that human beings are by nature inauthentic and frayed at the edges. We change inexorably with time, to the point that our current personas are essentially ‘copies’ of our conception of who we think we used to be. The same applies to our relationships, which for Miller exist as recollected constructs. Intrinsic to this conception of imitation of character and human connection is the inevitable decay that occurs from copy to copy, resulting in repeated failed attempts to recapture the past. The movie’s ambiguous love story between Elle and James thus centers upon the question as to whether the euphoria at the beginning of a relationship can ever be re-experienced. The answer depends on which understanding of the film and the relationship of its leads is taken.
Though "Certified Copy" sets itself up for any number of possible interpretations, given the self-consciously reflective nature of both its plot and imagery, it seems reasonable to infer that the first and second parts of the film are intended to perfectly mirror one another. Each half represents a counter-interpretation of the same characters and their story. Of course, a reflected image is in reality the exact reverse of what it shows. Put another way, mirror images are inversions so complete they deceive the eye into believing it perceives the original. Because of this, the film cannot be reduced to a single absolute narrative.
Rather, like the two faces of David looking at each other, Kiarostami’s work keeps its secrets to itself, but still invites speculation and admiration in equal measures. Ultimately, the meaning of "Certified Copy" is in the eye of its beholder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I read like a magpie,” author and former Harvard expository writing preceptor Paul Harding said to a packed audience in Boylston Hall’s Fong Auditorium last Tuesday evening. His comment referred to his obsessive habit of reading the stacks of books in every room in his house, as well as the breadth of his reading interests, which range from American transcendentalism, to quantum physics. He says he often forgets where independent passages come from, but he relishes finding connections between the seemingly disparate worlds of different writers. Knowing this, it’s no surprise that Harding is known as a master of the extended metaphor.
Thomas R. Jehn, the Sosland Director of the Harvard College Writing Program and also a former expos preceptor, introduced “A Conversation on the Craft of Writing,” the 10th event in the Harvard Writers at Work Lecture Series. According to Jehn, the series encourages members of the Harvard community and the public to consider the “transformational power of writing in people’s lives and in the world.” Jehn and Harding exchanged collegial badinage on Harding’s recent wave of public success. “We are in the process of naming a wing of the Expos Building on Prescott Street after him,” Jehn announced, and without missing a beat, Harding responded: “Can I pay that in installments?”
Harding started the talk with a brief reading of the opening from a thoroughly-thumbed copy of “Tinkers,” his debut novel and the winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The slim volume follows the last eight days of a New England clock repairman named George Washington Crosby. In the excerpt, Crosby, on his deathbed, hallucinates that the house he built is falling in on him. The roof, the attic, and the second floors of the house and their contents come crashing down, evoking the unraveling of an entire life.
The next two passages came from Harding’s next novel, still in progress, which features George Washington Crosby’s grandson, Charlie, dealing with the aftermath of his 13-year-old daughter’s death in a car accident. Drawing on extended metaphors from his fiction, Harding shared his own “interrogative” process of writing. He begins with a descriptive, declarative sentence or image, and then extends it. “You take the logic of the premises of the initial images and just keep extending them until they turn into, hopefully, these irreducible, sufficient images.” According to Harding, this method of gradually weaving a metaphor creates an organic, symbolic resonance that does not seem forced onto the narrative. For Harding, the interactions and qualities of smaller objects impact the larger fabric of the story. “In ‘Tinkers,’ for example, there isn’t a single sentence I didn’t rewrite 20 times, just to calibrate, just to get everything exactly right.”
The rest of the talk was devoted to questions and conversations with the audience. When asked about technical aspects likes plot, Harding gave firm answers. “I am interested in character, and so plot is always a predicate of character, it’s also always an emergent property.” But although Harding advocated revision and intellectual engagement, he emphasized that the rhythm and pace of writing is highly individual and that trying to adhere to someone else’s standard can be discouraging for aspiring writers. For Harding, years of “guerrilla” writing between jobs and taking care of children has made him independent of inspiration: “If I wanted to write,” he said, “I had to fight for it. So I just couldn’t be precious. I couldn’t, you know, flip my scarf and say, ‘The muse didn’t show up today.’ No ... I’m always writing in my brain.”
Liang Wong, a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found the writing tips to be best part of the talk. He was drawn to Harding’s precise writing. “It shows you the beauty of nature, but I also feel that [“Tinkers”] is very scientific. It’s not just aesthetic.” Although Wong was discussing the novel’s style, he could easily have been describing Harding’s approach to the practice of writing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In the early ’50s I was reading Bernard Malamud’s stories, later collected in ‘The Magic Barrel,’ as they appeared... in Partisan Review and the old Commentary,” wrote Philip Roth in a 1986 homage to one of his greatest influences. “He seemed to me then to be doing no less for his lonely Jews and their peculiarly immigrant, Jewish forms of failure than was Samuel Beckett, in his longer fiction, for misery-ridden Molloy and Malone.” For a few decades in the middle of the last century, American fiction featured a strong Jewish voice, world-weary yet wisecracking, in which unconcern—even disgust—toward the world coexisted with fascination with its linguistic and philosophical possibilities. With his existential emphasis, the Jew became the everyman; though the Jewish immigrant now rarely appears as a novelistic protagonist, a great nostalgia for his brand of schmerz persists.
“The Free World,” David Bezmozgis’ novelistic debut, can appear a tempting candidate to take up the kippah. Reviewers of Bezmozgis’ 2004 collection “Natasha and Other Stories” have praised him as a literary inheritor of Malamud, Roth, Bellow, and Babel; last year he snagged a spot on The New Yorker’s “20 Under 40” list of the best young fiction writers. In cadence, Bezmozgis’ style is strikingly similar to that of Malamud. Superficially, his new novel, which follows a family of Soviet Jews in 1978 who have emigrated from Riga to Rome and now await exit visas to the U.S.A. or Canada, treats similar themes. But though “The Free World” is a novel about Jews, it is not at all a “Jewish novel.” Bezmozgis’ own project places him in the vein of self-proclaimed ‘social realists’ like Jonathan Franzen, concerned with transparency of meaning, precision of language, and a mapping out of the social world.
Bezmozgis, born in Latvia before immigrating to Toronto as a child, has a wry literary voice—the prose equivalent of the raised eyebrow—well attuned to the more absurd aspects of historical events. To Bezmozgis’ émigrés, the disorder of Rome can seem more terrifying than even the harrowing border crossing at Chop. That was at least “cruel and nonsensical in a typical way,” conforming to Soviet logic. Rome, on the other hand, “was dirty. Crime was rampant. To walk near Termini, the central train station, was effectively to surrender your valuables.” Making their life in a strange new city, caught in the troubling space between Zionism and communism, are the younger Krasnansky son Alec and his wife Polina, his older brother Karl and wife Rosa, and Alec and  Karl’s father Samuil and wife Emma. All of them travel with a great deal of emotional baggage, related through flashbacks—from Polina’s abortion and desertion of her husband for Alec, to Samuil’s morally ambiguous past in the Red Army. Of these characters Bezmozgis gives by far the greatest narrative time to Alec, whose main interest and skill seems to be seducing women into closets.
A certain awkwardness of phrasing often distracts from Bezmozgis’ narrative. The first few pages feature flat dialogue, with a trace of accent: “Where are you traveling to?” “Chicago.” “No. Is this true?” “Yes, it is true. I am traveling to Chicago.” “Will this be your first time in Chicago?” “Yes, it will be my first time in Chicago.”  And so forth. Though his prose elsewhere can be ironic, if heavy-handed, here Bezmozgis evinces no irony at all; nor is he aiming for a Beckettian sort of parody. His word choice is similarly problematic. The first sentence of a debut novel is not, perhaps, the fairest of targets, as it tends to be the sentence at greatest peril of overworking. But here is how Bezmozgis begins: “Alec Krasnansky stood on the platform of Vienna’s Western Terminal while, all around him, the representatives of Soviet Jewry—from Tallinn to Tashkent—roiled, snarled, and elbowed to deposit their belongings onto the waiting train. His own family roiled among them.” “Roiled,” here, is a grammatically odd choice—do people roil?—and with repetition the flaw is compounded.
The numerous rhetorical glitches, however, point to a more serious philosophical issue. In its ambitious attempt to capture all the chaos of three generations of Jews in an alien city—all the “roiling”—Bezmozgis fails to sufficiently flesh out his individual characters. Where this becomes most obvious is with the character of Samuil, whose pro-Stalinist worldview feels like little more than a caricature. Samuil is an outdated relic of the old guard, and his death (after he stubbornly chooses to walk home in the heat of Rome when his tram stalls) forces an analogy to the death of communism. Bezmozgis’ rather obvious point is that Samuil’s descendants, in contrast, inhabit the “free world”—living now in a land where personal relationships reign instead of ideology.
Bezmozgis has clearly done his research (his acknowledgements note both interviews of Soviet emigrants and close study of documents in the New York Public Library). And a great deal of his motivation likely lies in recovering his own past—his native Canada is currently home to the fourth-largest Jewish population in the world, thousands of whom arrived as part of the 1970s wave of Soviet immigrants. But because of this desire to make an argument, the voices of his characters are nearly interchangeable, either dissolving into adjectives—the “gaunt, intellectual-looking woman”—or becoming puppets for plot or ideology.
In addition to writing, Bezmozgis has directed films, including the 2009 Sundance entry “Victoria Day”; he received his Master of Fine Arts from the University of Southern California’s School of Cinema. Indeed, it is fair to say that his book reads as a series of scripted scenes—events meant to be seen, aiming for the sharp effect of the visual rather than psychological or linguistic experimentation. The novel is written in chapters focused on alternating characters, and each chapter ends trimly, with an (inconsistently successful) attempt at a flourish. Bezmozgis does occasionally alight on a charming detail: watching his grandchildren play on the beach at Ladispoli, for instance, Samuil marvels at how perfectly they can adapt to any environment, and remembers the simplicities of his own childhood, when his mother would rub sour cream on his sunburnt back. It is a luminous image. But rather than allowing it to linger, Bezmozgis merely rushes on to the next event.
How hollow this feels when held up against the Jewish novel of the 1950s, almost obsessively concerned with pinning down individual characters and small details. There, collapsed into one life or object, the shifting terrains of memory became convincing fragments of truth—hence the magnificent, koan-like power in Malamud’s “The Fixer” of the “half a yellow sugar lump” dug out of a caftan pocket, or the last glass of tea before boarding a carriage in the icy cold. Indeed, a peculiar, potent paradox exists at the root of the Jewish plight—one of which Malamud and other writers were painfully aware, and which Bezmozgis leaves completely unexplored. Russian Jews left their homeland in large part because they believed in something transcending the materialistic, technology-driven Soviet culture. To reconstruct their past solely in the materialistic terms of bare facts would thus be more than inadequate—it would be unethical. This is why so many Jewish writers, in grappling with their past, have approached the subject indirectly, drawing on allegory or paying serious attention to detail rather than attempting straightforward explanation. Bezmozgis takes on the theme of Jewishness explicitly, and yet the degree to which it is absent in the novel, as either subject matter or approach, is striking. At one point, Alec explains his attraction to Polina: “There were very few women who possessed perpetual mystery—who revealed less than they knew and remained, at some level, mysterious even to themselves.” “The Free World” offers plenty of facts, but its superficial clarity only pushes Bezmozgis—and the reader—further from real understanding.

Boy meets girl. She’s beautiful, they hit it off, and he takes her home. But they’re both trying to ‘change,’ and a one-night stand would violate their new resolutions of responsibility. The solution? A three-night stand, complete with playing house in a shared apartment while jointly taking care of the tiny black boy who just happens to live there. Filled with such eccentric character vignettes, "Happythankyoumoreplease"—directed, written, and starring Josh Radnor of "How I Met Your Mother" fame—uses borderline-absurd storylines to create a diorama of the lives of several 20-somethings in New York City. While this setting and demographic have undoubtedly had their fair share of representation in popular cinema and television, Radnor’s debut dramedy has undeniable heart and makes for a refreshingly fine film.
Each of the narrative threads of "Happythankyoumoreplease" center around coincidence and companionship. When the film’s main character, Sam (Radnor) fortuitously finds the young Rasheen (Michael Algieri)—who has been separated from his family—on a subway, he takes the African-American boy into his home, sparking the movie’s most poignant relationship. In one evocative scene, Rasheen is shown drawing with two pens and a highlighter while Sam types away at his novel with frustration. Time accelerates and the characters continue with their respective tasks on fast-forward. Then, as light begins to stream into the room, the scene slows back to real-time and the audience sees that Rasheen has sketched a rough approximation of himself and his surrogate guardian Sam.
The film itself operates in a similar fashion, frantically scribbling out the lives of its extensive cast of characters, using powerful emotional moments to color its canvas. In this breakneck narrative, audiences follow not only Sam and Rasheen, but also Sam’s best friend, Annie (Malin Akerman), who is bald from an autoimmune disease; Annie’s distant admirer, "Sam #2" (Tony Hale of "Arrested Development"); a young couple (Zoe Kazan and Bram Barouh) trying to decide whether New York is the right place for them to settle down; and Mississippi (Kate Mara), the girl that Sam cannot decide whether or not to pursue.
Juggling such an ensemble successfully demands that every minute of screen-time and each line of dialogue be taut and effective. Accordingly, in Radnor’s script, each moment has a function, conveying exactly the message needed to establish connections between characters, as in the scene with Rasheen’s drawing. The tight direction of the screenplay dovetails with the film’s broader moral that the universe cares for individuals and will ultimately provide them with their heart’s true desire. However, this artificially-imposed narrative superstructure unavoidably detracts from the natural flow of the characters’ actions. Because of this, "Happythankyoumoreplease" feels more like a cleverly scripted short story than a genuine slice of life, with realism sacrificed for the sake of a meaningful message.
One of the film’s greatest strengths is its artistry, from score to cinematography. The soundtrack—mostly soft vocals and ambient music—is effective in setting the mood without being overbearing. Lighting throughout is superb—the streets of New York are harsh in their brilliance, Sam’s apartment is by contrast warm and soft, Mississippi’s cabaret is golden and dark, and Annie’s bar is dingy and derelict. In this fashion, each character’s environment accurately reflects his or her emotional circumstances, with exteriors even changing over the course of the film to match altered internal states. While one may criticize the overdetermined nature of the movie’s plot and scenery, one cannot deny that these choices skillfully combine to communicate the film’s life lesson.
That moral is simple: approach the universe with optimism, self-respect, and good intentions, and it will provide for your happiness. Because the film carefully conspires to convey this notion with every narrative development, when one character exultantly declares that she has "found the meaning of life"—to try to be happy and thankful, and let the rest take its course—the moment comes across as compelling rather than cliché. The simple realization of each of the film’s flawed characters that it’s okay to ask for "more, please"—whether from a romantic, friendly, familial, or spiritual relationship—instead of cynically muddling along alone rings strong and true. In crafting such a life-affirming morality play for meandering moderns, Radnor thus reveals himself as a serious cinematic talent, able to bring meaning to audiences and not just laughs.

Cleansed
April 22-24, 28-30, 8:00 p.m.
Loeb Drama Center­—Mainstage
Directed by Matthew C. Stone ’11
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 & Katie R. McNicol ’12
Sarah Kane’s “Cleansed” is a challenging production for all who partake in it. For the audience, the brutal violence and ubiquitous nudity can be disturbing. For the actors, representing characters beaten to the brink of death can be draining. For the director and the designers, realizing impossibly involved stage directions can be discouraging. Despite these obstacles, an undergraduate cast directed by Matthew C. Stone ’11 has begun work on a production of “Cleansed” that promises to be a jarring yet ultimately hopeful experience.
The play takes place in a ‘university,’ which is nothing but a prison camp enclosed by a chain-link fence and dominated by the sociopathic Tinker (Stewart N. Kramer ’12), a vicious ‘doctor’ who degrades his subjects to living bruises. Amongst the stark brutality, a tender and hopeful core of humanity pulsates softly. Coursing through scenes of horrific violence are several interlocking stories of the victimized characters’ desperate searches for love. “The play can be really brutal,” says Stone, “but at the end of the day it is really life-affirming more than anything else.”
Interpreting the setting broadly, Stone and set designer Snoweria Zhang ’12 have set this production in a grimy, claustrophobic, rat-infested sewer. In the interest of crafting an intensely visceral experience, the set will include a 10-inch pool of water, a bank of real mud, chain link fences surrounding both stage and audience, and a plexiglass wall protecting and hopelessly distancing the audience from the terrifying action onstage. In order to create an intimacy normally absent from the cavernous Loeb Mainstage, the seating will be cut by nearly two thirds and will encroach upon the stage. “The Mainstage is this huge, empty void,” says Zhang. “We wanted something small and intimate.”
The play guarantees to provoke and perturb everyone involved, but it rewards perseverance. Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13, who plays Grace—a woman who comes to Tinker’s institution in search of her brother— emphasizes that the goal of the production is not to shock. “We’re trying to stage this play in a way that is as tactful and thoughtful as possible. None of it is meant to be gratuitous,” she says. Stone’s production may put its actors and audiences through profound trauma, but he hopes they will emerge with a new understanding of the value of life and love.

James Gunn’s "Super" is a movie about an ordinary loser, Frank (Rainn Wilson), who turns himself into a superhero called the Crimson Bolt. Sound familiar? It’s a recognizable premise to those who have seen "Kick-Ass," "The Green Hornet" or Hollywood’s countless other do-it-yourself superhero films. But the comparisons end there, because while films like "Kick Ass" are redeemed by their zany fun, "Super" is just plain dark. Though its offbeat humor is as polished as one would expect from its cast, which boasts Ellen Page, Kevin Bacon and Liv Tyler, it is not enough to make up for the film’s unlikeable protagonist and its inability to balance gravity and comedy.
The name of the movie is "Super," not "Superhero," and for good reason: the Crimson Bolt is not a hero. His actions are often more demented than noble. In one particularly gruesome scene, Frank is waiting in line for a movie when he is cut by a husband and wife who ignore his repeated protestations. He runs to his car, changes into his Crimson Bolt costume, and then, quite matter-of-factly, takes out his monkey wrench and bashes the head of the husband until blood gushes from him—and then hits the wife for good measure.
The problem is that this sort of gratuitous violence—as well as the pride the ‘heroes’ take in it—provokes a visceral negative reaction in viewers that even humor and later character development cannot overcome. This persistent failing in characterization repels all attempts to empathize with or appreciate the film’s hero, and thus greatly undermines audience investment in the movie and its proceedings.
None of this is to say that "Super" isn’t funny—the film certainly has its amusing moments. Kevin Bacon is delightfully mercurial as the sleazy drug dealer who steals Frank’s wife, one moment complimenting Frank’s cooking at breakfast and the next moment making off with his spouse, Sarah (Liv Tyler). As Libby—the enthusiastic comic-book store worker who becomes the Crimson Bolt’s sidekick, Boltie—Ellen Page is in scene-stealing form, and manages to accomplish something Wilson never does by making her psychopathic character sympathetic. That Libby/Boltie is both relatable and likeable is a credit to Page’s acting, given that she contributes several of the film’s most shocking scenes—in one case laughing hysterically at a kid after she nearly kills him for having possibly keyed her friend’s car.
Like Page’s Libby, Frank is clearly meant to be not only a comic hero, but also a lovable loser. Several more serious scenes—Frank weeping after his wife leaves, flashbacks to his and Sarah’s first meeting—make halfhearted attempts to deepen his character. But these are insufficient to change the audience’s perception of him. Gunn—who also wrote the script—seems to want to present both a serious commentary on one man’s suffering as well as a satirical superhero movie but cannot quite pull off the necessary balancing act. Even when the Crimson Bolt redeems himself in the eyes of the local populace, we cannot come to terms with him. Hearing others call Frank a hero has no effect because we have seen his brutality firsthand.
For all its flaws, or perhaps because of them, "Super" ultimately conveys an important lesson. The real takeaway from the film—which it likely did not intend—is that taking the law into one’s own hands is crazy, dangerous, and just plain stupid. Moreover, the kind of deranged personality who would actually take such vigilante action is not the sort of individual we would want making judgments about who is good and who is evil. Intentionally or not, "Super" is not a movie about a hero; it is rather about the impossibility of one. The movie illustrates what a superhero would really be like in the modern world, and the harm to society that would result from someone stepping into such a role.
"Maybe you thought there was something wrong with me," Frank wonders at the end of the film. To which we can only reply: yes. And it’s a flaw disturbing enough to transform a movie filled to the brim with comic potential into a grossly unsympathetic affair, albeit one with an unwittingly redeeming message.

“Today, explore other versions of yourselves,” encourages Kriti Lodha ’12, the director of David Lindsay-Abaire’s “Rabbit Hole,” in the playbill. “Today, don’t think. Just feel.” Lodha and producer Lexis B. Ross ’13 bring that statement of purpose to emotional life in the Loeb Experimental Theater. “Rabbit Hole,” which runs until April 9, powerfully chronicles the long road to closure and acceptance after the death of a loved one and portrays penetrating feelings of grief.
The play follows the journey of Becca (Margaret C. Kerr ’13) and Howie (Daniel Gale Rosen) Corbett through the aftermath of the death of their only son, Danny, who was hit by a car. Becca  and Howie cope with the loss of their son in very different ways. While Becca draws away from loved ones, deflects offers of support from friends and family with biting sarcasm, and looks to escape from everything even remotely related to Danny, Howie puts all of his effort into hiding his emotions and pretending to move on. Both Becca and Howie try to reach the point where their grief, as Becca’s mother, Nat (Georgina B. Parfitt ’13) says, “turns into something you can crawl out from under and carry around. Like a brick in your pocket.”
In the end, Becca finds some comfort in the words from an unexpected character: Jason (Galt E. MacDermot ’14), the 17-year-old high school student who inadvertently hit Danny with his car. Becca decides that there are “different versions of us living different lives.” You merely need to travel through a rabbit hole, a figment of Jason’s science-fiction story, to a parallel universe to find that “there are other versions where things go our way.”
The pain and suffering of the Corbett family is quite literally strewn all over the floor—the set contains small reminders of the presence of a child, including a box of children’s toys in the foreground and a storybook on the coffee table. Just as remnants of Danny’s memory reside in every cavern of Becca and Howie’s minds, remnants of his existence remain in the Corbett residence. The subtle hints of an absent child bring this immeasurable grief to life.
In this milieu, Rosen and Kerr play off each other brilliantly. Their fights seem too real, to the point where the atmosphere is uncomfortable in just the right way. The two transform a quaint living room into a battle scene between a couple whose relationship is irretrievably damaged. Kerr’s tone drips with bitterness and intense anguish. Rosen expresses Howie’s dichotomy between putting on a strong face and unleashing his grief through bouts of anger and stubbornness.
The two main supporting characters offer different takes on grief that contrast with and accentuate Kerr’s. Parfitt, whether she is ranting about the bad luck of the Kennedy family or offering a light-hearted anecdote to cheer up Becca, charmingly lightens the dismal mood of the play and demonstrates a lighter approach to mourning. Parfitt is the epitome of a supportive and eccentric mother, the perfect complement to uptight Becca. Rachael Epstein, who plays Becca’s younger, slightly misguided sister Izzy, lights up the stage with her blunt, carefree vibrancy. Izzy and her sister could not be more different; Epstein’s kineticism highlights Becca’s stagnant grief.
The dark tone of the play is, for the most part, wonderfully echoed in the technical elements of the production. The emotionally charged soundtrack to accompany scene changes ensures that the atmosphere of tension and emotional stress carries through from scene to scene. In contrast, the somewhat liberal use of light-dimming to convey a foreboding tone seemed forced at times. The dimming of the lights during emotional climaxes obscured the power of the moment that the actors created on their own.
Despite these small flaws, brilliant acting and cast chemistry raise “Rabbit Hole” to deeply affecting heights; the production manages to do justice to an emotionally challenging piece.

Since its popularization in the late renaissance, the Faust story has become one of the central tales in all of western civilization. It has been told and retold hundreds of times, from Goethe’s famous closet drama to the Broadway musical “Damn Yankees.” Its appeal may lie in its universality: in essence, it explores what it means to be human. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s new production of Christopher Marlowe’s “Doctor Faustus”—here renamed “Faustus” and playing at the Loeb Mainstage from April 1-3, and again from April 7-9—combines faithfulness to Marlowe’s original text with modern staging and directing techniques. In her liner notes director Ilinca Radulian ’11 says that she feels that “Faustus” is ultimately a play about human longing. Through a beautifully visual piece of theatre that incorporates dance and performance art into the show, Radulian expresses the longing and loneliness that is at the heart of the human experience and the desperate action one man will take to stave off this inevitability.
Doctor Faustus (Nasir W. Husain ’12) is a brilliant scholar who makes a pact with the devil, which in this production is unconventionally played as a three-part entity (Darcy C. Donelan ’14, Vanessa B. Koo ’12, and Kelly E. Perron ’11). The Devil, in return for Faustus’ soul, gives the doctor the demon Mephistopheles (Isabel Q. Carey ’12) as a servant for twenty-one years. As the play progresses and Faustus understands the implications of the deal he struck, he begins to see what a terrible mistake he has made.
Husain is an especially compelling Faustus, putting a realistic spin on the doctor by playing him as a very troubled man who makes a decision out of desperation. For example, he uses the character’s complicated relationship with the demon Mephistopheles—who in this production has taken on the guise of Faustus’ lost love—as a way of humanizing the doctor. In the show they grapple with the artificiality of their relationship but they also have some very tender moments together. Husain turns someone who has committed Christianity’s ultimate sin into a very sympathetic person.
However, the real star of the show is the director Radulian. Her work is inspired, turning a classic Elizabethan drama into a modern piece that combines theatre and performance art. Paint is used extensively throughout the whole show for a whole host of symbolic reasons. This is most effective during the scene where Faustus sells his soul to the devil. He is drenched with a bucket of paint and for the rest of the show is literally “tainted” by the sin he committed.
Radulian makes great use of the physicality of her actors to highlight several key symbolic moments in the play. For example, when Faustus makes his pact with the devil, his movements are controlled totally by the devils. He has become a puppet in the devils machinations. In one of the most affecting scenes of the play the three devils wear upside-down Venetian masks and then scuttle belly-up. Their bodies are backwards, but their masks are not, so they look almost like satanic spiders crawling towards the audience. As Faustus discovered to his horror, not everything is as it seems and sometimes something that looks enticing can turn out to be monstrous.
The technical direction is just as creative. Although the stage is entirely open, the way the play is lit creates a sense of claustrophobia, as if we were trapped inside Faustus’ head. The show also uses a spotlight placed at the back of the stage  which shines directly at the audience. When on, this near-blinding light allows for some very imaginative use of silhouettes and shadows that made the devils appear massive compared the doctor.
The play’s one major flaw was sound. The Loeb Mainstage is a cavernous space, especially when it is completely open, and the actor’s voices can become inaudible if not handled properly. Sometimes the actors find themselves speaking their lines while either facing down or away from the audience. As a result it is very hard to hear some of the lines, especially at the beginning. In such a conceptual production, the audience will get lost very easily if they can’t hear the actors, and it seems like this variable was not properly accounted for.
“Faustus” is a real triumph, and a showcase of Radulian’s directorial talents. The original play was updated in such a way that the psychological aspects of Doctor Faustus are explored and the more physical aspects of modern theatre are utilized. HRDC’s “Faustus” is a groundbreaking work the likes of which are not seen at Harvard very often.

What do The Grateful Dead and brain tumors have in common? With the release of "The Music Never Stopped," audiences can witness an astonishing real-life connection in the story of Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci), an aging hippie who must deal with the grim realities of amnesia while coming to terms with his estranged father. For Gabe, it is only through listening to the music of his youth—from the Beatles to The Grateful Dead—that he can regain coherence, leave behind his currently comatose self, and possibly be reconciled with the father he barely knows. Based on an essay by famed neurologist Oliver Sacks about one of his patients, "The Music Never Stopped" is both a retelling of a medical miracle and a less inspiring display of sentimental schlock. Together, these two elements combine to form a somewhat disjointed portrayal of a generation and a family—one that succeeds as a macrocosm of ’60s culture but is ultimately too trite to serve as a chronicle of Henry Sawyer’s (J.K. Simmons) reconnection with his long-lost son.
We are first introduced to Gabe in 1987 as a heavily-bearded and socially inept man whose speech consists solely of nonsensical platitudes. As a result of his illness, Gabe has lost his ability to form new memories, and, most importantly, his ability to communicate effectively with those around him. When Gabe’s mother (Cara Seymour) asks him if he would like a sip of coke, he responds by saying, "it’s the real thing"—a line taken directly from a popular ’80s commercial.
Pucci’s performance is so effective that it’s difficult to imagine Gabe as anything other than a shell of his former self. Luckily for audiences, they need not do so, because the film is constantly jumping between eras, one moment showing its protagonist in a recovery facility, the next as a youth in the back of a VW bus, complete with Jim Morrison-esque locks. It is through these flashbacks that the movie’s broader storyline manifests itself. Because Gabe is essentially frozen in this earlier period of time, his conservative father Henry—whom Gabe fled to seek the real rock ‘n’ roll life in the West Village—must learn to connect with him through the music that his son loved as a teenager. Audiences are thus treated to the amusing sight of a staunch Buddy Holly fan becoming a Dead Head.
"The Music Never Stopped" abounds with other humorous asides which break up the monotony that inevitably attends its chronicle of a life’s downward spiral. In one such moment, Gabe attempts to explain the meaning of The Grateful Dead’s "Truckin’" to his father, launching into an extended, idealistic vision of ‘freedom’ allegedly encapsulated in the song. Confronted with skepticism, he adds: "That’s what that means when you’re stoned." All in all, screenwriters Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks have done a superb job transforming Sacks’ essay into a living, breathing human drama.
Early on in the film, Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond), the therapist who treats Gabe, tells his family that "humans are incredibly complex beings … let’s be patient." Audiences should keep this in mind, as "The Music Never Stopped" starts off very slowly and only comes into its own with the infusion of music—just as Gabe only begins to regain his vigor with tonal reminders from his past. One of the film’s best traits is its frequent use of ’60s music; Jerry Garcia, Bob Dylan, and Buffalo Springfield are key characters in Gabe’s story and add some needed spice to an otherwise predictable and sentimental plot.
That said, "The Music Never Stopped" still suffers from the glacial pace and clichéd nature of its meandering storyline. The film constantly sidesteps in slow motion, moving back and forth through time while its plot barely crawls along. And remarkable as Gabe’s story is, the film’s account of a man’s progress toward regaining his health and the respect of his father feels too much like a mash-up of two of mainstream cinema’s most overused tropes: the uplifting tale of conquering illness and the struggle to overcome generational differences.
At its best, "The Music Never Stopped" spans decades and musical eras, calling into question how music touches us and changes the course of a life. Although the storyline itself doesn’t quite make for compelling cinema, it does make for a meaningful journey through the mind that demonstrates the power of music to conjure up images of times long past.

Roughly 30 years ago, The Crimson ran a review on these very pages excoriating an experimental student production of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s “The Bedbug.” The staging wedded the manic spirit of circus with prosaic props drawn from a supermarket—frenzied actors rode around in shopping carts wearing mops on their heads. The show’s exaggerated  aesthetic was the brainchild of none other than Peter M. Sellars ’80, now a world-renowned (and still eccentric) director of theater and opera.
In his undergraduate years, however, Sellars was often the scapegoat of vitriolic Crimson reviews. The critique of “The Bedbug” was particularly derisive: “Assaulted by Sellars’ sound and fury, we feel confused, trapped, and embarrassed,” wrote Katherine P. States ’79-’80. “Why does Peter Sellars have so much contempt for his audience that he goes so far out of his way to make things inaccessible?” To this day, Sellars is questioned for his abstruse productions, such as his controversial staging of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s  opera “Don Giovanni” as a blaxploitation film. Yet if clarity has never been a hallmark of his work, that’s because it’s never been the goal: “My productions are a bit thorny, but I grew up thinking that’s what art is all about,” says Sellars in an interview with Arthur Barton. “Art exists to be chewy.”
This epigram seems innocuous enough, but Sellars’ word choice belies a profoundly important idea: theater is something we should sink our teeth into—something that should actively provoke debates among audiences. Sellars’ idea is certainly a lofty conception of theater’s social function. Oddly enough, the idea of a controversial or provocative production—“chewy” art, in Sellars’ words—is often considered anathema in our current theatrical climate.
To be clear, there are few definitive methods of directing, if any. While the practice of theater dates back more than two millennia, the concept of ‘directing’ as we know it today originated just over 100 years ago. As a result, directors often lack a nuanced vocabulary to discuss the particulars of their craft. But if one directorial imperative has taken hold in the past century, it is to control the audience. Conventional wisdom dictates that a stage director should guide the spectator’s eye and attempt to evoke a particular emotional response. Director Arthur Hopkins crystallized this objective in his 1918 essay “Capturing the Audience”: “The theater is always seeking unanimous reaction.”
This unanimity is what Sellars refers to as the “monolithic response,” and it is exactly what he seeks to surmount with his recondite theatrical aesthetics. “We produce theater that’s based on not letting anyone disagree. The whole objective is to make everyone in the entire audience laugh or cry at the same moment,” he tells Barton. “The notion of a monolithic response is basically undemocratic.” To Sellars, the monolithic response is not just an artistic gaffe—it is fundamentally opposed to the values of open, constructive discourse. He’s a director who believes theater has the power to provoke real thought—and, in turn, advance our entire society.
Furthermore, arguments in favor of the monolithic response often ascribe a reductive simplicity to the theatrical experience. In an interview with Newsweek, film director James Cameron asserts that a unified audience reaction is at the core of the cinematic experience: “It’s the psychology of sitting in a dark room with a bunch of people and reacting to something, and feeling like your reaction is the same as the rest of the group, a way of proof-checking your emotions are normal,” he says. “If you’re the one guy laughing out of 400 people, you’re obviously out of step.”
Cameron’s comments presume a universal pattern of “normal” sentiments—a dubious assumption given the complexity of human emotions. Beyond that, it’s somewhat depressing to imagine that the only function of theater and cinema is “proof-checking” that our emotions are consistent with others’. Cameron’s idea of audience response response seems almost oppressive, mandating that the entire audience react in a uniform manner lest someone fall “out of step.”
The status of the monolithic response is, in my mind, one of the most pressing issues facing the theater today—it warrants the attention of directors, producers, designers, actors, and audience members alike. Directors like Sellars posit that theater can become a locus for serious national discourse, but only by abandoning the monolithic response. To truly address this issue, we need to ask ourselves what we value about theater, how our art should engage with society, and what concrete steps we could take to precipitate such a radical paradigm shift in theater. Of course, these questions are far from answers at the time being—but, as Sellars would say, they’re definitely worth chewing on.

The word of our generation is ‘sustainable.’ Like ‘Choice’ and ‘Life,’ the word both describes an ideology and stands as a symbol for that ideology. ‘Sustainable’ is the rallying word for modern environmental protection: it’s stamped on menus at seafood restaurants and appears in the names of environmental committees.
Climate change is the greatest challenge facing our generation, and it is perhaps the greatest challenge that humanity has ever had to face. In this week’s column I want to take a closer look at ‘sustainable,’ the word that is currently at the center of our efforts to save Earth. Words, even didactic political ones, profoundly shape our thinking and our argumentation, and so in order to understand contemporary environmentalism we need to understand why ‘sustainable’ has become its rallying call.
Why ‘sustainable?’ A moment’s thought illuminates a compelling and clear intuition: there are not enough resources. The pollution is overwhelming ecosystems. Our current mode of consumption and production is, as it were, unsustainable. To solve the problem, we ostensibly need only to move in the opposite direction, making unsustainable practices sustainable. But common to both states is a particular attitude toward nature: that nature is a machine, a set of mechanical processes that we can exploit to our own ends. The problem that modern environmentalism addresses is the impending breakdown of that machine. And environmentalists are doing everything they can to scare us about that breakdown, so that we change our ways.
But we didn’t always see nature as so lifeless. In the Romantic era many artists saw nature as the one equal of the human mind. This was not out of ignorance of nature’s workings—it was a time of extraordinary scientific progress—but rather out of the attitude they bore toward nature. William Wordsworth, in a moving moment in “Tintern Abbey,” is able to hear in nature “The still, sad music of humanity.”
The effect of this switch in our conception of nature as soul-like to nature as mechanical is that our relationship to nature ceases to be a moral one. Seeing ‘humanity’ in the heart of nature means that we have to treat it differently. In a basic Kantian sense, seeing this ‘humanity’ compels us always to treat nature as an end, and never merely as a means.
In many ways, we are in need of a second Romantic era. We need to regain that moral relationship to nature that the Romantics fostered and operated under. If we want to salvage what is left of our world—and if we believe that the world is worth saving—then we need to change the way we see ourselves with respect to it. The adjective “sustainable” hopefully will move us in the right direction, but ultimately it won’t be enough. It’s the worldview of the earth as machine, mere means to our ends, the worldview that “sustainable” exists in and propagates, that is the real threat. The adjective “sustainable” hopefully will have immediate positive effects on the environment. Yet people don’t act based on numbers or senses of efficiency. They act because they are morally compelled to act. Climate change will not be solved by a mere movement towards sustainability. It can only be solved when we each feel the responsibility to act in a certain way toward the environment. It’s not enough merely to know how to act: we have to feel that necessity.
I look to you, then, poets and artists. “Poets,” Percy Bysshe Shelley concludes in his thrilling “Defense of Poetry,” “are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” Wallace Stevens writes to poets in “Prelude to Objects”: “We are conceived in your conceits.” Creators of art dictate the laws of our existence, because art, profoundly, sets the conditions through which we engage with the world. We are now stuck in an amoral stance towards our planet, one that the goal of being “sustainable” is only, slowly, aggravating. It is your task, artists, to quicken our ears again to that “still sad music of humanity.”

Robbie Robertson’s newest release may be titled “How To Become Clairvoyant,” but the fabled guitarist spends far more time looking back on his accomplished career than into the future. Robertson, former songwriter and guitarist for The Band as well as sideman to Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Eric Clapton, among others, has a large share of experience about which he can reminisce. Robertson’s first release in 13 years is a lilting retrospective that recalls both the good and the bad of his long career, and, while the album breaks no new ground, it easily displays his prowess as a songwriter.
After years of playing alongside others, “How To Become Clairvoyant” puts Robertson firmly in the spotlight with a strong ensemble that includes Clapton, Steve Winwood, and Tom Morello. Although he rarely sang with The Band, Robertson makes good use of his distinctive, sandpapery voice on “Clairvoyant.” His vocal style ranges from quiet somberness to rusty growling, his slight rasp contrasting nicely with the smoother guitars and pianos that make up the majority of the album’s dense instrumentation.
Robertson may not be known for his voice, but he has always been acclaimed as a songwriter. Responsible for many of The Band’s most popular songs, including “The Weight” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” Robertson has a knack for creating memorable melodies to accompany lyrics steeped with historical or religious significance. The first three songs on “Clairvoyant” are an excellent example of Robertson’s intimate understanding of songcraft. “Straight Down The Line” is an infectious blues jaunt; “When the Night Was Young” is a tender retrospective; “He Don’t Live Here No More” is a propulsive rocker. All of the album’s melodies have a tempered, nostalgic quality that lends it thematic cohesiveness while recalling The Band’s finesse.
Robertson examines his past in great detail, and he provides both specific vignettes and general reflections throughout the album. “When the Night Was Young” tells of his youthful idealism at the start of his career—“We could change the world / Stop the war”—and, in many ways, the album is a portrait of the decline of this idealism—a portrait which culminates on “This is Where I Get Off.” The song chronicles the 1976 breakup of The Band: “Walking out on the boys / Was never the plan / We drifted off course / Couldn’t strike up the band.” However, Robertson doesn’t sound regretful about his actions, just comfortably weary and content with his journey.
Despite the stirring vestiges of his old creativity, Robertson’s occasional reliance on lyrical and musical clichés detracts from the strength of his songwriting. “Right Mistakes” is practically a list of clichés—“One man’s trash is another man’s treasure / And one man’s pain is another man’s pleasure”—and the titular song finds Robertson making misguided attempts to replicate Dylan-esque storytelling—“As it turns out Miss Muffet wasn’t afraid of spiders at all / She slipped across the dance floor at the masquerade ball.” Musically, Robertson overuses electric guitar duels—he seems to insert them at every opportunity. The guitar playing on the whole is surprisingly bland and tentative, as evidenced by the cautious and formulaic solo on “He Don’t Live Here No More.”
The album also lacks the grittiness and texture that propelled not only The Band but also Dylan’s controversial 1966 tour, of which Robertson was part. His electric guitar work with Dylan was purposefully antagonizing and harsh. The sound marked a drastic shift for Dylan and inspired some of his most celebrated work, but the revolutionary dissonance of Robertson’s past is replaced by the restraint of this album. The guitar riff and melody on “Fear of Falling” are reminiscent of another Robertson-penned classic, “Chest Fever.” Where “Chest Fever” possesses a distinct soulfulness, though, “Fear of Falling” is gentle to the point of tepidity. The end of the album drags due to an excess of monotonous ballads and instrumentals that fall prey to these same weaknesses.
Despite its faults, however, “How To Become Clairvoyant” is overall an enjoyable album that offers us a glimpse at a wistful patriarch near the end of his career. While other stars respond badly to aging, Robertson proudly displays his age and experience. He’s had a full career, and he doesn’t sound at all regretful when he sings, “This is where I get off / This is where I move on.”

There comes a time when every punk, rudeboy, emo, mod, metal-head, and hipster must ask themselves how much longer they can keep getting away with it. Beyond the physical indignities of moshing, crowd-surfing, and staying up late as a middle aged man lies the social stigma of still dressing like a teenager at 41. Presumably when James Murphy—frontman and mastermind of LCD Soundsystem—bent down one day to tie the shoe-laces on his Converse and automatically thought, “What else can I do while I’m down here?” he realized his time had come.
Murphy’s career has always been marked by intelligence and self-awareness, and so his decision to end on a high note comes as no surprise. After a decade-long run comprised of three critically acclaimed and bestselling LPs, the band has scheduled a week of break-up concerts at Terminal 5 in New York, culminating in a concert on April 2 at Madison Square Garden. However, the sustained quality control of the band’s output is something of a surprise—of the groups credited at the beginning of the decade with resuscitating New York’s then-ailing rock scene, LCD Soundsystem would have been an unlikely candidate for graceful aging.
Murphy’s best songs have always been about the relationship between his music and his advancing age. The band’s first big hit, “Losing My Edge,” was a washed-up hipster’s lament about losing his relevance to a younger generation. Even as he became successful, Murphy was anticipating his eventual decline. LCD’s back catalogue now resembles a giant, self-fulfilling prophecy that predicted the band’s obsolescence even when they began to make it big. Ironically, the band has never been as popular as they are now, and this popularity is best evidenced by the fervent faces of the young, skinny-tie wearing hipsters and the middle-aged, skinny-tie wearing hipsters that I joined last Wednesday night.
The band fed off a tidal wave of good feeling for a spectacular three-and-a-half hours of music drawn from their entire catalogue, even remaining on stage at the end to wave and blow kisses to the audience as if the band members couldn’t bear to confront the outside world. Genuine emotion was etched on Murphy’s features, in particular during the highlight of the night, a stunning rendition of “All My Friends,” arguably the band’s biggest hit. Propelled by a single piano riff for eight minutes, the song gained an overwhelming pathos and momentum as Murphy sung about the struggle between youthful hedonism and the aging process.
LCD Soundsystem’s live concerts reveal the exact nature of their influences with far more precision than their recordings. They’ve never been shy about citing their favorite groups—the last two minutes of “Losing My Edge” is simply a list of Murphy’s favorite records—but in concert the post-punk aesthetic becomes more prominent. Their debt to the Talking Heads and New Order is well-documented, but onstage the band often recalled the jagged rhythms of Joy Division, Public Image Ltd., and The Fall, while several songs such as “Movement” and “Yeah” exploded gloriously into feedback and white noise reminiscent of the best, old shoegaze acts.
Around the middle of the set, the concert seemed slightly self-indulgent as the band—joined by a complete jazz band and backing chorus—played a gigantic 45 minute nonstop medley of “45:33” and “Sound Of Silver,” but the crowd didn’t mind in the slightest, carrying their uncontainable energy from opener “Dance Yrself Clean” to closer “New York, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down.” There was a sense of the epic—of the once-in-a-lifetime—permeating the whole night.
Murphy couldn’t however, do anything about the bittersweet tinge pervading the humid concert-hall air. He never directly alluded to the fact that the concert marked the end of the band; instead he let his music do the talking. There was defiance—on “All My Friends” he sings “I wouldn’t trade one stupid decision / For another five years of life”—but also acceptance and recognition, as he sung gorgeously on “All I Want:” “Take me home / Take me home.” It is this note of acceptance on which the concert finished. LCD Soundsystem bow out on a glorious high, but knowing all along that rock music is a young man’s game and that, painful as it is, they are young men no longer.

It was with a growing sense of apprehension that I approached a beat-in plastic newspaper dispenser to grab a copy of “The Universal Sigh” last Tuesday. The newspaper, Radiohead’s contribution to the underground literary scene is a potentially embarrassing, orgiastic almanac filled with disjointed poems and Gonzo-inspired illustrations. The paper seems to make an attempt at universal—or at least adolescent—consolation through a neo-Thoreauvian contemplation of nature and spirit. As I scanned the page, I breathed a sigh of relief; it’s actually pretty good.
In their paper, Radiohead cross a smattering of political and social commentary to interesting effect. They present their concerns through a tessellation of vibrant descriptions and intricate word play. They emphasize the spiritual rejuvenation of nature and the soul-crushing effects of society—they cast civilization as a placebo for a diseased human spirit. “The Universal Sigh” continually drives home the urgency of our situation, and consequently stresses the importance of further reading and writing regarding the subject: “Before we turn to ash with a lightness of touch, unwrap this page in me—scatter the ink,” frontman Thom Yorke writes.
Coupled with the release of their most recent album, “The King of Limbs,” “The Universal Sigh” provides a mildly cohesive set of short stories, one-liners, and suggestively oblique statements that, while somewhat overdone, manage to balance melodramatic allegories with poignant commentary. Throughout the paper, Radiohead takes on the role of a Pied Piper-like minstrel attempting to lead its audience away from the seductive evils of modern life towards reason and tranquility. In this manner, Radiohead presents themselves as ‘shamans’ of sorts for the ailing modern human condition, spiritual doctors providing a “tonic for the human spirit” in the form of “songlines” at the “wildest pitch.” While scanning the paper, one can certainly imagine a soundtrack of “songlines” from “Kid A” or “The King of Limbs” humming in the background.
Accompanying Radiohead-generated content is the work of a number of contributing and equally inspired writers whose more formal and literary short vignettes contrast well with Yorke’s abstract, imaginative, and schizophrenic phrases and pseudo-psalms. In their spreads, Robert Macfarlane, Jay Griffiths, and Stanley Donwood each provide their own anecdotes and meditations on forests—a motif throughout the paper—with seemingly autobiographical stories, personal commentary on the experiences, and revelations that are possible in the woods. Whether it is represented through the climbing of trees or the imbibing of Amazonian witch doctor brews, the forest—and nature in general—is portrayed as a panacea for the ails of civilization. As MacFarlane writes, the woods may “defray[ ] the city’s claims on me,” or as Griffiths puts it, “Our minds need what is wild, that unmistakable, unforgettable, elemental thing, wildness the universal songline, sung in green gold which we recognize the moment we hear it.” While the theme grows tired through constant rehashing, these accounts are gripping, and they provide ideas and considerations that, while not wholly original, are placed in a pleasing context of art and alliterative double-takes. We are in need of a revitalizing, the paper tells us. And, presumably, Radiohead may be the source of it.
With “The Universal Sigh,” Radiohead adopts a much more aggressive artistic persona, one that expands their realm of expression from airwaves to print. Yet, in generating all the proverbs in “The Universal Sigh,” Radiohead gives a written guide to the long-established rhythms and themes of their beloved music. While it may be said that this edition is merely a covert form of advertising, “The Universal Sigh” seems to be more than just publicity. Though it certainly serves to promote their very quietly released album, it is capable of standing by itself as a piece of art—or at least a souvenir that needn’t be continually contextualized with the LP.
It seems fitting that Radiohead should provide this piece—their considerations of civilization’s ails—in the form of a newspaper, a dying form of communication itself. Ironically, although they emphasize the need to rescue our forests and embrace the trees, Radiohead has chopped quite a few down for the global publication of their project, but perhaps they construe it as a necessary evil. Still, “The Universal Sigh” is a pleasing half-an-hour’s worth of reading, potentially capable of opening minds, or at least allowing the consideration of larger ideas and worries than biweekly exams or other collegiate woes. Though it is no gospel of our time, “The Universal Sigh” succeeds in construing Radiohead’s traditional message in a more visual, literary form, and in a media usually not associated with the music industry. Scatter the ink.

The Le Corbusier-designed Carpenter Center is the academic hub for undergraduate visual art at Harvard. One of its most prominent architectural features is a ramp leading from Quincy Street to the building’s third floor, and out onto Prescott Street on the other side. Le Corbusier intended the ramp to allow the curious a glimpse into the building’s art studios through the Carpenter Center’s expansive glass windows.
The Carpenter Center therefore sits at an intersection between public experience and private creation, where Harvard’s institutional history has a clear presence even while students create work that may change how the College’s space is utilized. "The building, while maintained to a historical tee, is not stagnant in terms of the activities that go on in it," says Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator Louisa C. Denison ’11.
When students and faculty do incorporate the physical environment into their work, however, their range of creative possibilities is constrained by Harvard’s history and the rules enshrined therein. In the same way that students’ work is thus mediated, the public is removed by the Carpenter Center’s glass windows from the artwork inside. It is not surprising, then, that there is little traditional street art to be found on campus. Harvard’s particular version of ‘street art’ is self-referential in the way it comments on the theoretical status of public art itself. By creating art about the interactions between art and viewer, students are able to make their physical environment the material and conceptual center of their work even though they cannot treat Harvard as they would a blank canvas.
CONSTRUCTIVE CONSTRAINTS
Because Harvard is so seriously committed to preserving the Carpenter Center to the standards set by its architect, the studios of the Carpenter Center do not feature the encrustation of dirt and paint that are characteristic of so many other art buildings. Each year, the concrete floors are scrubbed down and all marks left on the movable walls are removed. The same conservational rigor is applied to the College’s entire physical landscape, most of which is even older than the distinguished Carpenter Center. "Street art is sort of the antithesis of Harvard," says Jerry M. Tullo ’12, who spent time last summer creating spray-painted work on walls in Belgium.
Harvard students are exposed to traditional street art when they walk outside Harvard’s campus. Shepard Fairey, one of the most recognizable street artists working today, has wheatpasted on a wall of the Garage and on Brattle Street. In addition, there is a wall in Central Square on which anybody can legally leave his or her mark. Stickers, posters, and other forms of intervention dot the landscape.
Traditional street art is created through an additive process. Taking the architectural form as a base, the artist adds layers of his or her own work on top. Because spray paint dries fast, various layers of paint cannot be mixed together. Rather, each line is laid down separately and the drawing emerges only through an accumulation of lines. Likewise, wheatpasting, which involves gluing down layers of images printed on paper, builds on top of the wall’s surface. A similar thing can be said for projecting images onto architectural forms.
The texture of the building often shows through, but the historical and material significance of the building is rarely the most important consideration. "It wasn’t really about the wall, it was just about expressing what I wanted to express in my mind," says Tullo. If traditional street artists succeed in getting the public to rethink their environment, it is mostly through masking part of it.
Harvard’s campus is not conducive to an additive way of working. In and around the Yard, artists are faced with buildings whose façades are protected from any possible alteration. The rules that come with the University’s institutional history have forced Harvard artists to take into account the environment in their work, which makes for a more complex interaction of art and armature. Rather than merely claiming a public space, students and professors are concerned with taking that public space and figuring out how it can be used in a way consistent with its characteristics and function. "I am interested in assessing what spaces on campus are able to be modified or repurposed," says Dension. What starts out as a constraint ends up helping to produce art that is often richer and more complex that traditional street art by virtue of its more careful consideration of its materials.
Denison is at the tail-end of a yearlong joint effort with VES Teaching Assistant Helen E. Miller to incorporate growing spaces in the Carpenter Center. This project is motivated by Le Corbusier’s original plans for the building. Though his plans have been carefully preserved in general, Le Courbusier’s intent to incorporate gardens was never realized due to budgetary constraints. In looking for a way to introduce these plants, Denison is interested in the "potential today for either implementing his vision or continuing his intentions with new types of growing."
The plan has evolved over the course of the year due to negotiations over how to fit new work into a historical legacy. "A part of the project that is interesting to me is about the precision of Le Corbusier’s plans being upheld," says Denison. "To me, [this] means that the plantings should be there as well." Now Denison and Miller are working on creating three-dimensional versions of Le Corbusier’s annotations in the original copies of his plans that represented the plants he wanted to go in the Carpenter Center green spaces. Dension and Miller are placing their scribble-inspired sculptures in the locations that correspond to where they were placed in the Carpenter Center’s blueprints. Additionally, they are growing plants on the fifth floor to eventually be moved outdoors. By going back to Le Corbusier’s intentions, Denison is finding a different way to interact with Harvard’s institutions beyond simply placing her mark on top of existing structures. This is public art without the bravado of traditional street art.
COMMUNITY AS CO-ARTIST
Whereas a traditional ‘street artist’ may use a building as a forum to broadcast his name or message, Denison and Miller are removing the identity of the artist from the equation. Jesse M. Shapins, who is pursuing a PhD at the Graduate School of Design (GSD) as well as teaching courses there, is equally focused on the collaborative nature of public art. He sees what he and his colleagues are doing as related to the lineage of street art, but with important distinctions. To him, the aspect of street art that is "close to commercial culture and the edge of advertising" is interesting, but different from what he is trying to achieve. Shapins’ art, and that of his collaborators, forges a more complicated relationship between the public and the creator that casts the viewer as more than a consumer. These works are concerned with the fluid roles of the artist and the public.
Last semester, Shapins taught the GSD class GSD 3418: "Media Archaeology of Place" along with Associate Professor of Humanaties and Social Sciences Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Anthropology Lecturer Ernst Karel, and GSD student James C. Burns. They sought to develop a web-based media platform through which students and members of the public could share digital projects deconstructing the social and historical meanings of a given place through archival research and site visits.
In the spring-semester class Shapins teaches with Burns, GSD 3448: "The Mixed-Reality City," each of the students produced short walking tours that anybody could take via a computer or phone. Shapins says that audience reception to art is usually passive, but that with this work "someone makes a conscious choice to participate," and that thus the artist faces "a set of constraints—what people would be comfortable doing and how long they would feel comfortable doing it." The question to Shapins then becomes, "how does one push the boundaries of the every day comfort zone?"
The course’s project therefore relies on the willingness of the public to engage with it, and is built around the resulting constraints. How can artists make complete strangers into active participants? The answer may not be found through making a mark on the environment itself, but in thinking of ways to use digital technology to allow a greater participation of the public. This is why "Media Archaeology of Place" and "The Mixed-Reality City" both focus on developing a web-based platform. Shapins is interested in "building open-ended dynamic structures" so that one is able to add onto the artwork; even once the initial artist is finished, the process of creation is not over.
A first year PhD candidate in VES, Joana C. Pimenta took "Media Archaeology of Place" and is currently enrolled in "Mixed-Reality City." An essential part of her work is public feedback. "How can you create space for your own work when you are reacting to others’ work?" she asks. In trying to answer this question, Pimenta is working on a piece that responds to a series of public art installations around campus called The Divine Comedy that is on display in the Carpenter Center’s Sert Gallery, the Northwest Science Labs, and the GSD’s lobby. Despite the presence of well-known artists such as Ai Weiwei, Pimenta hopes to make the public itself a contributing artist by creating an online application that will support audio-visual responses to the installations. She hopes to expand her work so that will be of use for other public art pieces in the future. This project is mind-bogglingly meta—a publicly-driven digital interface on public works that take as their main subject matter public art.
At the GSD, a post-graduate program called Art, Design, and the Public Domain is in its inaugural year, and represents the increasing interest for artwork that directly engages the public. The coordinator for this program, Professor Krzysztof Wodiczko, projects video onto buildings and makes sound pieces in his own art. Wodiczko’s projections often involve video culled from interviews with a wide variety of figures—whoever he believes knows the most about the issue he wants to explore.
"In those projections, there are people operating as co-artists," he says. "They are always the people of whom we know the least. They are the ones who communicate through the structures about themselves … The process of communicating is more important on some levels than the actual projection." Wodiczko takes the role of the public as an artist one step further by actually making the public into contributors.
Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11 has focused on similar ideas in his VES senior thesis, in which Forbes is exploring theoretically the appropriation of graphic images and producing posters for student and community organizations. The creative decisions that go into making these posters are collaborative, and though Forbes does not decide where the posters will be used, he acknowledges that "how the posters are seen depends on the context of where they are viewed." This loss of control does not bother him, however. "The way people actually use images is sort of as important as anything," he says. "I see the people I work with as much of an active participant as anyone." He recalls one instance in which he created a poster he found undistinguished. The organization that he gave it to used it on the podium of a church where a rally was being held, and, he says, "it took on a whole other life." It was just as much the organization as Forbes who was accountable for the impact of the poster, once again giving the public agency that is usually reserved for the artist.
ACHIEVING TRANSPARENCY
Harvard itself has tried to blur the lines between artist and viewer by creating spaces in which interaction between the public and the artist is inevitable. The Laboratory at Harvard, for example, is a space in the Northwest Labs reserved for rotating public exhibits. The interdisciplinary and aptly-named metaLab is another newly created forum through which the entire Harvard community can get involved in public art and humanities projects. "[There is a] new intense creative energy at Harvard going on right now around these questions," says Pimenta.
Still, the fact remains that these buildings are part of a larger university. The Carpenter Center is an historical building that is part of a private institution, and may never be able to achieve the transparency Le Corbusier intended. So Harvard artists work within these confines, and create art that acknowledges the layers of history and exploring the possibilities for public involvement, without obscuring the original armature. In doing so they are invested in a different art of the street—one that acknowledges the inherent limitations of bringing art into the outside world, and one that directly engages with these constraints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lead singer Eugene Hütz of Gogol Bordello came on stage at the House of Blues on April 2, shirtless, in tattered jean cut-offs with a bottle of red wine in hand. He conveyed all the debauchery and energy that one would expect from a band that describes their music as “Ukrainian Gypsy Punk Cabaret.” Gogol Bordello’s sold-out show in Boston—one stop in their ongoing North American tour—was as much a spectacle as it was a concert. Frontmen Hütz and Sergey Ryabtsev are a truly theatrical pair—as demonstrated by their hysterical performances in the 2005 film-adaptation of Jonathan Safran-Foer’s novel “Everything Is Illuminated.” With eight equally idiosyncratic members performing on stage, theatrics seem to come naturally for Gogol Bordello, but surprisingly the eclecticism of their setup doesn’t impede the formation of a musically coherent sound, which combines diverse instruments such as accordion, violin, drums, and bass.
The array of bizarre instruments reflects the all-encompassing nature of Gogol Bordello’s style, which fuses traditional Gypsy music with punk and dub. This musical melding serves as a neat representation of the cultural melting pot from which the band sprung. Though the band met in New York, the members are mostly from Eastern Europe and tell of their immigrant experiences through the use of many languages and culturally unique music.
Even the setting contributed to the organic eclectism of the night: the House of Blues could not have been better suited to the band. Diverse abstract paintings adorn the multi-hued, mural-covered walls of its three-story hall while nearly a dozen large religious icons—from the Om symbol and Star of David to representations of Ganesh and Hamsa—line the top of the stage.  Gogol Bordello brought their own addition to this cultural smorgasbord with their iconic banner—a black swath of fabric with the words “familia undestructable” over the Soviet-propaganda-style image of a fist grasping a slingshot loaded with a red star—under which the band performed with a frenetically joyous energy.
The group’s focus, represented by the banner’s communist symbols and their motto— which translates roughly to “indestructible family”—belies their commitment to a communal effervescence. Nowhere is their belief in the power of shared experience more evident than in their live shows, where the audience is an equal participant in the creation of the wild atmosphere. Three feet from the stage, I was one in an ocean of sweaty bodies roaring and slamming into each other; all of us would testify that it was with all the rage and ferocity of actual oceanic waves. The lively ardor and spunk of this crowd was a response—almost a ‘thanks’—to the pure force and joie de vivre that Gogol Bordello and opening act Forro in the Dark emanated from the stage.
A highlight of the concert was the festive rendition of “American Wedding.” With shouts of “Brazilian Wedding” from Hütz, Gogol Bordello brought their Brazilian openers Forro in the Dark on stage to join them on the song, which mocks American weddings for lacking sufficient debauchery and alcohol—three days’ worth, according to the Gypsy punks. Following this display of cultural fusion and in keeping with the theme of family, a man and a woman from the audience came on stage after the song. He proposed, she accepted, and the crowd erupted in cheers.
Though no further proposals were made during the concert, the audience was no less a participant throughout the rest of the set. During “Start Wearing Purple,” one enthusiastic man turned around and yelled, “this is the best fucking band in the universe,” as the entirety of the audience embraced the chorus’s promise that “All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish … it’s just a matter of time” by shouting as loudly as they could and dancing with as many flying limbs as possible. This reaction, however, was not limited to “Start Wearing Purple.” Other fan favorites, such as “My Companjera,” “Break the Spell,” and “Last One Goes the Hope,” were met with similar reactions from the manic audience, whose enthusiasm eventually drew the band onstage for six encore songs.
Gogol Bordello is a band best seen live. The feedback between the audience and the group is perfectly suited to the all-inclusive nature of the band’s ethos and sound. Over the course of the concert, I recognized six distinct languages. Though it seemed improbable that any given member of the audience understood more than one or two of them, nothing was lost in translation.

In author Meg Wolitzer’s latest novel, “The Uncoupling,” the women in an American town begin to lose interest in their men after a local high school performs Aristophanes’ “Lysistrata,” a comedy featuring a revolt instigated by women. Crimson arts editor Rebecca A. Schuetz discussed the writing process, texting, and modern romance with the author.
The Harvard Crimson: Did you have an idea for the general shape of the story when you began? Or did you just pick a theme and feel your way through it?
Meg Wolitzer: I knew I was interested in female desire. I felt that there’s this notion that everybody wants sex all the time. Since [famed psychoanalyst Sigmund] Freud we’ve had this idea that to be sexual is to be healthy, and therefore to be unsexual is to be neurasthenic, ill. And I thought, that’s not really true as far as I can see, looking around me. But there are changes, there are patterns. And what would it mean to sort of want to have a low-ebb or to have a higher period? So that came about at the same time that I was sort of interested in the Lysistrata story. I realized very quickly that the thing that struck me was how do women feel about all this. The notion—because there are still sex strikes in places around the world—that denying men sex would bring society to its knees is sexist, because it means that men need this thing that women have and women can tolerate living without it. So I thought, how can I sort of use that text, because I was also interested in saying something about books and book culture and the internet age and its relationship to books. And it seems like when you’re writing a novel, different ideas dovetail. So that you’re not writing a polemic. I don’t like books like that. And I hope I haven’t written one.
THC: Jumping on the idea that the notion that men need this thing that women don’t is sexist, I noticed that this book does show women falling out of love with their husbands and the men’s reaction. And I was wondering if you think it tends to happen that way.
MW: That’s really where I put my lens, I think. I think the male story about all of this would be really different. I’m not sure what it is. I’ve tended in recent years to sort of look at women’s lives more closely. And the men here in this story are far more reactive than the women. And I feel that there is pain for them and I think that, if it were the other way around, I don’t know what it would be, and I would be really interested.
THC: I know that in “The Uncoupling,” there’s a lot having to do with the irreversible technological changes between generations, such as a subplot involving text messages. Could you expand on how technology dovetails with other themes in your book?
MW: I think that it occurred to me when I started really writing. I mean, I write—not exactly blindly; it’s a little bit like being spun around to hit a piñata, but fairly soon you rip off the blindfold. At least, for me, that’s what’s the process of writing a novel. I wondered about our relationship to intimacy, and the relationship of technology to intimacy. You know, people can reach each other so much more quickly and express things to each other that they couldn’t before in the same way. But they’re doing it sometimes in much more staccato verse. Are things being left out? I have a teenager and a 20-year-old. I think they love their friends, and they really want to express things and convey things. So I don’t think that all that is lost. But there is something about patience that is lost. And I think that there is almost a connection between the patience to sit and read, say, a long novel, and the patience to have a relationship that you have to give a lot of attention to and to have the rest of the world fall away.
THC: Has watching things like “The Sopranos” and things with multiple storylines that were published serially influenced you as a writer at all?
MW: Not that I’m conscious of, but who knows? I’m steeped in the culture, like we all are. We spend our days being dipped in the world, and some things really stick. And they may not pop up like something in a bingo tumbler for years. But it may be actually that the kind of visceral quality of certain films is inspiring. To want to grab that in the story or in the novel. Somebody said that I was afraid of drama, a friend of mine who was a very good reader, this was some years ago, confronted me on that. That it always seems like the scene where they empty the dishwasher and talk about their childhood and suddenly we’re back in their childhood and I’d forgotten that we were back in the kitchen with the dishwasher. I may be more aware now that we’re in the kitchen with the dishwasher, and I want some drive forward. But I think that it’s something that I have been, and I’m not sure where I think the influence is, but I think that I have been much more compelled by the notion of imperative. That you want the novel to have an imperative; that the reader is going to ask, “Why are you telling me this?” and really know that and have a reason. Otherwise, there’s this kind of formlessness that I think is related to the impatience that a lot of people have with a lot of novels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States government should be spending more money—a lot more money—helping people in other countries. On this much I agree with advocates of the war in Libya. Compared to other government spending, the Libya war costs a pittance. The operation required $600 million in its first week, a mere 0.016 percent of a budget totaling $3.8 trillion this fiscal year. But when compared to the $8.7 billion Obama’s budget sets aside for global health programs at the State Department and USAID, or the $1.1 billion total budget of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, it starts to look like a significant foreign aid program.
Given that, it is worth asking whether airstrikes in Libya are an effective foreign aid program and, if they are, whether they’re cost-effective as well. If that $600 million isn’t actually producing results, then we shouldn’t be spending it. If there are other interventions that could do more good for the same money, we should spend the money on them instead.
It’s hard to say, at this point, whether the Libya intervention is doing good in humanitarian terms. There is no doubt that Muammar Gaddafi was attacking his own people, and, as British Prime Minister David W. D. Cameron has said, there was reason to fear a massacre as Gaddafi closed in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. But we have to balance this averted catastrophe against the human cost of continuing Libya’s civil war. It is possible that by preventing the rebels from being crushed, the allied intervention will produce more casualties than a quick Gaddafi victory would have.
The intervention’s long-term aftershocks also give reason to doubt its effectiveness as a humanitarian measure. Some political scientists, most notably the University of Texas at Austin’s Alan J. Kuperman, have argued that humanitarian interventions create a moral hazard problem. Rebels in other countries may take the Libya war as a sign that the US and NATO will support them if they launch an insurrection. It hardly seems like a win, in humanitarian terms, to encourage violent, likely-to-be-crushed revolts, rather than nonviolent civil resistance of the kind that succeeded in Tunisia and Egypt.
This is not to say that the Libya intervention will be a net loss for human welfare. It could well end up helping more than it hurts. The point is that we are radically uncertain as to whether it will work. This is especially concerning given that the $600 plus million being spent in Libya could be devoted instead to interventions we know can work.
Over the past decade, a group of economists, centered at MIT’s Poverty Action Lab, have taken to using randomized controlled experiments to determine, with social scientific rigor, what bang-for-the-buck certain foreign aid programs get. The results are encouraging. PAL studies have shown, for example, that spending $100 on chlorine treatment for water sources in Kenya can prevent hundreds of potentially deadly diarrheal incidents. Meanwhile, $100 spent informing families in Madagascar about the benefits of education results in students attending school for a total of 40 additional years.
The takeaway is that there are very cost-effective ways to help a lot of people in the developing world. Obviously, scaling this up would take work, but spending $600 million and knowing that one is producing 240 million more years of school attendance in Africa seems like a better choice than spending it to get whatever the results of the Libya intervention will be.
More to the point, existing, large-scale government foreign aid programs are showing results. To give just one example, AIDS research groups have noted that the GOP’s proposed $1 billion in global health cuts could stop AIDS treatment for a half million people, eliminate education and housing for 300,000 orphans, and keep 3.9 million people from receiving malaria treatments.
And there’s the rub. While a $600 million intervention in Libya can be launched without a hitch, the White House and Congressional Democrats will have to fight tooth and nail to preserve a similar level of funding for global health programs. The American political climate, it would appear, only allows humanitarian assistance when it’s pursued at gunpoint.
This cycle is self-perpetuating. The Libya intervention has reversed momentum within Congress for defense cuts, meaning that debt reduction efforts will likely focus on programs for the poor at home and abroad rather than on waste at the Pentagon. So next time a choice like the one presented by Libya arises, we will have a well-financed Pentagon and emaciated aid programs, and once again the military option will look more attractive.
The U.S. government should start taking the welfare of people abroad more seriously across the board. The fact that the world’s richest country spends so little of its resources preventing people abroad from sickness and death is a moral travesty of the first order. But taking the interests of people abroad seriously means investing in humanitarian endeavors that we know will work. We just do not know that about the Libya war.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, letters were loaded onto a postal truck, emails were sent, and a record-setting 6.2 percent of applicants found out they had been admitted to the Harvard Class of 2015. We can all remember the moment that email appeared in our inbox, the moment we tore open the letter—we were excited, crying, laughing. We had a big decision to make by May 1, and we all had questions, doubts, and hopes.
How did we choose? Maybe some of us had friends or siblings who had made the decision before us and could give us valuable advice. But for most of us, Harvard was a name that became a real place when we talked to the people who make Harvard “Harvard.” This past weekend during the Phone-a-Thon, dozens of undergraduate volunteers called virtually every admitted student and spent hours answering their questions, from “How accessible are professors?” to “Where can I buy office supplies in the Square?”
These phone calls, the Harvard College Student Blog, and the Message Boards give admitted students snapshots of Harvard life; and in ten days, when over one thousand of them come to visit Harvard, these snapshots will come to life and significantly influence the big decision every admitted student makes.
Planning for Visitas begins months before any admissions decisions have been made, and contrary to the criticisms in The Crimson Staff’s recent editorial “Revising Visitas,” the Admissions Office and the Undergraduate Admissions Council work closely with faculty, staff, and students across campus to showcase Harvard and all its amazing opportunities and unique characteristics, not to “sell it.”
We want admitted students to see all of Harvard—and, yes, this includes a social aspect, such as the Prefrosh Palooza, the Extracurricular Fair, and Sunday Sundaes. But each of these events also shows admitted students a unique aspect of undergraduate life. The Prefrosh Palooza, a crucial part of Visitas, is a performance similar to Cultural Rhythms, allowing admitted students to experience the talents and the diversity of the Harvard community. Similarly, the Extracurricular Fair lets admitted students connect with student groups that share their interests, explore new groups, and get to know future friends and mentors. While neither Palooza nor the EC fair showcases necessarily academic endeavors of Harvardians, they do enable prospective students to witness the enriching activities to which so many of our fellow classmates devote countless hours. Sunday Sundaes gives admitted students a time and a space to mingle and bond with their potential classmates over cherries and chocolate syrup. These are the classmates who will challenge them to think more critically, the friends who will provide late-night snacks and a shoulder to lean on, and the cheerleaders who will encourage them to follow their passions.
Yet Visitas does not end there. The Crimson’s “Visitas Revisited” chose to focus on the social aspect of the weekend but neglected the other events that allow admitted students learn about academics and the “day-to-day aspects of campus life.” These include a new series of events, “Big Questions in the Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Sciences,” in which faculty panels respond to a student-submitted question, similar to the popular “Harvard Thinks Big” events.  Also, there are academic open houses, an undergraduate research symposium, class visits, and panels on Harvard’s curriculum, advising, financial aid, study aid, and the uncensored freshman experience. In addition to tours of the campus and the libraries, staff and students also offer tours throughout the weekend of our art collections, natural history museum, and science and engineering complex, giving admitted students a glimpse of the amazing resources available at the College.
For admitted students who want more student interaction, Visitas offers plenty of time to talk to current students, whether those students are your hosts, people you approach in the Yard or at a regional reception, or a members of the UAC or another student organization. “Visitas Revisited” did get it right in that we as an undergraduate community need to make an effort. We need to remember the excitement we felt when we chose Harvard, and share that excitement with admitted students.
It is so easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of life here—whether editing an Expos essay, planning an event, or binding a thesis—but instead of just providing floor space, we should look forward to spending time with the admitted students we host,  and showing them what Harvard means to us. We know that Harvard is not always rainbows and sunshine, and that an education here is hard work, but admitted students know that, too.  Give them a chance to fall in love with Harvard just like we did, for both the good and the bad. Put aside your paper, pset, and Google calendar for a weekend, and remember what it felt like to have the whole world open to you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no secret that the American educational system has received more than its share of rough feedback the past few months. From public education to even, arguably, one of the best institutions in America, our system has seen criticism at every turn. If we have learned anything from this entire backlash, however, it is that no one is properly learning anything. The quality of education is fast declining, and we literally need a superhero to help us back up.
Though this sudden and much-needed increase in awareness is better than ignoring the open-sore educational wound, the depressing tone these articles adopt will not solve anything. Some do attempt to inspire change by reassuring us readers that we might be the next superheroes, but it is difficult to sell such a pitch after convincing us the problem is practically unfixable: even trained professionals enacting reforms costing hundreds of thousands of dollars still can’t effect change. While the statistics can inspire, they can also add fuel to the already growing fire of disrespect for American schooling.
As President Barack H. Obama said in his State of the Union address, this disrespect makes all the difference between America and other countries with strong educational systems. In South Korea, teachers are given the utmost respect and are even called “nation builders,” a title that is indicative of  how differently they are treated compared to those in America. President Obama said that “it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.” But how do we change what has practically been pre-programmed into our minds? When the average American thinks of respectable job markets, medicine, business, and law sweep the top ranks while education is left somewhere in the middle, at best. If teaching were to be included in this power group, it could appeal to more people who shy away from careers in education because society considers them Plan B. It might attract the passionate and bright-minded to teach our future generations. True, the six-figure salary might still whisk away some graduates to other fields, but the educational field may not necessarily be the best fit for more money-minded individuals.
Lastly, we can’t forget the students themselves. They should be respected—or at least given an equal education. In the film “Waiting for Superman,” one child is afraid that she will forever be stuck in the same socioeconomic rut because people will not be able to look past her background and test scores. This seems to be a similar concern for educators in disadvantaged areas. After tutoring at a charter school in Boston, I was ashamed that I once shared this belief; I judged the students based on their preliminary test scores, and I assumed they would be unmotivated because they came from a high-risk area. To my surprise, the average tutee learned quickly and was engaged in the material. When given the opportunity, they proved their potential.
In order to reform American education, we must improve its connotations. Though it is true that it is difficult to garner respect in an area that lacks promising results, we can at least help the process by honoring educators instead of blaming them for our current educational crisis. If we continue describing the faults in the system without respecting its potential, we will stay in the mindset that American education lacks much and deserves little. At that point, even Superman will not be able to save us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When University officials warn students about drinking at Harvard, they usually do so on legal grounds. To cite just one example, in a recent email to freshmen in advance of Housing Day, Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 wrote: “Drinking under the age of 21 is a violation of the law.” Along the same lines, College administrators often cite Massachusetts state law as the rationale behind the College’s policy on alcohol consumption, a move that enables the College to present itself as lawful rather than oppressive and as responsible rather than moralizing.
After all, who would argue that one of the nation’s premier universities ought to flout the law?
This seemingly lawful and responsible attitude, however, fails to account for the College’s recent decision to ban hard alcohol at off-campus formals. The ban needlessly goes beyond enforcing the legal drinking age and, with regard to alcohol consumption, suggests that the College does not in fact trust its students to the degree that it should. Of course, it is true that the administration has defensible grounds for regulating alcohol at House formals. To be sure, it provides funds for these events, and, therefore, is entitled to a say in what is served and what is not. That does not mean, however, that the administration should use its power to enforce extralegal restrictions on alcohol consumption. After all, what—besides a larger safety cushion in terms of liability protection—will these restrictions actually accomplish?
Banning hard alcohol at off-campus formals is a somewhat futile venture in any case. At most, the ban will prevent some students from consuming for a handful of hours on one solitary evening. Besides, there is the inevitable enforcement question: Each house has its own masters, all of whom espouse unique attitudes toward their respective House events. How, then, will the College be sure that this policy will actually translate into reality for all Harvard students?
On a more conceptual level, however, the theoretical ramifications of this new policy are what is truly concerning. Indeed, students who are 21 or older will head off into the real world in a few months to a year, and—given the College’s taboo approach to underage drinking—there is little in place to teach these students about the dangers of drinking excessively. As such, what the College ought to do is treat alcohol consumption as an unavoidable part of collegiate life and work within the system to educate its students on responsible drinking habits that will serve them well in later life. Given that the administration appears more concerned with preventing visible alcohol consumption than actual dangerous drinking, the current paternalistic standard protects no one but the College.
Another concern with this ban is its potentially harmful effect on House spirit. Recently, the College has attempted to institute a more uniform, stricter enforcement of the drinking age at house social events, including Stein Clubs, which are some of the only all-inclusive social events on campus.  Bringing in acronym-heavy enforcement squads such as BATs (Beverage Authorization Teams) and SESs (Student Event Services Teams) runs the risk of dampening House spirit by stifling the atmosphere of some of the Houses’ most successful community-building events.  Should that be a goal of administrative policy?
The House community is one of Harvard’s strongest assets, and, since it is highly doubtful that events like Stein Clubs are where alcohol poisoning actually occurs, any drastic uptick in enforcements could negatively affect the Harvard community irreparably. In that sense, the College would do better to focus on increased alcohol education rather than on heightened enforcement.
At best, increased enforcement will prevent underage students from drinking on a handful of nights; at worst, it will drive consumption into rooms, where far more dangerous drinking can occur. Although we recognize that the balancing act between, on the one hand, ensuring that students obey the law and, on the other, not seeming entirely draconian is a difficult one, the administration must adopt policies that preclude actual dangerous alcohol use through education, not those that merely drive it behind closed doors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences continues to recover from the impact of the financial crisis, a growing Sociology Department remains constrained by a faculty size that has not kept pace with the rise in undergraduate concentrators.
While the number of undergraduate concentrators has risen from 85 in 2006 to 200 in 2010, the department has lost the equivalent of three full-time faculty members since 2003, according to Department Chair Mary C. Brinton.
“We find ourselves stretched thinner and thinner with committee work, teaching, and thesis advising,” Brinton said.
As a result, sociology professors say the number of faculty is too small to adequately handle a department whose number of concentrators more than doubled in the last five years.
Sociology Professor Frank Dobbin spoke to the lack of resources in the growing department.
“We’re running a concentration with a lot of majors, with one of the most competitive graduate programs in the industry,” he said. “The undergraduates are the ones who are getting left out.”
Dobbin, who is currently on leave but normally teaches Sociology 25: “Introduction to the Sociology of Organizations,” says that over the years his class has increased from about 25 students to 100 last spring.
And while he once was able to teach a freshman seminar, the growth in concentrators means he has not been able to do so for the past several years.
“They just don’t have the resources for us to be able to teach more classes,” Dobbin said.
Students have also noticed growing class sizes.
“I think the sociology classes are a lot bigger than the department would like them to be ... most of your classes you have one lecturer and a bunch of TFs,” sociology concentrator Kara M. Hollis ’11 said.
“You never really get to interact with the professor,” she added.
While the department did oversee a successful junior faculty search this year, Brinton stressed that the hiring is not necessarily increasing the number of faculty but only “replacing” a gap created after an unsuccessful tenure case several years ago.
“Ideally, we want to get three or four [new professors],” Brinton said, adding that this was probably not realistic given that “FAS needs to balance the needs of all departments.”
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal echoed this need in an email statement yesterday.
“The dean wants to maintain the excellence of all FAS departments,” he wrote. “While we have made very significant progress in tackling the originally-projected deficit, we are still in a period of constrained resources.”
FAS currently faces a $35 million deficit which it hopes to close by 2012.
In the meantime, the department has used short-term lecturers to fill in the gaps, creating a problem for concentrators looking to write theses.
“It’s hard to function if we have a lot of one-year lecturers because again we need a stable faculty to be able to advise senior theses,” Brinton said. “And we need faculty who are here for many years to guide [graduate students] through the program.”

The Computer Science Department plans to debut a new course—Computer Science 20: “Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science”— next spring that will better prepare students for the required proof-intensive course CS 121: “Introduction to Formal Systems and Computation.”
CS 20 will provide a strong foundation in topics such as “logic, proof techniques, proof by induction, and discrete probability,” according to the course proposal compiled by Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who will teach the course next spring.
Lewis created CS 121 in 1978 and has taught the course roughly 25 times since then. He proudly displays a framed Number 121 Red Sox jersey in his office as a mark of his enthusiasm for the class.
But Lewis said he feels that a greater number of students are now entering the course without the rigorous proof background that is demanded.
“It’s always been a pretty steep hill for people who haven’t done formal mathematics before,” he said, adding that proof-writing is not extensively covered in the Math 1 and 21 series. “[CS 20] is designed to fill in that gap.”
The popularity of introductory computer science class CS 50 has played a role in attracting students without a formal math background into the CS concentration, according to Lewis.
In his course proposal, Lewis noted that most other universities with strong CS programs—including MIT, Stanford, and Yale—have already incorporated a discrete mathematics course into their curricula. CS 20 is primarily modeled off of Yale’s comparable class.
The course will be mainly intended for freshmen, and Lewis said he will forego teaching his usual General Education class—Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 12: “Bits”—to teach the new class.
“It’s not going to be obvious to people whether they need to take [CS 20] or not,” he said, adding that he plans to develop a sample final exam that will help students identify whether the class is appropriate for them.
Lewis also emphasized that CS 20 will not increase the number of CS concentration requirements, since it could potentially replace a technical elective or another math class.
Its introduction will also consolidate formal logic taught in a number of other courses.
“One of the things we’re actually hoping to accomplish in putting this in an intro course is [to] free up some time in several other courses,” Lewis said.
Computer science concentrators said they were excited about the new course.
“I think it’s a great idea,” said Tiffany J. Au ’12, who took CS 121 without a background in proof-based mathematics. Although she said that she left CS 121 feeling very comfortable with proofs, she added that the CS concentrators tended to have a weaker math background when compared to applied math concentrators in the class.
“Having it would definitely give us a leg up, especially for the first few problem sets,” she said.

Birds swarm around an unknown object in flight, mistaking it for one of their own, but fail to communicate with the device: an autonomous flying robot.
Dario Floreano, a professor at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, presented his recent research on autonomous flying robots to a packed room at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences yesterday.
Partially inspired by biological models, Floreano’s laboratory, the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at the EPFL, has researched how to “map the sensory modalities of insects into a small robot.” The information from these sensors can be used to control the pitch and roll of robots so that they can fly in natural environments.
Floreano highlighted the robot’s capabilities during a video demonstration of the robot’s flight around a small village while avoiding obstacles such as trees and buildings.
The technology is already employed in current catastrophe response and defense efforts in Floreano’s native Switzerland, as autonomous flying robots are capable of locating and rescuing individuals and simultaneously establishing a communication network for rescuers.
Floreano said that the new technology solves fundamental issues currently limiting unmanned aerial devices, which commonly depend on GPS signals that do not provide information about complex natural environments.
Still, the technology requires further modifications.
“The main limitation we face today is the resolution of the camera,” Floreano said. “The only time the robot collides with small objects is when these small objects are not resolved by the camera.”
The potential extraction of principles from nature and their application to technology were also discussed with regard to other bio-inspired industry innovations.
Mirko Kovac, a current post-doctoral researcher at the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory who studied for four years as a Ph.D student under Floreano, stressed the potential of robots using self-deployable wings to jump and glide, a current development that coincides with Floreano’s research.
In addition to examining flight, current researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering are drawing from other areas of biology.
“In general, when you are looking at designing robots, we’re looking at building a robot with all the senses you have,” said SEAS Associate Professor Radhika Nagpal, who co-hosted the discussion and is involved with the Wyss Institute.
Going forward, Nagpal said that medical technology and autonomously-driven cars are potential areas in which this sensory-based technology could be employed.

Presenting images of children shouting “Leave, Mubarak,” and men collecting trash as a “donation for Mubarak,” freelance journalist Sahar El-Nadi—a native Egyptian—presented an audiovisual account of the Egyptian Revolution in Cairo’s Tahrir Square yesterday evening at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“Tahrir can’t be told. It has to be witnessed,” El-Nadi said. “I want you to see what I saw.”
Utilizing her firsthand account of the events during Egypt’s 18-day revolution, which eventually led to the ouster of former president Hosni Mubarak, El-Nadi showed video clips and photographs to convey her experience of an “ethical revolution.”
“In just 18 days, Egyptians have made huge leaps of progress in every walk of life,” El-Nadi said, citing organizational skills, creativity, mutual trust, and even recycling as examples.
El-Nadi’s footage documented the participation of diverse individuals from across Egypt as they contributed to the revolution in various ways: providing medical care to participants, engaging with the media, and welcoming new protestors to the Square.
“It was like going to the Super Bowl,” she said. “People came from far away villages just to try out [protesting the government].”
Though her presentation culminated in a standing ovation and left some attendees in tears, audience reaction to El-Nadi’s statements was mixed.
El-Nadi claimed that the revolution was historic in that there were no instances of sexual harassment or sectarian violence in Tahrir Square during the uprising—a statement with which Ed School student Jared A. Jones took issue.
Jones, who used to live in Egypt, said he was skeptical of El-Nadi’s statement, pointing out that the widely-publicized sexual assault of CBS journalist Lara Logan disproved it.
Jones went on to say that though El-Nadi’s images and videos were emotional, her clear political bias may have clouded her judgment as to the reality of the revolution.
“This sounds like a lot of the rhetoric that has been coming out of Egypt for the past few decades,” he said. “Very one-sided.”
El-Nadi openly admitted that her talk was not impartial.
“I’m very biased,” she said. “It’s like talking about your child.”
However, Jones said El-Nadi had failed to realize the true beginnings of the revolution—as an outlet for the economically underprivileged.
“My fear is we’ll remember that people didn’t die out of economic frustrations, but to get rid of Mubarak,” he said. He added that he feared El-Nadi’s talk was an indication that Egypt may not truly reform itself if those who are suffering are ignored in the aftermath.
“When you know the real reasons for revolution like that [and ignore them], you doom yourself to repeat [history],” he said.
Jones’ step-mother Deborah L. Davis, a psychologist, said she wanted to attend the talk to explore the account of human nature and emotion during a revolution.
“It was fascinating to hear from someone who had been there,” she said.

Students gathered in Austin Hall at Harvard Law School yesterday to hear the founding members of the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective talk about the history and legacy of their book, “Our Bodies, Ourselves.”
Addressing a mostly female audience, authors Judy L. Norsigian ’70, Nancy Miriam Hawley, Joan S. Ditzion, and Wendy C. Sanford spoke about women’s health and sexuality, including how norms and taboos have changed since the first publication of their book 40 years ago.
The authors spoke about the creation of the book—after attending the first Female Liberation Conference together in June of 1969, they regularly met up in each others’ homes and frequented local libraries for information.
“We never wanted to do a book,” Ditzion said. “We just started with a sort of pamphlet and the idea of getting women’s voices together to have an open conversation.”
The first edition of the book was self-published and originally sold for 35 cents. A worn copy was circulated around the room.
“By seeking information for ourselves, we saw the value for all women,” Hawley said. “There are still women who don’t have access to health care and accurate medical information.”
Since its initial publication, 4.5 million copies of “Our Bodies, Ourselves” have been printed in 25 languages.
Law school students in the audience shared personal experiences and questioned the speakers on current political issues ranging from free speech to the recent passing of health care reform.
“I think it’s lovely to have different generations of activists come together and think creatively about how to bring about change,” said Sarah P. “Poppy” Alexander, a Harvard law student who moderated the discussion and whose mother, Ruth Bell, co-wrote the book.
“It was personally exciting for me,” said Kristi L. Jobson ’06, a second-year law student and proctor in Wigglesworth Hall. “This was a book that my mom gave to me when I was younger.”
Boston Women’s Health Book Collective currently works out of an office in Porter Square with a staff of over 40 people.
The 9th edition of the book will be released in October, tackling both new and old topics including abortion, contraception, menopause, and domestic violence.

Cambridge City Council members last night discussed potential plans for MIT to pay $175,000 to the city in order to reinvigorate nightlife in Kendall Square.
The expenses for development in Kendall Square were not originally included in the city’s annual budget.
City Manager Robert W. Healy proposed that half the necessary revenue come from an increase in MIT’s contribution to the city. The money would allow Cambridge to hire a consultant to examine how to revitalize Kendall Square and diversify its offerings.
Councillors mentioned that changes should introduce a mix of activities beyond the predominantly academic atmosphere, including increasing retail outlets, public gathering spaces, and entertainment venues.
“We are recognizing that MIT is a major player in this area that needs to have the vision and the concepts looked at and analyzed,” Healy said in light of plans for the development.
The majority of council members said they favored the plan and saw it as progressive.
“We are in a great place here, and this is important work,” Councillor Sam Seidel said.
Referring to an earlier report, Councillor Leland Cheung said that estimated demographic trends until 2025 in Cambridge should be taken into account.
“We will be a more diverse community,” Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 said, referring back to the demographic study. “We need to better understand what we’re planning for.”
The councillors said that, compared to the other squares in Cambridge, Kendall Square lacks appeal as a destination for social activities.
“Kendall Square has got to have its own edgy personality,” Reeves said.
To attract more activity and residents to the area, Cheung suggested that one easy solution would be for MIT to build more graduate housing.
Healy proposed that the upgrade take place within a year. However, Reeves said that the time frame was unrealistic for implementing all the changes discussed.
“A one time expenditure of $350,000 may be just the beginning,” Reeves said.

Because of a loophole in a computer system, fellowship applicants have been able to access their own and other students’ recommendation letters submitted to the Office of Career Services—making available what are supposed to be confidential documents on a wider basis than previously believed.
The Crimson previously reported that individual students were able to view letters of recommendation submitted on their behalf, but the loophole in the system is in fact broader and allows students to also view letters submitted on behalf of other students.
A student at the College confirmed that a friend, who had the same recommender, demonstrated on a computer screen that it was possible to view both their recommendation letters through the friend’s account in the application system.
The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that they could also see two other students’ recommendation letters written by the same recommender.
Director of OCS Robin Mount confirmed the nature of the system loophole in an email, acknowledging that students could “see all the recommender’s letters, for themselves and other students”.
In a March 25 memo to Mount, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris obtained by The Crimson, 26 faculty members requested “information about the exact nature of the lapse and the specific steps that are being taken to avert such system failures in the future.”
“We have not been made aware of the full extent of the security breach. The email sent out by OCS did not provide any details about who may have read or even downloaded our recommendations—this introduces awkwardness into the relationship, particularly if the recommendation was not in line with student expectations,” professors wrote in the memo.
“Of even graver concern is the possibility that a student could have read or even downloaded letters written for other students. This would represent a far more serious breach of confidentiality,” the memo continued.
Expressing serious concern about a lack of confidence in the OCS system, professors in the memo specifically requested information about “which fellowships were involved, which recommendations would have been available to students based on date of submission, and what is being done to increase security going forward.”
In addition, the memo said OCS should “ideally” disclose which students accessed recommendations if the office can obtain such information.
The memo also proposed that the system security be upgraded so that professors must enter their Harvard PIN to access the recommendation files.
Since last fall, notification emails were sent to faculty members—with students copied on the message—when they uploaded recommendation letters. Those emails included a link at the bottom of the e-mail that allowed students to view their letters of recommendation.
A student first alerted OCS to the problem in mid-January, after which OCS stopped copying students on the notification emails.
However, until students notified Dean of Faculty Michael D. Smith of the problem in mid-February, it did not come to OCS’ attention that students could still access recommendation letters through links sent in previous emails.
OCS told The Crimson on Feb. 18 that the problem was completely fixed.
“We learned recently through reports from students that the system email to a recommender requesting a recommendation, which included a link to a file with the recommendations the recommender had entered in the system, was cc’d to the student to keep the student up to date and, unfortunately, the cc included the same link,” OCS wrote on Feb. 22.
It was unclear from this letter whether students were able to access only recommendation letters written for themselves, or the ones written for other students as well.
Mount said OCS is now working with FAS IT and Symplicity—the company that designed the software—to “gather the data necessary to enable [OCS] to report as quickly as possible to faculty who have raised concerns”.
Harris declined to comment today in an email to the Crimson, adding that the administration will share a full report with the faculty after investigating the matter.
Representatives from Symplicity could not be reached for comment yesterday.

The Department of Athletics has laid the groundwork for its role in the University’s upcoming capital campaign, according to Harvard Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise.
Scalise said the department is hoping to enhance varsity, club, and recreational programs, as well as taking on facilities renovation projects.
“We’ve proposed both some facility projects and some ways to attract and develop outstanding people, and ways to improve our programs for the committee that’s looking at the campaign to consider,” he said.
Scalise declined to discuss specifics as to the scope of the campaign, both in terms of fundraising targets and which facilities would likely be part of the renovations.
Besides some independent fundraising, the Athletic Department will work in close conjunction with University administrators who will have a hand in the sports-specific elements of the campaign.
“[The department is] about to get ready to undertake a capital campaign, and that means a lot of work, a lot of planning from President [Drew G.] Faust on down to the deans,” said Tim Murphy, head coach of the football team. “Eventually it’s going to affect us all, but it’s a long term approach.”
At the moment, it is unclear which teams will be most dramatically affected by potential changes.
While the upcoming campaign will benefit the department at large, Harvard athletics has undertaken smaller efforts targeting more specific causes in recent years.
In 2006, the Athletic Department made changes to Harvard Stadium, adding lights, artificial turf, and a seasonal protective bubble that allows for winter-time use of the field. Alumni donations funded the multi-million dollar project.
Among the donors was Albert H. Gordon ’23, the namesake of Harvard’s indoor track and one of the biggest donors to the athletic department in University history, who died in 2009. His son, long-time donor Albert F. Gordon ’59, publicly criticized the Athletic Department a year ago.
But Scalise remains optimistic about the department’s alumni outreach over the next several years.
“We feel like we’ve had some good input, and we hope both that the committee [planning the campaign] agrees with some of the things we’d like to do and that we have some donors who would be interested in funding these things, which would impact a lot of broad areas of student life,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the opening day of the murder trial of alleged Kirkland gunman Jabrai Jordan Copney yesterday, dozens of citizens paraded through the courtroom to be evaluated for spots in the jury box.
By the end of the day, half of the panel—five women and three men—had been selected through a lengthy process which involved questioning each potential juror individually. Thirty-four citizens interviewed yesterday were excused from service based on their answers.
As soon as sixteen jurors—the requisite twelve deliberators plus four alternates—have been selected, opening statements will begin in the trial of the man who allegedly shot 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland House in May 2009.
Through a written questionnaire, a group session, and individual interviews, potential jurors faced inquiries about a wide range of issues that might disqualify them.
Some were turned away for saying that a relative’s employment in the judicial system or the police force unfairly colored their view of law enforcement; others said they were biased due to their own or their family members’ brushes with the law.
One woman was excused because of health problems, and many were dismissed because their employment or their family commitments presented “insurmountable” hindrances to their attendance at the trial, which Superior Court Judge John T. Lu predicted will last up to three weeks.
Lu also asked members of the jury pool whether they would be unable to make impartial judgments in a case involving Yale or Harvard. For some, that did pose a problem.
“I live right down the street from Harvard, so it’s kind of in my neighborhood, and I was actually quite happy when I heard they had found the person that did it,” one woman said. “And I think I know one of the witnesses: I think one of the police officers, his son was on my kid’s baseball team.” Lu promptly excused her from the jury pool.
Lu dismissed some people who said they would look unfavorably upon a defendant who chooses not to testify in his own defense, even though the law permits him to do so, and others who admitted they might have trouble thinking about potentially prejudicial evidence only in certain court-approved contexts.
Noting that both the murder victim and his alleged killer are African-American, Lu asked every potential juror whether race would unfairly sway his or her thinking about the case. All said that race would not affect their judgments.
Daniel J. Bennett ’85, the senior prosecutor in the case, and John A. Amabile, a defense attorney representing Copney, each had the opportunity to ask up to three questions of each juror and to unilaterally choose to remove a limited number of interviewees from the jury pool without stating a cause.
Bennett asked few questions, but Amabile used his three questions at almost every opportunity. He repeatedly queried how, as a juror, a person might react to prosecutors’ allegation that Copney committed a different robbery several months before the crime for which he is on trial.
Lu has said that he intends to deny Amabile’s earlier motion that this evidence should be excluded from the Kirkland shooting trial altogether.
Amabile also asked many potential jurors to define “presumption of innocence” and probed them about their personal feelings toward marijuana users and accused murderers.
Bennett chose to strike two interviewees from the jury pool yesterday, and Amabile struck four.
Next on the horizon—after the jury box is filled and the prosecution and defense each deliver opening statements—is a bus trip for jurors from Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, Mass., to Cambridge. There, the jury will visit Kirkland House’s J-entryway to see the alleged scene of the crime first-hand.

A Harvard undergraduate may have been thrown out of Market in the Square by a homophobic clerk after kissing his boyfriend in the store early Sunday morning.
In search of a late-night snack, Aaron C. Fallon ’11 and his boyfriend, who is not a Harvard student, briefly kissed as they perused the aisles of the 24-hour market. A moment later, an employee approached the couple and said, “We don’t want that shit in here,” according to Fallon.
“We were trying to pick out something to eat, and my boyfriend kissed me,” Fallon said. “Literally right after we kissed, an employee came out from behind the sandwich counter and told us to get out.”
The employee ushered them out of the store.
Fallon, deeply concerned, sent an email describing the incident over the open email list of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, which prompted an outpouring of support from list members.
Fallon, a Market in the Square regular, returned to the store yesterday morning to discuss the incident with the store manager, Ahmed Eino. After reviewing the relevant security camera footage, the manager called his employee and confronted him about the issue.
“I go there a lot, and I was really offended by what happened,” Fallon said. “I felt personally attacked, and I went back because I wanted to say that homophobia isn’t going to be tolerated.”
Eino said that his employee said he believed the two were stealing and was still alarmed by a fight that had broken out in the store 15 minutes prior.
“Apparently the employee said he thought that we were stealing something, but that’s ridiculous,” Fallon said. “We had our hands in our pockets the whole time. We were in the olive oil section. I wasn’t trying to steal olive oil from Market in the Square at 3 a.m.”
Fallon explained this to Eino, who then pressed the issue with his employee. The clerk then said that he believed the two were going to do something “inappropriate” when he saw them kissing, according to Eino.
After discussing the issue with his clerk, Eino apologized to Fallon for the incident and informed his employee that he would have to find a new job by the end of the week.
“I know my guys, and this guy had been working for me for a while,” Eino said in an interview. “We [are] all human, and a human makes mistakes. But this wasn’t shoplifting and the way my clerk acted was unacceptable.”
QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 said that she was glad the incident was resolved and noted the support Fallon received from Harvard’s queer community and its allies.
“In my three years here, I don’t remember seeing something similar go over the [QSA] email list,” Wang said. “Generally homophobia goes unannounced, but I was proud that Aaron spoke up and sent this over the list and I was very impressed to see the response.”
Wang added that she hopes that Fallon’s email will inspire other members of the queer community to speak up about instances of discrimination they may face.
Fallon said that though he did not wish for the employee to be fired, he was heartened by the way the store manager handled the situation.
“This will make me more confident in standing up for myself if I ever face homophobia again,” he said. “At the time I felt so trampled on and weak, but it was a really good feeling to stand up for myself and get support and hear confirmation from the manager.”
Fallon added that he will most likely return to Market in the Square sometime in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the College’s recent announcement banning hard alcohol from off-campus House events, House Committees have been forced to reevaluate plans for their rapidly-approaching spring formals.
Both Kirkland and Quincy Houses—which intend to hold their formals off-campus this year—have been forced to modify their formal plans after negotiating with venues under the assumption that hard alcohol would be served.
The initial contract for Quincy’s Spring Formal—known as the Q-Ball—included hard alcohol and was preliminarily approved by the Office of Student Life, according to Quincy HoCo co-chair Neil T. Curran ’12. About a week later, the Office of Student Life told Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke their contract had to be revised to reflect the change in policy.
“It was a surprise to my House Masters,” said Ling Lin, the other Quincy HoCo Co-Chair, who is also a Crimson design editor.
According to Lin, Quincy, which will hold its formal at the Harvard Club of  Boston, has used a similar contract for years, and the Masters expected that the contract would not pose a problem.
Following the College’s policy change announcement, Quincy modified its contract to reflect the new regulations. The money originally allocated towards the purchase of hard alcohol will now be redirected towards buying “better food” for the formal, according to Curran.
Although Quincy has finalized its formal plans, the status of Kirkland’s formal—to be held at the New England Aquarium—remains uncertain while Kirkland HoCo co-chairs and their House Masters talk to the administration about the new policy.
Although nothing in the House’s contract with the venue specifically states that hard alcohol will be served, the contract sets the baseline drink price at $6 per drink—typically the price of a drink containing hard alcohol.
Juan P. Munoz ’12, a Kirkland HoCo co-chair, said last Thursday that he received an email that day informing him that Kirkland’s formal could not serve hard alcohol.
Munoz’s fellow co-chair K. Abby Koff ’12, who is also a Crimson photo editor, said that given such short notice, it would be difficult for Kirkland to modify its contract.
“Changing our contract isn’t a feasible option because we had to go through months of negotiating,” she said.
Kirkland also risks losing money if the House is unable to renegotiate with the venue.
“The baseline price [for wine and beer] would probably be around $3 or $4. Multiply $2 by 500 and suddenly it’s $1000 you’re losing,” Koff said.
Administrators have indicated that they intend to work with HoCos to help them adapt to the new policies.
“The Office of Student Life is currently reaching out to every HoCo that has signed a contract with an off- campus venue to determine what, if any, contractual ramifications might arise from the alcohol policy,” FAS Spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a emailed statement.
Administrators banned all liquor except beer and wine and mandated that staff check student IDs at all House events as part of a larger push by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds to enforce alcohol policy in a more uniform manner throughout the Houses.

Kirkland House Resident Dean David A. Smith will be replaced by Cory T. Way at the end of this year, Kirkland House Masters Tom C. and Verena A. Conley announced in an email to the Kirkland House community yesterday.
Smith wrote in an email to the Crimson that he will miss Kirkland’s vibrant community and annual traditions, including housing day, humans vs. zombies, and Secret Santa week.
After three years as resident dean, he will be returning to Canada to accept a tenure-track appointment in history at Wilfrid Laurier University, which is near Toronto.
He said that he plans on completing his first book on English law and developing a project on the multiracial experience in the English Atlantic world.
Way, who will assume Smith’s role in July, is currently a Fellow in the Program on the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School.
He graduated from Princeton in 1990 with a bachelor’s degree in International and Public Affairs and received a doctorate from the University of Oxford.
He has practiced law at firms in New York City and Washington, D.C., and has served as a law clerk to Karen L. Henderson, a federal judge for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
His doctoral thesis, “Nothing Beats a Stunning Good Murder: Crime News in England and America,” will soon be in print, according to the announcement.
The Conleys also praised Way’s previous experiences as Dean of Student Welfare at Merton College, Oxford, and Assistant Dean at Corpus Christie College of the University of Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When women’s tennis junior co-captain Holly Cao went to play in her first-ever tournament, she was a bit underprepared.
“I went to the state tournament not really knowing the rules of tennis,” Cao said. “So my opponent had to tell me what to do—like where to stand and where to serve. I had no idea what the scoring system was…and I didn’t know that I was supposed to switch sides after two games.”
Regardless, Cao, who was only eight years old at the time, managed to reach the quarterfinals, proving her doubters wrong.
“When my father mentioned that I was going to play in the tournament, people kind of laughed at us,” Cao said. “So they were really surprised, because they didn’t expect me to do so well.”
Cao’s father then predicted that his daughter would win the same tournament next year—which she did. Cao also won a national under-12 event at Melbourne Park, the site of the Australian Open, the same year.
By 2006, Cao had become the top-ranked junior girl in Australia, and at one point held a professional ranking of 699 after playing in several WTA events. Eventually Cao decided that she would bring her talents to the banks of the Charles, where she has blossomed into Harvard’s No. 1 player and has gone undefeated so far this spring season.
“She is a very, very fierce opponent,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “If I had to face her in a tournament, I’d definitely be nervous. She’ll put you in trouble and have you running the whole match.”
But playing for Harvard hasn’t always been easy for Cao. In her freshman year, she fell off her bike on a slippery road and injured her knee. Without an immediate diagnosis, Cao fought through the pain and played in the following weekend’s USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center Invitational in New York City.
The injury got worse as the tournament progressed, so Green decided that she had to stop Cao from continuing play in the third set of the semifinals.
X-rays taken after Cao returned from the tournament showed that she had fractured her kneecap.
“Everybody was just like ‘Whoa’,” Green said. “Basically she just ran through people with a broken knee and didn’t even want to stop. So we were just dumbfounded by the whole situation.”
“She was kind of just hobbling around,” senior Samantha Rosekrans added. “But she fought through the pain and tried as hard as she could for every point, which said a lot about her.“
A different educational system presented another challenge, and being thousands of miles away from home didn’t help either.
“I had a pretty tough freshman year,” Cao said. “Just being so far away from home and unable to go back very often—it’s hard to keep yourself afloat especially with that broken kneecap and everything.”
Cao spent a couple of months in a cast but eventually recovered from the patellar injury to come back stronger than ever.
“She never really complained about the injury,” junior Sam Gridley said. “She worked really hard, and she came back. Now she just steamrolls past everybody like it never happened.”
In recognition of her hard work and talent, the team elected Cao co-captain at the end of her sophomore year, an added responsibility that she said has helped her evolve from a player into a leader.
“Being captain has taught me how to better communicate with the coaches and everyone on the team—to look outside yourself and focus on the entire team,” Cao said. “It’s really been a memorable experience for me.”
“I’m just excited by how she has learned how to make other players around her better this year,” Green added. “She had always been a great player for us. But this year, she has learned how bring the rest of the team to her same level.”
Sophomore teammate Alexandra Lehman said that Cao, with her intensity and focus, always leads by example.
“When I’m playing with her during practice, I know I have to raise my level and focus to keep up with her,” Lehman said. “And that’s really helped my game.”
After going 26-8 as a sophomore and 16-2 so far this season, Cao has no intentions of slowing down.
“I think it would be really great to win Ivies this year,” Cao said. “It would be a great team achievement.”
She shouldn’t have much trouble doing that—now that she knows all the rules.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After surrendering six unanswered goals to New Hampshire, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team was in danger of having its record drop below .500.
But that’s when sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen did what she does best, scoring the tying and go-ahead goal to lead the team to victory.
“Being down one and being tied, I knew that someone had to step up and put some shots away because we were having some troubles with their goalie,” said VanderMeulen after the contest.
Coming out of the half down one to the Wildcats, VanderMeulen was fouled going to goal and awarded a free-position shot. The attacker fired the attempt past the New Hampshire goalkeeper to even the score at six. Fifteen minutes later. VanderMeulen found herself with another free-position opportunity. And this time, the sophomore bounced it into the back of the net for the winning goal.
Two days later, Harvard was defeated by Virginia on Sunday afternoon, but VanderMeulen continued to score in bunches, finishing with five goals in the 19-18 loss.
When the Crimson was fighting back from a 10-5 deficit, VanderMeulen scored two quick goals to bring the Crimson within three just minutes into the second half. The sophomore also finished second on the team with two draw controls.
“This past weekend our team showed a lot of fight,” VanderMeulen said. “Against New Hampshire, being down 6-0, I think most teams, or even our team last year, might have given up. We didn’t let down, and we knew that we could dig ourselves out of it. Same thing against Virginia, They came out very strong, and we weren’t really ready, and yet we were able to close the gap and almost knock them off.”
VanderMeulen currently leads the team with 25 goals this season, netting a combined eight this past weekend.
The sophomore also sits atop the Ancient Eight in scoring, averaging 3.12 goals per game. But this weekend VanderMeulen took her scoring to a new level.
“Jenn really stepped it up this weekend,” junior co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “She’s been a consistent scorer since last year, but we were counting on her more than ever these past couple of games.”
On Friday, VanderMeulen led the scoring with a hat trick including the winning goal with 10:31 left to play in the game.
She was successful on two of three free-position shots and three of her total five shots.
She also led the team with three ground balls.
“Jenn is always aggressive going to goal, and that really helped in our game against New Hampshire,” sophomore Danielle Tetreault said, “She scored that buzzer beater at the end of the first half to make it 6-5 and that gave us momentum going into halftime.”
The momentum carried throughout the second half, as Harvard continued to tally scores and prevent New Hampshire from getting on the board.
“Jenn always steps up.” Tetreault said. “This weekend, though, she stepped up when we really needed it.  We had quite a few injuries this weekend and not all of our starters were out there but Jenn really stepped up and led the team.”
Harvard’s opponents are certainly aware of VanderMeulen’s offensive talent.  Last year, the attacker earned the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award and led both the Crimson and the Ivy League in goals and points with 56 and 64, respectively.
But her past success has brought VanderMeulen even more attention as a sophomore.
“It’s difficult returning as the Rookie of the Year because you’re constantly grabbing the other team’s best defenders and getting double-teamed,” said Baskind, who earned the 2009 Ivy League Rookie of the Year award in women’s soccer. “Jenn has handled it very well and has just continued to get better.”
For most players, increased defensive pressure might hinder their goal-scoring ability, but VanderMeulen has embraced the challenge.
“Usually when teams man mark me, it makes me work harder, and I kind of see it as a challenge,” VanderMeulen said. “I try not to use the face guard as a crutch, but I see it more as a competition.”
The way VanderMeulen has overcome the added defense attention has impressed her teammates, who have grown to look to the sophomore in pressure situations.
“She’s doing a lot more than just scoring; she’s taking draws and is a key part of our transition defense as well,” Baskind said. “She’s becoming a real leader out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After claiming the top spot in the Ivy League the previous week, the Harvard sailing team looked to continue its success and maintain its standing as it competed in a trio of regattas this past weekend.
The Crimson picked up its third win of the spring season with the co-ed team finishing first at the 14th Southern New England Team Race Intersectional. The co-eds also sent another squad out on the water over the weekend to compete for the Boston University Trophy, where the team took 10th place.  The women’s squad competed this weekend as well, coming in 15th place at the 25th Women’s Brad Dellenbaugh Trophy Intersectional.
“We’ve been winning a lot of good races, making good plays and good execution,” senior Alan Palmer said. “We feel pretty good about where we are right now.”
14th SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TEAM RACE INTERSECTIONAL
The co-ed team sent its best sailors down to New London, Conn., to compete at the 14th Southern New England Team Race Intersectional hosted by Connecticut College and the Coast Guard Academy.  Harvard put together one of its best performances this spring, posting a 14-1 record on the weekend to claim the first-place finish.
“Last year, one of our Achilles’ heels was when it got real breezy,” senior John Stokes said. “We’ve had a couple of situations [during the weekend], but we’ve done a lot better when breezes come up [with] being able to set up boats fast and still make plays and execute team racing.”
But this was not an easy victory for the Crimson, as it faced stiff competition from Roger Williams University and Boston College. At the end of the regatta, all three teams posted identical 13-2 records, requiring a three-way tiebreaker to decide the victor, which would be won by the top-ranked Eagles.
But the tiebreaker would prove to be moot, as Harvard won a protest over an earlier incident with Boston College, giving the Crimson sole possession of first place.
Eleven different sailors competed for Harvard with combinations of four skippers and eight crews, easily one of the biggest squads put out by the Crimson in recent competition. Palmer, Stokes, fellow senior Tedd Himler and junior Brendan Kopp skippered for the Crimson. Senior Meghan Wareham, junior Quincy Bock, sophomore Alma Lafler, sophomore Jason Michas, freshman Sarah Pierson, and Stokes all crewed multiple races, while junior William White—who is a Crimson news editor—and freshman Luke O’Connor each raced once as crew.
“We have some crews that don’t have as much experience,” Palmer said. “But I think we’ve done pretty well integrating everyone.”
BOSTON UNIVERSITY TROPHY
Not too far away from home territory, Harvard competed in its second event at Boston University in as many weeks.
But familiar surroundings did not give an edge to the Crimson, as the team finished in 10th place out of a field of 14. The host Terriers took the win with a low score of 89 points.
In the A-division, sophomore Ryan Byrne and freshman Kathryn Kelley managed to take second place in two of the 14 races they competed in but finished with a score of 101, a far cry from the 46 points put out by the top two teams in the division as they finished in ninth place.
Harvard’s B-division squad did not fare much better, as the freshman duo of Ben Lamont and Alice Kenney were unable to place higher than fifth in any of their races. The pair finished in 11th place on the weekend.
25th WOMEN’S BRAD DELLENBAUGH TROPHY
The women’s squad sent out by the Crimson on the weekend traveled down to Providence, R.I., to compete for the 25th Women’s Brad Dellenbaugh Trophy against 16 other teams from across the country.  Harvard finished in 15th place out of 17 teams with a score of 324 points, nearly 200 points behind the host and winner Brown.
In the A-division, the junior combo of Emily Lambert and Alex Jumper hoped to continue on their spring season hot streak, but the two had an atypical outing, only finishing twice in the top two and four times in the top four, wrapping up the weekend in 10th place.
The B-division saw another classmate pair compete, this time the freshman duo of Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane, hoping to put the experience they have gained in the previous weeks to good use. But the two were unable to place in the top half of the field with the highlight of their weekend being an eighth-place finish in their fourth race. They finished the regatta in 15th place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates have been named to a wide variety of Hall of Fames throughout the world over the years. But one Hall not often frequented by those associated with the university is the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.
But on Monday, former Crimson head coach Tom “Satch” Sanders earned that prestigious honor, as he was selected by the Veterans Committee for enshrinement on Aug. 12.
Sanders coached Harvard for four seasons, from 1973-77. The team went a combined 40-60 during his tenure, finishing 27-29 in Ivy play.
A former New York University basketball standout, Sanders was the eighth pick in the 1960 NBA draft and played 13 years in the league, all for the Boston Celtics. During that period, he was part of eight championship teams from 1961-66, 1968, and 1969. Only teammates Bill Russell and Sam Jones ever won more titles during their playing careers. For Sanders’ contributions, his No. 16 is among those jerseys retired at TD Banknorth Garden.
“Satch made my life easier, because he got all the tough guys to defend,” Heinsohn told ESPN. “So he took a load off of me. But he was perfectly capable of scoring 20 points a game, also. He was a very good offensive player.”
The 6-foot-6 forward averaged 9.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per game during his career, but it wasn’t his numbers that his former teammates most respected.
“In the course of things, people try and quantify whether a guy should be in the Hall of Fame because of his stats,” Heinsohn said. “Stats mean nothing, and I think right now, this is proof that he was a winner.”
Upon his retirement from the NBA in 1973, Sanders took the Harvard coaching job. After leading the Crimson, Sanders returned to the Celtics as head coach, finishing with a 23-39 career record. In the years since, he has served as the NBA’s Vice President and Director of Player Programs.
“He’s such a good guy,” Celtics star Ray Allen told ESPN. “He’s very humble.”
The Celtics great joins a 2011 Hall class that includes former NBA stars Dennis Rodman and Chris Mullin, among seven others. He becomes the second member of the Basketball Hall of Fame to have Crimson ties, along with former Harvard coach Edward Wachter, who was enshrined in 1961 after coaching the team from 1920-33.
"Satch will fit right in with Harvard's tradition of excellence,” said former professor James M. Jones upon Sanders’ hiring in 1973. “He has the ability to bring basketball up to par with Harvard's academic excellence. And it's about time."
With his election the hall, Sanders has met the highest standards of excellence once again.

Next time you're in the dining hall, don't pass on dessert in the name of healthy eating. A recent Harvard study concluded that consuming chocolate lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol levels, and may reduce the risk of diabetes.
The researchers conducted a meta-analysis and reviewed 24 studies and 1106 participants to analyze the overall conclusions researchers have made over the past decade regarding the health benefits of chocolate. The study concluded that eating chocolate leads to lower blood pressure. They also found evidence of positive changes in cholesterol levels and an increase in insulin sensitivity, which may contribute to lowered risk for diabetes.
However, not all chocolate is created equal. The component of chocolate that creates these positive health benefits, flavonoids, are found in chocolates that contain higher proportions of cocoa solids.
Eric L. Ding, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the researchers of the study, wrote in an email that the "implications are that darker chocolate is likely better than milk chocolate or (fake) white chocolate for health."
So should college students think twice before passing up tomorrow's dessert option in the dining hall? Ding cautioned to be wary of commercial dark chocolate and over-consumption.
Unlike the very dark and fortified chocolate used in the studies, Ding warned that "[commercial] 'dark' is sometimes only 60 percent dark." He continued, "a chocolate bar again has calories, which likely somewhat dilutes/negates health benefits if eaten beyond moderation."
The reseachers, however, concluded that chocolate eaten in moderation will have positive benefits for your health. Enjoy that cheesecake brownie or bowl of chocolate pudding in the dining hall. Your heart will thank you.

Students and volunteers from the Office of Sustainability weatherized the Freshman Dean's Office (FDO) by installing energy saving bulbs, caulking windows, and insulating pipes. Kamilia K. Kaczor '11 and Sam J. Arnold '14 helped lead and organize this project.
The weatherization of the FDO is part of the campus-wide green initiative that aims to reduce the greenhouse emissions at Harvard by 30 percent below their 2006 levels by 2016, according to the Office of Sustainability website.
"It was amazing to see how so many little changes could add up to save tons of carbon dioxide and thousands of dollars a year," Arnold said. "Getting involved and making these changes ourselves goes to show how easy it is to make these adjustments and reduce our environmental impact."
So on Saturday morning instead of catching up on sleep, these students rolled up their sleeves, broke out the supplies, and caulked cracks in the FDO's building in the pursuit of a greener campus.
Students who wish to participate in green initiatives and the push to reduce greenhouse gases should contact the Office of Sustainability.
