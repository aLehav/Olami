Craig Brewer’s remake of the 1984 classic “Footloose” attempts to update a well-loved film, but fails to bring anything new to the table. Instead, the movie comes off as a simple tribute to a past success, but not something most would spend 15 dollars to watch in theaters today.
The film opens in exactly the same manner as the 1984 version, with continuous footage of dancing feet—only this time the feet are housed in converse sneakers, plaid hipster moccasins, and off-the-shelf women’s cowboy boots. Likewise, in place of the frayed denim jacket Kevin Bacon sported as protagonist Ren in the original, the new Ren (Kenny Wormald) wears a cutesy denim jacket adorned with buttons. Like the updated footwear in the opening credits, the shinier jacket screams “Take me as an indication that this movie is hip and contemporary!” Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is about as superficial as these cloying gestures at relevance, with little of the charm of the original.
At film’s start, archetypal bad boy Ren MacCormack buses into the tiny rural town of Bomont, West Virginia. There, dancing, drinking, playing loud music, and generally carrying on in other inappropriate ways is strictly forbidden ever since a tragic accident took five of Bomont’s brightest three years ago. Ren soon meets up with leading lady Ariel, played by Julianne Hough of “Dancing with the Stars,” and they establish the standard sexual chemistry needed to propel the movie forward.
Ariel is reckless and frankly unlikeable, but as this was how Lori Singer portrayed Ariel in the original “Footloose,” of course the character is similarly flawed in this version. And don’t worry—the new Ariel wears Sugarlips apparel, feather necklaces, and Delia’s skirts, so audience members will at least be able to relate to her sense of fashion, if not her personality. The two hip high school students set out to change Bomont’s laws and the mind of its religious leader, Rev. Moore (Dennis Quaid), who happens to be Ariel’s father. Dancing and deviance predictably ensue, and the movie proceeds to faithfully cover the same plot points as its predecessor, but with more style than actual substance.
Of course, if you are just looking for a movie with pretty people and spectacular dancing, you will not be disappointed. The dance moves that made the original “Footloose” such a crowd-pleaser are exactly the same. Ren’s “dream ballet” moment in the warehouse is as sexy as ever and wrought with as many grunts and gyrations as the original. Wormald does a fantastic job of mimicking all that Kevin Bacon did to make Ren into a suffering artist and hero. Wormald walks and slouches in the same way, and glowers from under his wispy tuft of hair in the same smoldering manner. It is almost as if Brewer said “Let’s update all of the clothing and casually throw in some cell phones, but leave Ren and the plot in a time capsule to satisfy the older audience members.”
Indeed, given the film’s loyalty to its source material—aside from its taste in fashion—one wonders why the filmmakers didn’t just let the original stand on its own. Often, the film simply feels like an extended exercise in product placement, rather than a dramatic update of a cult classic. We may not find a new interpretation of the story or characters here, but how else would we know which cowboy boots to buy at Target, or how exactly to wear Ray Bans? Thank goodness “Footloose” is on the case.
But perhaps this nostalgia for past success coupled with comfortable consumerism is exactly the film’s purpose. In times of recession and political upheaval like ours, people turn toward what they already know for solace. Remakes like “Footloose” remind audiences that some things never change. The consistency of the film’s lines and character portrayals, when both are dressed in contemporary garb, soothes the film’s audience, at least for two hours. When all is said and done, this escape from the anxiety of our daily lives is the film’s sole attraction. If nothing else, “Footloose” offers us a reminder that pretty people exist and they can still dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The teacher holds his head in his hands. Lisa Cohen, a 17-year-old New York private school student, has cheated on her math test. With crossed legs and folded arms, she nasally claims that it’s not like she would “ever have to use math ever again.” Six hours later, Cohen is cradling the bloody, mangled body of a middle-aged woman in her hands, her snotty persona shattered by the woman’s desperate cries to talk to her daughter in her last moments.
With such a visceral opening gambit to catalyze its story and an able cast, “Margaret” could have proved a masterful coming-of-age film. The performers—Anna Paquin as Lisa Cohen, Matt Damon as her math teacher, Allison Janney as the accident victim, and Mark Ruffalo as the responsible bus driver—play each of their characters with a distinctly human touch. And even though Paquin’s Cohen is not likeable in the least, the actress perfectly animates her role as the daughter of a flaky actress who has been raised in privilege. However, despite these initial advantages, the film falls apart due to noisy editing and an even louder screenplay that together make “Margaret” a plodding, unrelatable mess whose best moments are over after the first promise-filled 15 minutes.
The set-up of “Margaret” is simple and effective. Cohen chases after a moving bus in an attempt to ask the driver where he got his cowboy hat. The driver, thoroughly distracted by Cohen’s waving arms and shouts, runs through a red light and into Monica Patterson (Janney), who spends the next 10 minutes in Cohen’s arms slowly dying from blood loss. Cohen’s crushing guilt for the accident causes her to slowly unravel as she hallucinates “Black Swan” style, complete with blood pouring from imaginary spigots and Patterson haunting her dreams. However, the film seems determined to ignore this main plotline in favor of around 10 other side plots that just serve to make both Cohen and the film similarly unappealing.
In the two and a half hours of “Margaret,” Cohen manages to scream at her mother once every 15 minutes; have three awkward phone calls with her father; lose her virginity to ne’er-do-well Paul (Kieren Culkin); seduce her math teacher; smoke marijuana; get into several heated debates about the right of Palestine to exist; listen to “King Lear;” and go to the opera. On top of all of these extracurricular activities, back in the main storyline Cohen also manages to organize a legal battle against the bus driver, attend Patterson’s funeral, call her family, visit the bus driver, and bond with the best friend of Patterson before screaming at her too.
The sheer busyness of “Margaret” would imply that the film is fast-paced and exciting, stuffed with every single possible element of a contemporary Bildungsroman. However, the construction of each one of these scenes makes each event seem highly annoying or simply boring. When Cohen leaves her math teacher’s house after coercing him to have sex with her, she whines, “Get over it. It was just sex,” before slamming the door. During class time, when Cohen engages in political debates, statements such as “[Arabs] killed 3,000 of our people” just sound like a lazy writer’s way of saying that Cohen is ignorant and looking for someone to blame.
“Margaret” would work as a series of short films, each designed to create a sense of malaise and anguish. However, when these moments are strung together, they become a torturous experience. Lisa Cohen, whose character could have been a great example of disaffected youth, instead becomes a sort of cut-out doll that writer-director Kenneth Lonergan shamefully uses to connect a slew of unrelated concepts that aren’t even novel.There’s little we haven’t seen before, from the teacher who can’t resist his student, to the mother who is too self-absorbed and the father who is distant and distracted, to the girl who can’t deal when real life runs her over.
In the end, by taking this string of character clichés and compounding their painful presence in the film through constant languorous slow-motion cityscape shots and unnecessary opera arias, Lonergan makes “Margaret” a parody of its own genre: an exaggerated portrait of adolescent angst so overwrought as to border on the comical.

Nicolas Cage has yet again managed to hammer another nail into the coffin of his terminally ill movie career, one that has been in freefall since its last success in 2004’s “National Treasure.” Cage’s new film, “Trespass,” is as dull and confusing as his previous hit was exciting and straightforward. The same can sadly be said for his co-star, Nicole Kidman, whose hysterical role is a far cry from her Academy Award–winning appearance in “The Hours.”
Directed by Joel Schumacher, “Trespass” tells the tale of Sarah (Kidman) and Kyle Miller (Cage), an unhappily married, wealthy couple who are held hostage by a group of criminals looking for some money. While the premise is not original, one might hope for a spark of novelty in the way the crisis affects the protagonists’ fragile marriage, perhaps by bringing the formally estranged spouses back together and allowing them to address their issues. But the entire film is an exercise in disappointment, as every avenue for creativity is quickly headed off in favor of hackneyed cliché.
Consider the film’s home invaders. The more we learn about them, the less interesting they become; there is no great reveal that exposes their hitherto hidden motivations—they’re just a group of greedy people. Worse, these criminals are some of the more incompetent and imbecilic miscreants in cinematic history. Through their foibles, they join the ignominious ranks of the laughable thieves of the “Home Alone” franchise—except “Trespass” isn’t meant to be a comedy; it gets there by accident.
The film’s burglars make all the rookie mistakes in the book, from allowing their bound prisoners near enough to knives to cut themselves free, to letting their charges get ahold of guns at various points throughout the movie. The villains even fall into the habit of making long speeches before offing their victims, and thereby conveniently provide their captives with time to escape unnoticed. The best that can be said for this insufferably lackluster excuse for a band of antagonists is that the viewer, too, will surely be rooting for them to be thwarted, if only to get the posse off the screen as soon as possible.
Cage spends most of the movie resisting opening up the family’s safe for no apparent reason. Kidman’s character, for her part, remains illogically devoted to Cage, even as he repeatedly makes the absolute worst decisions one could in such a hostage situation. He continually puts his family’s lives in jeopardy to avoid paying the criminals the relatively paltry sum that they demand. Meanwhile, in a great waste of acting talent, Kidman spends half of the movie crying incoherently and the other half yelling things like, “Not my husband!” and “Please spare my daughter!” Taken in light of her and her husband’s incredibly poor choices throughout, these pleas are plodding rather than moving.
Lack of brain power and poor decision-making appear to run in the Miller family. The couple’s teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) offers a glimmer of intelligence when she uses drugs, a car, and a lighter to free herself and go for help. Yet she subsequently manages to get recaptured—multiple times—in some of the most lunkheaded ways possible.
And it’s not just the Millers whose actions seem to be dictated more by plot expediency than common sense. At one point in the movie, the family manages to activate their home alarm. Of course, when the alarm company calls, the daughter is forced to tell the representative that there is no need to send a police car. The alarm company agent, certainly a nominee for dumbest employee of the month, determines that everything is fine, despite the inordinate pauses and broken sobs transmitting through the receiver.
In what would be a coup for most films, “Trespass” repeatedly manages to put the audience in the shoes of its protagonists. Unfortunately, here this means evoking a sense of being helplessly trapped with no hope of escape. At least viewers are guaranteed their freedom after 90 minutes.

In the distance, two lone figures on horseback ride across a vast expanse of land and sky. The two men are the legendary Butch Cassidy (Sam Shepard), now an old man, and Eduardo Apodaca (Eduardo Noriega), a younger Spanish engineer turned bandit, and the context is “Blackthorn,” the new movie from Spanish director Mateo Gil. The film begins with the premise that Butch Cassidy did not die at the hands of the Bolivian army, but instead lived on under an alias until circumstances provoked his reemergence. It’s an intriguing concept, and “Blackthorn” is a strikingly beautiful execution of it, with pleasant if sometimes terse dialogue and superb acting. Ultimately, though, the film’s moral equivocations betray its own characters, and undermine its otherwise considerable artistic achievement.
“Blackthorn” is not a sequel to “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” the 1969 George Roy Hill film starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Rather, the movie offers a complete retelling of the story of Butch Cassidy, while focusing on the hitherto untold tale of his later life. The story of Cassidy’s journey to Bolivia as a younger man with the Sundance Kid and Etta Place is told throughout the movie via flashbacks. As writer Miguel Barros imagines it, the fabled trio, feeling it was time to depart the U.S., decided to travel to South America. Etta then left the two men—both previous romantic flames—to return home and give birth to a child. Butch survives the shootout with the Bolivian army and after years of quietly breeding horses and messing around with a younger Bolivian woman, decides to go home and see this child, whom he believes is his.
This homecoming serves as a MacGuffin of sorts. The majority of the movie centers upon Butch and his companion Eduardo Apodaca and how their journey impacts their relationship. The two begin as stock characters. Butch, whose alias is James Blackthorn, is the gruff old man who is too old for all this. Eduardo is the young, inexperienced criminal badly in need of guidance. Both Shepard and Noriega are honest and believable in their roles—which grow and complicate as the film progresses—perhaps aided by their respective real-life youthful experiences of riding in rodeos and working on ranches. The two actors complement each other nicely; Blackthorn overflows with sagacious truisms that delightfully toe the line between crusty wisdom and cliché, while Apodaca’s naïve enthusiasm rejuvenates his older companion.
Though not set in the American west, like many classic Westerns “Blackthorn” takes advantage of its natural scenery to great effect. The South American salt flats are perhaps the most unusual location featured in the movie, but only one of its many gorgeous backdrops. The film’s action spans across thickly forested mountains, vast sparsely foliaged deserts, huge dramatic rock formations, and small idyllic Bolivian villages. The wholly foreign nature of these settings adds to the sense of Cassidy’s isolation and increases the audience’s investment in his personal struggles.
Less compelling are the recurring moral motifs throughout the movie. Early on, Shepard’s character clashes with Noriega’s over whether the latter is right to steal purely for personal monetary gain. But this conflict feels forced and untrue to the characters themselves. After all, Cassidy was himself a bank robber, and even with the wisdom of old age, it seems strange for him to have become as stubbornly upright as he ultimately is in “Blackthorn.” Generally, the movie’s moral interplay, which seems oddly ignorant of Cassidy’s past life, comes off as a somewhat dishonest distraction from the film’s storyline and scenery.
Nonetheless, “Blackthorn” is undeniably a good old-fashioned adventure story, one that honors its predecessor, even if it fails to exceed it. And with strong performances, a deft screenplay and engrossing cinematography, the movie stands as a solid work of filmmaking, regardless of whether or not it faithfully adheres to its source material.

“You wanted to destroy me!”
“I wanted to honor you!”
The emotional journey that leads to these heated words between Ruth Steiner and Lisa Morrison is the subject of Donald Margulies’ “Collected Stories.” From the onset, the relationship between Ruth (Bobbie Steinbach), a seasoned writer, and Lisa (Liz Hayes), a graduate student studying under her, is portrayed as one that is constantly evolving. It’s hard to say with absolute certainty whose transformation is more profound: Lisa’s transition from awkward, naïve graduate student to accomplished author or Ruth’s transition from a sarcastic, bad-mannered professor to adopted mother who is capable of feeling scorned by her protégée.
Unfortunately these parallel transformations are not equally compelling; Steinbach’s authoritative performance carries the play, and though she could outshine many skilled actors, she is nonetheless held back by her comparatively underwhelming co-star.
“Collected Stories,” which runs until October 30 in the Charles Mosesian Theater at the Arsenal Center for the Arts, spans the years following Lisa’s first appearance in Ruth’s Greenwich Village apartment. The apartment is the only set used throughout the play, and effectively centers the focus on the interactions between Ruth and Lisa. Its consistency and simplicity is a fixture that makes the change in the characters’ dynamics more evident and striking.
With only one set and two characters, the bulk of the play’s success relies on the strength of the actors’ performances. While Hayes is not without considerable talent, it is only halfway through the play that she seems to hit her stride. Her naïveté at the beginning is conspicuously overplayed and delivered without subtlety. The result is a stale performance that stunts the possibility of a fully developed and moving character.
On the other hand, Bobbie Steinbach’s performance not only dwarfs her co-star’s efforts, it also manages to lend credibility to the production and elicit genuine emotion. While Hayes struggles to embody young Lisa, Steinbach captures Ruth Steiner effortlessly. She nails every nuance and creates mannerisms that are in sync with Steiner as a character. A prime example of Steinbach’s breathtaking skill is a monologue in which she describes her life as a young, aspiring writer and meeting the man of her dreams. She recounts the story while staring off into the distance and fiddling absent-mindedly with a blanket, her voice marked by an astounding and genuine nostalgia.
Tyler Kinney’s costumes serve as visual cues for the changes in the characters’ emotional states. A shift in wardrobe from muted, pastel sweaters (complete with a ridiculous side ponytail) to a tomato-red cocktail dress symbolizes Lisa’s metamorphosis. Although Lisa’s styling at the beginning is overstated, the use of costumes as an allegory for personal change is generally an effective ploy. The decision also helps along Ruth’s character: as she succumbs to an unnamed illness, her clothes gradually show her decay.
As might be expected from such a spare set, lighting also plays an important role, though mainly in the finale. Most of the time Ruth’s apartment is completely lit, but the play ends with the spotlight focused on Ruth, sitting alone at her typewriter. The light slowly dims until all that’s left is the outline of her frail figure.
The ambiguous ending seeks to ask one main question: what stories are yours to tell? Who gives a writer the authority to use other people’s stories? These questions of literary ethics purport to be the play’s main thematic focus. But on stage, “Collected Stories” functions best as a simpler tale of Ruth and Lisa’s fictive kinship.
On that level, director Bridget O’Leary manages to work the set, lighting, costumes, and undeniable chemistry between the two actresses into a true human drama. Despite a rocky beginning, the play’s various aspects coalesce to convey a simple yet powerful message about the complexity of human relationships.

“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” with music and lyrics by William Finn and book by Rachel Sheinkin, is a musical take on a spelling bee and the unique psychologies of its participants. Competing in the bee are six cast members as well as four people picked from the audience to be in the play. This conceit adds a fresh improvisational aspect to the performance.  The characters range from a pressured-to-be-perfect Asian genius who speaks six languages to an archetypical hippie “flower child.”  While the varying quirks of the characters—from likeable Olive, who only wants her parents to love her and give her some attention, to Logainne SchwartzandGrubenierre, a precocious daughter of two gay dads—provide a dose of light-hearted comedy, their greatest appeal is their relatability.
“Besides being super campy and fun and silly, this play is also smart and Harvard students can relate to the characters during their discovery of the implications of the drive for success. There is definitely a dark side to the spelling bee,” says Susanna B. Wolk ’14, who plays Logainne. Mindy Yi ’15, who plays Marcy Park, similarly linked her character and the childhood travails of Harvard students. “She is a perfectionist and everyone expects nothing less than perfect out of her, so she strives to be the best. But in the end she realizes that there are things more important than that.”
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” is its interactivity with the audience. Though the participating audience members will be chosen with their consent when they enter the theater, one “Harvard celebrity”—a House master, professor, or the like—will feature in each show. In keeping with the musical’s tradition of altering the script in each production, the show will also contain a number of Harvard references, and possibly a jab at Yale. Despite what may seem like a postmodern sensibility, director Alexander M. Willis ’14 isn’t seeking to over-innovate. “I want to bring a traditional musical to Harvard. I don’t want to make it avant-garde … [the script is] pretty much what I want it to be,” he says.

In 1635, at the height of the Spanish Golden Age of the arts and nearly four centuries before “Inception,” priest and playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca used the arts to probe the limits of reality and dreams. “Life is a Dream,” his most famous play, is a tragicomic tale, both markedly outmoded and startlingly modern, of honor, revenge, fact, and fiction—at least for Polish Prince Segismundo (Bryan D. Kauder ’14). Imprisoned since birth due to a malicious prophecy, the Prince is drugged and given a brief chance to prove himself worthy of the throne. He is ultimately sent back to prison and made to believe that it was all a dream, but not before throwing Poland into turmoil and engendering a popular revolt. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) will move this play onto the modern stage while preserving the style of the original work—right down to the proper length of the actors’ pauses in dialogue—in its new production.
A few of the social tensions underlying the play, especially the concept of honor, can seem foreign to modern audiences. Calderón may have held similar reservations about it. “In Spain, if someone dishonored you, you were bound to take revenge, but Calderón suggests here that pursuing personal vendettas and this idea that you have to restore your honor is actually self-destructive,” says director and Crimson arts editor Caleb J. Thompson ’14. “Back in the seventeenth century, this was actually very original.” Actor Nancyrose Houston ’15 senses the idea of vindictive honor and social maneuvering in her portrayal of the character Estrella. “I want to be the queen, but at the same time I don’t have a say in anything,” she says.
While the accessibility of the theme of honor may have expired, the supporting concept of the pain of spurned love has stood the test of time.  “At the core, the ideas of unreciprocated love and being slighted by a lover are very relatable,” says actor Darcy C. Donelan ’14. This HRDC production hopes to bring a modern consciousness to the Spanish classic’s original themes of love and honor.

“Death is ... not. Death isn’t. You take my meaning. Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being. You can’t not-be on a boat,” Guildenstern (Eli E. Kahn ’13) asserts after his companion asks if death could be a boat. It is a seemingly foolish question, but in Tom Stoppard’s absurdist and existentialist tragicomedy “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” the titular pair is searching for any explanation for their peculiar state of limbo. The naïve Rosencrantz (Benjamin A. Silva ’14) replies, “I’ve frequently not been on boats.” This exchange is emblematic of the complex tonality of Stoppard’s text, which struggles with the subject of morality in one moment and delves into humorous wordplay in the next. Though Lenora C. Murphy ’12’s production of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” grapples successfully with the challenges of the text, it is undermined by a faltering attempt to infuse the play with a modern aesthetic. Luckily, the production overcomes this weakness due to the winning dynamic between Silva and Kahn.
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” which ran in the Loeb Experimental Theater from October 13 to 15, concerns two minor characters from Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” the titular pair who are never seen apart. The play inverts Shakespeare’s original, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as the lead characters and Hamlet in a minor role. The duo has been summoned to the King’s palace for an unknown purpose and while waiting, they come across a traveling group of players who join them in their journey. Original scenes from “Hamlet” are interwoven with dialogue between the pair as they attempt to discern not only what’s happening around them but also the meaning of life at large. As the play progresses, their fate becomes more apparent until it is undeniable.
Guildenstern reads a letter, at first with a bored tone, expecting Hamlet’s name until he reaches the fatal change, sentencing himself and Rosencrantz to death instead of the prince. Before the impact is registered, The Player (Caroline R. Giuliani ’11) blares at the Tragedians to leave, shouting, “They’ve gone—it’s all over!” The delivery of the statement, intended to underscore the fate of the titular pair, disrupts an essential moment rather than illuminating it and serves as a synecdoche of the production’s most salient flaw. In an attempt to rejuvenate the script with unsubtle modern touches, Murphy allows style to distract from the play’s substance.
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” is typically compared to Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” for multiple reasons, but one in particular presents a stumbling block for directors: the potential for tedium as the duos await their fates. However, in adroit hands, the waiting engenders dramatic tension instead. The impulse to enliven the script with a hipster aesthetic, a nonsensical array of props, and a merry group of players that are more distracting than compelling is an understandable reaction to the text’s potential pitfalls, but the effort is misguided.
The players are clothed in plaid shirts, black skinny jeans, and Converse. When they portray one of the major characters from “Hamlet,” they wear ludicrous, period costumes over their clothes, as though they are children playing dress up. However, this costume choice feels more scattered than original, as if the players are drawn from multiple productions of “Hamlet.” Similar problems beset the stage design: eclectic props are strewn across the set, including a shopping cart filled with mannequin parts and streamers. Disembodied mannequin parts would be disturbing if they were actually utilized in the production. Instead, they are merely one of a bizarre and apparently meaningless array of props.
Silva and Kahn’s strengths are manifested in their ability to negotiate the fluidity of identity within the play and still portray individualized characters. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern frequently call each other by the wrong name or forget their own, but remain grounded in their own characters. Silva’s Rosencrantz is filled with brisk energy and manages to be childish but not cloying. He runs back and forth across the length of the stage, demonstrating a sense of claustrophobia more deftly than the set design. Silva functions nimbly in Stoppard’s self-conscious theatricality, able to switch quickly  from acknowledging the audience to bemoaning the pair’s isolation. Kahn shines as the more intellectual of the pair. He can articulate the intricate hypotheticals and wordplay of Stoppard’s text with an admirable fluency. However, he is more than a scholar; Kahn has the depth to comfort a fearful Rosencrantz with an embrace in one moment and, with measured menace in his tone, threaten Giuliani’s flippant Player in the next.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s identities are interchangeable not due to similarity in character but due to seamless interaction, a credit to both actors and director. Silva and Kahn act in concert; their dialogue is a steady rapport. Their chemistry is apparent in their gestures—frequent embraces, even spooning in their sleep—and their facial expressions. To say that their intimacy is a gay take on the characters would be an oversimplification. Instead, Kahn’s Guildenstern and Silva’s Rosencrantz appear to rely on each other. Though the crucial sense of foreboding arrives too late and too rarely due to the distraction of the players, when the tone makes its essential shift, the actions of Kahn and Silva towards each other engender a genuine response.

This past Saturday wasn’t just a day for book lovers; it was a day for everyone involved in writing, from avid fans to struggling writers. The third annual Boston Book Festival brought together a diverse community of bibliophiles, local writers, and publishers to showcase the thriving world of the written word and its continued influence on the fabric of Boston’s art scene.
Many different parts of the literary community—from fans waiting in line to get their books signed by their favorite author to the small New England Science Fiction Association publishing house trying to bring classics to a new generation—gathered in Copley Square in downtown Boston to find their passion. What distinguished this event from others of its kind was its interaction with the community; various panels, which ranged from discussions with authors on different topics in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry to readings by local poets and students from the Berklee College of Music, created an intimate connection between author and reader. The festival reflected both the intellectual curiosity and the deep-seated literary affection of the Boston public.
In the middle of the row of publishers’ tents sat the table for the Writers’ Room of Boston, a studio for writers to come and focus on their craft, showcasing a preserved old typewriter with an almost nonexistent ribbon sitting on a pedestal in front. Above it was a sign reading, “Come add a sentence or two to the story.” Throughout the day, people wandered by, stopped, and added their own part to the narrative. Yet it wasn’t just adults who were punching the keys; kids, from toddlers to teenagers, were drawn to the booth to interact with a piece of literary history. Maureen E. Rogers of the Writers’ Room said that the people at the festival fell into two distinct categories. “Are you a writer or a reader?” she asked. “Because that’s really why you’re here.” These participants were united by their communal admiration of literature. Despite the sudden downpours that interspersed the eight-hour day, fans endured, staying to listen to published authors and to expose themselves to local book vendors.
The Boston Book Festival also served as a way for lesser-known companies to introduce themselves into a vibrant market. Tom J. Devlin, creative director for Montreal-based publisher Drawn & Quarterly, said that the audience was often not familiar with the graphic novels his company produces. “We definitely have to explain what we do more than [at] a comic convention.” Small magazine publishers were also in attendance vying to grab some of the attention of passersby. “Your local base is your first base,” said Daniel E. Pritchard, marketing and promotions manager for the Boston Review, a local magazine. While the Boston Review draws on the local academic community in the greater Boston area, Pritchard said it is harder to maintain their unique flair now that most of the publishing world has left Boston. “We’re one of the last,” he said, in reference to his magazine’s dedication to both political and economic commentary and literary publication. According to him, other periodicals have strayed from their original intentions as they move away from Boston. “Magazines like The Atlantic lost some of that local perspective when they moved to Washington, D.C.,” he said.
The majority of mainstream publishers have quit Boston, leaving a dearth of major muscle in that arena in Boston by relocating to New York City to join companies like Random House and Harper Collins. This transition from original Boston headquarters along with The New York Times’ acquisition of the Boston Globe in 1993 indicate that publishing renown has shifted recently from Boston to New York City.
The focus of Saturday’s festival was not on such prominent booksellers, however; most of the publishers that arrived to sell their works were small, local companies. St. Johann Press—whose display comprised primarily of baseball literature on the Boston Red Sox—and David R. Godine, Publisher were two such participants. According to Godine’s representative at the festival, Carrie A. Dieringer, these businesses are getting increasingly rare. “Godine is one of the only independent trade publishers left in Boston. While there used to be a larger trade publishing market in Boston, today almost all publishing takes place in New York City and there are only a few publishers left in Boston that aren’t educational publishers like Houghton Mifflin.”
Despite all of the challenges that Boston faces, these same independent publishers have said that this was one of the best book festivals in Boston. “I wish there were more things like this,” said Pritchard, while Devlin cited the consistently large crowds as one of the festival’s successes. In the few years since its inception, the Boston Book Festival has grown tremendously, and hopefully that same trend will continue, inspiring children and reminding adults what made them fall in love with literature in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jon McLaughlin hasn’t always been so successful at drawing a crowd.
The first time the pop rock singer-songwriter came to Cambridge was to play a set at the All Asia Bar in 2005. “We played for 30 minutes. No one was there. We packed up and left,” he said.
During his most recent visit to Cambridge on Thursday, though, students filled every seat in the Lowell House Junior Common Room to listen to him speak. McLaughlin’s visit was the first in a new series of programs called “Conversations with Harvard,” a university-wide expansion of the former house program Conversations with Kirkland.
McLaughlin has come quite a long way in six years, from playing empty venues to playing the Oscars. He has released three albums and performed songs written by Alan Menken and Steven Schwartz for the Disney film “Enchanted.” McLaughlin has also collaborated and toured with a constellation of stars, including Sara Bareilles, Demi Lovato, Jason Mraz, O.A.R., and Kelly Clarkson.
Like so many singer-songwriters, McLaughlin had humble beginnings. While an undergraduate at Anderson University in Indiana, he and his bandmates would go to classes during the week and travel to different towns to perform on the weekends.
However, McLaughlin insists that it wasn’t the consistent touring that launched his career as a recording artist. “I wouldn’t have gotten signed without Myspace,” he said. He contends that it was his significant online presence that eventually got him noticed by Island Records, a subdivision of Universal Music Group.
After getting signed by Island in 2006, though, McLaughlin began to realize that recording professionally required him to make concessions he never thought he would have to make. Responding to a question from an audience member about whether his songwriting changed after signing, he said, “You quickly get thrown into the factory that is a major pop label.” According to him, Island put its profits first when it considered what songs to include on an album and what songs to throw out. For McLaughlin, who chooses to record the songs that he feels express his emotions best, this was difficult to accept. “When [my songs] get tossed aside, that’s really tough,” he said.
Despite these grievances, McLaughlin stayed with Island Records long enough to produce two albums: “Indiana” in 2007 and “OK Now” in 2008. By the time “OK Now” was released, though, McLaughlin had had enough of recording with a major label. Half of the tracks on “OK Now,” McLaughlin said, represented the kind of heartfelt music he wanted to be writing, but “the other half, quite frankly, was—songs.” So he left Island and in September of this year released “Forever If Ever” independently.
After discussing his time in the recording industry, McLaughlin shifted to talking about his songwriting process. “You can’t write songs when you’re happy,” he said, only half joking. “I need to be depressed or really angry.” This approach manifests itself in his emotionally charged lyrics. One of his most famous songs, “Indiana,” was written while he was homesick and disillusioned in Los Angeles. “So it’s probably best I stay in Indiana, / Just dreaming of the world as it should be, / Where every day is a battle to convince myself / I’m glad she never fell in love with me,” he sings.
Near the end, the intimate talk in Lowell JCR developed into an intimate performance. To the delight of the audience, he sat down at the grand piano and played “I’ll Follow You,” an uncharacteristically lighthearted love song from “Forever If Ever.” His classical piano training was evident in the song’s intricate melodies and rich chords, and his voice was just as clear and mellifluous as a pop singer’s should be. The engrossed students recorded his performance on their phones and closed their eyes in contentment as the music filled the room.
“I think it went extraordinarily well,” said Peter V. Emerson, the creator of Conversations with Kirkland. His goal for the new program is to attract a wider audience for speakers he plans to invite in the future, as well as to allow for more flexibility in scheduling. Additionally, said Emerson, “A more diverse audience will benefit the guest as well.” And Conversations with Harvard, he says, will encourage undergraduate participation in producing the events; by the end of Thursday’s talk, five students had already volunteered to lend their time to the new program.
Student attendees were clearly enthusiastic about both Conversations with Harvard and McLaughlin himself. Kristina F. Latino ’13 had been a fan of McLaughlin for a few years, since her a cappella group The Harvard Callbacks performed one of his songs. “I loved the intimacy,” she said. “You always have these questions you want to ask of entertainers, and this really provided an avenue to ask those.”
“I got a really great impression of [McLaughlin],” added Kayci E. Baldwin ’14, also a member of the a cappella group. “He really stayed true to himself.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: OCT. 24, 2011
The Oct. 18 article "Jon McLaughlin On the Recording Industry" identified Peter V. Emerson, the founder of Conversations at Harvard, as a resident tutor at Kirkland House. He has never been a resident tutor nor does he live at Kirkland House.

While most Harvard freshmen were busy getting their driver’s permits, Riley K. Carney ’15 was writing her first novel. While they were getting their driver’s licenses, Carney was getting her first novel published. And now as they try desperately to balance college social and academic life, Carney has to do that too—as well as run a charity and continue writing her fantasy book series.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve been writing seriously from a very young age—why did you pursue this art?
Riley K. Carney: I write because I love to write. It is pretty much like breathing for me. If I do not write, I start to go a little crazy. So it is almost out of necessity.
THC: Three of your books have already been published; can you tell us about your book series?
RKC: I have written a five-book series—a fantasy-adventure series for kids, ages 8–14 or older. It is called the “Reign of the Elements” series. The first book is “The Fire Stone.”
THC: Could you describe your writing process?
RKC: [The process] depends on what I am writing. With this series, I was creating a whole new world so I spent some time creating imaginary creatures, magic, things like that. If a piece takes a lot of research, I may focus less on the aspects of important to writing fiction—it really just depends on the story. I try to include enough [detail] to make my writing believable. You want to make sure that you have everything covered, but not too much to bog down the story.
THC: Do you like to read or write more?
RKC: That is a hard one. I am a writer because I started out as a reader and I fell in love with the whole idea of [creating] stories. Reading was my first love. Writing was just an extension—I wanted to create my own stories.
THC: Does writing offer you something you cannot get anywhere else?
RKC: It offers an escape. When I am writing a story, I get lost in this other world. It is like those secret adventures that you have always wanted to have, whether you are an adult or a kid. To be able to actually create whatever your imagination wants to—I really love that.
THC: Who inspires you?
RKC: My mom is my biggest inspiration—she is amazing. She has always encouraged me to write and she has been so supportive. As a writer, many people inspire me—but J.K. Rowling is especially fantastic. T.A. Barron was also an author that I read growing up who has been a big influence on me.
THC: Is there a book that has changed your life?
RKC: There are so many, but growing up “Harry Potter” [made me think,] “Wow, this is what you can do with a book.” More recently ,there is a book called “The Book Thief” [by Marcus Zusak] which is fantastic. It has an amazing use of language that I think is really rare.
THC: When you were fourteen, you created a nonprofit called “Breaking the Chain” to promote children’s literacy that provides books for schools in the United States and helps build schools abroad. What inspired this charity?
RKC: Well, the goal of the organization is to spread literacy and make the opportunity of education available to every kid. Growing up, reading had a huge impact on my life. There are so many opportunities that education opens up for you and I had never really considered life without it. To think that there are so many children who ... don’t even have access to books at school, who have never owned a book before—that really struck a chord with me. Two-thirds of kids who do not know how to read by the end of fourth grade will end up in jail or on welfare. There is an enormous need. All of those things motivate me to keep the nonprofit going.
THC: If you were on a deserted island, what three books would you like to have with you?
RKC: I would definitely say a Harry Potter book—probably the seventh one. “Pillars of the Earth” [by Ken Follett] is a great book. It would keep me busy for a while. Third, I don’t know… a survival guide.
THC: What is your favorite word?
RKC: I love this question! Don’t     ask me why. I just like the way it sounds: dastardly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO) opened its 204th season with a dynamic and highly energized symphonic journey. The HRO began the evening by presenting a contemporary piece from Peter Lieberson’s 2005 “Neruda Songs,” five works set to poems by Pablo Neruda, before traveling back in time with excerpts from Richard Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” and Ludwig van Beethoven’s entire “Symphony No. 7” in A major, Op. 92.
Led by Music Director Federico Cortese, the HRO first featured mezzo-soprano Sofia M. Selowsky ’12 in “Amor mio, si muero y tu no mueres,” an excerpt from “Neruda Songs.” The song cycle was written as a musical gift for Lieberson’s wife, Lorraine, who was ill with breast cancer when Lieberson began to compose them for her. Selowsky delivered an impeccable performance of the same solos Lorraine Lieberson herself performed in the premiere of the work; her voice filled Sanders Theatre with a dark melody of love and grief. Her powerful vocals hovered near the brink of overpowering the orchestra, though Cortese masterfully maintained a balance by developing a thoughtful, introspective flair in the musical accompaniment. Lieberson’s composition is strikingly free-spirited: each instrument slid out and seamlessly slipped back into the piece as the orchestra developed a layered and haunting tune to open the evening.
In a deft display of versatility, the HRO then transitioned from Lieberson’s modern work into the prelude and “Liebestod” from Richard Wagner’s 1860 opera “Tristan und Isolde.” Assistant conductor Matthew A. Aucoin ’12 led the orchestra through this piece with a subtly articulate and detail-oriented style quite distinct from Cortese’s own. While Cortese held a sweeping vision of the orchestra’s dynamics and phrasing, Aucoin attentively highlighted the nuances of each instrument, bringing a new range of colors to the orchestra’s sound—though, of course, their respective pieces themselves called for quite different approaches.
The closing piece, “Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7,” again directed by Cortese, is undoubtedly the most well known of the three. The orchestra vigorously tackled this difficult and exciting piece; the evening transformed from a more intimate, reflective showcase to an enthusiastic performance of scintillating vibrance appropriate for a symphony that Aucoin described in the program notes as a “fundamentally public piece.” Only a few blurry moments of transition between strings and woodwinds weakened the first and third movements; otherwise, the orchestra maintained a technical prowess that highlighted the intricate rhythms of the symphony.
The orchestra generated momentum with a rousing grand climax in the fourth movement. It was a triumphant and fitting end to a concert that began its musical journey in the 21st century and harked back to Beethoven’s finest years in the 19th, an era that inspired both Wagner, Lieberson, and undoubtedly the HRO itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather’s Chamber Music Program seeks to teach students the fundamentals of chamber music. As with all classical forms, part of this training is technical: a professional musician from the Boston area serves as a coach. However, Mather also offers teambuilding activities, largely geared at understanding musician body language, as a key part of learning the art of chamber music. How can group dynamics training improve the quality of music written hundreds of years ago?
For Na’Ama Lion, tutor and director of the Mather House Chamber Music Program, these unconventional forms of practice are necessary for the mutual dependence in chamber groups. “Sometimes groups will practice without music, using clapping exercises to practice taking turns to lead [the melody, as in performance],” she says. Some groups have gone as far as sitting in circles, facing away from each other, and practicing cues. “They can actually sense when each other is going to start [or respond to the cue].”
While orchestras and other large music groups enable individuals to be a part of a powerful, unified soundscape, in them only solos give individual musicians free reign of expression. Chamber music is a unique combination of both: it allows a musician to play with peers without sacrificing a personal interpretation of the piece. These aspects together create intimate dynamics of musical expression not possible in solos and large ensembles.
CHAMBER CLAUS
“It’s a beautiful thing,” says musician Daniel Stepner. “When four people come together because they’re inspired by a piece of music, even if there are differences in levels of accomplishment, there’s a special focus to it.” The disparate talents of each musician come together to create a variegated and interpretive whole.
Stepner is a world-renowned musician who has performed and recorded as concertmaster in a number of orchestras, such as the Boston Baroque, as well as in chamber music groups. Currently, he’s the first violinist of the Lydian String Quartet at Brandeis University and a preceptor in music at Harvard who teaches Music 187r: “Chamber Music Performance.” We’re talking in the office he shares with Dwight P. Robinson, Jr. Music Professor Robert D. Levin, surrounded by stacks of sheet music, a clock with a face adorned with musical notes, and a grand piano. Stepner’s white beard, friendly eyes, and round spectacles are unmistakably Santa-esque.
His passion for chamber music, which is for many the most democratic and inclusive form of classical music, fits well with his St. Nick appearance. “It’s a medium between playing as a soloist and a subordinate role in a large ensemble,” he says. The musician gets the best of a large group’s power and the creativity present in any solo.
SELF-CONDUCTING
Chamber music, a formally unique kind of classical music, was first popularized in the 1600s as a way for groups of 10 or fewer musicians to play together intimately. Groups can be composed of various different instruments but typically include piano, string instruments, flute, and bassoon. Common ensembles include string quartets (two violins, viola, and cello), piano trios, and instrumental duos.
The primary difference between chamber music and other classical forms is the lack of a conductor. Unlike the orchestral setup, in which a single person controls the group’s musical interpretation, chamber music groups are self-directed. They rely on each other’s understanding of the entire piece and on spontaneous coordination with other members.
Ryan A. Murphy ’14, who is enrolled in the Harvard/New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) Joint Program, tells me about the student experience of playing and training in chamber groups. His bright, blue eyes light up as he speaks.
“Chamber music is great because it requires active participation and collaboration between individual musicians in order to make successful performances and interpretations,” says Murphy. Active participation is not only facilitated but also necessitated by the lack of a conductor. Thus, the horizontal relationships intrinsic to chamber music are part of what Murphy appreciates about the form.
This difference also makes chamber music risky. “With that many people, something might go wrong,” he says. “There is just so much diversity in individual interpretation.” Individual interpretation has to be coordinated to create a coherent overall sound. In ensembles, members need to stay synchronized with each other; the larger the ensemble, the more difficult it is to play cohesively.
TEAM GAME
Cohesion comes easily with a conductor. And in large ensembles, like orchestras, the conductor is necessary to unite many diverse timbres into a single voice. “The intimate collaboration [experienced in chamber music] is impossible between individuals in a full-sized orchestra, which is why the conductor is there: to keep everyone together and provide them with musical direction,” Murphy says.
Although it allows musicians to be part of a powerful voice, playing in an orchestra has its cost: musicians may feel that they are submitting to a kind of anonymity, even a loss of individual expression in the music they’re playing.
“In orchestras, everyone’s important, but it is almost total submission to the orchestra conductor. It’s not that you don’t contribute to it but no one person shines, except in solos,” Murphy says. “For the most part, everyone contributes to a single interpretation.”
The authoritarian role of the conductor in large-scale orchestras may be mitigated by the input from musicians on the interpretation of choice, but the leader has ultimate control. “I mean, it’s a wonderful thing, playing in an orchestra, but it’s a bit of a dictatorial situation. It’s so centralized,” says Stepner.
Chamber music, on the other hand, “is like a democracy … It’s up to the group to decide what nuances and depths to play the music.” says Lion. Classical music tends to be the strange example of an art that does not put a premium on individual creative expression—the goal is just to stick to the conductor’s interpretation of the piece. In large orchestras, interpretive credit goes to the conductor and the musicians just try to be faithful to the material at hand. Chamber music enlivens the material for musicians seeking their own take on a given work.
The final product of chamber music done right requires a dynamic balance between the thoughts of each musician. “You really have to have a strong, cohesive interpretation and a sense of the group … That’s one of the reasons why you don’t play with a leader because you are really collaborating equally with other musicians,” says Murphy. Because each team member takes responsibility of the group’s success, each individual shares the role of the leader.
By fostering a team environment, chamber music groups develop a unified vision while maintaining individual dynamics. Lion calls this product “a conversation through music.” It is largely unplanned, then, and constantly evolving.
SEEING THE WHOLE
By playing in chamber music groups, musicians have the opportunity to hone their musical intuition and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the music. “In a quartet … [you have] to have a really good understanding of what’s going on in all four parts of the music,” says Murphy. The musician becomes acquainted with the piece as a whole.
In that process, each musician comes away with their own understanding. “For every one feature [in a piece], there are possibly 20 ways to interpret it. So, one person’s interpretation isn’t necessarily the same as another’s,” says Stepner. “One of the challenges and joys of chamber music is balancing negotiating and assertiveness. It’s about sacrifice, but it’s also about fun.”
This openness is evident in both performance and practice. “In class, students will make suggestions as to how to play a certain part,” says Stepner. “Sometimes I make snap judgements, but then we try it out—on principle, I try everything out—and often it works and we include it in the performance.” Collaboration leads to experimentation. Greater musical comprehension and more creative freedom make chamber music a particularly valuable learning experience at the student level.
MODERN SPIRIT
It’s appropriate to the point of its form that chamber music generates a sense of community. Jennifer Huang, President of the Harvard Law School (HLS) Chamber Music Society, claims that chamber music creates an especially emotional experience for players. The HLS Chamber Music Society has 14 active chamber music groups that Huang organizes herself. She shows me the spreadsheet of all the members with details like instruments each musician plays and his or her previous experience. “We collaborate with the Medical School and Business School chamber music societies with charity events as well,” she says. “After all, it’s called the ‘music of friends’.”
This social aspect can be as important as the musical end result. “A lot of people would say that chamber music is the most fun part about being a musician,” Murphy says. “Through how [other musicians] play the music, you can get to know more about them as people.”
Stepner has also observed how chamber music can bring musicians together. “A lot of the time, student [musicians] will somehow find each other and form ad hoc music groups. There’s a real community of musicians here. It’s really quite fascinating.”
What makes chamber music different is not simply an aesthetic component, then, but a social one as well. It is this singular meshing of social equality and aesthetic freedom that draws students and professors to this kind of classical music. It is the modern spirit of one the West’s oldest and most hallowed arts.

With their sophomore album “Days,” the New Jersey quartet Real Estate proves that there’s more to the Jersey shore than bad television. Over the course of 10 tracks, the album succeeds in channeling classic surf-pop sounds while imbuing the intimacy of lo-fi hum with a more expansive psychedelic rock sensibility. Though the band stays true to the relaxed ambiance of their earlier work, they have undoubtedly developed a more refined sound than that of their eponymous debut LP, and they successfully add a more mature element of nostalgia for baked skin and windswept sand. The result is a lovely and cohesive album that straddles the reality of today and the dream-state of summer’s yesterday.
Within the first several tracks, it is clear that although the album has a higher production value, its sound is still based in the woozy guitar chords and hazy vocals that constituted the first album’s garage rock aesthetic. Album opener “Easy” is a signature Real Estate track, warm and hassle-free with melancholic lyrics placed against the backdrop of feel-good guitar strumming. It subtly transitions into one of the album’s most beautiful tracks, “Green Aisles,” in which lead singer Martin Courtney yearns for the days of youthful innocence and ignorant bliss: “All those wasted miles / All those aimless drives through green aisles / Our careless lifestyle / It was not so unwise.”
The ease with which one track coasts into the next is driven by the band’s consistent ability to layer and loop discernible guitar chords and melodies. Rather than inducing boredom, the repetition in instrumental track “Kinder Blumen” sways with comfort like a rocking hammock, and effectively conveys the album’s pervasive wistfulness. In under four minutes, any perception of the song’s beginning or end is lost in the music itself, and the production allows the recurring riffs to exemplify the sort of summer transience that makes the calendar days pass in a blink of an eye.
The soothing ebb and flow of “Days” is also evident in tracks such as “Younger than Yesterday” and “Three Blocks.” With Courtney slipping his “oohs” and “ohs” subtly into the supporting instrumentals, the former track quickly becomes a trance of heartwarming oscillations. On “Three Blocks,” he blends lyrics such as “Things won’t be like they were before” with the intimate susurration of mellowed guitars and soft drumming. Throughout the album, he uses his suggestively thin voice as more of an impressionistic element than a driving force.
Nevertheless, despite its nature as an atmospheric album awash with the haze of summer daydream, “Days” also marks the band’s move into catchier pop. “It’s Real” glides right through its two minutes and 48 seconds with surprisingly bright vocals and upbeat tempo—the jam has just enough clarity and splash to make it an excellent first single. Perfect windows-down driving music, it is both catchy on its own and structurally significant because it provides dynamic shift from the laid-back songs.
The lackadaisical quality of somnolent pop often has the danger of becoming lazy and emotionally stagnant, as demonstrated by the album’s few weak tracks, “Wonder Years” and “Out of Tune.” Falling victim to flat melodies and generic lyrics, both songs lack the charming element of surprise present in most of the songs’ chiming chords.
Nevertheless, even on the album’s longest and most repetitive track, “All the Same,” Real Estate manages to counteract their steady lightheartedness with enough sentimental punch to keep listeners engaged. Courtney’s voice fuses right into the track with “Oh when you came back from the sea / It’s true, you brought a melody,” in reference to the band’s own playful inspirations and musical goals. The vocals eventually fade as the instrumentals slow, the song growing more tranquil until a final pluck of guitar string is sent drifting off into the horizon. Even then though, the beauty of the song lingers as Real Estate shows that their music’s strength is in their ability to evoke the sensation of undirected, emotionally-charged remembrance.

It sometimes seems like DJ Shadow is striving for mediocrity. DJ Shadow, legally known as Josh Davis, has come a long way since his popular debut LP,  “Endtroducing......” Unfortunately, his trajectory has been a steady downward slope. Shadow’s newest album, “The Less You Know, the Better,” is somewhat lacking. The album was publicized as totally different from his previous work. “The Less You Know, the Better” purportedly received its name from a moment when Shadow was forced to watch CNN and Fox news while waiting in an airport, and was struck by the arbitrary nature of the information the media feeds us. Nonetheless, “The Better” is missing the originality and innovation that made Shadow’s first album a success in the ’90s that was enough to put his then label Mo’ Wax among the big names of innovative hip-hop labels. Instead, Shadow’s latest is an obnoxious album that delivers such a painfully clichéd message—albeit over decently sampled music—that it seems almost as offensive as the news programs that partially prompted it.
The first half of the album is perhaps best-suited to musical periphery—background music during a party, for instance. The smooth twang of funk guitar found on “Enemy Lines” is so unexpectedly soothing that its atmosphere is that of a druggy ’60s torch song. The problem is that by a certain point, the music becomes too repetitive to hold interest effectively. In the same respect, “Tedium” stays true to its title, and is so tedious that the song might be missed entirely when listening to the album as a whole; in fact, the prominent percussive sounds reminiscent of garbage cans and clanging kitchenware are so offensive as to invite disengagement.
Even the more pleasant aspects of whatever trance “Enemy Lines” and “Tedium” elicited is broken by “Give Me Back the Nights,” the lyrical poverty of which almost obscures the total lack of melodic merit. “Give me back the nights” is spoken over and over by a tense and increasingly aggressive narrator until he finally explodes into a screaming refrain of “the nights / The nights.” His shouts are supported by the computerized sounds of what sounds like the early theme music of the “Tron” arcade game, but even the music cannot distract from Shadow’s pervasive embarrassingly explicit angst or his blunt lyrics.
The one gem of the album, “Sad and Lonely,” is perhaps good enough to mitigate the disappointment accrued throughout the rest. The simplicity of the three-chord piano progression bathed in the sound of crackling vinyl, and paired with the soft ’60s pop female vocals crooning, “I’m sad and I’m lonely” is endearing and tender. The track is unlike any of the others in that it lacks male vocals, discernible drum-beats, and total emotional inaccessibility. However, Shadow’s decision to revisit “Sad and Lonely” in “(Not so) Sad and Lonely,” which is essentially the same track without vocals, is questionable at best.
If “Endtroducing.....” was the peak of DJ Shadow’s career, then “The Less You Know the Better” is a little more than halfway down the slope. Where his debut was about Davis finding himself as DJ Shadow and introducing his uniquely blended, sample-heavy music into the hip-hop industry, “The Less You Know, the Better” is Shadow’s semi-convincing, unoriginal struggle with media superficiality. With all the initial cleverness and spirit that drew listeners to him dissipated, little remains of interest here beyond a half-baked yet somehow overdone idea of resistance to mass media culture. Ironically, Shadow seems to have partially become a purveyor of what he so loathes.

The hazy-nostalgic sound of many recent indie-pop bands has hardly ever been more explicitly acknowledged than in the title of M83’s new two-disc album, “Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming.” The album is a mature addition to M83’s storied discography. In an interview in Spin Magazine, lead singer Anthony Gonzalez said the album is “mainly about dreams, how every one is different, how you dream differently when you’re a kid, a teenager, or an adult.” Artistically, the album is an articulate expression of dream in sound. At times, however, the album’s excessive length serves only to accommodate long and indulgent ambient sections that disrupt the otherwise coherent sequencing.
”Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming” is structured around a chronological approach to a person’s dreams over the course of his or her life. The album starts by describing children’s dreams through fanciful sound. One of the highlights of this collection is “Raconte-Moi Une Histiore.” The sharp claps guide the light-hearted synth into deeper basslines and then seraphic ambiance while a child’s thin voice delivers an endearing monologue about a magical forest frog. Yet the album’s introductory section is not particularly consistent. The very next track, “Train to Pluton,” is completely electronic and slows the pace of the album. This is the sort of song that would have been deemed unnecessary for inclusion on a one-disc album, and it serves little purpose conceptually or musically.
The album builds in momentum over its evocation of adolescent dreams. “OK Pal” is the most distinctive song of the sequence. The track is catchy, and reminiscent of Phil Collins’s production. It’s steeped in the exuberance of a storybook, adolescent relationship, and features a female monologue about the nervous anticipation leading up to her first kiss. “Splendor,” another gem of the album, conveys both the excitement of going away from home and the ominous feeling of striking out into the unknown. “Another Wave From You” is an example of the better purely electronic tracks. Its surrealism is well positioned, as it builds engaging tension during the midsection of the album.  But “Year One, One UFO,” another electronic track, seems out of place. Its fast pace, heavy drums, and folk transitions give the sense that M83 is artificially diversifying the sound of an album that is beginning to sound lengthy and unfocused.
When properly focused, though, it is this very eclecticism that makes the album. The later sections are a full transformation of tone  which exhibit M83’s incredibly flexible style. “Steve McQueen” is a beautiful track, and even features brief hip-hop arpeggios. Where other tracks were hopeful, forward-looking, and wistful, “McQueen” speaks to perseverance and strength. It is the practical dream of a father who longs to provide for his family. “Klaus I Love You,” the penultimate song of the album, is a peek at dreams to come. The track is one of the album’s best, but its location on the album is indicative of some of the larger issues with “Dreaming.” Through the last songs, M83 affects jarring transitions from the more serious numbers back to their earlier, light-hearted pop sound, and these missteps replicate in miniature the album’s issues of overwhelming, indulgent breadth.
“Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming” is a strong album with excessive frills. While at times it feels like it loses focus or could have been cut down, it offers a compelling account of dream in sound. In the midst of an ambitious artistic vision M83 stays true to pop music with a number of simple earworms. Though the album’s ambitious aims are well-intended, its length and catch-all approach to genre are ultimately more hindrances to the better parts of the record than they are high-concept artistic choices.

Amid the shouts and sirens that hang in the air of Dewey Square in downtown Boston, the occasional hesitant “Check, check, one, two” resonates throughout the tents and booths that were erected at the beginning of October. Almost every day, amateur and professional musicians have been performing at the informal stage on the square for camped-out protestors, pedestrians on their way to work, and passersby who simply take a moment to stop and listen.
Music might not be the first thing one associates with the Occupy Boston movement, a protest inspired by the ongoing Occupy Wall Street demonstration against corporate greed and income inequality. But music has become both a unifying factor and an inspiration for demonstrators from every background imaginable, and has been used to call attention to issues ranging from union rights to the wars in the Middle East.
“We have lots of different people from lots of different diverse communities that come down during the week, and what I’ve seen is that [music] lifts spirits and makes people happy. Music is music,” says entertainment organizer Kelley P., who wishes to keep her last name private. “It’s something that we can all relate to, vibrationally at least.”
The diversity of the demonstrators themselves is reflected in the assortment of genres represented by performers requesting a time slot. “I’ve got everything from international African drumming, classical acts, jazz, rock, acoustic, Americana to country,” says Kelley. “The diversity is huge.”
So is the demand for a performance time slot: local, regional and national groups have been bombarding organizers with requests to book the stage, especially in the past week. With its large built-in crowd, heavy media attention, and plethora of issues to which the performers can speak, the event offers an ideal spot for a show. However, those organizers are only encouraged by the increase in demand.
“[Music] boosts morale and builds community, especially on rainy days,” media representative Philip J. Anderson says. “Music is just one of those things that can galvanize movements—especially with songs that everyone knows and can connect with.” The sentiment is evocative of the ethos behind various civil rights movements of the ’60s, many of which found a voice and ally in the musical figureheads of the time. Kelley finds a distinct parallel between Occupy Boston and important protests and movements of the past. “Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Simon and Garfunkel—a lot of these artists had a lot of great things to say during the events that came before us,” muses Kelley. Though the times have changed, many musicians’ desires to perform for a movement they believe in have not.
“[Performers] are fighting for the same causes and the same rights that we are. It’s not as easy for a band to get nationally signed to a worldwide record deal anymore. The music industry has changed so dramatically and a lot of these artists struggle with their art and their music,” she adds. “They write songs about situations like these and they’re there [at Occupy Boston] because they are part of the 99 percent.”
Kelley has already heard four songs written for and about Occupy Boston, while demonstrator Barry A. Knight agrees that protesters may be inspired to contribute creatively to the protests. “I’d love to see some new music come out of this. People have been writing their own songs here, even if I haven’t seen them yet,” says Knight. “I’m not a musician as such, but I can write. I might write a couple of tunes while I’m here.”
Indeed, the relationship between the movement and the live performers seems to be a reciprocal one. While both established and amateur performers have been stimulated to produce new material, the music they perform deeply inspires the demonstrators who constitute a significant portion of their audience. Knight, who has been at Occupy Boston for over a week, was particularly uplifted by a female singer accompanied by acoustic guitarist.
“I am not an emotional person by any stretch of imagination, but listening to that woman play, and remembering what this whole thing is about, I actually shed a tear,” says Knight. The emotional power wielded by performers is made even more impressive by the spartan stage set-up, which consists solely of a limited PA system and two microphones.
That performances still go on consistently shows that demonstrators at Occupy Boston find value not in light shows or in heavy production, but in the messages that live musical acts spread, as well as the sense of community bolstered by musicians who are as much a part of the 99 percent as the protestors are. As the range of issues raised by the group expands, one thing will remain static: the stage in Dewey Square, where performers and protestors maintain a connection just as significant as the ongoing chants in Boston and around the world.

Zombies are never subtle plot devices. There is a reason they have been confined so long to the realm of B-list horror: they are a particularly heavy-handed way to convey the sheer terror of losing one’s humanity. In his new novel “Zone One,” the celebrated A. Colson Whitehead ’91 drags zombies out of genre fiction and into high literature—with disastrous results.
At the novel’s beginning, a zombie plague has thrown Manhattan into chaos and uprooted society at its very core. In the past few years, small bands of survivors, allying themselves with ramshackle militias or hiding in the countryside, have tried to cope and rebuild civilization in the wake of the epidemic. A fledgling government in Buffalo, having made great strides in rebuilding upstate New York, attempts to reclaim New York City from the chaos. They send clean-up teams to Fort Wonton, based in the former Chinatown, to clear away bodies and scour every city block, office building, and apartment in Manhattan for the dangerous and flesh-hungry “skels.” The novel follows three days in the life of one of these sweepers, a man nicknamed Mark Spitz. His experiences become a lens through which Whitehead explores horror, loss, and rejuvenation in the wake of chaos.
”Zone One” is frightening, a spare narrative cluttered with the ephemera of New York’s bygone civilization—chamomile tea, anti-mosquito candles, abandoned m inivans—and devoid of the preaching allegory that haunts the disaster genre, in films like “The Day After Tomorrow” and novels like Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.”
Also unique to Whitehead’s zombie story is the concept of “stragglers”—infected people who do not develop a taste for flesh and continue with a routine task like making photocopies for all eternity. Not much separates the stragglers from the surviving humans, most of whom are ill-equipped to deal with the new reality. Indeed, many survivors simply refuse to cope, treating stragglers as simply sick rather than lost. Through the stragglers, Whitehead, perhaps excessively, analyzes humans’ ability to cope with change. Though his meditations are often poignant, he dwells far too much on individuals stuck in limbo.
Whitehead stays true to the horror genre by depicting some awful and gruesome scenes, so twisted in their depravity that they repel and fascinate simultaneously. But Whitehead also plays a mental game with his readers: if he strips away one piece of decency here, a mind there, but leaves an collection of insignificant details intact, at what point can we no longer recognize the human? A zombie may look like a grandmother, wearing the same clothes and continuously clicking through the channels on the television, but she is fundamentally different from the survivors who are able to cope with the catastrophe—so different, in fact, that her very humanity must be questioned. By exploring what separates the harmless stragglers, the bloodthirsty skels, and the survivors, Whitehead divides embattled humanity into three possible paths when faced with a disaster: the path of failure, the path of success, and the path of simply making it through.
“Zone One” is undeniably literary, but while trying to compensate for the inevitable associations between zombies and the cheap thrills of the genre to which they belong, Whitehead has overshot his goal and left his novel lofty and inaccessible. Sentences that are supposed to twist artfully just seem confusing and unpolished on the page. Ironically, Whitehead falls into the same trap that bogs down so many science-fiction and thriller writers: while the premise may be exciting, the uneven and winding prose makes the book almost unreadable.
On the very first page, Whitehead dissects a scene from Mark Spitz’s childhood and latches onto a very small detail—a camera. The camera holds the key to understanding Mark Spitz’s relationship with his parents. “His parents were holdouts in an age of digital multiplicity,” Whitehead writes, “raking the soil in lonesome areas of resistance … The camera was so backward that every lurching specimen his father enlisted from the passersby was able to operate it sans hassle, no matter the depth of cow-eyed vacancy in their tourist faces or local wretchedness inverting their spines.” As one of the few descriptions pre-dating the zombie apocalypse, it is inscrutably academic, leaving readers no frame of reference to understand the contagion that has upended society. Every sentence in this book fills to the brim and topples over with descriptive detail. By including these minutiae, Whitehead seems to be aiming for a reality effect, but the small details do not add up to a grander picture.
Despite the occasionally gory and jolting scene, there is simply not enough incentive to turn the pages and keep reading. Although blurring our definition of humanity may be a worthy premise, “Zone One” is a frustrating read that never achieves its grandiose ambitions. Beneath its morass of painstaking description lies the same gore and suspense that is at the heart of more lowbrow zombie novels—no more and no less.

Is a person still alive if no one notices they are? Norwegian author Kjersti A. Skomsvold’s debut novel explores the meaning and purpose of life from an unlikely perspective: that of a near-centenarian recluse who, in her last breaths of life, sets out to make her mark in a world she no longer understands. Having lived alone for so long, Mathea Martinsen has trouble with the most basic social interactions. To an outsider, her attempts at conversation make no sense and her actions are erratic and paranoid. Indeed, though Skomsvold never mentions the particulars of Mathea’s health, she is probably suffering from some form of dementia. But in a vivid and logical style rendered in English by translator Kerri A. Pierce, Skomsvold fully realizes the confusing experiences of this unlikely protagonist. In this brief and impressionistic novella, Skomsvold offers not so much a narrative as a snapshot of one woman’s lonely life.
Interspersing the past with the present, Skomsvold portrays Mathea’s vast cache of memories alongside a present that grows dimmer by the day. This structure, while often disorienting and confusing, is an effective method to help the reader experience the mental disorganization that plagues a person of Mathea’s age. One minute Mathea is baking meringues, and the next she is lost in a long-forgotten childhood memory or a conversation with her deceased husband, Epsilon. It is sometimes unclear whether Epsilon is actually dead, and the reader must guess his status. Mathea clearly lives alone, but Epsilon’s ubiquitous presence in her thoughts and memories, which frequently overlap, makes him just as present as if he were alive.
“Epsilon says that, statistically speaking, a given person will probably die in bed. Maybe I should get up now,” Mathea decides at the beginning of the novel, as she commences her journey to rediscover a world in which she has always been a passive observer. Shy and afraid of strangers since her school days, she goes so far in her avoidance of social interaction as to check her hallway before she opens the door; she times her entrance and exit from her apartment so as to not run into her neighbors, many of whom she hasn’t seen in decades.
But reintegrating herself into society isn’t as easy as she thought it would be. Mathea can barely muster the courage to talk to checkout clerks in the supermarket, much less join in any community gatherings. She finally interacts with a strange man in the park who asks her what time it is: “I just contributed to society, the stranger trusted me to give him the right time, and time is not to be taken lightly.” The gift of time, overlooked by everyone with years left to live, becomes a value of central importance to Mathea, who has little time left.
Skomsvold articulates such a basic human need—not the need for love, acceptance, or involvement, but just the need to be noticed—that Mathea’s fierce struggle for acknowledgement becomes all the more poignant. She resembles nothing more than a creeping mouse, frightened even by the enthusiastic “CLEAN-UP!!!” sign posted for residents of her apartment building. “It shouldn’t be necessary to shout like that,” she thinks, flustered. “I don’t have the courage to read the rest of the flier and scurry back up the stairs.”
Skomsvold’s portrayal of Mathea’s emotional life is balanced and perfectly realistic. Mathea craves attention in the most intense way, but is unable to leave the security of her home long enough to break out of the insular life she has built for herself. “I wish I were under house arrest,” she imagines. “There would be nothing I could do about it, my life would never change. … Wouldn’t it be nice to have an excuse.” A secure, unchanging life is all she wants, but realizing her life is coming to an end without ever having made an impact in the world, she feels an obligation, a compulsion, to make one final attempt to engage with the world around her.
Though Skomsvold’s terse language occasionally lacks description, it is the bluntness with which she renders Mathea’s world that makes it a more plausible exploration of the mind of a senile woman. Hanging on to her last days of life, Mathea recollects a childhood ambulance ride after she was struck by lightning—“Then we drove away, sirens blaring, and it was as beautiful as Beethoven’s Fifth.” It is a haunting elegy for the most fame she ever achieved. “The Faster I Walk, the Smaller I Am” blends the unconventional with the human, all while calculating the costs of privacy and recognition.

American humorist Will Rogers once famously declared, “I’m not a member of an organized political party; I’m a Democrat.” Nearly 80 years after Rogers’ death, the Democratic Party still suffers from a seemingly congenital inability to act in a cohesive manner. Whether it is the months-long slog to corral enough moderate Democrat votes to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in late 2009 and early 2010, or whether it is the initial resistance among Senate Democrats to President Obama’s American Jobs Act in September, congressional Democratic infighting and handwringing has become a staple of American political life. Perhaps it is emblematic, then, that even the movement that aspires to revive the political fortunes of American liberalism—Occupy Wall Street—is hampered by debilitating incoherence. A potential solution to longstanding liberal political dysfunction, however, presents itself in Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, which is why we strongly endorse her candidacy for the United States Senate.
Warren, due to a professional lifetime of middle class advocacy spent outside the corrosive scope of professional politics, has demonstrated time and again an almost-reckless fearlessness that enables her to make a forceful and unequivocal case for economic fairness. This fearlessness was best demonstrated by her now famous assertion that “There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. You built a factory out there—good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces the rest of us paid for.”
Republicans have attempted to dismiss Warren’s rhetoric as divisive “class warfare,” as seen by a recent, unintentionally self-parodic ad run by the Massachusetts Republican Party reframing Warren’s rhetorical differentiation between “you” and “the rest of us” as a differentiation between “job creators” (a.k.a. the rich) and…well, they never do give the “the rest of us” a nickname. But as demonstrated by President Obama, whose rhetoric of late has come to resemble Warren’s more and more, the best way to counter the Republicans’ specious accusations of class warfare is to embrace them. As the president said, “I'm a warrior for the middle class; I'm happy to fight for working people. Because the only class warfare I've seen is the battle that's been waged against the middle class in this country for a decade.”
The clarity and passion of Warren’s rhetoric is reinforced by her expertise in consumer protection as a longtime law professor specializing in contracts, bankruptcy, and commercial law, as the intellectual architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as chair of the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s Congressional Oversight Panel, and as a special advisor charged with implementing the CFPB following its establishment by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Her intellectual heft, coupled with hands-on experience, would give her the ability to harness the amorphous rage of the Occupy Wall Street movement and channel it into constructive advocacy for the middle class as a United States senator. Therefore, two years into the Wall Street-coddling tenure of sitting Massachusetts Senator Scott P. Brown, whose woes have recently been compounded by fresh allegations of plagiarism on his campaign website, we firmly believe that Warren would be the better steward of the legacy of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.

I’ve had trouble lately responding to questions about the revolutions taking place across the Middle East and North Africa—questions like “How does it make you feel?” or “Talal, were you in Tahrir Square?” Up to now, my response has been vague, short, and somewhat embarrassing “I actually don’t know. I wasn’t really personally affected. I wasn’t part of the change.”
Don’t get me wrong—I am ecstatic at the prospect of novel opportunities being created and the new sense of responsibility citizens in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Libya, Bahrain, and Yemen have won for themselves. However, despite being an Arab citizen, I can’t quite pinpoint how I made any sort of difference in the birth of this new generation.
My frustration extends further to my native country, Saudi Arabia, where the recent law granting suffrage and the right to participate in legal counsel to women has put into even starker relief the lack of rights in the Kingdom. As one of the few students from the Arab region on campus, I constantly find myself in discussions about the progress and future of my own country. Yet, I often do so strolling through Harvard Square where a malfunctioning BlackBerry trumps most people’s list of concerns. I feel deeply connected to the changes in my part of the world but troublingly insulated from them.
As some of my peers took their fates into their own hands and autocratic regimes collapsed I was live streaming Al-Jazeera in my literature lecture on Arabic fiction, trying desperately to keep up with the events as they unfolded at a remarkable rate. They were marching in the streets while I was sitting in class thousands of miles away. Did I fit into this equation at all? I trust that I am not the only Arab in the Western world with this feeling of disconnect. Yet, it is this confusing lack of geographic proximity with an absence of agency that has prevented our communities from reaching our social, political, and economic potential, leaving us ineffectual and helpless supporters of our allies abroad.
Despite being thousands of miles away, Arab citizens abroad should not use our distance as an excuse to hold us back from action. Our international education has provided us with a platform to debate and think without restrictions, and to freely explore our potential to succeed. We have the liberty to dream up ideas, theories, and plans that can motivate and inspire us to create a change in our communities.
Still, it is rare that we, the Arab youth living abroad, are given a forum to do so —a forum that stimulates our ambition and our creativity in pursuit of tangible results. It is for that reason, and more, that the upcoming Harvard Arab Weekend is so exciting! Being a four day-long conference, the Harvard Arab weekend brings together hundreds of participants from across the US to discuss and learn. Under the theme of ‘The Arab (R)evolution: What’s Next’, the conference incorporates  panels and keynote speeches, discussions and debates that aim to deconstruct the changes happening in the Arab world, as a key step to move forward. The conference events will bring experts, scholars, policy-makers, revolutionists and youth from across the Arab region—ones who have taken part and others who are determined to take part in the Arab Spring. This conference will cover a wide spectrum of fields and interests—one that reflects the diverse representation from the different Harvard schools, graduate and undergraduate.
The Harvard Arab Weekend 2011 is indeed an opportunity to overcome distance, and the sense of longing and excitement that it has created, to catalyze efforts focused on building a stronger, and a more productive and socially aware Middle East and North Africa. I may not have marched in Egypt or protested in Syria, but my voice and the voices of my peers are still important.  Simply through dialogue in Cambridge, we can take part in the global debate started by the Arab revolutions; one to which we have important sentiments to contribute.
Talal M. Alhammad 11 is a Harvard Arab Weekend Co-Chair.  For more information on the events, see www.harvardarabweekend.org.

The United States Postal Service is in deep trouble. This “independent agency” of the federal government, while it does not receive direct subsidies, has long operated in the red, its 2012 deficit projected to reach $9.2 billion. The situation has become so severe that its management predicts it will be unable to fund routine operations by early next year.
This fiscal crisis has resulted not only from declining demand for conventional mail delivery, but also from the political straitjacket that prevents any government-owned enterprise from adjusting to market developments. The best way to make the Postal Service solvent is to free it from political influence, which can only be achieved by forcing it to compete with other carriers as a private firm.
When the Post Office was created in the 1770s, federal ownership made sense. Given the expanse of the country and high transportation costs, government was likely the only institution willing and able to maintain a nationwide postal system.
It almost goes without saying that this is no longer true. Digital messaging and telecommunications have drastically reduced the need for conventional mail delivery, which itself has become so cheap as to be profitably conducted by private firms. Were the government to privatize the Postal Service and end its legal monopolies on first-class and standard mail (letters and bulk advertisements, respectively), as well as the use of mailboxes, private firms would fill the void. What would change is that the prices of the industry’s inputs and outputs would better reflect the true cost of services, rather than political jockeying within the federal government.
And the jockeying is substantial. Raising the rates for standard mail might be a good first step toward solvency were it not opposed by politically influential direct marketers (i.e., the companies that send junk mail), which provide 48 percent of USPS’s business. The Postal Service Inspector General issued a report last year concluding that discounts offered to direct marketers often result in rates lower than delivery costs. It would take a 22 percent increase in the rate for catalogs, for example, for the Post Office to break even on their delivery. The American Postal Workers Union has long criticized these excessive discounts, arguing that they deprive USPS of critical revenue.
But if anyone is depriving the Postal Service of revenue, it is the American Postal Workers Union, and the three other unions with which USPS has been required to bargain since the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Although postal employees cannot go on strike, arbitrators who resolve labor disputes are not required to consider USPS’s financial position. Thanks in large part to the legal framework within which the unions operate, the average postal worker in 2009 received an absurd $79,000 in wages and benefits for the task of sorting and delivering mail. Contracts with each of the unions prohibit USPS from terminating employees if business declines, which is perhaps the biggest obstacle to badly needed cost cutting.
Other ways of reining in the deficit, like raising first-class rates and ending Saturday delivery, require congressional authorization and are unpopular with the public. Closing post offices, which USPS can do unilaterally, is often difficult due to local opposition. Aside from these political hurdles, the implicit guarantee of a federal bailout makes self-preservation a less urgent motivator in the Postal Service than in the private sector.
Congress could largely eliminate these problems by privatizing the Postal Service and allowing other firms to compete for its market share. Since mail delivery would be structured to maximize profit rather than to satisfy the political needs of legislators and bureaucrats, prices would more accurately reflect costs, and unprofitable services would be curtailed. Labor unions could continue to look after the interests of postal employees, but unrealistic demands would be restrained by the prospect of the business’s failure.
Replacing a political motive with a profit motive would entail some adjustments. The government would need to contract with private carriers for delivery to some remote locations, since this would often be unprofitable, and residential pick-up and delivery six days a week would probably become a thing of the past for many citizens. It might be desirable to subsidize mail services for the poor, either through existing aid programs or a separate voucher system. Passports and voter identification, now frequently provided by post offices, would need to be offered elsewhere.
While these costs are significant, they are a small price to pay for a system of mail delivery that responds to consumer needs rather than political whims, and a government that is not on the hook for yet another insolvent public corporation. Letting USPS sink or swim on its own would also send a very positive signal after the bailouts of the past several years. The obvious caveat is that privatizing the Postal Service would itself be very difficult politically. But if Congress fails to stand up to corporate and union interests, this may be the only option besides a multibillion-dollar bailout.

With the approach of pre-term planning, idealism and pragmatism are at war once again in the academic lives of many Harvard students. Students can’t learn the basics of economics or computer science without devoting a full year to Ec 10 or pulling all-nighters for CS 50. As a pre-med humanities concentrator with little time or energy to spare beyond my regular academic workload, I am reluctant to enroll in these valuable but large, time-intensive and notoriously stressful courses even though I would like to learn about these subjects.
As evidenced by the open secret that students prefer to strike a balance of “easy” and “hard” classes in their course selection, I am not alone in the caution with which I approach large introductory courses outside my field of study. In order to better serve myriad students with preexisting academic commitments, the College should expand its offerings of accessible introductory courses in popular subjects such as computer science and economics.
Many Harvard students pursue honors concentrations or pre-professional tracks that demand rigorous course loads. The result is twofold: First, major “gateway” or introductory courses like Ec10 experience high numbers of enrollment, resulting in a lecture-style course that employs a singular method to teach the same content to students of wildly diverse academic preparation and motivations for taking the course. Consequently, the perception of these introductory courses as large, demanding, and time-intensive discourages students from pursuing them in addition to other major academic obligations. Taking a large introductory course becomes a rite of passage for the majority of students, but taking one in addition to other significant commitments becomes unadvisable from a practical standpoint.
This semester, Ec 10 and CS 50 enrolled more students than any other course, reflecting the mass appeal and relevance of these subjects. In today’s technologically-defined and economically volatile world, it is crucial for Harvard graduates to have practical knowledge of computer science and economics. As such, Gen Ed requirements should be altered or expanded to include these fields. If the Program in General Education’s purpose is “to prepare students for civic engagement” and “to enable students to respond critically and constructively to change,” then it is equally, if not more, necessary for students to understand the basics of economics or computer science as it is for them to know about the role of the United States in the world or the science of living systems.
Given the logistical complications of altering the current Gen Ed program, the college should, at minimum, introduce a greater variety of courses in introductory economics and computer science, including some that are comparable in workload and time commitment to Gen Ed courses. Granted, the breadth of a field like economics would be difficult to reconcile with the typical scope and workload of a Gen Ed course, but the Computer Science and Economics departments could work to devise courses that balance satisfactory scope of material with reasonable expectations from students. Just as many students attest that some of their most meaningful academic experiences have been through Gen Ed courses that weren’t necessarily the most academically rigorous, students who cannot or choose not to take Ec 10 or CS 50 stand to benefit from carefully balanced courses that expose them to the basics of these practical and intellectually significant fields.
Alternative introductory courses should, by no means, replace the existing courses designed for concentrators, nor should they count for concentration credit. Rather, these courses should serve as a means for students to develop knowledge and interests outside their area of expertise. In regard to concentrations and secondary fields besides economics and computer science that currently require Ec10 or CS50, departments should exercise discretion to decide whether the traditional course or a less in-depth introductory option satisfactorily communicates the knowledge required by a given academic program. The potential benefits of empowering more students with the opportunity to gain basic, valuable knowledge are sufficient incentive to develop and implement new courses in two invaluable fields.
In the end, the lack of more accessible, less time-intensive courses in practical subjects reveals that the Harvard undergraduate academic curriculum is currently too focused on academic rigor as opposed to the dissemination of interdisciplinary knowledge and diverse methods of learning to the maximum number of students. The latter is the purpose of a liberal arts education, one oft forgotten amidst the pressure to provide students with a rigorous academic experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lisa Stampnitzky, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard’s Warren Center for Studies in American History, discussed how to analyze terrorism from a critical perspective during a seminar held in Robinson Hall Monday afternoon.
The seminar, drawn from a chapter from her upcoming work “Disciplining Terror: How Experts and Others Created ‘Terrorism,’” focused on how the idea of terrorism entered the academic arena and the difficulties in deciding who is the “expert” in a field such as terrorism.
Stampnitzky, who worked at Oxford University before her fellowship at Harvard, is a sociologist by training, completing her doctoral thesis on terrorist studies.
Stampnitzky’s colleagues reviewed the excerpt from her book before the seminar and discussed terrorism in academic terms, referring to the difficulty of dealing with the “irrational actor” in terrorism policy. Any field of study requires quantitative analysis, a system of rational methods of understanding. But terrorism itself is irrational, placing it outside of scientific study and making it very difficult for anyone to understand sociologically, Stampnitzky said.
Jeffrey C. Stewart, another Warren Fellow and a professor in the Department of Black Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said, “We’ve sort of reached a cul-de-sac in how we think about terrorism because if we define it as outside social science, we can’t study it using social science.”
Terrorism, as we define it today, is the use of violence or the threat of violence to intimidate, usually for some political end. The word came into common use in 1972, after the U.S. State Department, under the Nixon administration, convened to develop a response to the Palestinian attacks against Israeli Athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.
Stampnitzky explained how “terrorism” evolved from the “insurgency,” another form of armed violence against a perceived authority. While insurgents attack targets directly, terrorists are more inclined to kill civilians to make a statement or to take hostages.
Stampnitzky explained how the use of non-target victims created a new emotional dynamic, and this dynamic solidified the position of terrorism in the good versus evil model that led to the United States War on Terrorism.
While counterinsurgency and counterterrorism measures have been implemented to deal with these acts of violence, many scholars feel that the U.S. deals with terrorism too homogeneously. Some of those in attendance said that policymakers do not understand that terrorism is a field of study that has not yet developed enough on a quantitative level, and that this analysis may be a long-term project due to complexities that vary by nation, region, and motivation.

John W. Garver, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and an expert on China’s foreign policy, said China can uphold friendly relations with all Middle Eastern countries without challenging the role the United States has assumed in the volatile region.
Garver, who spoke as part of a lecture series hosted by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, said China’s economy is, has been, and is certain to remain dependent on export markets. As the U.S. carries the “biggest stick” in the global capitalist system, he said, China depends upon the U.S. for access to western markets and technology.
For economic reasons alone, Garver said China wants to avoid political competition with the U.S. in the Middle East.
The U.S. repeatedly has asked China for diplomatic assistance in the Middle East, and China has agreed on occasion, mostly when it has suited its interest in maintaining neutrality in the region. Beginning with the Iran hostage crisis that started in 1979, China cut a fine line condemning both the kidnapping and the attempted use of force by the Americans. In the Iran-Iraq War, China supplied weapons to both sides but was Iran’s primary arms supplier. China did not back down from this position despite U.S. demands, according to Garver.
From a policy perspective, Garver said China views U.S. military actions in the region over the past two decades as fallout from the Cold War, during which an unopposed super power has sought to take possession of the region’s oil.
Though China continues its “strategic cooperation” with the U.S., the Chinese have a low opinion of American policy in the Middle East. Garver emphasized this point, referring to Chinese analysts with whom he had spoken.
“The underlying Chinese belief,” he said, “is that American policies are ill-considered, wrong-headed, and not wise.”
Garver said Chinese commentators believe the American drive for “hegemony” is simplistic, and the attempt to impose western values will fail at immense cost.
The Chinese do not believe that the religiosity of the Islamic Middle East can, or even should, be weakened. China believes, according to Garver, in a pluralistic world, where one area should not try to impose its beliefs on others.
Garver’s lecture provided a far more disciplined view of Chinese foreign policy than the nation is often given credit for.
It was “interesting to hear about Chinese policy from someone who is not speaking from a strictly American point of view,” Caitlin S. Pendleton ’15 said.

Growing up in Pakistan, Rabeea Ahmed ’14 never had the opportunity to sit in a sukkah.
“Back in Pakistan, there’s not a huge Jewish population. I didn’t know any Jews in Pakistan,” Ahmed said.
Coming to Harvard, Ahmed wanted to take part in interfaith events–starting with Sukkat Salaam.
Sukkat Salaam is Harvard Hillel’s annual interfaith dinner to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. It builds on the Jewish idea of Sukkat Shalom, a shelter of peace, and combines it with the word for peace in Arabic.
“It’s been an event where members of the Jewish community and Muslim community have gotten to learn from each other,” said David F. Sackstein ’14, vice president of community relations for the student steering committee of Harvard Hillel. But in the past, he said, it hasn’t been the best venue for addressing substantive issues, although the program included singing and cultural presentations.
This year, the program included readings from the Koran and Psalm 104, encouraging attendees to grapple with the texts.
“It’s kind of a pilot program, I’d say, in terms of having it be dialogue based,” said Nima Y. Hassan ’14, director of external relations for the Harvard Islamic Society and co-coordinator for the event along with Sackstein.
“The real purpose of this event is to dispel stereotypes through casual interactions. We don’t really care what people talk about as long as they’re talking,” Sackstein said. “This vision of ours, we wanted the focus of this evening to be on good food and good company, and less on the distraction of performances.”
Fifty students and community members drifted in and out of the Sukkah as Jonah C. Steinberg, director of Harvard Hillel, and Nuri Friedlander, Harvard’s Muslim Chaplain, gave a presentation to kick off the event.
“We started out with just two snippets of text, one from your tradition and one from my tradition,” Steinberg said. “This is what you get when you put two people in a room together who love their textual traditions.”
The chaplains read excerpts from their religious texts in Arabic and Hebrew after students read them aloud verse by verse.
Steinberg and Friedlander included questions for attendees to discuss.
At one table, Raya S. Dreben ’49, a board member of Harvard Hillel and associate justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court, discussed the passages with two Jewish and two Muslim students.
“Well when you sing to the lord you’re affirming, and so you won’t be sinful,” she said of the Psalm passage.
Jeremy S. Cushman ’12 commented that he thought it was about the coming of the Messiah.
“It could be both,” said Dreben.
“Sounds good to me,” agreed Cushman.
Ahmed, the student from Pakistan, enjoyed the event.
“It felt a little like section,” she said. “But I liked it.”
The conversation at her table then turned to kosher dining laws.
For Steinberg, the Hillel director, the passages had a message of coexistence.
“Where would there be evil doers, if we learned to live in harmony with the world around us,” he said. “It struck me this morning, that this is maybe a goal we have in common.”
Friedlander agreed. “And so we thank God for sharing our meal in this temporary space,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An advisory group has concluded a process of rethinking the University’s strategy abroad and has provided a set of recommendations to University administrators that begin to formulate a vision for Harvard’s international presence.
The effort, known as the International Strategy Working Group, was developed by University President Drew G. Faust about a year ago to advise her office on broad questions about how Harvard should proceed in its international work, according to Jorge I. Domínguez, the vice provost for international affairs. Dominguez said that the purpose of the group is to carry out “some attempt at systematic thinking” about the University’s global approach and to “discern what it is we are doing now.”
The working group, which is made up of a few faculty members from each school within the University, presented some of its findings to the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing board, several weeks ago, but they have not been made public. Though the formal work of the group is complete, a University official said that Faust would continue to consult with its members on an as-needed basis.
While Harvard has built up a formidable presence abroad—over 40,000 alumni work abroad and Harvard has opened dozens of offices serving the Harvard community’s needs abroad—the University seems to be struggling to articulate its vision for international engagement.
“We have heard from the Harvard community and people outside the Harvard community that they don’t see a deliberate University-wide strategy,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said. “So this working group is going to make recommendations about ways we could be more strategic in our approach.”
One of the issues the working group will consider is whether the University should expand its physical presence abroad through offices or global institutes or if it should instead focus on creating more partnerships with other educational institutions. Many of Harvard’s peer institutions have in recent years made plans to open campuses abroad. Yale, for example, plans to open in 2013 a joint liberal arts campus with the National University of Singapore.
“My guess is that over the next two or three years, maybe as part of the capital campaign, we might be exploring the possibility of opening offices elsewhere,” Dominguez said.
While the upcoming capital campaign, which is currently in a quiet phase, will not necessarily fund new international initiatives, Dominguez said he can envision that reasonable objectives of the campaign might include making the entire University “need-blind and passport-blind,” including for Ph.D programs.
Another question that the working group is currently grappling with is whether an international experience should be a requirement for students. For example, the Business School currently sends many students abroad in January, though it is not formally required by HBS. Dominguez said that faculty tends to be reluctant to add requirements and that simply enabling students to go abroad might make more sense than mandating it.
Both Garber and Dominguez agreed that the University should be outward-looking in how it approaches its international strategy. Dominguez said the University should “try to generate knowledge of universal value.”
Garber echoed these sentiments. “Harvard has to be engaged globally in ways that maximize our impact for the good of the world,” he said.

With the new lounge space for bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer students set to open in the spring, it remains unclear whether the new space will replace or supplement the existing Queer Resource Center in the basement of Thayer Hall, and some student leaders in the gay community find the new space less than ideal.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced the space—a lounge and two offices in Boylston Hall—last spring, at the same time that she created a new position, director of BGLTQ student life. Hammonds’ decision came in response to the recommendations of the BGLTQ Working Group and to student protests  earlier in the year that decried the underground location of the QRC and its lack of a paid staffer.
The new director, Lee Forest, was appointed in September and will start work in November.
According to Emily J. Miller, a student at the Divinity School who is the graduate student intern for the new space, the Boylston offices and lounge will be remodeled over winter break and will open in the spring.
The space consists of two offices formerly occupied by teaching fellows in the Romance Languages and Literatures Department, which will be used by Forest, Miller, and possibly undergraduate interns, as well as an open area where students can congregate and pick up informational material on resources at the College.
The dissatisfaction with the QRC centered in part on the fact that it was located in the basement of Thayer. When the office of BLGTQ student life was allocated space in Boylston Hall, the move was seen as an improvement upon the rather dingy lounge in Thayer. But the new space in Boylston, located one floor below the main entrance, is arguably still in a basement.
“They call it garden level,” said Emma Q. Wang ’12, co-president of Queer Students and Allies. “Whatever you call the QRC—ground level, basement level, garden level—all the same adjectives apply to the floor level of the new space.”
But Wang called the new facilities “a step up,” noting that she’ll be glad to have a space dedicated to BGLTQ student life that is not in close proximity to a trash room.
The room near the garbage bins may not be closing yet, though, and some students would prefer that it does not. Miller and several students involved in BGLTQ activities said that no plans have been made to shutter the QRC.
“This is a lot less bureaucratized,” James R. Sares ’12, a volunteer staffer, said of the QRC, a student-run room lined with shelves full of movies and books pertaining to BGLTQ issues. “There isn’t a paid University person to oversee what’s going on in the space. ... I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing.”
Wang also noted that the open structure of the Boylston lounge does not afford the privacy of the QRC.
Moving meetings for the BGLTQ community from the QRC to Boylston would “cut down on the potential to have confidential meetings,” Wang said. She described the Boylston area as “more of an office and a waiting room than a cozy space that is secure for students.”
Wang, who served on the Working Group that asked Hammonds to create a new staffed space, said that the committee was not consulted before Hammonds announced her choice of Boylston for the lounge’s location.
“The devil is in the details,” Wang said. “There are some major drawbacks.”
Despite these concerns, people involved in the creation of the space say they look forward to its spring opening.
“It’s a great gesture to the acceptance of the College,” Wang said. “It genuinely is a big deal.”

The founder of Pencils for Kids (P4K)—a grassroots organization committed to improving education in the world’s most impoverished communities—recounted the history of P4K and encouraged premedical students to follow a similar path at a presentation hosted by the Harvard Premedical Society Monday night.
Robin Mednick, P4K’s founder and executive director, traced the history of P4K from its beginnings in Libore, Niger, a small commune outside the capital city of Niamey. In a 2007 United Nations report, Niger was ranked the worst country in the world to live.
In December 2005, Mednick’s friend described the disturbing sight of 30 kids sharing a single pencil on his trip to Libore.
“At that moment, I told him, ‘Stop talking—we need to do something,’” said Mednick, who holds an M.A. from Oxford University in Politics and Economics and a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University.­­­­­­­­
That day, Mednick organized for a box of school supplies to be sent to the commune. One box eventually led to a van full of boxes, and soon the mayor of Libore invited her to visit and witness the box opening.
The national media was called to broadcast the distribution of the school supplies, which Mednick equated to manna from heaven for the children. To even Mednick’s surprise, the mayor announced that Mednick planned on building a new school for the village.
With the help of local NGO’s and the Canadian Embassy, the school was built. P4K has since initiated several other programs in the area that it hopes to expand—including a girls’ scholarship program and an agricultural education program for young boys—increasing its influence to much more than just pencils.
Mednick’s husband, an ophthalmologist, also helped to bring ORBIS, a charity devoted to curing preventable blindness, to Niger in order to train local eye doctors.
Mednick’s story resonated strongly with audience members, many of whom were premeds wishing to exert a similar positive impact on the world.
“The event definitely made me realize the ability of one person to impact the world community and truly make a difference in people’s lives,” Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14 said.
With a motto of “do it afraid,” Mednick urged students to tackle global health problems, even if they are frightened of the enormity of the challenges they face or lack a concrete plan of action.
“Don’t get overwhelmed by the huge problems facing the world in the field of global health,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong  with starting with small steps.”

The directors of the Harvard Library’s new system of “affinity groups” —which will bring together library units with similar missions—will be selected following a 45-day review period that began on Sept. 28, during which faculty may offer suggestions for modifications to the system.
The new affinity group heads will work to facilitate better coordination in collection strategy, increased development of research and pedagogical support, and additional improvements in library innovation, according to Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy, who oversees the long-term vision of the library system.
After the review period closes, faculty and staff will have the opportunity to nominate current library staff to head an affinity group.
Kennedy said she imagines the future directors to embody the characteristics of a “Renaissance person.”
Kennedy said that the new positions will be able to “tie librarians closer to the intellectual agendas,” bringing libraries together to work on collection strategy both within and among groups.
“There hasn’t been a structure in the past that has made it possible for the faculty and the libraries to come together to figure out what is the right solution for collections,” Kennedy said last Friday.
Professors have expressed concern that the library reform process, which began in 2008, could lead to slower collection rates in the face of tightening budgets.
In 2009, more than 100 faculty members signed a letter to University President Drew G. Faust, then-Provost Steve E. Hyman, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in response to a report published by the Task Force on University libraries. The letter advised the administration to maintain strong collection growth.
The report determined that the Harvard libraries “can no longer harbor delusions of being a completely comprehensive collection, but instead must develop their holdings more strategically,” due to rising costs of providing both electronic and paper versions of many resources and acquiring materials in new and expanding intellectual disciplines.
Kennedy said that a new system of prioritization does not imply budget cuts.
“I think one of the unspoken questions is ... [a worry] that we’re going to cut collection budgets again, and that’s just not true. That’s just not true,” she said.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who has called reforming the library system his “number one” priority,  said the reforms will focus on innovation rather than cost-cutting.
“I’ve heard people say that this is a way to implement cutbacks, but the intent is to fashion the libraries into a system for the 21st century,” he said.
History Professor and Interim Director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies Andrew D. Gordon said that while “centralization isn’t always the answer,” he “felt optimistic” about the move.
“But it’s very early to see how it’s going to work,” added Gordon, who served on the library task force.

Pforzheimer House resident Emily K. Crockett will be remembered by friends and family for her love of music, mischievous humor, and unbelievable optimism.
Crockett died on Sunday night at the Rose Monahan Hospice Home in Worcester, Mass. after struggling with cancer for 20 years. She was 26.
Originally from Worcester, Crockett was diagnosed with cancer at age 6—what started as a malignant brain tumor would later leave her blind and physically handicapped. At the time, her family was told that she had six months to live.
But Crockett lived longer than six months, persevering through high school and eventually enrolling at Harvard with the Class of 2008.
Pforzheimer House quickly became her home, said her father, Walter H. Crockett. She became close with the House administration and befriended many of the dining hall staff.
But Crockett’s time at Harvard did not come easily, as her studies were frequently interrupted with recurring illnesses and diagnoses of more tumors.
“I’ve beaten it before; I’ll beat it again,” said Crockett, as Pforzheimer House Allston Burr Resident Dean Lisa Boes recalled.
“She just felt lucky that she had made it this far, and she was surrounded by people who cared about her,” said Gabriel A. Katsh ’04, who was once Crockett’s floor tutor. “She was really an example of someone who knew how to keep a positive attitude.”
Crockett and her parents, all musicians, shared a coping mechanism of viewing illness through a lens of humor. Before her mother died of cancer two years ago, the family decided that laughter was the best medicine.
The last sign that Crockett gave her father was a middle finger that she gradually pulled out from beneath her blanket while lying in her hospice bed on Saturday.
“You’re ugly today,” her father had said to her in their mutually-understood joking way, which prompted the appropriate reaction.
Nenita P. Elphick, a former Pforzheimer resident tutor, recalled that Crockett was a fan of practical jokes. On one occasion, Crockett ordered whoopie cushions to play pranks on the Pforzheimer dining hall staff, according to Elphick.
On Monday night, Pforzheimer resident Chelsea S. Link ’12 shared the “Best of Emily Crockett” emails with the House open list.
“I once tried to give my Pforzheimer Mail Center address over the phone,” Crockett had written, “and the woman I was talking to had virtually no trouble with the ‘pforzheimer’ aspect, but she thought I was trying to have my package shipped to a strip club called ‘Pforzheimer Male Center.’”
Crockett became involved with the Make-A-Wish Foundation at a young age, and as a teenager she met her celebrity mentor, country singer Garth Brooks. Brooks continued to stay in touch with Crockett and even called her while she was in the hospice.
Crockett was a songwriter and pianist herself. She posted her original song “Angel All Along” to YouTube from the hospice in early October.
“I was always struck, for somebody who struggled with life-threatening illness, she wasn’t absorbed with her own condition,” Boes said. “She wanted to make the world a better place ... What was really inspiring was the way that she lived her life.”
Chad R. Cannon ’11, a close friend of Crockett, recalled a peculiar incident in Harvard Square one day. A man who was homeless had overheard Crockett talking about her dogs, and the man, who had a dog himself, tried to give Crockett a bag of dog food to take home.
“She was able to inspire such charity—even from a homeless man,” Cannon said.
In an email to The Crimson, Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 recalled that in her Harvard application essay, Crockett had written that she hoped “to leave something behind, some accomplishment that will have a long-lasting effect on the world, even after I’m gone.”
“Emily did just that,” the House Masters wrote. “Her gift was teaching us how to live.”
Crockett is survived by her father Walter and brother Jackson.
A calling hour will be held Friday at 5 p.m. at Nordgren Memorial Chapel in Worcester. Her funeral, which Walter called a “musical celebration,” will be held on Saturday at 11 a.m. at the United Congregational Church in Worcester.

With the announcement of a $40 million gift from Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser, Harvard said Tuesday that it will launch an Initiative on Learning and Teaching, an effort that officials describe as re-emphasizing its commitment to best teaching practices and innovative learning.
The University-wide initiative aims to better integrate technology into the classroom and to advance research on pedagogical methods.
“This remarkable gift from the Hausers will allow us to support the efforts of our enormously creative faculty and provide a framework for making excellent teaching and engagement between faculty and students the touchstone of the educational experience at Harvard,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release.
The establishment of this new teaching initiative comes at a time in Harvard’s history when issues surrounding education and pedagogy have gained a new currency on campus. A large number of Harvard graduates now enter the field of education, including through programs like Teach for America, and University administrators have placed an emphasis on improving the quality of teaching at Harvard.
“This gift is so vital because it allows faculty the opportunity to step back and “think of new ways to engage our students,” said Jules L. Dienstag, the dean for medical education at Harvard Medical School, in a press release.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said that HILT will further the advancements in teaching practices that have already been made by the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, which was founded in 1975.
“This gift is a huge affirmation of Harvard’s ongoing commitment to excellent teaching,” Smith said in a press release. “Since the ’70s, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning has been one of the world’s most highly regarded centers focused on teaching undergraduates, bringing insights from the science of learning into the classroom.”
In the past, Harvard has been criticized for faculty members’ prioritization of their own research at the expense of time in the classroom. The establishment of entities like the Bok Center and, now, HILT, has tried to combat this image and make substantive improvements in teaching.
“Visionary investments in activities like these will establish Harvard as the institution for pedagogical innovation,” Smith added.
But apart from cultivating better learning practices, this new initiative may have larger implications for the  University-wide capital campaign.
Some have speculated that undergraduate House renewal or the University’s Allston campus may serve as the campaign’s focus, but Law School Professor John G. Palfrey, who advised the creation of the initiative, said that teaching and learning will function as a “centerpiece” for the upcoming capital campaign.
Faust echoed this sentiment in an interview Monday and said that the University took into consideration “what kind of issues would be of interest in a coming campaign” when planning this initiative with the Hausers.
The Hausers have made several significant donations to the University in the past, including seeding the money for the creation of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organizations in 1997.
Rita Hauser—who served as national co-chair for the University’s last capital campaign—said that she hopes her donation will be a “catalytic gift” that will encourage other donors to make contributions for teaching and learning development at Harvard.
“This is in line with the philosophy of our giving,” said Rita Hauser in a statement. “We are giving a sizeable gift, which is just the beginning. This is really a start-up, if you like, and we hope it will be a catalytic gift.

To say the Bucknell offense never got going on Saturday is an understatement.
Coming into the game, the Bison averaged 24 points per contest. On Saturday, it scored just three.
The Bison struggled to find a rhythm, and dynamic sophomore quarterback Brandon Wesley spent most of his day avoiding the rush. He struggled in the air too, throwing four interceptions to match his four sacks.
In the Crimson’s (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) 42-3 rout of Bucknell (4-3, 1-1 Patriot), Harvard’s defense was fast, aggressive, assertive, playing an instrumental in the lopsided non-conference victory.
“The biggest thing was preparation,” captain linebacker Alex Gedeon said. “One thing was tendency—just being aware of what they wanted to do on offense. [Another] was the coaches putting us in good situations and keeping it simple, which allowed us to play fast.”
Game plan and tempo were pivotal in the dominant performance by the defense.
The linebackers were all over the field, pressuring Wesley on some plays and wrapping up ball carriers on others to prevent broken tackles and limit big plays.
“[The coaches] gave us a great game plan and allowed us to execute,” said junior defensive back Brian Owusu. “It especially helps when we have seven guys swarming the ball up front.”
The defense played consistently from the opening kickoff, notching an impressive first-half performance that helped put the game out of reach. The Bison gained just 31 yards of total offense in the first two quarters, and the only drive with any promise ended with an interception.
“Holding them to 31 yards of offense in the first half really set the tone,” Gedeon said. “And then we were able to come out that same way in the second half.”
The front four dominated the line of scrimmage, freeing up the linebackers and defensive backs. Bucknell managed just 140 yards of total offense, running for -5 total yards.
“We really didn’t blitz at all,” Gedeon said. “It was just those guys up front winning the battles one-on-one.”
The line—led by preseason All-Ivy senior tackle Josue Ortiz—recorded four sacks and was a constant presence in the backfield. They harassed the fleet-footed Wesley, who despite an ability to run failed to gain a single yard on the ground.
“We knew [Wesley] could run the ball, and we really wanted to contain him,” Owusu said. “When he got out of the pocket, we wanted to get the secondary on the receivers. But at the same time, we wanted to remain attack-oriented.”
Harvard’s secondary played just as well, and its performance was particularly impressive with its backs against the wall, recording three of its four picks inside the Harvard five-yard line.
One of these interceptions stalled Bucknell’s longest sustained drive of the first half. With the Bison nearing field goal range, Wesley lofted a pass to the right-hanf corner of the end zone. But Owusu picked it on the four-yard line and returned it all the way to the Bucknell 38.
“They were driving towards the end zone, and the defense had to come up with a big play,” he said. “There were two receivers in my area, and I got off the first receiver and went up to get the ball.
We gave our offense the ball with great field position, which is always our goal.”
By recording big returns on turnovers and forcing punts deep in Bison territory, the defense gave the Crimson great field position throughout the afternoon.
Harvard started five drives inside Bucknell territory, cashing in for three touchdowns.
“We need to take the speed and physicality we had against Bucknell into Princeton [next week] and going forward,” Gedeon said.
Owusu, whose interception was his first on the season, agrees.
“Moving forward, we can’t get complacent,” he said. “The last couple of games we have been up-and-down. It comes down to executing our individual assignment [and] having the right mind set and right focus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout most of the year, the Crimson has turned in largely middling performances. And in its last match of the fall season, the trend continued.
Facing tough competition in its final tournament of the year, the Harvard men’s golf team found itself toward the bottom of the pack, taking 11th out of 17 teams this weekend in Skokie, Ill., in the Windon Memorial Classic Invitational.
Captain Tony Grillo, senior Mark Pollak, sophomores Seiji Liu and Theo Lederhausen, and freshman Akash Mirchandani all represented the Crimson at two-day event, which took place on Sunday and Monday at the Evanston Golf Club, a 6,793 yard course near host Northwestern  University.
Matt Thompson of the University of Michigan won the tournament with a score of 205, followed by Eric Chun from Northwestern at 207 and Ethan Tracy of Arkansas with 209, who paced the tournament’s winning team.
Two tournament rounds were scheduled for Sunday, with a third to be played on Monday morning, but part of the second round was postponed until Monday on account of darkness.
At the end of the first day, the Crimson stood in 15th, with Pollak leading the way with an opening-round 72, good for a 34th overall.
Lederhausen and Grillo both finished just a shot back of the senior with a pair of 73s.
Liu was tied for 78th with a score of 76. Mirchandani, the least-experienced player on the travelling squad, shot a 78 for an 84th-place finish after the round.
On the following day, the Crimson moved up from 15th to 11th as a team, with a total score of 876, 29 strokes behind Arkansas, the eventual winner.
UCLA and Indiana tied for second place, as both teams shot a combined team score of 851.
Grillo paced the team for the second straight week, finishing the tournament tied for 24th and shooting a cumulative 216 over three rounds.
Lederhausen was the Crimson’s second-best performer this weekend, as the sophomore tied for 42nd with a 219.
The rest of the team finished well behind—Mirchandani took 48th with a 221, and Pollak tied for 52nd with a 222. Liu finished in a tie for 79th with a score of 229.
It is clear that heading into a long hiatus, men’s golf has its work cut out for it during the winter offseason. The team has not finished better than fifth place or worse than 12th since the first match of the year against Yale and Princeton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a weekend of mixed results for Harvard sailing.
With a third-place finish at the Lark Invitational, the Harvard sailing team overcame tough weather conditions and unfamiliar equipment to produce a strong result this past weekend.
In addition to the Lark Invitational, the Crimson co-eds also competed in Dartmouth’s Captain Hurst Bowl, where the squad placed 13th out of a competitive field of 22 teams. The Harvard women’s team was scheduled to compete in the Yale Women’s Intersectional, but no races were completed due to strong winds.
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
Breezy, puffy shifts between 30 and 45 degrees on Sunday added an additional challenge for the sailors at the Captain Hurst Bowl, named in honor of the late Dartmouth coach, at Mascoma  Lake. Although there were strong breezes on Saturday, those winds diminished for Sunday’s races, allowing for the two-day regatta to continue.
“This regatta was particularly challenging because the conditions were [rougher] than the ones we usually practice in, which is something we do not have control over,” freshman Ansel Duff said.
Harvard finished in 13th place with a total of 347 points. Captain Alexandra Jumper and senior Emily Lambert competed for the A-division, and the duo had six top-10 finishes on the weekend, earning 160 points overall and placing tenth in their division.
The Crimson went with its younger members to compete for the B-division. Freshman Michael Drumm skippered, with Duff and sophomore Sarah Pierson splitting the time at crew. Duff would fill in for Pierson to level the boat during heavy breezes.
“The Captain Hurst Bowl was cold and windy but it was a lot of fun,” Duff said. “We sent good sailors that placed really well in a few races. Overall, it was a great learning experience for me.”
In both the Captain Hurst Bowl and the Moody Trophy the previous weekend, the younger members of the team received key opportunities to gain competition experience.
“There were really good sailors at the regatta from all over,” Duff said. “The way I learn is by competing against people that are better than me. You can learn subtle things by watching the other sailors in competition that you cannot learn in practice alone.”
Roger Williams University claimed first place overall at the regatta, followed by the Big Green and the Boston University.
LARK INVITATIONAL
At the Lark Invitational, hosted by nearby Tufts  University, the Crimson competed against 13 other schools. The host Jumbos took first place in the regatta, while BU came in second place, narrowly defeating third-place Harvard by two points.
“We tend to sail better when it’s windy,” sophomore Alice Kenney said. “We were making sure to keep the boat up, because a lot of boats were tipping. The conditions were challenging, but we were happy about it.”
Kenney and fellow classmate Ames Lyman competed in the A-division, placing third and accumulating 18 points. The pair had three second-place finishes in their five races.
“We were able to keep our boat flat more easily than the other boats could,” Kenney said. “The conditions allowed us to sail faster. The main thing we were focused on was staying in phase and making sure our boat was working well with the wind.”
The B-division team consisted of sophomore Luke O’Connor and junior Nicholas Gordon, who competed as skipper and crew, respectively. The duo earned 20 points and emerged fourth in their division, and they ended the weekend with a first-place finish in their last race of the regatta.
The Crimson does not typically practice in Larks and only sails this type of dinghy at Tufts invitationals, but the squad overcame the additional challenge of sailing less familiar equipment to end its weekend with an overall third-place finish in the regatta.
YALE WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL
The Yale Women’s Intersectional was cancelled due to inclement weather.  On Saturday, a strong western front with gusts above 30 knots prevented the teams from taking the water. The following day, the high winds continued and caused large waves, once again forcing racing to be canceled.
Eighteen schools from across the country had planned to participate in the regatta.
