After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past 24 years, Roncalli High School gave out more than two million canned food items for the needy. The Class of 2021 performed more than 40,000 hours of public service. Last year was Roncalli’s first-ever “R Family day” celebrating the diversity of Roncalli students, with 19 percent of students displaying their diverse backgrounds. Roncalli participates in the Indiana Choice Scholarship which allows primarily low-income families to choose what school their children attend; this scholarship allowed my family to attend Roncalli free of cost when tuition is more than $10,000.
This reputation of exceptional performance is accompanied by an equally exceptional history. A yearbook from 1987 tells of a general named “Ronnie Rebel” holding Confederate battle flags — or as the school once called them, “rebel flags.” The Rebels, and their implied ties to the Confederacy, continued to represent our school for several decades. However, researching Roncalli’s extraordinary history doesn’t require digging through an archive — just a quick Google search.
I was a freshman in high school when Roncalli fired two gay counselors — Shelly Fitzgerald and Lynn Starkey — after finding out about their long-term marriages. In Starkey’s lawsuit, she provided evidence of a hostile environment towards gay students and faculty members. Student Dominic Conover, founder of Shelly’s Voice Advocacy Group, was told he would be unable to receive his diploma if he continued to use his voice to support Fitzgerald; Fitzgerald’s father was similarly prevented from volunteering at the school due to his support for Fitzgerald. Even as another local Catholic high school refused to fire Layton Payne-Elliott, a teacher in a same-sex marriage, Roncalli held strong to the firings. Roncalli also allegedly threatened suspension to those vocalizing support for the BGLTQ community, silenced gay students and even allegedly demanded additional tuition payments from vocal students.
In my sophomore year, the Roncalli High School principal used the N-word at an all-school assembly. All Roncalli students, Roncalli teachers, and eventually, Roncalli families heard the principal say the N-word. Even more shocking was when former Roncalli teacher and coach, Jerre McManama Jr. responded to the scandal with: “Say the word. We’re not walking on eggshells here.”
Junior year was marked by an incident of football players hazing a student with Down syndrome, forcing them to lick someone’s nipple. What did the players do the following day? Play football. That was followed by a teacher (previously honored with a football field named after him) allegedly assaulting a student in the cafeteria.
In my senior year, Roncalli changed its nickname from “Rebels” to “Royals” due to the ties that Roncalli had to the Confederacy. The name was met with mixed reviews. Reverend Robert J. Robeson, Interim President of Roncalli in 2021, stated in Roncalli’s winter magazine: “[M]any … do not understand the nickname and see it as a symbol of the Confederacy and associate it with slavery and oppression.” He acknowledged that “Rebels carries with it some deep and hurtful associations for a great many people in our society — regardless of how we understand it.” He stated that changing the name would make others feel closer to Roncalli. In addition to this important change to Roncalli’s identity, that year, Roncalli demonstrated a commitment to inclusivity within Indianapolis’ diverse community, after the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
A year after my time at Roncalli, a photo posted on the “roncallirowdies” Instagram depicted several Roncalli students next to signs of the letter K. Some, unaware of a pre-existing tradition in baseball in which strikes are counted using “K”s, labeled the photo as a joke to create controversy. As a Roncalli student stated, “now it looks like a huge kkk rally instead of a high school softball game … it’s a wall of white students and k’s.” Roncallirowdies explained that the post was simply an expression of a pre-existing tradition and didn’t intend, or believe, that the post was connected to the KKK. A current sophomore at Roncalli stated that “if any other school or team did this … no one would care” — implying that Roncalli's identity is the reason people reacted negatively.
The issue isn’t with the tradition, just as the word “Rebel” in itself isn’t a word that has been limited in usage (unlike other words used by the former principal of Roncalli). Roncalli, much like Harvard, has an exceptional history, tainted with imprints of the Confederacy, discrimination, and racism. When our school holds up “K”s, much of the Roncalli community, primarily underrepresented minorities, doesn’t see a tradition.
To acknowledge our complex history and the positive changes that Roncalli has made despite it, Roncalli — just like Harvard — must firmly establish that, because it is exceptional, some traditions and practices must be discontinued or modified. Roncalli’s greatest challenge is to hear the voices that it has silenced throughout its history, including the increasing number of students of different racial, sexual, and economic backgrounds. Listen to us when all we see is “KKK — KKK — KKK.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School alum Steven Donziger recently marked his 900th day in detention. Donziger represented victims of oil dumping in a landmark case against Chevron in Ecuador and has since faced serious intimidation and harassment, including mishandling of his trial.
This high-profile case has garnered the support of Amnesty International, a UN Human Rights working group, members of Congress, 68 Nobel laureates, and others, with some calling on the Department of Justice to intervene.
Here at Harvard, Law Professor Charles Nesson has steadfastly spoken out in Donziger’s defense. Harvard Law students joined a letter signed by peers at 55 leading law schools, calling for Donziger’s prosecution to be reviewed. In Fall 2021, with the support of the Human Rights Profession Interest Council at Harvard Kennedy School, I coordinated a petition for Harvard students and alumni to support Donziger that more than 1,600 people have signed onto. This public support is overwhelming, and continued pressure is needed in order for Donziger to achieve justice.
So why hasn’t the Harvard administration spoken up?
The school is quick to parade its most controversial alumni. They have no qualms honoring alum Henry A. Kissinger ’50, who orchestrated widespread war crimes in Cambodia. They were eager to invite Harvard drop-out Mark Zuckerberg to give the College’s 2017 Commencement speech, shortly after Facebook’s incriminating role in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Harvard has shown that it is willing to take risks for certain kinds of alumni.
This makes their silence on human rights defenders all the more deafening.
Harvard trains students to be leaders and to act courageously to create a better world. Many students in my program at the Harvard Kennedy School graduate into high-risk careers, combatting authoritarianism, fighting for indigenous rights, or working on environmental accountability. Graduates have been detained for their work, from the 1992 imprisonment of HKS alum Jeffrey G. Kitingan in Malaysia to the 2012 imprisonment of HKS alum Bakhtiyar Hajiyev in Azerbaijan.
Just last year, HKS alum Erendro Leichombam was detained in India for a Facebook post criticizing Bharatiya Janata Party members’ approach to Covid-19. While Harvard alumni launched a petition for his release, and the Harvard Graduate Student Union lent its public support, these actions could only go so far.
Harvard alumni have been targeted for their human rights work in the past and will continue to be in the future. They deserve more than one-off petitions and scrambling students. Harvard is one of the most powerful educational institutions in the world; surely we can do more.
These targeted alumni are a part of a larger story. 2020 was the deadliest year on record for environmental activists around the world, particularly for Indigenous people and the Global South. Of course, those who graduate from Harvard schools have privileges and protections not afforded to many. Donziger is a white American man with a Harvard Law degree who benefits from respectability politics, and we should critically consider why his case has received more attention than most.
But that is just it. The more we understand and leverage the connections between these cases, the more human rights defenders can receive the attention and advocacy they deserve. These are not isolated incidents. When the next HKS or HLS alum is inevitably threatened or detained, I hope we remember they are connected to a long lineage of targeted alumni and a vast community of targeted activists around the world.
Harvard has taken an important step with the Scholars at Risk program, established more than 20 years ago to offer respite to persecuted scholars, artists, and writers from around the world. Harvard should expand this commitment, devoting significant resources to the defense of human rights, with particular attention to indigenous, women, queer, poor, and otherwise marginalized activists.
It is time to support our alumni at risk, too. Harvard should develop contingency plans that allow the administration to evaluate a situation, get in touch with the detained alum’s close contacts, and consider a range of private and public support measures. At the very least, the administration should be receptive to student campaigns that request the school to make a public statement or intervene in support of a member of our community.
Harvard needs to take responsibility for the human rights defenders it trains. It needs to create a real, ongoing, accessible infrastructure of support. And it needs to start today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Professor,
I want to start by apologizing for turning in my essay so late. I have been working diligently on all my assignments to ensure that I can give each one the thought and attention it deserves, but also, season two of Euphoria just came out so you know how it be. Since we’re on the subject, I wondered if you might grant me an extension on next month’s paper as well. I plan on being sick that week, and there is a concert in New York that I desperately need to aid my recovery.
Anyway, attached, you’ll find the final draft of my Expos 20 essay titled, “Insects Insights: How Endangered Fleas Defeat Patriarchy.” Isn’t that a great title? My boyfriend Jeff came up with it last night while shot-gunning a White Claw in the Wigglesworth basement. He’s very talented. The essay, of course, is the culmination of all my newly acquired facility and passion for expository writing, which is to say, that it’s complete crap. But that’s not my fault! You must remember that I’m incredibly gifted, so if I perform badly on an assignment, it’s probably because the professor is stupid — no matter what the Nobel Prize committee states!
As a Harvard student, I’m tremendously grateful for the opportunity to expand my intellectual horizons by spending copious amounts of time in your mandatory writing class. As a human teenager, though, I hate it with the passion of a thousand suns. It’s nothing personal, you know? I’m just not really into books. Or reading. Or words. I guess writing is fine if it’s for something cool like TV (have you seen Euphoria????) but otherwise, I’m not super into it.
Still, I want to mention how cool it is that this Expos class is insect-themed! Was it my first choice of topics? No. (The class about pirates was full.) Was it my second choice? Also no. (The witches one was full too.) Still, over the course of the semester, I’ve learned lots of valuable things. For example, do you know how many pages of insect-related argumentation you can write before people start getting annoyed at you? Three. The answer is three pages. But we’re well beyond that now, so I apologize in advance for this literary dribble.
Now before we get to the essay, there are two things you’ll need to keep in mind. Firstly, like all Harvard students, I foolishly believe that the key to generating substantive intellectual arguments isn’t about what you say, but how you sound. Thus, the less I know about a subject, the more obnoxious my vocabulary will become. (This phenomenon also explains why Gov concentrators use such big words)! Secondly, I wrote 50 percent of this paper while “krunk with the boyz” at Yardfest, so there’s a pretty good chance that most of it is actually just Swae Lee lyrics. Sorry about that. It’s not plagiarism if you apologize, right?
Now without further ado: the essay.
The most salient insect of this post-modernist society would veritably, indubitably, and unequivocally be the “Ctenocephalides felis,” otherwise known as the domestic flea. This creature is a well-known hematophagic organism. If you do not already know what “hematophagic” means, then you might as well stop reading. Thou incompetence art the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended my nostril. In fact, the inherent intellectualist nature of the domestic flea necessitates that I utilize gargantuan locutions of Brobdingnagian proportions throughout the duration of this essay. So try to keep up.
Domestic fleas fulfill many important roles in environmental ecosystems. These roles are complex and widely studied. So well-studied, in fact, that there’s no need to rehash them here. Instead, it behooves us to examine how these creatures function as an abstract symbol for feminine domesticity.“But wait!” you say. “Why is that the least bit relevant?” Well, I could explain myself, but if my argumentative intentions are not already clear to you, you’ll probably never understand.
My argument is as follows. Because the “Ctenocephalides felis” is colloquially known as the “domestic flea,” we can conclude that fleas are actually just an animalistic representation of female servitude. Furthermore, pesticides – whose very purpose is to exterminate these “domestic creatures” – are the prime symbol of feminist liberation. Thus, I argue that because Harvard is an institution that claims to support the psycho-sexual liberation of women, it should invest in pesticides to liberate the Adams dining hall from fruit flies.
Because I have managed to outline and defend my argument in the first two paragraphs, I really see no need to continue for much longer. I will conclude, then, by turning to contemporary experts. In his seminal work “Sunflower,” existentialist philosopher Swae Lee discusses his previous studies of the domestic flea with colleague Post Malone. “Needless to say, I keep her in check. She was a bad-bad, nevertheless. Callin’ it quits now, baby, I’m a wreck. Crash at my place, baby, you’re a wreck.”
Here, Swae Lee clearly identifies domesticity as a “bad-bad” and emphasizes the importance of keeping “her” — our internalized tendencies toward oppressive domesticity — in check.
Well said, Swae Lee. Well said.

The Cambridge City Council is poised to institute a moratorium on office and lab development in the Alewife neighborhood of Cambridge for the next year and a half, allowing the city time to weigh options for rezoning in the area.
The Ordinance Committee of the Council unanimously voted to recommend a zoning petition to temporarily prohibit new offices and laboratories from being built in Alewife during a virtual meeting last Thursday. The petition now goes to the full Council for consideration, where it is likely to be adopted.
If the moratorium goes into effect, the city will have until December 31, 2023, to propose and enact long-awaited changes to the Alewife zoning districts before office and laboratory permitting can continue. A 2019 study released as part of the Envision Cambridge project recommended a set of zoning amendments to make Alewife “a vibrant mixed-use district with a strong sense of place,” but the Council and city staff have yet to transform them into actionable legislation.
This move comes as the life science and biotechnology industries continue to quickly expand throughout the Greater Boston area. While most lab development in Cambridge has been concentrated in the Kendall Square-MIT area, some companies are looking to Alewife as a potential alternative site for lab construction.
The moratorium was prompted by a recent series of sizable property acquisitions by Healthpeak Properties, a Denver-based trust specializing in real estate for laboratories, medical offices, and other healthcare-related uses. According to the Cambridge Day, Healthpeak has spent nearly $600 million on property in Alewife to date.
Councilor Marc C. McGovern, a co-chair of the Ordinance Committee and a sponsor of the petition, said the Healthpeak purchases are the “final straw” pushing the city to develop comprehensive zoning code revisions for the neighborhood.
“Alewife has really been a lost opportunity,” McGovern told The Crimson. “We’ve sort of created places for people to work or live, but we haven’t really created places for people to be, to interact.”
“Now we’ve got this one developer who’s buying up a good chunk of the land,” he continued. “Here’s an opportunity for us to kind of take a step back and say, ‘What is it we really want to see in this area?’”
The 2019 study, which will serve as a blueprint for potential amendments to the zoning code, called on the city to impose low maximum limits on parking in new developments, incentivize open space, and encourage mixed-use and residential development throughout the neighborhood.
The city should turn Alewife into a “fully functioning urban neighborhood with a broad range of uses and a variety of public places that provide opportunities for social cohesion,” the report says.
McGovern attributed the spread in lab development to its profitability and said that new zoning should incentivize housing to make it financially viable.
He said Healthpeak officials have been “really willing” to engage with the city and Alewife residents in the development process, per his conversations with them.
“They’ve said that they want to build a mixed-use area, that they want housing, that they want retail, that they want commercial,” McGovern said. “They don’t want to build all labs.”
“I’ll take them at their word,” McGovern added.
Healthpeak officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Harvard College Dean of Students Office has appointed an interim election commission to conduct the first elections of the Harvard Undergraduate Association in a selection process some former UC members have called unconstitutional.
Though the HUA constitution mandates that members of the election commission be appointed by a majority vote of the outgoing UC executive board, some UC leaders say they weren’t consulted.
The HUA constitution outlines two procedural paths for forming an interim election commission by the April 6 deadline.
The first path requires a majority vote of departing UC leaders — a group consisting of the UC president, secretary, treasurer, and committee chairs.
In the event of a deadlock, the HUA constitution calls for the Dean of Students Office to select the commission.
It is this second option that the Dean of Students Office, along with UC President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 and Vice President Christopher T. Cantwell ’22, relied on to justify their process.
“The Commission was selected by myself and my colleague, JR Bagley, as representatives of the DSO, not the president and vice president,” said Assistant Dean of Student Engagement and Leadership Kate T. Colleran. “As the executive board is no longer operating at the capacity needed to do a full vote on a tight timeline, we went with the DSO option.”
de Kanter ’24 said the Dean of Students Office had made the selection in the interest of time.
“No specific email was sent out asking for input,” de Kanter wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “From the tenor of the meeting on Sunday, we did not get the impression that there was much interest in getting involved with non-UC related projects.”
Still, some UC leaders said they felt overlooked and contested the constitutionality of the selection process.
“We had never been reached out to about this at all,” said UC Communications Chair Ethan C. Kelly ’25. “I just feel very left out, and I wish we had that included or kept in the loop because there was no communication.”
UC Rules Chair Samuel H. Taylor ’24 called the move “an arrogant approach.”
“This is a constitution that the student body just signed off on, and they’re already doing whatever they feel like and totally ignoring what the rules say,” Taylor said in a written statement.
Former UC Kirkland House Representative Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 lamented what he saw as a disregard for constitutional due process.
“This government that doesn't even exist yet and we’ve already taken a big fat dump all over this constitution,” Zimmerman said.
In a written statement, de Kanter conceded that he could have consulted UC members more but emphasized the time constraint.
“In retrospect we could have been more solicitous of input, but we made the assumption under time pressure and had to move quickly to get things going,” de Kanter wrote in a text message.
The newly appointed election commission consists of seven students: April D. Chen ’23, Ethan Lee ’23, Katerina V. Corr ’25, Madison Eagan ’24, Neil K. Khurana ’22, Ekene Chukwueke ’25, and Simeon I. “Moni” Radev ’22. None of the selected members have previously served on the UC.
The HUA constitution calls for the election timeline to be announced by April 11 and elections to take place by April 30. As of Tuesday evening, no timeline had been publicly announced.

What do final clubs, the Undergraduate Council, and Yardfest performer Swae Lee have in common? All are popular subjects of memes on Sidechat, a new social media app that has swept Harvard’s campus since its launch in late March.
On Sidechat, students can anonymously post, comment on, and upvote — or downvote — jokes and confessions about Harvard student life. Before arriving at Harvard, the app launched platforms at other universities, including Tufts and Cornell.
The app features a leaderboard of the top 10 contributors ranked by “karma,” or the number of total upvotes minus downvotes on posts and comments. As of Tuesday, the top contributor had over six thousand karma.
The platform verifies users’ identities by requiring they log in with a Harvard email address.
In Sidechat’s “Top” section — where students can see the most popular posts — the most upvoted meme pokes fun at the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
“A day and a half of this app has already produced more funny content than the Lampoon has all year long,” it reads.
As of Tuesday night, the post had 554 upvotes.
At 300 upvotes, another post references the fall of the school’s 40-year-old Undergraduate Council.
“Telling my kids the UC was a final club for gov kids,” it reads.
Samuel E. Meacham ’25, a Sidechat user since its launch at Harvard, said the app is “a lot of fun” and relatable.
“We’re all part of the same culture, we all kind of have similar experiences, and it’s nice to be able to see jokes about that experience,” Meacham said. “People feel comfortable sharing if they’re anonymous.”
Some students said though they enjoy scrolling Sidechat, they harbor concerns about how the platform could spread negativity or perpetuate stereotypes of certain groups on campus.
“I think as it grows, it’s definitely become more toxic,” Elliot K. Chin ’25 said.
Nicholas R. Lopez ’25, who said he and most of his friends use Sidechat, is worried about the app’s complete anonymity, which applies to posts, comments, and even private messages.
“Right now it’s definitely used for solely humor as far as I’ve seen, but I think the anonymized factor definitely has the potential for more toxicity,” Lopez said.
Tim C. Fargiano ’24 said while he finds the content occasionally funny, it can sometimes “just be mean.”
“Sometimes it’s mean in a funny way,” Fargiano said. “And sometimes, when it’s a thousand posts making fun of rich New York City girls, it’s like, they’re also just people.”
Sidechat is moderated, and users can be suspended for violating the platform’s rules, which encourage posts that are “funny, thoughtful, and community oriented.”
Before a user is able to post a meme, they receive a reminder of the app’s guidelines.
“We don’t allow spam, abuse, obscene content, or posts that spread rumors,” they read. “No posting of students’ full names or doxxing allowed.”
Sidechat is not the first anonymous platform popular among Harvard undergraduates. Another popular app, Yik Yak, allows users to chat on discussion boards with others in a five-mile radius. Students have also long used the Facebook page Harvard Confessions to post hot takes and anonymously profess crushes.
Jennifer A. Hughes ’24 said while she has seen some “bad things” on Yik Yak, most of Sidechat’s content thus far has been “relatively harmless.”
“Sometimes it’s funny, but it’s more just people being stupid,” Hughes said.

With the Supreme Court set to hear a high-stakes lawsuit challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies, Sherri A. Charleston, Harvard’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, defended the University’s practices and commitment to diversity in an interview last Wednesday.
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions brought the lawsuit against Harvard, claiming that the school’s consideration of race in its admissions process violates civil rights law and discriminates against Asian American applicants. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case along with a second suit SFFA filed against the University of North Carolina — a move that could have major implications for the future of affirmative action in higher education.
During the interview last week, Charleston said Harvard is defending its holistic admissions process and those of other schools around the country in the legal battle.
“What we are defending, in our case, is the ability of Harvard College and Harvard University — and really all of higher education — to be able to consider the whole student in its practices,” Charleston said.
“I’m a historian of race in this country, and I think quite centrally about the ways in which race is a key component to any number of other factors,” Charleston added.
She said SFFA’s litigation against Harvard threatens the school's ability to ensure diversity and inclusion on campus and that Harvard’s consideration of race in its admissions process is crucial for evaluating prospective students.
“What we’re trying to do is to think about how you evaluate the whole student and see race as a key component of that,” she said.
Barred from recognizing race as a factor in their admissions practices, Harvard and other American universities would fall short of institutional goals, according to Charleston.
“What is at stake here is the ability of colleges and universities across the country to create the kind of diverse communities that I think many people and key research in the area has demonstrated is not only essential to the educational mission of higher education, but is actually essential to the success of students,” Charleston said.
“We precedented diversity in our classes over the course of the last several years and what’s clear is that race-neutral policies result in less diverse classes,” she added.
Charleston also pointed out that William F. “Bill” Lee ’72 — a senior fellow at the Harvard Corporation and the lead trial lawyer representing the University against SFFA — will be speaking at the University’s Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Forum, a series of events for Harvard affiliates this week.
“What we’re trying to do is make sure that, as an objective, Harvard is able to maintain the level of excellence that we’ve seen in our student body and — to be quite clear and quite frank about this — making sure that we have a racially diverse class is core to that excellence,” she said.

Founder of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Robert M. Greenstein ’67 discussed the relative merits of social safety net programs during the annual Godkin Lecture at the Harvard Institute of Politics on Tuesday.
Jason Furman, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, moderated the forum. The Kennedy School has hosted the Godkin Lecture series annually since 1903, honoring Edwin L. Godkin, founder of liberal magazine the Nation.
Greenstein began the talk by outlining the two main types of programs used to address poverty. He said that targeted programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, are restricted to those in specific income brackets while universal programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, are available to all Americans.
Greenstein pointed to a “long-standing narrative” that targeted programs are more often cut or eliminated, reciting an adage that “programs for the poor are poor programs.”
“The narrative also holds that universal programs — those that go all the way to the top of the income scale — do much better in the political sphere,” he said.
Greenstein said targeted programs have actually seen significant annual funding increases but added social safety net programs are often inaccessible to the very people they aim to support.
“In every year from 2011 through 2019, fewer than 30 percent of the unemployed received benefits in an average month, which is many fewer than several decades ago,” he said. “Many of the unemployed actually are ineligible for unemployment insurance.”
Greenstein noted, though, that social safety programs have expanded their reach in recent decades. In 2019, government benefits other than health insurance kept 47 percent of Americans who would otherwise be poor out of poverty, compared to only 9 percent in 1970, according to Greenstein.
Asked how policymakers can find a balance between sponsoring targeted and universal programs, Greenstein cited the cost associated with maintaining universal programs.
“If you're in a country that has the kind of resistance to raising taxes that we do in the United States, it makes it really hard to go much farther in a universal program direction,” he said.
Despite difficulties in securing funding and ensuring social safety net programs are accessible to those who need them, Greenstein pointed to progress made under the Biden administration to improve internet access and eliminate obstacles to applying to social welfare programs.
“I want to be clear,” Greenstein said, “I don’t want to be a Pollyanna here. Even with this progress, we have a long way to go.”

Experts, including former extremists, discussed efforts to counter hate groups and extremist violence at a panel hosted by the Harvard Divinity School on Monday.
The panel featured Kristi M. Anderson, a prison reform advocate; former extremists Chris Buckley and Mubin Shaikh; Myrieme Nadri-Churchill, executive director of Parents for Peace, a deradicalization group; and Melvin Bledsoe, co-founder of Parents for Peace.
The conversation — moderated by Susan O. “Susie” Hayward, associate director of the Religious Literacy and the Professions Initiative at HDS — included recollections of lived experiences with extremist ideologies and a discussion on ways to combat radicalization.
Maya C. James, an HDS student who organized the event, began by discussing the importance of centering humanity in combating radicalization.
“You'll soon learn, as I did, that what we are discussing here is not politics but a lesson in our shared humanity, the strands of empathy that bind us and break us,” James said. “No one is born into hate, nor are they stuck in it forever.”
Bledsoe described his family’s agony upon learning that his son had shot and killed a soldier at a U.S. Army recruitment office after being radicalized by an Islamist extremist group operating in Yemen. This incident ultimately led Bledsoe to form Parents for Peace with his daughter.
Shaikh, a professor of public safety at Seneca College, recounted his close encounters with the Taliban before countering extremism as an undercover operative with Canada’s intelligence services.
The panelists also acknowledged religion’s power in countering extremism, despite its frequent use as a tool to promote hate. Anderson, a chaplain and advocate for incarcerated women, discussed the impact of introducing prosocial figures, including ministers of various faiths, into prisons.
Anderson referred to faith and prosocial influences as a “lifeline” in helping incarcerated people find purpose and avoid extremism while serving their sentences.
Nadri-Churchill said religion’s capacity to radicalize but also to restore made the conversation especially salient at the Divinity School.
“As uncomfortable [as] this is, divinity schools across America need to be aware to address the role of clerics in the radicalization process,” he said. “At the same time, we have amazing stories of clerics who understand they have to be a guide, a guide that works with families, not against families.”
Panelists also noted that efforts to counter extremism, like deradicalization interventions, are not always the same.
Buckley, a Parents for Peace team member who formerly held a leadership role within the KKK, stressed the power of drawing upon lived experiences in interventions.
Buckley later met a former white supremacist and a Muslim refugee who helped deradicalize him, which motivated Buckley to deradicalize others.
“One of the most successful things you can do in an intervention is know when it's not your expertise,” Buckley said.
Shaikh said that the availability and feasibility of interventions also differ across geographies, but a sense of humanity should inform these efforts.
“There are different contexts in which interventions can be applied,” Shaikh said. “In our Western contexts where we have all these opportunities and abilities, then, I think the most effective ones are those which, I think, at its core, recognize the inherent humanity of a person.”

Harvard’s relationship with Boston’s Allston-Brighton neighborhood has been fraught for decades.
The University’s ambitious plans to expand its footprint in the area have been met by resistance at every turn. Recently, the neighborhood has become home to a growing regulatory battle over Harvard’s proposed 900,000-square-foot mixed-use development complex called the Enterprise Research Campus.
Many area residents and civic leaders say Harvard — which owns roughly one-third of the neighborhood’s land — must do more to engage residents in its decision making and support the construction of new affordable housing.
But amid the longstanding tensions, there is one University-run initiative that has been welcomed with open arms: the Harvard Ed Portal.
The Ed Portal, located in Allston, provides learning opportunities for area residents through an array of educational programs. Its youth program brings Harvard students in as mentors to local public school students, while other initiatives provide resources to adults seeking work.
Truong L. Nguyen ’23, an Ed Portal mentor who works with students one-on-one, said he is tasked with developing the curriculum for elementary and middle school mentees.
“The idea is to not make it into a tutoring session,” said Nguyen, a Crimson Multimedia editor. “We try to stay away a little bit from the academic, more rigid structure of the classroom.”
Hannah B. Thurlby ’23, who mentors elementary and middle school students, said the Ed Portal’s programs are “not meant to feel like school.”
“It’s meant to feel more fun than school,” she said in an October interview. “But we’re still working to get at some of the bigger learning objectives.”
Catherine C. Taing, a Brighton resident who has three children who have taken part in programming at the Ed Portal, said the mentorship sessions allow her kids to communicate and work with older students on projects.
“If I was talking to a parent who has asked for suggestions, Harvard Ed Portal would definitely be one of the recommendations that I would give to them to look into,” Taing said.
Harvard students are paid for their teaching, but the programming is entirely cost-free for all participants.
The Ed Portal’s building includes a large glass entrance with a sleek, new indoor space, complete with an art installation. The building is home to several classroom-like rooms, smaller spaces for one-on-one mentoring sessions, and a science lab.
But students don’t always have to go to the program’s building, located on Western Avenue in Allston. Georgena M. “Gena” Williams ’23 goes directly into Boston and Cambridge public schools to deliver workshops to students as an intern for the Public School Partnerships Program. Some of her workshops teach financial literacy, a subject she said she did not learn in depth at her high school.
“Not a lot of students are educated on financial literacy, and then when they leave the classroom, they’re now expected to take on a huge amount of debt for college, and they’re like, ‘What am I going to do with this?’” she said. “Being in the classroom and teaching financial literacy has made me realize that there is a need for this.”
Williams said her experience working for the Ed Portal has been “beyond words, amazing.”
“The Harvard Ed portal is by far the best way to engage with education here at Harvard because it's directly in the community,” she said.
The Ed Portal also offers arts education at local schools, including a theater storytelling program at the Gardner Pilot Academy.
“Students are not only acting and giggling and having fun, they’re also being able to be creative and write stories and really express themselves in a different way than they do during the school day,” said Ariana C. Fusco, the Gardner Pilot Academy’s partnership manager.
Cindy Marchando — the chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, a group of Allston residents and Harvard representatives tasked with advising the University on its development plans in the neighborhood — said that the Ed Portal has done an “exceptional job” in its public school outreach. Marchando said the HATF worked with Harvard to help the Ed Portal vision become a reality — one of the “best benefits” it has “brokered with Harvard,” she said.
Still, she said the Ed Portal’s programs are “underutilized” — in part because some residents may be deterred by the Harvard name, perceiving an affiliation with the school to be out of their reach.
While much attention is given to the Ed Portal’s youth programs, it also offers initiatives aimed at adults, including its workforce development and digital learning programs.
After about nine months of training at the Ed Portal — which included meeting a few times a week for tutoring, resume preparation, and other lessons — Celina P. Descoteaux, a life-long Allston-Brighton resident, completed the Harvard Careers in Construction Program. When she graduated from the program, she got her preferred job in the industry.
Without the career help that she received from the Ed Portal, Descoteaux said it would have been difficult to get hired.
“Nobody can really get in the union unless you know somebody, so it seems,” she said. “So at least I knew Harvard.”
The Allston-Brighton neighborhood has changed dramatically in recent years as housing costs have gone up.
“It used to be the cool place to live,” said Jane McHale, an Allston-Brighton resident who serves as a member of the Ed Portal’s committee on workforce development. “If you didn't have much money, if you were a musician or an artist or whatever, you could live in Allston-Brighton. That doesn’t exist anymore.”
“As a resident and not a construction worker, when you go through Allston throughout all these years, it’s like, wow, you feel like it’s being taken over,” Descoteaux said.
She commended Harvard’s decision to help residents without college degrees attain jobs through the Ed Portal’s programs.
Given Harvard’s lofty development goals in Allston, according to McHale, the school has an obligation to residents.
“I think people generally here expect far more of its universities — and most especially Harvard as the wealthiest university in the world — to really make this community outstanding,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As soon as Harvard Head Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith announced this past fall that she would be retiring after 40 years at the University, Carrie Moore set her “heart and eyes” on the position. Moore had just coached her first game as an assistant at the University of Michigan, but she had wanted to be a head coach since she worked at basketball camps in college, and the job she describes as the best in the country was always at the back of her mind.
In Cambridge, the decision-makers behind the coaching search had their eyes on Moore. Athletic Director Erin McDermott had worked with the Michigan native when they were both at Princeton from 2008-2010. Moore had also spent the years since working with McDermott building an impressive resume. At Creighton from 2010-2015, Moore was on the bench for five straight postseason appearances.
Returning in 2016 to Princeton as an Assistant Coach, Moore was instrumental in recruiting the team that has dominated the Ivy League for the last four seasons. She still remembers watching Abby Meyers at AAU tournaments in high school, long before Meyers would become the 2022 Ivy League Player of the Year and lead Princeton to a first-round upset over Kentucky in March’s NCAA tournament.
From Princeton, she was hired in 2019 to be Assistant Coach and Recruiting Coordinator at North Carolina, where she brought two top-10 classes and three McDonald’s All-Americans to a team that hovered around .500 for four years before her arrival, eventually helping to guide a team to the NCAA tournament in 2021. Last year, Moore moved to the same role at Michigan, where she continued to build her reputation as a recruiter and helped lead their team to this year’s Elite Eight.
Creighton, UNC, and Princeton – programs where Moore’s fingerprints are still evident – each made runs in this year’s NCAA tournament as well, with Creighton also surviving to the round of eight, UNC making the Sweet 16, and Princeton falling one possession short of joining them.
Moore’s sustained success in recruiting likely stems in part from the fact that not too long ago, she was in the same place as many of the high schoolers she scouts. After a standout high school career in the Detroit area, Moore was a four-year starter at Western Michigan University from 2003-2007, scoring a school-record 2,216 points over her career and leading the nation in scoring her senior year, tallying 25.4 points per game. She then played in the pre-season for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, briefly signed to the Chicago Sky, and played a year in Poland before transitioning to coaching.
At just 36 years old, she joins a cohort of young coaches with impressive player resumes at the top of the Ivy League, from Columbia’s Megan Griffith, who graduated from Columbia in 2007 and played three years professionally in Europe, to Princeton’s Carla Berube, who was a 1,000-point scorer for Geno Auriemma at UConn in the late 1990s. This youth, according to Moore, brings advantages.
“I think there’s a youthfulness about me, there’s an authenticity and a relatability that has always transcended really well throughout the recruiting process,” Moore reflects. “I think I’m a player’s coach, and I’ll be able to relate to them.”
Though Harvard does not have the Power Five pedigree of UNC or Michigan, Moore is excited to continue her recruiting efforts in her new role and build on the momentum that has landed top players like first-year Harmoni Turner, a five-star recruit in 2021, and junior McKenzie Forbes, a transfer from the University of California. “Any player and any family in the country is going to call me back once I say ‘I’m Carrie Moore, and I’m the Head Coach at Harvard,’” Moore suspects. “[The school] really sells itself, so it’s not a sell - it’s more of a presentation and an opportunity that I want to be able to share with some of the best basketball players and some of the best people throughout the country.”
The first-time head coach also looks forward to building her strategic philosophy, planning to implement a fast-paced offense that opens up space for Harvard’s multiple shooters and playmakers, and a “blue-collar” defense. Hoping to borrow from Tom Izzo, whose gritty Michigan State men’s teams she grew up watching (“I’m sure my Michigan folks won’t be too happy about it,” she likes to joke), Moore envisions instilling a culture that cures some of the rebounding ills Harvard faced this past season and tires their opponents out. This mindset, along with her familiarity with Princeton’s team, are the pieces that Moore plans to use to help Harvard add its first Ivy League title since 2008.
Settling into her first week in her new position, Moore’s excitement to be at Harvard is readily apparent. She sees connections to her job arise in spaces that seem at first to have little to do with basketball, and hopes to create an environment where her players can “soak up every ounce of potential” from the Harvard experience, not just on the court but also in the arena of social change. She recently texted her new team about the confirmation of Harvard Alumna Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US Supreme Court, seeing echoes of her players in the first Black female justice on the nation’s highest legal body. “I want us all to be able to aspire to do unimaginable things,” Moore remembered telling them. “And I feel like they’re already doing that, just attending Harvard.”
Moore is especially appreciative of being able to follow Kathy Delaney-Smith, speaking with reverence about her predecessor’s impact on her players, the program, and women’s place in sports as a whole. Speaking with Delaney-Smith’s former players and hearing their regard for their coach has been, says Moore, “a motivating force… to build relationships that last not only four four years, but forever,” and to help her players reach graduation “ready to set the world on fire.” Though Delaney-Smith is retiring, Moore says she looks forward to keeping in touch with the coaching legend throughout the transition process and to seeing her at games in the future. “I told her that her legacy will live on as long as I’m the Head Coach at Harvard,” Moore recalls.
But what has Moore most excited about the future is the group of players she has right now. She watched Harvard’s nail-biting loss to #24 Princeton in the Semifinals of this year’s Ivy League Tournament, and she was moved by the fight and the emotion the Crimson showed while almost pulling off the upset. Her opinion was only heightened upon meeting the team and getting an introduction into her players’ unique personalities. While she has only known them for less than a week, they’ve already given her a moment she expects she will never forget. As Moore and a number of team members took a picture after the coach’s introductory event, she told them: “This is it guys. This is day one; it’s going to be a great ride – just believe it.”

Are you left scrambling because it’s Senior Spring and you have no idea how to get into ~the chill zone~? Flyby has your back with these tips to get you started.
Eat Breakfast in Annenberg
Remember how excited you were to see the Great Hall of Harvard? How you felt like you were at Hogwarts and a hundred owls could swoop in at any moment? Maybe after three years, the overwhelming stress of freshman year has faded away, and you can now truly enjoy the magnificence of Annenberg’s architecture and daily hot breakfast. Or at the very least, mentally list reasons why your House dhall is better and avoid making eye contact with all the first-year students.
Reunite With Your First-Year Characters
Revive the overly optimistic vibes of early freshman year and call for a first-year suitemate dinner! How have you all changed or stayed the same? You can also spontaneously reach out to your Annenberg crush and finally ask them if they’d like to grab a meal with you. Or tell your freshman seminar professor that you switched concentrations and show your proctor that you are still a hot mess. #throwbacks
Pull an All-Nighter to Hang Out with Friends Instead of to Study
When was the last time you had an hours-long heart-to-heart with those you love best? In the spirit of senior spring, chuck the laptop and stay up all night talking to your closest friends. You can reflect on your time in college, or maybe even learn new things about each other that have managed to not come up in the past four years. (Like how your roommate never returned that dress she borrowed pre-pandemic.) This is one of your last chances to all be together, so make the most of it!
Do a Reverse River Run
Go to your first-year dorm and take a shot of your favorite non-alcoholic beverage — since the Yard is dry, of course ;). Legend says that drinking in the Yard is a transcendent experience whereby memories of your first year come rushing back. A senior told Maya that when she was a freshman, a group of people showed up at her door and asked if they could come inside to drink (which she politely declined).
Visit Mount Auburn Cemetery 
You may be questioning your existence since you handed in your thesis, but what better place to contemplate life than at the Mount Auburn Cemetery? See the intricate gravestones and beautiful scenery (it’s a great bird-watching site, too!), and go to Washington Tower for great views of Cambridge and Boston! You can also pack a lunch and a blanket and make a cute picnic out of it.
Send these ideas to your closest friends and check off as many of these as possible. While the future is uncertain, we hope that you will at least be able to enjoy your senior spring!
