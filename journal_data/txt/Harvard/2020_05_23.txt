After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study released its list of fellows for the 2020-2021 school year Friday, naming 42 scholars from a wide range of disciplines from health policy, climate change, and astronomy, to poetry and cartoons.
Radcliffe’s fellowship program, first established in 1960, provides fellows with academic and financial support as well as access to Harvard and Radcliffe resources. This year’s programming will be held virtually in light of the coronavirus pandemic, with the possibility of a residential component later in the year.
This year’s fellows were selected from a pool of more than 1400 applicants and hail from six different countries.
“Their creative work will change how we see the world. And they will pursue solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our society,” Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin said in the press release. “Their endeavors will be immeasurably enhanced by the unique intellectual cross-fertilization that takes place at Radcliffe.”
The fellows will also undertake a diverse range of projects during their time at Radcliffe. Will Mackin, a fiction writer and former special operations soldier, will work on a story collection based on his experiences in Afghanistan and New York. Alaa Murabit, a physician and United Nations High-Level Commissioner, will work on a project aimed at expanding women’s roles in peacemaking.
David Hemenway ’66, a professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health, will examine solutions to reduce gun violence.
This year’s fellowship program will also be the first held during executive director Claudia Rizzini's tenure. She joins Radcliffe after a post serving as the director for precision medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
As the rest of the University considers plans for either remote or on-campus learning in the fall, Brown-Nagin stressed the importance of Radcliffe’s mission during the ongoing pandemic.
“This fellowship class, taking shape amid a devastating pandemic, reflects our conviction that the cross-disciplinary exchange and deep exploration that Radcliffe enables are critically important to Harvard and for the wider world—especially in times like these, when we must confront unprecedented challenges,” Brown-Nagin said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s Student Experience Survey found students were dissatisfied with their transition to online learning and hope to return to campus this fall, according to a summary of the data presented this week.
The anonymous survey examined students’ virtual learning experience, health, wellbeing, and engagement with student life after the University’s move to remote instruction due to the global coronavirus outbreak. It had a 29.6 percent response rate, drawing 1,964 responses from April 26 to May 3.
Survey coordinators Jenny Y. Gan ’22 and Oliver S. York ’21 said they have discussed the survey results with administrators including Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke, who is leading FAS’s planning for fall 2020 alongside Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs. Gan and York also said they have shared the results with faculty deans and administrators from Harvard University Health Services.
According to Gan and York, key takeaways from the survey include data showing students’ dissatisfaction with their academic experience following the move off-campus. Students also said they lacked the necessary resources to have a successful academic experience, with many citing a lack of physical space to study.
Gan and York also said students reported that their overall emotional and physical health has declined. Nearly half of those surveyed reported that their physical health has worsened, and 81.1 percent of those surveyed reporting their emotional health has worsened. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and its resulting impacts, the students surveyed also reported new or worsening symptoms of anxiety and depression.
In response, Gan said the Council is working on addressing the negative impacts the pandemic has had on the physical and emotional health of students.
“Clearly, health and wellbeing have taken a hit since the evacuation off campus, and I think we're trying to think of ways to improve that and trying to plan meetings with HUHS and CAMHS for fall semester,” Gan said.
Engagement with student life has decreased over the course of this semester, per the survey results — both participation in residential life and extracurricular activities declined.
Echoing recent student petitions, the survey results indicated undergraduates’ displeasure with the possibility of more virtual learning, with many indicating a preference for a delayed semester on campus over a virtual semester. According to Gan and York, 45 percent of students surveyed said they were very likely to take a leave of absence in the event the fall semester is virtual.
Gan and York also said certain demographics were more likely to report considering a leave. The survey results indicated that rising seniors, students paying full tuition, and students studying the humanities are more likely to be considering a leave of absence.
The UC Student Experience Survey also asked students about their experiences with the universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system adopted by the College for spring 2020. The survey asked students to rate the fairness of the satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading policy both for themselves and for their peers.
“Generally people thought the grading policy was really fair, but what was a striking result was people thought it was more fair to their peers,” York said. “We see students recognizing that this situation has hit people differently, and a lot of their peers have had a hard time.”
According to Gan and York, they plan to meet with administrators from the Office of Undergraduate Education next week to continue to discuss the survey results to provide student input as details about the upcoming fall semester are discussed.
