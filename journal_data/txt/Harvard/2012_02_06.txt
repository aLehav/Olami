After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, several dozen male Harvard undergraduates received invitations for an invite-only event hosted by the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. While SAE still held its usual open and widely-publicized first rush event last Thursday, the invitations offered a select group of students entrance into the pre-rush event that took place the preceding Wednesday evening.
At first glance, SAE's hosting of an invite-only pre-rush event may seem like a worrying harbinger of a selection process starting to deteriorate into something akin to the closed punch process of final clubs. What effectively separates fraternities from final clubs, after all, is the difference between rushing and punching; everyone can rush, but only a few will be punched.
On closer inspection, however, this new pre-rush style of event appears merely to be a substantiation of the way fraternities and other social organizations have always worked. Reportedly, students who did not receive a pre-rush invite were still able to attend Wednesday’s event, despite its lack of publicity. Even so, the fact that the pre-rush event technically allowed non-invited students doesn’t undo the de facto result of this move. The reality is that if you weren't invited and you didn't know an invitee, the prospects for taking part in this special preview were slim. Rather than encouraging more students to rush and stimulating interest in SAE, pre-rush is problematic because it discourages those from rushing who didn't have an envelope slipped under their door. An invite-driven event advantages undergraduates with connections to the fraternity, and disadvantage those without.
Together, these factors exacerbate the already subjective nature of the selection process that is inherent to any social organization. Such organizations, be they fraternities or social clubs, survive by judging prospective members on their supposed ability to blend with their existing pool of members. This train of events will take place regardless of whether rush is open or not. Perhaps the most telling consequence of SAE’s pre-rush event is in reminding us that a fraternity’s selection process is ultimately not that different from that of a final club, which points to a larger social problem on campus.
Instead of focusing on the relatively inconsequential decision of SAE to door-drop invitations this year, our campus should use this occasion to consider the larger issue of gender discrimination within student organizations. Fraternity brothers often make a point of spelling out their organizations’ differences from male final clubs. Yet, like final clubs, they do not allow women to become members and their social spaces remain exclusionary ones during the day. At night, however, scantily dressed females are welcomed with open arms. When members of Greek institutions sought official recognition from the College last year, administrators replied that nothing has changed since 1984 when Harvard ceased to recognize them because they discriminate against women. We reaffirm our agreement with the College on this matter. The gender-based exclusion of women from fraternity membership continues to warrant official non-recognition of Greek institutions on campus.
In short, while SAE's invitations may have been merely just an extension of the status quo, they shine a light on the real problem with all-male social organizations at Harvard: female exclusion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I shuffled between various fire code-violating classrooms during my final shopping week at Harvard, I lamented that I had missed out on dozens of excellent courses over the past three years. There was still so much content knowledge I lacked, so many analytical and critical-reading skills I had yet to hone. But one element was still missing from most of the courses on my shopping list. No, it was not the job offer I could have more easily secured had I just taken CS50 or anything in the engineering department. This missing piece of my undergraduate education was social skills.
I concentrate in Social Studies. I have taken coursework that counts for the “Social Analysis” core (may it rest in peace). But in reality, while I have improved my ability to study and analyze social things, I am bad at participating in them myself. (Is that what you do? Participate in social things?) I take courses in General Education areas like “U.S. in the World” and “Societies of the World.” But what about “You, Currently Living in the U.S.” or “You, Functioning in Societies of the World”? I say, sign me up.
I think I speak too loudly, but people don’t generally come close enough for me to ask. I am awful at laundry. I also apparently have poor taste in clothing; the only times I receive compliments on my attire are when I am out of laundry and must reach to the depths of my closet for fancier options. Friends from home ask me about the accuracy of the depiction of Harvard in the movie, “The Social Network.” I respond: What’s a movie? Perhaps most tragically, I will almost definitely graduate from Harvard without knowing how to cook. Harvard could help here; it offers a class and public lectures on Science and Cooking. But what about a course on the basics of cooking? We students could use fewer lectures on “Exploring thickeners to manipulate mouthfeel” or “Proteins & Enzymes: Transglutaminase,” and more on subjects like “Boiling Water: The Truth about Adding Salt,” or “Eggs: A Primer.” A “Social Skills” General Education requirement would mitigate some of the shortcomings of Harvard’s current course offerings. Unfortunately, Harvard is notoriously slow at implementing initiatives for new curricula, so this is an unlikely addition to the General Education program.
But then there’s public speaking. I become nervous during the first week of section when I must introduce myself with vital details (e.g., name/year/concentration) and a “fun fact” (e.g., I was born on Friday the 13th. This is my definition of “fun”). This spring’s public speaking course, Expository Writing 40: Public Speaking Practicum, offers instruction in a skill that is highly important for students’ future professional and social lives (e.g., speaking in front of other people and not just criticizing things behind the comfy façade of a Crimson article). According to the Expos 40 website, however, over 160 students applied for just 45 spots in the class. I imagine many students here gave high school valedictory speeches, but there is still high demand for additional learning opportunities.
Public speaking may be a practical and social skill, but it aligns with the goals of the liberal arts as well—aiding those who give lectures, attend conferences, and defend theses. But oratory is one area in which Harvard currently lacks opportunities. In addition to Expos 40, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning trains undergraduate Speaking Tutors and hosts a Program in Speaking and Learning for teaching fellows and professors. Of course, students give presentations in seminars and sections. But Harvard should expand formal and informal public speaking instruction, perhaps by incorporating it into freshman Expos courses or Wintersession activities.
Bolstering Harvard’s offerings in public speaking would not undermine its commitment to the liberal arts; rather, it would reinforce it. Harvard students who speak clearly and persuasively will leave Harvard better educated than they arrived. Then, perhaps after phasing these courses in, Harvard could consider adding Social Skills 101: Coughing in One’s Sleeve and Social Skills 55: Dealing with Being Quadded (spring only). After all, we could all use some help in those departments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, February 2, the United Nations declared an end to the famine in the Horn of Africa that killed tens of thousands of people in the last nine months. With an unstable political situation and 2.3 million people still in need of food, there is a high likelihood that famine conditions will return to the region within the next 100 days. While natural occurrences such as drought may have initiated the famine, its severity and persistence can be attributed to people and politics. Indeed, the situation in the Horn of Africa is a perfect storm of environmental, local, and international dynamics, topped off by the presence of a militant Islamist group blockading aid efforts.
For this very reason, it is imperative that we consider multi-dimensional solutions to the crisis in the Horn of Africa. The need will not end with the UN’s declaration last Friday, nor will the political situation change over night. Activists have called on the media and on donors to continue to pay attention and give money to maintain a response to the humanitarian needs, and we agree. But as members of the Harvard community, we should all seek to encourage further academic engagement to derive holistic, multi-disciplinary solutions.
The UN reserves the label of “famine” for only the most severe emergencies—at least two deaths per 10,000 people per day, at least 30 percent of children with acute malnutrition, and at least 20 percent of the population unable to reach its food need. When the UN declared famine last July, the region, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti, had faced nearly two successive years of almost no rainfall and over 12 million individuals needed food aid. Somalia fared the worst, as years of political instability and war have left millions displaced and al-Shabaab, the group with de facto control over the country, has blocked food aid and shut down refugee camps.
Indeed, al-Shabaab is the most obvious reason why simple humanitarian solutions cannot end the famine in Somalia. Al-Shabaab has denied access to aid organizations, evicted refugee camps, and prompted widespread violence throughout the region, taking credit for bombings in Somalia and neighboring countries. Because of this, al-Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations, which puts Somalia on the map in the U.S. war on terror. The African Union has had a force in Somalia since 2007, and Kenya invaded in 2011, introducing regional complexity to the humanitarian crisis. But U.S. policy towards the region is additionally sensitive due to the Black Hawk Down tragedy in 1993, when 18 U.S. soldiers died on a mission in Mogadishu. For these reasons, no matter what develops in Somalia, the U.S. is unlikely to ever put troops on the ground, leaving Kenyans and other African nations to deal with al-Shabaab. However, as Davidson College Professor Kenneth J. Menkhaus points out, while responding to al-Shabaab is necessary, responding to the immediate humanitarian crisis will draw attention to Shabaab’s inhumane acts, weakening its stronghold in the country. Sensitivity to the historical and political situation in Somalia is key to effective intervention, but it should not detract from the importance of fighting acute malnutrition and food shortages.
Much work has been done to study food security in the developing world and many of the manmade causes of this famine are known. Soaring food prices have played a large role. Last August, the prices of maize and sorghum, two important staples, were 84 percent and 240 percent higher than a year before. In addition to poor local harvests, U.S. production of ethanol and the diversion of crops for the production of biofuels have exacerbated price increases. A systemic underinvestment in agriculture in East and Central Africa has led to decreased agricultural capacity in recent years. While up to 60 percent of the populations of many of these nations depend on agriculture for their livelihood, many governments devote only five percent of national expenditure to agriculture. At the same time, investment in infrastructure is vitally important for the transportation of crops and fertilizer. Robert L. Paarlberg, a professor at Wellesley College and an Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard, has been mapping the impact of the under-usage of biotechnology in Africa. Scientific advances in developing seeds resistant to drought and insects would greatly improve the region’s food production, where farmers are now less productive on a per-capita basis than they were in 1970. Paarlberg posits that the spread of such technology has been held up by the richer countries in which they were developed. The usage of newly developed surveillance techniques, a focus of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, could allow for improved early warning systems.
We now know many of the causes of famine, but coordinating the response in a tense political climate remains challenging for humanitarian organizations. Consequently, donors who want to support the cause are left unsure about which organizations can reach people in need, who can bring about immediate relief, and how we can transition to long-term change. As a university, our mandate must be to reach greater understanding of the crisis by bringing together experts from many disciplines. Harvard has responded in important ways to humanitarian crises in the past, from fundraising to utilizing its academic expertise, and we commend the important strides it has made in responding to this crisis. I hope the university continues to leverage its academic capital to bring about an end to one of the most complex recurring crises to face humanity.

Dear President Faust,
In 2008, at an inspiring rally with Vice President Albert A. Gore '69, you challenged the Harvard community to make “Green the new Crimson.” You followed up your call to action by announcing an ambitious plan to reduce the University’s greenhouse gas emissions by thirty percent by 2016.
Since then, an enthusiastic culture of sustainability has emerged at Harvard. Student representatives now educate their peers about recycling and food waste in the dining halls. The faculty make a conscientious effort to turn off projectors and lights in classrooms. The University has already demonstrated significant progress in cutting its overall emissions.
But while we at Harvard may feel a growing sense of accomplishment, has the planet really noticed? On the macro scale climate change is continuing to get worse. Global emissions in 2010 alone increased 5.9 percent—the largest increase ever recorded. That's roughly 500,000 million more tons of carbon dioxide than the year before—orders of magnitude more than the amount of reductions Harvard has achieved since 2006.  Even if our sustainability campaigns eventually succeed in a larger sense—inculcating environmental values in Harvard students and inspiring other institutions to follow suit—we at Harvard would be kidding ourselves if we think that our actions are making the slightest difference to the problem we’re ostensibly trying to address: halting perilous climate change.
We do not mean to poo-poo Harvard's efforts, or to be defeatist. Rather, we suggest that the university channel its resources toward substantially more meaningful efforts that can actually move the global dial.
President Faust, we are faced with a unique moment in history, in which global economic stagnation and lack of political will are allowing this very crucial challenge to go completely unattended. We urge you to fill this vacuum by seriously revamping our sustainability vision so that it more explicitly leverages the public good that Harvard provides best—innovation and ideas. The way we see it, Harvard’s comparative advantage when it comes to the climate change problem is not in emissions reduction, but rather in knowledge production. If we can channel Harvard’s research, education, and public outreach capacities in a more focused and unified way, we can decrease carbon emissions more significantly than the most ambitious emissions goals ever could.
We might start by incentivizing climate-related research, with an emphasis on inter-disciplinary projects. A challenge as complex and multi-faceted as climate change will require not only the contribution of many disciplines—such as the fundamental sciences, engineering, and economics—but also collaboration across them. So many existing research programs, however, remain siloed within individual schools and disciplines. Without coordinated leadership from the top, these efforts can only move forward in fits and starts.
This is where we believe you can make a tremendous difference. Well-designed university-wide incentive schemes could motivate faculty and students to dedicate more time thinking about and generating solutions climate change. Smart policies like breaks from teaching, seed funding support, and overhead credits for professors who engage in climate and energy related research could go a long way toward achieving a critical mass on this initiative.
In addition, with its arsenal of Nobel-prize winning hard-scientists, Harvard could make major contributions towards radically improving today’s renewable energy technologies. By incentivizing research ideas which are potentially game-changing in the long run but economically unattractive in the short run, you could help Harvard’s researchers fill in the gap that businesses (with or without a price on carbon) never could. By doing so, we’d help make possible the order of magnitude improvements in cost and performance that will be necessary for renewables to one day displace fossil fuels subsidy-free.
On the curricular front, Harvard could provide more support for undergraduates who are interested in sustainable development and climate change. For example: by offering an “energy innovation” concentration [EM1] or by establishing special fellowships for students who decide to spend their summers working on climate-related research or interning with environmental non-governmental organizations or clean-tech start-ups.
Finally, to truly maximize the impact of this climate change initiative, Harvard must reach out beyond its gates. Beyond the obvious first-step of establishing partnerships with industry to facilitate the rapid commercialization of its energy technology breakthroughs, Harvard should also be more explicit in its call for policy action on climate change—both at the state and Federal level. Even if Congress has decided to punt on this issue for the time being, that is no excuse for the world’s leading academic institution to stand blithely by.
President Faust, we believe it is time for a newer and bolder climate change initiative—one which better utilizes Harvard’s comparative advantage in idea generation. We are convinced that the Harvard community has the resources and the willpower to do much more than it already does. We ask you to lead the charge.

Mention Michael J. Sandel’s popular course “Justice,” and most Harvard students will probably picture the dark wooden grandeur of Sanders Theatre.
But “Justice” has found a home not only in Memorial Hall. With the launch of duplicate courses in Beijing and Tokyo, Sandel’s curriculum designed to introduce students to major philosphers and provoke debate over moral questions has gone international.
Through the aid of technology and of simultaneous translation, “Justice” students in three countries now debate ethical dilemmas in real time with each other as well.
Eight students apiece from Fudan University in Shanghai, China, the University of Tokyo in Japan, and Harvard take part in the global discussion by video chat. The ensuing intercultural discussion is televised by NHK, the national television network of Japan. Five episodes of the show have been taped so far.
“Justice” has become such a craze in China that China Newsweek named Sandel the “most influential foreign figure” of the year in 2011 and audiences across East Asia scalp tickets to hear him speak, according to a column in the New York Times.
Sandel has visited the “Justice” classes in Tokyo and Beijing. In an email, he wrote that his goal in expanding the reach of his curriculum “is to foster global discussion of philosophical questions that bear on contemporary issues, and to promote learning across cultures.”
The same sort of ethical debates that take place in Sanders Theatre are conducted abroad, Sandel wrote, and the foreign universities have mimicked Harvard’s use of teaching fellows and weekly discussion sections to teach the course.
Shalini K. Rao ’12, one of the eight Harvard students who participates in the televised class, said that the idea of working with student who had a “different cultural thesis” enticed her to join the international discussion after taking “Justice” at Harvard.
“It’s not okay to assume that everyone in the room thinks that torture is wrong. It’s not automatic to assume that everyone will know where you’re coming from if you’re speaking on your intuition,” said Rao, who is also a Crimson editorial writer.
According to Sandel, the transnational class has discussed ethical dilemmas that arose from the Japanese tsunami and nuclear disaster last year; issues of justice in fighting terrorism; inequality, taxation, and distributive justice; and the moral limits of markets over its first five sessions.
“They aren’t Chinese problems, they aren’t Japanese problems, they aren’t American problems. They’re fundamentally human ones that we all face,” said participant Duc P. Luu ’12.
Luu said that he has been pleased to find that he is able to see eye-to-eye with his fellow students in the video-linked class despite the oceans, languages, and time zones that separate them.
“We have been surprised again and again,” Luu said, “by how much common ground we’ve been able to find.”

Lately, Kelsey A. Beck ’14 has been in training. From eating well to doing cardio step workouts in the Malkin Athletic Center, Beck has been following a routine that might look similar to an athlete’s practice regimen.
But Beck’s training also includes brushing up her knowledge of current events and practicing piano every day. She is preparing not for a sports game but for a beauty pageant—the Miss Boston 2012 competition which she will enter in two weeks.
Beck, originally from Florida, is not the first Harvard student to compete in the Miss Boston pageant. Last year, Loren Galler Rabinowitz ’10 won the Boston event, became Miss Massachusetts 2011, and competed in the televised Miss America Pageant. If Beck wins at her upcoming pageant, she too will go on to compete for the title of Miss Massachusetts, in addition to taking home a $1500 academic scholarship.
Beck decided to enter this pageant—her first—as an attempt to lighten the financial burden that her parents must shoulder to pay for her Harvard tuition.
“It’s just been real godly timing for me to enter this,” Beck said.
While Beck has not yet competed in a pageant herself, she is no stranger to the Miss America Pageant. Her mother, Barbara Ivey Beck, won the title of Miss Florida in 1971.
“It really put me through college,” Barbara Beck said. adding that she did not try to persuade her daughter to follow in her footsteps. “I never pushed that avenue, or even encouraged it because it’s such a personal thing.... I never encouraged her to do this unless she wanted to.”
Beck will compete against ten other young women, some of whom, she said, have probably competed in pageants before.
“Being from Harvard makes me unique, but I’m sure they all have their strengths and components that make them unique,” Beck said.
In addition to vying for scholarship money, Beck said she hopes she can use the pageant as a platform to advocate for the rights of elderly citizens.
Beck, an English concentrator who hopes to attend law school and eventually practice elder care law, said that her compassion for the elderly springs from her own family’s experience moving her grandfather into a nursing home.
“It was a real difficult journey,” Beck’s mother said. “I think that really influenced her, watching the choices and decisions we had to make.”
At 5’9”, Beck looks like a model. But she said that the ideal pageant contestant has much more than looks.
“I think that the Miss America organization really empowers young women to be strong, independent, driven, educated, and passionate,” Beck said. “I feel like it’s an extension of, you know, being a Harvard student.”
Beck’s mother echoed her daughter’s assertion that her Harvard background and her Miss Boston bid are compatible.
“For this to be something that somebody out of Harvard does, it sounds like an incongruity, but it’s not,” Barbara Beck said.

As “Grimm Legacies” drew to a close on Saturday, attendees took one final look in the “magic mirror”—a prop that was the centerpiece of two days of discussions on topics such as violence in “Hansel and Gretel” and metamorphosis in “Beauty and the Beast.”
The annual symposium, sponsored by the Folklore and Mythology department, was held at the Barker Center in honor of the 200th anniversary of the publication of tales collected by brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. “Grimms’ Fairy Tales,” which was originally published in German, includes classic stories such as “Rapunzel” and “Cinderella.”
“[This is] a way for our students to participate, to give papers, to be involved, to see what people go on and do in this field, because of course their parents might ask, ‘You’re majoring in what?’” said Deborah D. Foster, a senior lecturer in Folklore and Mythology.
University of Minnesota professor Jack D. Zipes, who has authored numerous books on the Grimms’ tales, delivered the keynote address Friday on the pair’s legacy. “The Brothers Grimm have [had] a very unusual reception in Germany and a lot of their fairy tales have been sanitized and infantilized and really not been acknowledged as profound contributions to German culture,” Zipes said. “I showed, however, that there is another level in Germany where they take these stories extremely seriously and produce great illustrations based on their work.”
Folklore and Mythology Chair Maria Tatar delivered Saturday’s welcome address, entitled “Magic and Mythical: 200 Years of Brothers Grimm.”
“I wanted to show how [the tales’] magic has a mythical quality to it,” said Tatar, who teaches Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature.” “They take us to the great existential mysteries, questions about death, reproduction, love, romance, power, all of these fundamental matters,” Tatar said.
Cara Zimmerman ’05, a doctoral candidate in art history at the University of Delaware, said she attended the symposium because it combined her current academic work with her undergraduate concentration in Folklore and Mythology.
“I liked seeing the intersection of different scholarly works and seeing how the intersection of these stories comes together for a larger community not just in academia,” Zimmerman said.
Tatar said that she hopes the symposium’s participants had gained new perspective on fairy tales and folklore. “The takeaway will be that these stories make the human world but they also make the world human,” she said.

As two rivals butted heads in a championship rematch, football devotees and neophytes, Giants fans and Patriots die-hards gathered across campus to bear witness to the unfolding of Super Bowl XLVI—an event which ultimately left Giants supporters and Patriots detractors triumphant while Pats fans were disappointed yet again.
Viewing parties took many forms, ranging from screening in House Masters’ residences to House Committee-organized events in dining halls.
Approximately 100 students squeezed into the cramped penthouse of Quincy House Masters Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke to cheer on their favorite team.
“It’s so great that we have House Masters that really like to participate in student life,” said Ling Lin ’12, a former Quincy House Committee chair and Crimson design editor. “Instead of watching the show separately, we’re together.”
Throughout the night, the House Masters gave away Patriots team flags and held raffles for an assortment of gifts.
“Deb and Lee are spectacular,” said Collin A. Jones ’12, one of the 40 or so students who tolerated the penthouse’s space crunch to watch the entire game.
At the Quincy Masters’ party, students ranked the Super Bowl commercials from one to five. “Dieting Dogs,” an advertisement for Volkswagen, was a favorite among many.
Deborah Gehrke said the party was an opportunity to have “all [her] students together.”
“I wanted to have as many students as I possibly could cheering for the Patriots. Giants fans were welcome, too,” Deborah Gehrke said jokingly. “I love hosting this party.”
Around 30 Currier residents congregated in the Fishbowl as the championship game played on the room’s large central screen. Many brought their dinner trays in from the dining hall to catch the game’s opening kickoff.
“The Fishbowl [has] a great sense of House community,” Robert O. A. Nash ’12 said.
Mather Common Room drew a crowd of roughly 40 students and tutors. Leverett House screened the Super Bowl in the dining hall, as did Adams and Pforzheimer.
Dining halls specially tailored their dinner menus in honor of the evening’s main event, offering students a meal of sporting event staples such as hot dogs, nachos, and french fries.
“It’s like everything fried and good in this world in this one night,” said Katherine M. Woodbury ’14, who watched the game in the Pforzheimer dining hall.
While Quincy residents grilled their own burgers, Adams students crunched on popcorn and sipped free beer.
But for many the experience of watching the dramatic game with their peers trumped even Harvard University Dining Services’ special fare.
“It was very thrilling—very nail-biting,” said Sagar S. Desai ’15, who rooted for the Giants.
Ben T. Martin ’15, a Patriots fan, left a bit more disappointed than Desai.
“I’m emotionally devastated,” he said.
Right after Patriots quarterback Tom Brady ran the last play, celebratory shouts of “Go, Giants!” reverberated throughout the Yard.
“The first time we beat the Patriots, everyone was surprised,” said Glenn R. Thrope, a Business School student who cheered for the Giants and rushed to the Yard moments after the game ended. “Now that we beat them a second time, it’s clear we’re not a fluke.”

The Undergraduate Council announced that its new Loans Pilot Program—an initiative which will enable the Council to bankroll more student-run programming—will go live starting this week.
“We didn’t like turning down organizations that wanted money for fund-raisers,” UC Treasurer Jonathan Y.H. Li ’14 said. “This loans program allows us to support them.”
Previously, the Undergraduate Council, which funds many student groups on campus, could only provide monetary grants for not-for-profit events that directly served Harvard students. The creation of this new program allows the Council to now allocate money—in the form of loans which must be repaid within three weeks—for charitable fundraisers, projects targeting the greater Boston community, and other for-profit events.
The Council has designated $10,000 of its over $500,000 budget, which is drawn from student fees, for such loans.
“Because we receive our finances from students, everything has to benefit the students,” said Li, who represents Mather House. “We’re happy to fund information sessions and meet-and-greet events, but we’ve never been able to fund anything that makes a profit because we wouldn’t know where that money goes.”
UC Finance Committee Chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14, a Kirkland House representative, said that he is glad the Council will now be able to fund a greater variety of student activities.
“The UC has never been able to support fundraisers, but now we can,”  said Marotta, who  spearheaded  the  loan initiative along with his committee. “Events as simple as bake sales can now be funded by this loans program.”
In October, the Council passed legislation for the loans program, which was sponsored by Leverett Representative Nicholas Oo ’13, with a landslide majority of 29 to 1.
The new program, however, circumvents rather than amends existing UC funding guidelines.
To apply for loans, students must fill out a form that can be downloaded from the UC’s website. Students will then be invited to an interview with the UC’s Finance Committee.
Unlike grant applications, which require previous organizational standing, Marotta said that students can use this program to generate initial income.
“People can apply right now. The portal’s open,” said Marotta. “These are funds that are just waiting to be tapped into, and we’re eager to help student groups get started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chopstick rested stiffly on his nose as he placed an egg on top of it. Slowly, the Happy Chef added another egg as the audience waited silently in anticipation. The crowd burst into applause as he added yet a third egg to his balancing act before circling the stage.
Happy Chef—a Chinese acrobat who is known as Xiaodi Yang off-stage and has practiced his art for 60 years since age six—was one of many performers at the 2012 Ivy League Spring Festival Gala at John Hancock Hall this past Saturday.
Organized by the Harvard Chinese Students and Scholars Association, the event featured performances by students from all eight Ivy League schools, an elementary school choir from the Hubei Province in China, and professional artists from around the world.
Roughly 1,100 spectators attended the event, which celebrated the Chinese New Year that took place on Jan. 23.
“I don’t think Americans realize how big Chinese New Year is in China and what a big production [it is],” said Lydia M. Chen, associate director of Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. “You have to go to a big, gigantic performance with lots of singing, juggling, and cross-talk. All those events are typical of new year festivities.”
The four-hour event also included performances by Harvard students from the College, the School of Public Health, the Kennedy School, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“It’s really great to see students showing their talents in other ways than their academic pursuits,” said Chen, who attended the event with her family.
The HCSSA has hosted Spring Festival celebrations for many years, but only included other schools last year. Leizhi Sun, president of HCSSA and a doctoral candidate in applied physics, said that he believed it was important to create a community for Chinese students studying abroad.
The show fostered a sense of community beyond the student performers, evoking memories of home for some audience members as well.
“It made me feel like I was back in Beijing,” said Chen.
Lydia Ding ’15, who like Chen grew up in China and attended the event, was reminded of her Chinese New Year celebrations with her family.
“I spent Chinese New Year with my family this year, but it’s so special to me that I wanted to celebrate it with my friends as well,” Ding said. Ding hosted students from Princeton who traveled to Boston to attend the event.
“This was a fantastic event,” said Sun. “I’m very happy with the turnout.”
In a letter addressed to the Gala attendees, University President Drew G. Faust wrote that the event was a “wonderful opportunity to meet new people, reconnect with old friends, and celebrate the vibrant culture of China as we enter the year of the dragon.”
The Gala organizers also received congratulatory letters from Massachusetts Senator Scott P. Brown and Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick.
“Massachusetts is proud to have to have a robust Chinese community that adds so much to the cultural vitality and diversity of the Commonwealth,” Patrick wrote. “This year’s gala is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the diversity and strength of your heritage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 15 of its 22 games so far, the Harvard men’s basketball team has scored at least 63 points, averaging 65.7 points per game. But Columbia stalled the Crimson offense Saturday night, as Harvard failed to find its scoring stroke, finishing with its second lowest point total of the Ivy season so far.
Although the Lions held Harvard to just three more points than the 54 the Crimson scored in its defensive battle against Dartmouth on Jan. 21, Harvard was never really threatened by the Columbia offense, taking down the Lions, 57-52, at Lavietes Pavilion.
Junior point guard Brandyn Curry started off the scoring with a three pointer 34 seconds into the first half, and Harvard never gave up its early lead. Although Columbia tied it up three times—at three, five, and 16 points—the Crimson was able to close out its sixth conference win of the season, adding to the program’s best start of all time and securing its third straight 20-win season.
Harvard also improved upon the longest home winning streak in program history, pushing the mark to 25 consecutive wins, good for the fourth best current home winning streak in the nation. The Crimson also earned its first-ever 6-0 mark in league play and is currently riding an eight-game winning streak.
“Anytime you’re undefeated in conference play this time of year, it’s a pretty significant moment,” Amaker said. “To be able to do it for the first time here for us with that particular group is pretty special.”
The Crimson continues to lead the league defensively, allowing an average of 53.4 points per game.
FREE FOR ALL
Although Harvard earned an impressive 32 trips to the line Saturday night, the Crimson failed to capitalize on its free-throw attempts, going 21 for 32. Harvard struggled in the first half in particular, going 7 for 12 (58.3 percent) in the frame.
“We didn’t shoot foul shots well,” Amaker said. “That was really one of our Achilles’ heels tonight in terms of us not being able to stretch things out.”
“Foul shooting can be contagious, like anything else in basketball,” he continued. “If some of your better shooters go up there and somehow they don’t knock them down, it’s amazing how it flows in that direction.”
Sophomore sharpshooter Laurent Rivard got to the line early for the Crimson, drawing two fouls on shots behind the arc in the first five minutes of play.
But Rivard, who entered the game shooting 37 of 45 from the stripe, knocked down just three of his attempts in the opening minutes, setting the tone for Harvard’s worst free-throw shooting performance of the season.
“It was one of these nights,” Rivard said. “The first one I missed, I didn’t follow through according to Coach. It was just a bad night for me, but I just tried to keep shooting, and it paid off a little bit.”
Although Columbia only made it to the line four times on the night, the Lions fared much better in limited trips, finishing all eight of their free-throw attempts.
OFF BALANCE
The Crimson typically boasts one of the most balanced offenses in the league, with 10 players averaging at least a field goal per game. But Saturday night was all Rivard, Curry, and co-captain Keith Wright. The trio combined for 47 of Harvard’s 57 points, with Rivard leading the way with 20 points. Junior forward Kyle Casey contributed an additional five points for the Crimson.
It was not that the rest of the Harvard squad was missing shots—it was that they were not taking them. Aside from Curry, Wright, and Rivard, who each took at least 10 shots, the rest of the Crimson combined for six attempts from the field. Casey took three shots, and co-captain Oliver McNally managed just one, both season lows.
“We weren’t as aggressive as we should have been, trying to score while we were running our offense,” Amaker said. “[Columbia] did a nice job packing it in on us, making it tough for us to drive or even feed the post.”
The rest of the Harvard team struggled to score, combining for just five points, all from the free-throw line. Co-captain Oliver McNally contributed four of those points to help the Crimson secure its advantage late in the game.
And it wasn’t until 12:14 had expired in the second half that Harvard got its first bench point, courtesy of a free throw from rookie Steve Moundou-Missi.
Columbia’s bench had more of an impact Saturday night, outscoring its Harvard counterpart, 16-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team handily defeated Cornell, 71-60, at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night. But that isn’t to say the squad played a perfect game, or anywhere near one, as the Crimson struggled to consistently score against the Big Red.
To many, Harvard’s offensive struggles will be hidden by the 71 points it scored, its highest total of 2012. But 29 of those points came off of 34 free throw attempts in a tightly-called ballgame. Had the Crimson not shot the lights out from the line, the result would have been much closer.
On offense, Harvard had its worst shooting performance of the young Ivy League season, going 18 of 44 from the field and six for 20 from behind the arc. The worst dry spell of the night came during the final five minutes of the first half and the first five of the second period.
During that ten minute span, the Crimson went two for nine from the field and committed six turnovers. On the night, the team had more turnovers, 16, than assists, 12.
“We turned the ball over too much,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We didn’t have the attention to detail needed, and I was very disappointed with that. I wish we could play more consistently throughout the game.”
Coming into Friday’s contest, Harvard was expected to dominate down low against Cornell’s frontcourt. And while junior Kyle Casey did rack up 13 points in 16 minutes, both he and co-captain Keith Wright were hamstrung by fouls and turnovers.
The nine-point outing by Wright, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, represented another below-average performance from the senior in conference play.
After scoring double-digits in 12 of his first 18 matchups this year, Wright was held to single digits for his fourth straight game.
With its bigs saddled with foul trouble, the Crimson needed its shooters to step up.
Sophomore Laurent Rivard did just that. Rivard went five of nine from the field and three of seven from deep, tallying a team-high 16 points. The marksman also stole the ball thrice, twice turning the extra possession into a fast break layup by himself.
Meanwhile, freshman Corbin Miller, who entered Friday’s contest shooting a blistering 60.7 percent from beyond the arc, hit a cold streak Friday night. The rookie got a career-high 21 minutes but made poor use of them, going zero for seven, all from deep, on the night. Miller’s only two points came late in the game from the charity stripe.
FRESH FOUR
While much of the rookie class skipped the game to prep for Freshman Formal, four freshmen ballplayers showed their moves on the court. Miller, Wes Saunders, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Jonah Travis combined to play 69 minutes—more playing time than they had received in any of the previous four Ivy matchups—though many of those minutes came after the starters had established comfortable, double-digit leads and while Casey and Wright battled foul trouble. In different ways, each rookie took advantage of the time to prove why they deserve to be stalwarts on the squad.
Saunders’ potential contributions to the team were encapsulated by the final play of the first half. With seconds left, the rookie converted an athletic layup attempt to regain the momentum for the Crimson heading into halftime. Saunders is one of few Harvard players who can create off of the dribble and provide an offensive spark.
Moundou-Missi proved once again why he is a quintessential Amaker player. While he took only two shots Friday, Moundou-Missi was consistently in the right spot on defense, garnering a steal and a block in the process. He also played strong on offense, earning seven trips to the free throw line where he converted all his attempts.
Travis played a similar game, not registering a single shot from the field. Still, he provided solid minutes when the starting big men needed a rest.
HISTORY LESSON
With Friday’s win, Harvard moved to 5-0, its strongest start to conference play in thirty years. That 1980-1981 squad won its first five Ivy contest before faltering, losing five of its last nine conference matches.
Friday’s win also pushed the Crimson to 19-2, an opening mark that hasn’t been seen since the Truman administration. The 1945-46 iteration notched its 19th win against Chelsea Naval Hospital. That team was the last to make the NCAA tournament, where it lost to NYU and Ohio State in the then-not-as-big dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4 Harvard men’s squash team’s six-hour bus ride home from Ithaca, N.Y. could have felt a lot longer.
Coming off of a big win over then-No. 4 Rochester, the Crimson (13-2, 4-1 Ivy) came through once again this weekend, bumping its winning streak up to three straight matches with the road victories over No. 6 Cornell and No. 15 Columbia, 5-4 and 9-0, respectively.
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 4
In the highly anticipated matchup between two top-10 teams, the Crimson just sneaked by with a 5-4 win over Cornell (10-4, 3-2) Sunday afternoon on the Belkin Squash Courts in Ithaca, N.Y. The match was close, but clutch victories from freshmen Tyler Olsen and Julian Kirby helped seal a slight edge in Harvard’s favor.
“We knew [the contest at] Cornell was a big match,” said junior co-captain Jason Michas, who played at the No. 9 spot for the Crimson. “They were one point behind us in the rankings [last year], and we knew they got a really strong recruiting class this year. We knew they were a good team.”
The Big Red took an early lead, with Harvard dropping four of its first five matches. But Olsen—playing at the No. 5 spot for Harvard—picked up the slack. Despite going down, 2-1, in games, the rookie came back to win, 3-2.
“Olsen came up big for us,” Michas said. “It was a really close match.... We knew if Olsen could win that match, we could win the whole thing.”
At the No. 1 spot, sophomore Ali Farag continued his winning ways, taking his match, 3-0, and putting Harvard within a match of the Big Red.
“It was a tough match that we came out a little slow for,” co-captain Will Ahmed said. “But our…guys really played well and showed a lot of resiliency.”
Kirby won his match in four games, coming back from an 8-6 deficit in the final frame to earn the victory. That final game went into extra points, with Kirby coming away with a 12-10 win and tying the overall match score at four individual matches apiece.
Sophomore Gary Power—playing at the No. 4 spot—was left with the task of finishing off the match for Harvard.
“Power is a consistent player,” Michas said. “We are confident in him being the last guy on the court.”
Power won his match in four games, pushing the Crimson to a slight, 5-4, final edge over Cornell.
“[Both players in that final match] were hitting the ball hard, but Power weathered the storm,” Michas said. “He battled it out and pulled off that last win for us.”
With the win, Harvard extended its unbeaten streak to three games.
“We were down, and we climbed back into the match and proved that we are a strong team,” Michas said. “We are excited about going forward with this win.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
In the Crimson’s first match of the weekend, Harvard took on a less formidable opponent, Columbia (5-6, 1-2), on Friday. And Harvard easily downed the Lions, who started their varsity squash program last season, in the first meeting on the squash court between the two schools.
Because Columbia is a new program, the matchup between the Crimson and the Lions took place offsite at the Street Squash Courts in New York City, N.Y.
“We played with the Street Squash kids before we got on the court,” Michas said. “It got people excited to play, and it was a nice way to start the weekend.”
The Crimson powered past Columbia with a 9-0 sweep, with Farag earning a notable fifth straight victory at the No. 1 spot. The sophomore—who extended his winning streak to six before the weekend was over—has yet to lose a match for the Crimson.
“We ended up winning, 9-0, and we needed to do that,” Michas said. “It was a nice match for us to play.”
Two freshmen had notable performances at Columbia. Defeating his opponent in three games—11-1, 11-1, and 11-9, respectively—Olsen brought home the most dominant victory for the Crimson at the No. 5 spot. After defeating his Lion opponent at the No. 7 spot, Kirby had notched his 11th win of the year, a team high.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team steamrolled through New York this past weekend, as all nine members of the squad had perfect weekends against Ivy rivals Columbia and Cornell.
“We’ve had two weeks off, and we’ve been training really hard, so it was good to get back on court and play some opponents,” co-captain Cece Cortes said.
With its undefeated record, the No. 1 Crimson (12-0, 5-0 Ivy), has a strong shot of capturing the conference title.
“Obviously we have our eye on the prize, on winning the Ivy League title,” junior Natasha Kingshott said.  “We take each match at a time, [and] we can’t look too far ahead. But we are feeling good, and everything is coming together for the pinnacle of our season.”
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0
In continuing its long road trip through New York, Harvard played No. 7 Cornell (9-3, 2-1 Ivy) on Sunday afternoon in Ithaca.
The Crimson defeated the Big Red, 9-0, capping off a perfect 18-0 weekend for Harvard in its Ancient Eight play.
“We won 9-0, but that doesn’t really reflect how we played. There were some really tight matches,” Cortes said.
No. 5 Kingshott dropped her first game 11-9, but came back to take the matchup by winning her next three games.
Junior Laura Gemmell had a tough matchup against Cornell’s Jaime Laird, as she found herself tied at one game apiece. But the junior took control in the following two games and went on to a 3-1 victory.
“Laura Gemmell has been battling an injury, and in her match today against Cornell, she played incredibly well and toughed it out,” Kingshott said. “We all respect her so much.”
Gemmell insists that her back injury is something she has been able to manage for the last couple of months.
“I’ve had back pain for a while, and I’m taking care of it,” Gemmell said. “I don’t think it really affected me in my match.”
Like her team’s overall record, Gemmell is also individually undefeated so far this season.
“I just take it one match at a time,” Gemmel said. “I don’t really think about that I’m undefeated.”
Freshman No 1. Amanda Sobhy easily swept her matchup, 11-5, 11-4, 11-5, for the 3-0 victory.
“Amanda is such a beautiful payer to watch. She is an inspiration to us all,” Kingshott said of her teammate.
The Crimson has never lost to Cornell, and Sunday’s victory ran the all-time record to 18-0.
Harvard will face stiffer competition next weekend, as it faces No. 10 Brown and No. 2 in what is expected to be the de facto Ivy League championship.
“Everyone is very pleased with how we’ve been playing and all our hard work has been paying off,” Kingshott said.  “We’re excited to keep it going.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
In the first matchup of the weekend against Columbia on Friday in New York, N.Y., all but one of the Crimson’s players captured 3-0 matches.
This is the first year that the Lions have had a varsity squash team, but even though Columbia might not be the most experienced team, the Crimson made sure not to look past them.
“We always have the upmost respect for our opponents,” Kingshott said. “You can never underestimate your opponents.... Obviously, we’re going to be the target, and so we need to take that in stride and be confident in our ability.”
Despite handily beating the Lions, Harvard is excited to add another opponent to its league.
“It’s so great to have more teams to play,” Cortes said. “They put up a good fight. They’re a really new team, but we definitely had to battle.”
Playing in the top three spots for Harvard, Sobhy, Gemmell, and co-captain Nirasha Guruge all swept their Lion counterparts, winning, 3-0.
Freshman Haley Mendez was the first Harvard player to reach 10 wins this season for the Crimson in her 3-1 win over Katie Quan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there was any uncertainty about where the Harvard track and field team stood in comparison to local rivals, the Crimson’s performance on Friday likely put it to rest.
Both the men’s and women’s squads cruised to victory at the Battle of Beantown meet, held at Harvard’s own Gordon Indoor Track, dominating Northeastern, Boston University, and MIT. The Crimson men finished with 191 points, 34.5 more than second-place Northeastern, while the women earned 196 points on the day, besting BU by 20.
“I thought we competed really well,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I was very, very pleased with how both of our squads competed. It was a good team competition, and we had a number of individual highlights as well.”
Crimson freshman Jarvis Harris did his part to provide some of those highlights at Friday’s meet. The rookie ran the 60m hurdles in a blistering 8.11 seconds, breaking the meet record and the 11-year old school record.
“The beginning of my race felt a bit slow,” Harris said. “But the competition picked up, and I had to run faster.”
But having his name in the record books in one event was not enough for the Ama, La. native.
Harris went on to win the triple jump with a personal-best leap of 14.42 meters, setting the meet record in that event as well.
“I can tangle with the best of them,” Harris said. “I can go out there and give them a run for their money.”
The rookie has certainly earned the recognition of his coaching staff.
“He has a phenomenal work ethic,” Saretsky said. “You can just see his confidence growing every week.”
Harvard’s group of throwers continued their trend of excellence at the Battle of Beantown. Freshman Ben Glauser and sophomore Dustin Brode finished in first and second place, respectively, in the shot put. Besting their nearest competitor by more than two feet, Glauser and Brode seemed to be in a league of their own on Friday.
“[Glauser and Brode] are training really, really hard right now,” Saretsky said. “They have their eyes on the prize, on bigger things down the stretch of the season.”
As the Crimson readies for its most important meets of the indoor season, it may need to rely on some of the team’s newest members. For fans of Harvard athletics, these additions to the track and field team may seem a bit familiar.
Sophomore football players Andrew Ezekoye and Damani Wilson, along with classmate Connor McCarthy of the Harvard soccer team, made their collegiate track and field debuts on Friday. The trio went right to work, with Wilson taking first place in the 60-meter dash in a meet-record 6.83 seconds. McCarthy and Ezekoye also competed in the event, finishing in third and sixth place, respectively.
“Those three all bring a great dimension to our program,” Saretsky said. “I wish we had more time with them, but we’re starting to see what they’re capable of and just beginning to scratch the surface with them. I hope that working with us helps them in their other sports.”
Though Saretsky indicated that Wilson, Ezekoye, and McCarthy have some work to do on their technique and form, he is very impressed by the work ethic and dedication that they have displayed in their brief time with Harvard track and field.
Away from the track, junior Nico Weiler once again excelled in the pole vault. Weiler cleared 4.95 meters to take home first place in the event.
But it was Weiler’s female counterpart that etched her name in the record books on Friday.
Sophomore Allie Pace set the all-time record for the Crimson and the meet recordin the pole vault with a mark of 3.81 meters, besting the second-place finisher by nearly seven inches,
Senior middle-distance runner Meghan Looney competed in an unfamiliar race at Friday’s meet. Looney, who earned first place in the 800-meter run at last week’s invitational at the Armory in New York, N.Y., toed the line in the 500-meter run at the Battle of Beantown.
“[Looney] was a little nervous to run the 500,” Saretsky said. “She knew she was strong, but she was not sure how much of her speed was there.”
In spite of her pre-race jitters, the veteran finished in first place in the 500, completing the race in 1:14.19.
To Saretsky, Friday’s results indicate the progression of the track and field program in the past few years.
“The first year of the meet, we finished dead last,” Saretsky said. “It’s great to see that our athletes have come such a long way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s water polo kicked off the regular season on Saturday, splitting its two games for the day against Villanova and host, Iona.
The Crimson ran the gamut of game experiences, losing a close 15-14 match to Iona Saturday morning before dominating Villanova that afternoon at the Iona Invitational in New Rochelle, N.Y.
Iona’s pool, the Hynes Center Pool, is shallow-deep and not regulation length, which created some problems for Harvard. Although the Crimson found itself out of its element, junior attacker Aisha Price said the pool forced the team to adjust.
“We’re a fast team, so, since it was a shorter pool, we weren’t able to capitalize on our speed; we couldn’t capitalize on counter attacks,” Price said. “We tried to make the best out of the situation with the pool, but going into the future, we need to know how to capitalize on all parts of our game.”
HARVARD 13, VILLANOVA 1
Harvard finished off its opening day of the season by trouncing Villanova, who struggled to keep up with Harvard’s depth.
The Crimson effectively ended the game in the first quarter by climbing up to a 9-0 lead.
“We wanted to end on a good note in the day of games,” said Price, who led the charge against the Wildcats with three goals in the game. “We knew we had to come out strong and put the game away early in that first quarter.”
The success was certainly a team effort, with eight different players putting numbers up on the scoreboard. Sophomore attacker Shayna Price, a Crimson sports comper, freshman attacker Victoria Frager, and co-captain Devan Kennifer each had two goals.
“We ran a pretty smooth rotation,” Price said. “Everyone was getting minutes, and everyone was in the water.”
Frager’s two goals were only part of the freshman class’ large contribution this weekend. Goalie Ariel Dukes started against Iona, while Jasmine Griffin started against Villanova, and the rookies made seven and nine saves, respectively.
Frager and classmate Kalina Grabb led the team in steals against Villanova with four apiece.
IONA 15, HARVARD 14
Despite coming in as the favorite, the Crimson couldn’t complete a come-from-behind victory as a 6-2 run in the fourth failed to put the squad over the edge to defeat the Gaels.
The game began with both Iona and Harvard trading possessions and goals in the first quarter.
Although the Gaels finished the first quarter with just a one-goal advantage, momentum stayed on their side through the proceeding two quarters, and the team ran up the score to 13-8.
“[Their offense] was an aggressive style of play,” said Dukes, who made her collegiate debut in the contest. “They knew what they were doing, jumping off the bottom of the pool, and they were taking a lot of shots.”
By the fourth quarter, Harvard was better accustomed to the shallow-deep setup, which took away from the large home-pool advantage the Gaels maintained throughout most of the game.
“We were down by six, but the girls just went crazy,” Dukes said. “In the fourth quarter, everyone just turned on and got used to the strange pool.”
Dukes said it not only took her until the fourth quarter to get used to the shallow-deep pool, but it also took until that point to grow used to the collegiate level of play.
“The whole game, I was just kind of rattled a little,” Dukes said. “But by the fourth quarter, I kind of calmed down a little just seeing my team play like that.”
Dukes and Griffin are currently working with the team to fill the large void left by the absence of senior goalie Laurel McCarthy, who is recovering from surgery for the entirety of the season.
The two freshman goalies have not been informed yet if they will continue to rotate as starters at next weekend’s Princeton Invitational.
“We’re both freshman, and we’ve both never played [for a collegiate program] before, so we split time the whole tournament,” Dukes said. “It was good for both of us, because it gave us a chance to see the game. We both needed that chance. We’ll see how it goes next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its first road trip of the winter season, the Harvard men’s tennis team arrived back in Cambridge with a 2-1 record under its belt.
The Crimson topped Vanderbilt and Butler on the first and last day of its three-day Midwest road trip, respectively, but fell to Indiana on Saturday.
While Harvard squeaked out a win over Vanderbilt, riding a standout, clutch performance from freshman Denis Nguyen to the victory, on Sunday against Butler, in the words of senior Alistair Felton, the Crimson “crushed in emphatic style.”
“I thought it was fun,” Nguyen said. “We had a lot of good matches, faced some competitive teams, and came out largely on top. It was a pretty successful trip.”
The Harvard (5-1) squad was happy with its efforts and reassured of the mentality that got it this far.
“We came in full of confidence from the wins last weekend and full of belief that we could win all the matches even if we weren’t favored,” Felton explained. “We had a really positive attitude, and it definitely paid off.”
HARVARD 7, BUTLER 0
The Crimson rebounded from the previous day’s disappointing efforts on Sunday afternoon, winding up with its most resounding win of the year, defeating Butler (0-6), 7-0 in Indianapolis, Ind.
Harvard last completed a 7-0 sweep came in 2011 against Boston University, almost one year exactly before the Crimson’s matchup with the Bulldogs.
In doubles play, Harvard had no trouble topping its Butler counterparts. Denis Nguyen and doubles partner junior Andy Nguyen took their match, 8-5, while senior Alistair Felton and freshman Alex Steinroeder also won in convincing fashion, 8-3.
Sophomore Christo Schultz and freshman Henry Steer’s match mirrored that of the two Nguyens, as they matched their teammates’ score of 8-5.
Not to be outdone, the Crimson’s singles players also brought out their brooms and finished off the day without any losses.
Pearlman earned his first victory of the triple-header when he topped his Butler opponent, 6-4, 6-3. And from then on, the disparity between the teams only got larger.
In Steer’s matchup, the freshman took charge of the match immediately, winning, 6-1, 6-1. Steer’s double partner, Schultz, continued his teammate’s success, dropping just two games en route to a 6-0, 6-2 win.
Steinroeder didn’t break rank, cruising to a 6-1, 6-2 victory. Chaudhuri and Andy Nguyen finished off the day, winning 6-2, 6-0, and 6-1, 6-3, respectively.
NO. 27 INDIANA 5, HARVARD 2
Despite gaining momentum against Vanderbilt the previous day, the Crimson struggled against No. 27 Indiana (4-2), and lost overall by a score of 5-2 on Saturday at the Indiana University Indoor Tennis Center in Bloomington, Ind.
Doubles play once again proved to give Harvard many of its troubles, as the Hoosiers swept all three matches. But the Crimson duos stayed close to their Indiana counterparts in each contest, never falling by more than three games. Felton and his partner, sophomore Casey MacMaster, came closest to earning a Harvard victory, though the pair eventually fell in a tiebreaker.
The Crimson scratched first on the scoreboard when it came to singles. Freshman Shaun Chaudhuri won his second singles match in two days, 6-2, 6-3, as did teammate Steinroeder who finished up at 6-3, 6-2. But those points would prove to be the last of the day for Harvard.
“We knew that coming in that Indiana was very good,” Andy Nguyen said. “Things didn’t go our way, but we felt that on a better day we could’ve won it. We learned a lot.”
HARVARD 4, VANDERBILT 3
The Crimson’s weekend road trip began on Friday afternoon, when, led by a strong performance in singles play, the Crimson defeated the Commodores (2-2), 4-3, at Vanderbilt’s Currey Tennis Center in Nashville, Tenn. Prior to the match, Vanderbilt was ranked 32 spots above Harvard, at No. 34 nationally.
The beginning of match play didn’t go the Crimson’s way, as a strong performance by the Commodores’ doubles team put the visitors in a 2-1 hole.
Though the first and the third matches went Vanderbilt’s way, the second match of doubles play went decidedly better for Harvard. The two Nguyens beat their Commodore opponents, 8-6.
On the singles court, it was a different story, as the visiting team soon founds its stroke and was able to rally and earn the victory.
At the start of singles play, Steinroeder handily defeated his opponent, 6-1, 6-4, and Schultz captured a narrower victory, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Senior Jonathan Pullman and Steer each lost their matches.
After Chaudhuri won, 6-1, 6-4, the stage was set for the final match-up: Denis Nguyen versus Austin Gonzales. After losing the first set, 5-7, Nguyen managed to pull out the second, 6-4.
As a result, the match’s outcome hinged on the third and final set. Nguyen was put to the test of match point five times in that round, but the rookie defeated Gonzales, 7-5, and earned Harvard the 4-3 win.
“It was a close match,” Nguyen explained. “I was cramping and I think he was tired as well. It was interesting to see who wanted more, and I guess I came out on top in that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong performance against UMass last weekend, the No. 60 Harvard women’s tennis team dropped its contest at No. 40 Maryland on Saturday, 4-3, in College Park, Md.
Though usually commanding in doubles, the Crimson fell at the No. 1 and No. 2 spots fell to the Terps, and the doubles point proved to be the deciding factor in the match between the two ITA-ranked schools, which split the singles matches 3-3.
In singles, Cristina Stancu overtook junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana at the No. 1 position. At the No. 2 spot, fellow junior co-captain Kristin Norton also lost, falling to Ana Belzunce. Freshman Sylvia Li suffered Harvard’s third singles loss, falling to Mikele Irazusta at the No. 6 position.
The middle courts fared better for Harvard. Junior Camille Jania, senior Samantha Gridley, and sophomore Hannah Morrill each won at the third, fourth, and fifth court, respectively.
But with the doubles point earned for Maryland earlier in the match, the home team had the edge on the day and beat the Crimson, 4-3.
The match opened with Harvard’s No. 1 doubles team, Tachibana and Norton, who are ranked nationally as the 25th-best tandem, losing to Maryland’s 37th-ranked Belzunce and Welma Luus, 8-6.
The loss for Tachibana and Norton was uncharacteristic for the duo, which boasts a 9-2 record.
“[Belzunce and Luus] were better at playing with their own strategy,” Norton said. “If Hideko and I came into the match a little more poised and were a little more aggressive and played our game like usual, then I think we could have won. But I think we were a little too tentative in the beginning.”
Belzunce and Luus quickly took the early lead, going 2-0 to begin the day. After the match, Norton identified the poor start as the main reason for her tandem’s loss.
“Especially in these eight-game pro sets, you have to get an early lead usually because it can go by fast, and we weren’t able to do that,” Norton said. “So I think that was the main reason we lost.”
Harvard’s other loss came at the No. 2 doubles court, where the Terps took control of the match, winning 8-2.
At the No. 3 position, the Crimson duo of Jania and Gridley kept the visitors from being swept in the doubles with an 8-4 victory over Maryland. But their win was not enough for Harvard, and the Terps transitioned into singles matches with a 1-0 lead from the doubles point.
Jania and Gridley’s success carried over to their singles matches.
At the No. 3 spot, Jania kept Luus to a clean slate, shutting out her foe, 6-0, 6-0.
One court over at the No. 4 position, Gridley also claimed a convincing victory, winning 6-1, 6-4.
The Crimson’s first singles loss of the day was at the No. 6 court, where Maryland freshman Irazusta came out victorious in a second-set tiebreaker to beat Li, 6-3, 7-6 (4).
With the team score at 2-2, the winner of the day’s match was still very much in the air.
At the top two courts, Tachibana and Norton both lost their first sets, 7-5. Tachibana put up a fight against Stancu, but the Harvard No. 1 could not keep up, and a 6-4 second set loss by Tachibana put Maryland ahead, 3-2.
Very soon afterwards, Norton fell to Belzunce, 6-2, which sealed the victory for the Terps.
“We fought really hard, but we just couldn’t pull it out,” Norton said. “I think it could have gone either way. Essentially with these 4-3 matches, I think the key was that Maryland was more poised on the court.”
Although the victor for the match was already decided, Morrill finished her bout at the No. 5 position, winning 6-7, 6-0, 6-4 against her opponent.
Next up, the Crimson faces Boston College, which it beat 5-2 last year, at the Murr Center tennis courts on Thursday, marking Harvard’s first of five straight home contests.
“[BC is] always a really tough match,” Norton said. “We know this year they’ll come out fighting hard. But we’re really excited, though. I think we learned a lot from our match against Maryland.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its most important meet of the season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team faced off against fourth-place Yale and Princeton, which entered the contest tied with the Crimson for first place in the Ivy League.
Harvard topped the Tigers for the first time since 2006, besting Princeton, 190-110, and Yale, 235-65, to take the Ivy League dual meet title at Blodgett Pool over the weekend.
“It was really high energy. I think a lot of people were really excited for the meet,” senior Meghan Leddy said.  “It’s a big rivalry between us and Princeton and Yale.  It’s always been one of the biggest meets of the year.
The Crimson (7-2, 7-0 Ivy) took charge of the meet during the first event—the 200-yard medley relay.  The relay team of juniors Caroline Weaver and Mackenzie Luick and freshmen Ana Anaya and Sarah Sumner stopped the clock at 1:42.39, touching out the Tigers (5-1, 5-1) by .3 seconds to win the event and set a new school record.
“We were out towards the front going into the last 50, but...Sumner really brought it home for us,” Luick said.  “Across the board in all the events, we had really great finishes, but to be able to start the meet with a finish like that is incredible.”
From that point on, Harvard never looked back, taking first place in 10 of the 16 events over the two-day meet.
“We were the underdogs of this meet,” Sumner said.  “It was very exciting. The relay just got us pumped up and ready to go for the rest of the meet.”
Freshman Kelsey Hojan-Clark made her mark on the distance events, claiming victory in both the 1000- and 500-freestyle races, stopping the clock at 9:51.32 and 4:49.82, respectively.  The Crimson took a one-two finish in both events.  Freshman Courtney Otto touched second in the 1000 with a time of 9:57.72. In the 500, senior Catherine Zagroba finished right after Hojan-Clark in 4:50.41.
Zagroba earned one of Harvard’s first-place finishes in the 200 freestyle (1:48.59). Freshman Faith Martin and sophomore Sara Li were right behind, with times of 1:49.01 and 1:50.38, respectively, for a one-two-three finish.
“We went out there with a really positive attitude and really wanted to put everything on the line for the last dual meet,” Luick said.
Princeton took the victories in the 50- and 100-freestyle events, leaving Sumner with second-place finishes in both events.
The Tigers also beat out Harvard in the 100 backstroke, adding first and second place points to their total. Weaver earned third place for the Crimson with a time of 56.23, but came back in the 200 backstroke to touch out Princeton by .07 seconds to win the event (1:57.60).
The butterfly events were also split by the Tigers and Harvard. The Crimson grabbed another one-two-three finish in the 200 butterfly with performances by sophomore Danielle Schulkin (1:59.60), senior Hilary Roberts (2:00.00), and Otto (2:00.37).  Princeton snagged a first-place finish in the 100 butterfly by .14 seconds over Anaya, who stopped the clock at 54.85. Shulkin finished close behind for a third-place finish in 55.04.
“The times were very, very fast, even though we weren’t fully rested for the meet,” Shulkin said.  “It was great to be able to defend our turf.”
Yale showed that it was top dog in the diving events, taking first place in both. Senior Leslie Rea finished her last dual meet with 261.05 points in the one-meter dive and 261 points in the three-meter dive, finishing second in both.
Harvard raked in three one-two finishes in the 100 and 200 breaststroke and in the 200 Individual Medley.  Luick added to her school record performance with two first-place finishes in the breaststroke events. Her 1:03.01 finish in the 100 was followed closely by freshman Stephanie Ferrell, who notched a time of 1:03.59. The Crimson also took fourth, fifth, and sixth in that event.  Martin took the second place slot in the 200 breaststroke, finishing in 2:15.68.  Evans and Leddy clocked in at 2:02.70 and 2:04.12, respectively, in the 200 IM for Harvard’s penultimate one-two finish.
“We had really good positive energy the whole way through,” Luick said. “I think it was a great way to wrap up our dual meet season going into Ivy championships.”
The meet came to a close with the 400-freestyle relay. The A team, consisting of Martin, Li, Lightbourne, and Sumner, sailed ahead of the others, finishing in 3:23.52. The real race was between the Crimson’s B team and the Tigers’ A team.  The group of Gregoire, Clute, Anaya, and Zagroba touched out Princeton’s top relay team by .1 second with a time of 3:27.82.
“None of us tapered—we’re still focused on the main events, which are Ivy and ECAC championships.” Luick said. “It’s an incredible victory, but they’ll be back, gunning for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard alpine coach Tim Mitchell didn’t know exactly when the last time a Crimson alpine skier reached the podium, but he estimated that it was sometime during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. That changed on Friday when sophomore Rebecca Nadler took second place in the giant slalom.
“Clearly that’s fantastic,” Mitchell said of Nadler. “I’m very pleased, but I’m not surprised. She’s been skiing very well. I thought it was more or less a matter of time.”
“I was obviously really happy,” Nadler said. “I’d been feeling good...I felt like I brought over the things I’d been doing in training.”
Nadler’s finish led the women’s alpine team to a fourth-place finish in the event and was the highlight of a weekend in which the skiing team finished ninth overall at the Vermont Carnival, held at Stowe & Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vt. While the sophomore led the charge, strong finishes from freshman Cate Kistler and captain Caroline McHugh, who took 25th and 27th respectively, also lifted the Crimson squad.
The weekend’s performance marked the best finish of Kistler’s young career. McHugh, meanwhile, has been a reliable performer for the Crimson throughout her time with the team.
“It’s been super exciting for me to see the team get so much stronger,” McHugh said. “Just watching the progress has been really awesome. It’s super exciting to show people that the Harvard team is something to be reckoned with.”
While the Crimson women’s alpine team was unable to replicate its team-wide success in the slalom event and took seventh, Nadler continued to shine with a sixth-place finish, the highest the skier has ever taken in a slalom event.
“It was a very challenging course,” Mitchell said. “She skied very well; she skied very tactically smart.”
Nadler arrived at Harvard as a skier who specialized in the giant slalom, but she has continued to improve her performance in the slalom throughout her time with the Crimson.
“We’ve been trying to take what she does well in the GS and move that into the slalom,” Mitchell said. “The events are fairly different, so it’s not always a super straightforward transition.”
“I kind of kept it simple,” Nadler said of the slalom. “I don’t know if there was one big change.”
While Nadler thrives in difficult conditions, Saturday’s slalom races proved perilous to many. Nadler and freshman Liz Strong were the only members of the team to finish the race. Strong took 19th.
“It was just a lot of tough hills,” Mitchell said. “I thought everybody had some pretty good turns here and there. I thought everyone attacked really well.”
The men’s field was similarly set back by the tough conditions of the course.
“More than half of the men’s field didn’t finish,” Mitchell said of the slalom. “The number of crashes…was pretty staggering. It was extremely, extremely challenging. Everyone kind of sensed that you could either ski really safe and hope that because people were crashing you’d have a good score, or you could say, ‘If I really go for it and make it down the hill, I’ll do really well.’ The guys went for it and it unfortunately didn’t work out for them.”
While the men were hampered in the slalom, Mitchell was pleased with the progress he saw on Friday when both senior Kevin McNamara and sophomore Ian Anderson qualified for the second run for the first time all season.
“They started to ski in the race how they had been skiing in training,” Mitchell said.
Meanwhile, junior Alena Tofte led the charge for the Nordic team with a 15th-place finish in the 5k classic race and a ninth-place finish among collegiate skiers in the 10k free race.
Tofte finished 10th overall in the 10k free race, falling to one professional skier.
“Alena’s definitely proving that she can ski in the top 10 in our league, which is great,” Nordic coach Chris City ‘94 said.
The Crimson also posted solid team finishes both days in the women’s Nordic events with a fifth-place team finish in the 5k classic race and a sixth-place finish in the 10k free race.
“We had some really good races from Alena and Esther [Kennedy] and Jen [Rolfes],” City said. “I thought it was just exciting that we were up there with the [top teams].”
Sophomore Chris Stock continued to lead the charge on the men’s Nordic side with a 23rd place finish in the men’s 10k classic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming team split its matchups in this weekend’s annual HYP meet, topping Yale, 268-85, but falling to No. 24 Princeton, 207-146.
The Tigers swept their matches, topping both the Crimson and the Bulldogs, 285.5-67.5, to extend their perfect record in Ivy League competition.
The trio of ancient eight teams entered the meet tied at 4-0 in conference play the season. After the weekend’s dust has settled, the Tigers claim sole ownership as leader of the Ivy League standings.
“We went into the meet knowing it was a good test of where we are in the season, and despite our loss [to Princeton], I feel that the meet put us in a good position going forward into the Ivy League Championship,” freshman Chuck Katis said.
The previously undefeated Harvard team looked at the weekend’s competition as a test of its championship readiness.
“Our team was just trying to get some fast times out there at [the meet],” sophomore Oliver Lee said. “We haven’t really had a meet yet with stiff competition this season, and so we were just really psyched for this weekend’s meet.”
Despite the split result this weekend, the Harvard swimmers were relatively satisfied with the performance, as the squad beat the Bulldogs by a margin of almost 200 points and saw several swimmers and divers come close in losing efforts.
The Crimson’s 200-free relay team—formed by classmates Lee, Will Brophy, Chris Satterthwaite, and freshman Griffin Schumacher—gave Harvard its first of five first-place finishes of the weekend with a time of 1:20.50. The Tigers narrowly trailed behind the Crimson men by .52 seconds while Yale’s squad took third with a time of 1:22.74.
In the individual 200-free race, Princeton’s Colin Cordes and David Paulk finished first and second with times of 1:37.91 and 1:38.09, respectively, and set the tone for what would be a demonstration of domination by the Tigers, which tallied an impressive 12 first-place finishes in the weekend’s 19 events.
Princeton continued its winning style in sweeping the top three spots in the 100 backstroke. Tiger freshman Michael Strand touched the wall first at 49.10, followed closely by teammates Raigla and Maher with respective finishes of 49.57 and 49.91.
In the 100 breaststroke, freshman Chuck Katis, who entered the meet ranked 47th in the nation and third in the Ivy League for the event with a time of 55.08 seconds, had a season-best finish at 54.29 seconds. But Katis was bested by a margin of .46 seconds, as Princeton senior Jonathan Christensen swam to No. 11 in the nation and first in the conference with a time of 53.83.
Clocking in at 1:47.04, Yale’s Alwin Firmansyah posted the Bulldogs’ only first-place finish of the weekend in Friday’s 200 butterfly.
As the battle for first in conference resumed Saturday, both Harvard and Princeton were decisively ahead of Yale, each with a score exceeding the Bulldogs by 100 points or better. The Crimson began within striking distance of the Tigers trailing 104-82.
But the Princeton men emerged as the clear victors, taking the first five events of the day and earning a total of 103 points to increase the margin between Princeton and Harvard to a comfortable 61 points.
The Crimson pushed back with first-place finishes in the 400-freestyle relay and the three-meter dive. Harvard freshman Kyle McIntee gave the Crimson another victory when he took the 500 free by swimming a time of 4:28.1 in a heat leading up to the final.
“It was really unexpected, not from our point of view, but especially for [the opposing] teams,” Katis said.
But McIntee’s success and the other four Crimson first-place finishes of the meet weren’t enough to overtake a strong Princeton team whose swimmers boast 16 times within the nation’s top 50 in 13 different events.
One such swimmer, Tiger Paul Noelle, finished far ahead of the rest in the 1650 free. After touching the wall at 15:30.62, Noelle surfaced to watch his closest opponent finish nine seconds later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an attack error gave MIT the first game of the match, things did not appear to be going the right way for the Harvard men’s volleyball team.
But the Crimson (4-0) fought off early errors and a hostile Engineer (5-2) crowd, as Harvard downed its upstream rival, 3-1, at MIT’s DuPont Athletic Center Saturday night.
With the stands packed full of MIT supporters, captain Matt Jones, who received the brunt of the abuse, knew how to deal with the jeers and taunts.
“I just laugh and ignore them,” Jones said. “Maybe when I was younger it would be a little different, but being a senior, you’ve heard everything. They weren’t very creative.”
And though Jones would open the game with a kill that momentarily silenced the crowd, it seemed like the raucous home support was serving as an eighth man on the court, as service and attack errors plagued the early showing from the visiting Harvard squad. After MIT went on a 5-0 run, Crimson coach Brian Baise called a timeout to settle his team down.
“We know we have to focus entirely on our side of the court,” Baise said. “We don’t worry about what the other team is doing, let alone the fans. This is a big rivalry match, and we knew the fans were going to come out. The best way to deal with that is to stay in the lead.”
Harvard came out of the timeout strongly, tying the game up at 10 through strong offensive play from Crimson freshmen DJ White and Caleb Zimmick.
But another MIT run took the game out of Harvard’s hands, as the Engineers took the first game, 25-15.
“It was a shaky start,” Baise said. “We came out pretty cold, and they came out pretty hot.”
The tide began to turn in the second game, as the two teams traded points to begin.
Sophomore Nick Madden led the way in the game, notching six kills as the Crimson extended its lead to four, forcing MIT to call a timeout.
But the Engineers could not stop Harvard’s growing momentum, and both MIT’s bench and crowd quieted down as the Crimson took the second game, 25-19.
As more and more fans entered the back bleachers going into the third game, Madden and Jones tightened their grip on the flow of the game, combining for 11 kills in the frame.
“We knew our game plan would work if we just executed,” Baise said. “Our outside hitters had a great game for us, and we had a little bit of height advantage that helped a lot.”
The pair’s offensive effort was buoyed by strong defensive play from libero Chris Gibbons. The sophomore posted 10 digs on the night, keeping several long rallies alive for Harvard to put away.
“[Gibbons] is a real quick, active defensive player,” Baise said. “He really makes a difference back there, and that puts a lot more pressure on the other team’s offense.”
Harvard slowly took control, and after a run put them up, 18-11, the Engineers took another timeout to stop the bleeding.
Initially, the break proved successful, as MIT scored three quick points to get back into the contest. But the Crimson answered with a run of its own, as several Engineer miscues gave the visitors a formidable lead and eventually the game, 25-16.
With their team facing a do-or-die situation, the MIT faithful shook the DuPont Athletic Center with chants of “M-I-T!”
But it was Harvard that fed off the energy, as a series of 3-0 runs gave Harvard a 9-3 edge.
The Engineers would not go quietly, as some effective offensive work brought the score to 9-7.
But again, Harvard was up to the challenge, as another Crimson run gave Harvard the 25-17 victory in the fourth game, ending the contest, 3-1.
The Crimson will look to take this momentum into its midweek matchup with Cal Baptist, and the team is relishing the chance to take on an unfamiliar foe.
“It’s great to have a team like Cal Baptist come to Harvard,” Baise said. “It’s a great opportunity for us to take on a great West Coast team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 7/8 Harvard women’s hockey team rode a dominant second period to an easy 10-1 victory over Princeton on Saturday at the Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (16-7-1, 13-4-1 ECAC) scored a season-high 10 unanswered goals, seven of which came in the prolific second frame.
Junior forward Jillian Dempsey, who scored five goals on the night, led the charge with four second-period goals.
Harvard was looking to rebound against a Tigers (10-11-4, 8-8-2) team that had shut out the Crimson, 3-0, in the last contest and was coming off a win over No. 10 Dartmouth on Friday.
“We picked up our momentum from [yesterday’s 4-2 win over Quinnipiac], and we were hungry,” Dempsey said. “This team handed it to us in January and we had something to prove out there today, and things finally started falling our way.”
“We were outhustling them to every puck and beating them all over the ice,” Dempsey continued. “Then the puck started going in and we just fed off of that.”
Princeton scored the first goal by taking advantage of an early opportunity when junior Corey Stearns flipped a wrist shot past the left side of Crimson goalie Laura Bellamy on the first shot of the game.
But in the second period, Dempsey started the Harvard streak when she collected the puck and dumped it into the Tigers zone on the left side of the ice. The junior moved past the defense to the left and fired a shot past the goalie, nailing the top right corner of the goal.
From there Dempsey took control, scoring a shorthanded breakaway goal in which she faked going right the goalie and slid a shot past the netminder to put Harvard up, 2-1. She continued her onslaught of scoring by fighting for position in front of the net, taking a pass from junior Josephine Pucci and directing the puck into the net for a hat trick.
“We have a pretty good rivalry against [Princeton] so it was just one of those days where things fell into place,” Dempsey said. “I just kept going to the net, and people were finding me. And [the puck] just kept going in.”
Crimson sophomore Gina McDonald then followed a minute later with a score to extend the lead to 4-1 with under five minutes left in the period.
Soon after, Dempsey made it a four-goal lead for the home team. After taking a well-placed pass by freshman Samantha Reber, who poked the puck by the defender and drew the goalie, Dempsey put it away for her fourth goal of the period.
Harvard freshman Hillary Crowe put the finishing touch on the period for the Crimson by taking a pass from the point and shooting beyond the reach of the goalie.
“I think [the scoring] shows what we are capable of,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We need to make a decision that we are going to do that every day, and certainly we are capable of that kind of offense. But again our offense starts with playing great defense and moving it up the ice, and I think we did that well today.”
“We didn’t really come to play [in January’s loss to Princeton], and they came ready and they outworked us,” Dempsey said. “We don’t want to be that team [that gets outworked]. We want to be the team that works hard and that’s how we define ourselves.”
The Crimson was able to close out the game in the third behind a strong defense and three goals within a span of three minutes. Reber struck first in the final frame when she took a pass from behind the net and scored through the five hole.
Then Crowe added her second goal of the game with two minutes remaining before a fifth goal from Dempsey with 40 seconds left completed the 10-goal scoring run.
“From the beginning even though they got a quick goal we never let down at all,” Stone said. “We continued to stay focused and built momentum as the game went on…. We just owned the game in a lot of ways. Overall it was great to see all three lines, the [defense], and everyone doing what you need to do to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like the Knicks will try to extend their Lin-ning streak.
On Monday, New York Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni gave reporters the impression that former Harvard standout Jeremy Lin '10 will be the Knicks’ starting point guard against the Utah Jazz later tonight. After a 25-point, seven-assist performance against the New Jersey Nets on Saturday, Lin seems to have won the confidence of his head coach, who over the past couple of days has praised the poise of the second-year guard.
D'Antoni also stated that injured Knicks point guard Baron Davis has suffered a setback in his recovery and will not be back for at least another week. While the Knicks lost 11 of their 14 games over the past month, New York fans were hopeful that Davis' return would mean the end of the team's woes at the point guard position. With Lin's breakout performance on Saturday, the wait may be over—there is already huge hype about Lin's potential as a starter. The former Harvard guard has even made it to the front page of the Knicks website, clearly a sign that the franchise is beginning to stand behind the young player.
Tipoff is scheduled for 7:30 EST on FSSW+, MSG, and NBATV. But if you can’t find a TV, don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. Check thecrimson.com later for a live blog of tonight’s game.

Once a year, two football teams and an industry of advertisers collaborate to create an unforgettable night of American entertainment. The commercials aired on this Sunday in February are often the most innovative ones seen for the rest of the year. Here's our roundup of this Super Bowl's best.
Volkswagen: The Dog Strikes Back
One part adorable puppy, one part Star Wars. Honestly, could anything be better?
Oikos Greek Yogurt: The Tease
So unexpectedly hilarious. The head-butt also paralleled the football game perfectly.
Audi: Vampire Party
Vampire jokes just don't get old, especially when they culminate in people vanishing into poofs of smoke. #SoLongVampires
Budweiser: Prohibition is Over
This old-time movie throwback brings a traditional classiness to one of America's favorite brands. Men in suits, Clydesdales, and sepia-toned film work together charmingly.
H&M: David Beckham Body Wear
Slow motion panning can be a dangerous move, but in this case it played to the subject's strengths. Simple, but certainly eye-catching.

Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren released a clip for the "It Gets Better Project" on Jan. 25, standing in support of LGBT youth who face bullying and discrimination.
Warren released the video as part of her senatorial campaign against current Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. In July, Brown stirred controversy when he declined to participate in an "It Gets Better" video filmed by the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation, of which he is the only Republican member.
Warren has voiced support for gay rights in the past, urging for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman.
While Brown is opposed to the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, in December 2010 he voted in support of ending the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which barred gay members of the armed forces from disclosing their sexuality. "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was subsequently repealed, a vote that was seen as a huge win for the LGBT community.

First Printer Restaurant opened its doors last week, boasting a menu of upscale American fare. A plaque identifies the 15 Dunster Street address as the site of America's first printing press, which was used to publish religious tracts for nearby Harvard College.
Today the walls are decorated with old newspapers and authentic moveable type. The exposed brick, terracotta walls, and period light fixtures cast a warm glow over the rustic interior. A large arched window looks out onto Dunster Street.
First Printer's menu features gator bites and pork belly for adventurous eaters, as well as more traditional, regional seafood dishes. Prices range from $7 to $22.
The restaurant is open all week, starting at 11:00 a.m. The eatery also provides take-out.
First Printer's owner, Jeffrey Stannett, is no stranger to Harvard Square. His legendary ice cream store, Herrell's, was a Square staple for 20 years before it closed its doors two years ago. Herrell's Ice Cream currently has locations in Northampton, Mass., and Huntington, N.Y.
