“The air of reality, the solidity of specification, is among the supreme virtues of the novel,” said Ian McEwan as he stood in a simple grey suit, calmly shifting papers in front of a concert hall of people. “It’s got something to do with its interiority, with that sort of inwardness that it can capture better than any other art form.” McEwan exuded a sort of interiority himself, as he revealed his writing secrets to the audience like the end of a novel. McEwan visited Harvard last Tuesday to give a talk called “The Lever: Where Novelists Stand to Move the World” at the Rita E. Hauser Forum. He was casual in his address to his listeners and spoke with the literary expertise found in his novels, full of concrete imagery and explanatory passages.
The director of the Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard, Homi K. Bhabha, introduced McEwan. Bhabha spoke of the “mental freedom” McEwan gives to his readers and the dexterity of his knowledge in integrating heady subjects such as neuroscience or climatology with the experiences of his characters. “McEwan’s works are shrouded in secrets, surprises, and suppressed thoughts,” said Bhabha, referencing the interiority of McEwan’s novels—the unique reading experience of being privy to a lifetime of a character’s accumulated knowledge.
McEwan accomplishes this realistic character perspective by putting months—sometimes even years—of research into the activities and thoughts his characters will engage in. “You need as much research as 10 times what you will actually use in order to feel free, to move with confidence in the world of knowledge,” said McEwan. As an example, he mentioned the research involved in writing one of his novels, “Saturday.” He followed a neurosurgeon and collected information in order to write comfortably about the inner life of his main character, also a neurosurgeon. At one point during his two-year research period, McEwan even found himself mistaken for a doctor. In order to use the situation to his advantage, he tested his own knowledge by explaining to a few students the process of operating on an aneurysm.
Despite his meticulous research to create an “air of reality” within his works of fiction, McEwan has repeatedly found himself in conversation with his readers about the logic and factual components of his novels. Scores of readers have written to inform him about mistaken details which, for them, were jarring and unwanted reminders of the creator’s orchestration. The inconsistencies in McEwan’s otherwise realistic world pulled those readers out of the comfort of a character’s created world. One reader pointed out the lack of a clutch pedal in a specific model of car that McEwan included in his novel, “Saturday,” while another reader voiced concern about the impossibility of a particular constellation’s appearance in the Italian summer sky in “The Comfort of Strangers.” McEwan read aloud a multitude of these often humorous responses. He pondered the possibility of rejecting each complaint given that a novel is by definition a work of fiction. In the end, though, McEwan admitted his mistakes with grace and appreciated that his readers treated his novel as a completely real entity, grounded in the same reality they lived in.
Another writer in the audience, Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, mentioned a similar reaction from his readers when he described the particular location of a Cape Cod town incorrectly in his novel “Free Association.” “I was abashed, because I was caught out,” said Buttenwieser. McEwan also talked about the embarrassment of being informed of a mistake after millions of copies had been sold and circulated. Instead of responding with anger or indifference, however, McEwan pointed out that these protests from readers are a powerful indication that every part of a story matters to the reader and that the private knowledge, suppressed thoughts, and exterior world of each character combine to form an experience that is real in relation to the world that we know as humans. “The novelist must cross and re-cross the realm of imagination and the general world,” he said. McEwan explained the battle he has had in grounding the lives of his characters in reality, as opposed to attributing his own mistakes to an element of magical realism that other authors, like Salman Rushdie and Gabriel García Márquez, have used artfully.
“I love his eye for everyday life,” said Spencer B. L. Lenfield ’12, another attendee of McEwan’s talk. “I think that any novelist should make you step out into the street and look at the world around you more intensely.” This is an integral aspect of McEwan’s words and works; his realistic, well researched environments allow the reader to delve deeper into the interior of the characters and know that their world is as real as our own. “The novel has allowed us to develop a means of examining our own nature,” McEwan said. “It gives us thought.”

“We were like guests at the Mad Hatter’s table,” reflects one character in “Arcadia,” “but didn’t even know the world was flipped around.” In her second novel, author Lauren Groff traces the backwards and unusual life of Bit Stone, the child of hippies who help found the commune Arcadia in rural New York in the 1960s. Bit, who is as meek and passive as his name suggests, observes his strange world first through the eyes of a child and then, as the novel progresses, through the jaded and wounded perspective of a man in an increasingly confounding world. Through beautiful language that grounds the story in its natural landscape along with its focus on personal relationships, “Arcadia” forms a haunting and hopeful vision of love lost and gained.
Groff’s portrayal of Arcadia borders more on a cult than a happy-go-lucky land of hippies. Its inhabitants call themselves the “Free People,” and led by the charismatic but deeply flawed Handy, they dutifully recite mantras of yoga, organic produce, and equality. The vision of Arcadia is a world removed from outside influences, but as such utopian experiments are wont to do, it eventually descends into complete chaos. Early disturbing signs of control within the community presage its fall; the people may strive for a perfect world, but certain elements—like public “Critiques” of misbehaving citizens—lend this rural landscape a feeling more akin to the controlling and creepy cult of the film “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” where its people were slowly brainwashed into surrendering their identity, than that of a gentle utopia. “Pain, when given its proper place in the human heart, can be a door that leads to a feeling of oneness with the Universe,” one resident intones. “This is a path to deeper empathy.” At times, indeed, elements of this cult-utopia border on the cliché—“May they rot in their bourgeois capitalist hell,” Bit’s mother Hannah angrily lashes out against her estranged parents—but ultimately, Groff’s powerful attention to detailed atmosphere overrides these somewhat uncreative elements.
Groff creates a novel lush with descriptions of beautiful landscapes and inner torment. Bit, who as a child knows no other world besides the several hundred acres of the commune, inevitably reflects on the land around him with the same natural language that describes Arcadia itself. In a period of self-imposed silence, his words lump like “a toad, in the cave of his throat.” Elsewhere, young children scatter like “a handful of seeds.” This distinct descriptive language elevates the forests and rolling hills to more than scenery; indeed, the world around Bit is nearly a character itself. This helps develop the powerful attachment that Bit—and perhaps even the reader—grows to have with the land of his youth.
Groff’s apt coupling of nature with memory provides ample emotional ground to traverse once the commune inevitably fails. Its fall is all the more devastating because of the loss of place as well as people: through Bit is sad to see his friends go, he is even more overwhelmed by the loss of the fragile but comforting environment of Arcadia, the only one he has ever known. “There is a puncture in the world,” Groff writes plaintively, “and everything Bit knew about himself is escaping.”
In addition to these melancholy tangents of memory, “Arcadia” highlights shortcomings of modern society through Bit’s ever watchful eyes and vivid imagination. The Arcadia commune may not have been perfect—Groff makes that abundantly clear—but what it did have was a pure focus on the power and sanctity of human connections. As a boy, Bit imagines the outside world as a monstrous place, filled not only with crime and hate, but also with the modern scourges of social loneliness and technological isolation. This perception does not change with time. “Every soul on the street is sunk within its own body,” he realizes sadly as he walks through New York City. “Sometimes Bit imagines that he, alone, bears witness to the world.”
Yet all is not gloom and doom in “Arcadia.” Much of the novel focuses on the powerful impact of personal relationships throughout Bit’s life. There is his mother Hannah, a stalwart yet sometimes fragile character who takes care of Bit as much as he takes care of her; his friend and great love Helle, a self-destructive and magnetic woman whose grip on Bit’s life lends him both joy and sorrow; and his daughter Grete, a perfect blend of Hannah and Helle, who helps Bit find redemption despite the losses and confusion in his life. The novel is told less in the style of a narrative than a biography, for the only consistent plot thread throughout the book is Bit’s gradual journey through life. Yet these strong emotional bonds between Bit and the three central women anchor the book and give it focus through its meandering reflections. With language rich like the earth Bit lovingly treads, Groff fleshes out each relationship to show all of its hidden pockmarks of connection and loss.
It is a fulfilling and well written novel that can find solace for a character despite a string of lifelong disconnects, and by the end of “Arcadia,” Groff does just that. “He loves the sediment of good time,” she writes about Bit, in an emotional revelation that is unexpected but relieving. Her subtle switch of Bit from a fearful child to a cautious but wise adult is thus compelling and realistic. His inability to escape his perspective on the world, so influenced by his early life, colors the novel with unique, heartrending descriptions. Groff perfectly inhabits the mind of her main character, and the prose that results is well suited to every situation Bit encounters. It is as natural and as poignant as the land of Arcadia itself.

“Music has the ability to totally alter your mood based on what song you’re listening to,” says Meredith C. Baker ’13, a singer-songwriter performing in this year’s Arts First festival. Organized by the Office for the Arts at Harvard and currently in its 20th year, Arts First gives musicians like Baker the opportunity to perform both original and better-known songs in an open setting. The genres of music that will be performed range from classical to pop, many tinged with the flavor of folk, bringing a taste of students’ unique musical sensibilities to the greater Harvard community.
Along with playing solo performances, musicans at Arts First are using the opportunity to promote groups that they have established with their peers. Sophia W. Wennstedt ’15 is part of a student band, Chuck, Taylor, & The All-Star Band, that mainly plays covers from a variety of genres; the group has played at the House of Blues, and often performs at house formals, the Queen’s Head pub, and other on-campus venues. In addition to playing with her band, Wennstedt will have a solo performance during Arts First. “I’ll probably just do most of my own songs,” she says about the possible lineup for her solo performance. “I think I may be playing a couple of songs for the first time, so I’m deciding whether they’re ready for the general public.”
Daniel A. Masterson ’12, Wennstedt’s fellow bandmate, will be performing folk-pop inspired songs with Wennstedt during Arts First. He also makes his own rock-pop music and is an active member of The Veritones. Many of the musicians in Arts First are very involved in various aspects of the music scene at Harvard, and Masterson is no exception. He is planning to become a professional musician after graduation and he has experience performing in front of various audiences. “I spent the summer in England and Scotland for about 10 weeks playing shows in pubs by myself with a keyboard,” he said. “I was actually a part of the [Edinburgh] Fringe Festival as a busker, which was a really cool experience.” Masterson’s extensive musical background contributes to his willingness to partake in various pursuits in the pop-rock genre.
H. Luke M. Anderson ’14 is another member of The All-Star Band who is more involved with the bluegrass genre. He started off playing the trombone before moving to bass and guitar.  He is also a member of another band, Miles Beast. “We started off playing primarily bluegrass music, and we kind of veered away from that a little bit into folk-acoustic kind of stuff,” he says about his band’s repertoire. For musicians like Anderson, performing at Arts First is an opportunity to introduce a lesser-known kind of music to the student community and hopefully raise a greater awareness and appreciation of it. “I think they like it a lot,” he says about audience reactions to his folk music. “I think that partially our own musical taste, as well as what other people like to listen to, causes us to veer a little away from bluegrass, so we kind of got a little more adventurous and mix up some chords and get into other realms.”
This kind of experimentation also appeals to classically trained musicians. Bran S. Shim ’14, also a Crimson editor, Theodore A. Peng ’13, and Jeremy Ying ’13 are the members of the Americana Trio, a group composed of violin, cello, and bass. They play music by lesser-known American composers as well as original contemporary classical pieces. “The pieces written for cello and bass come from a more modern time period, so many of the cool things about American composers is that they try to make new kinds of music and produce those new kinds of sound,” says Peng, the cellist. “I think that gave us a perfect opportunity to play together at something like Arts First.” The trio met in Bonn, Germany on a Harvard study abroad trip last summer, and has been actively involved in working with student composers and creating the River Charles Ensemble, a larger group of musicians.
With the River Charles Ensemble, the trio tries to draw from the large pool of classically trained musicians at Harvard to create a fresh take on music. For the Americana Trio, Arts First is a venue that promotes types of music that may be unheard of among the student community. “We’re playing specific music that is atypical, and the entire group is playing something that is an impressive piece of work that a musicologist can appreciate,” says Shim, the bassist. “Your typical person will probably know the most famous tune in the piece, but really nothing past that.” Although they have been playing informally for small groups of friends so far, the official debut performance for the Americana Trio will be during Arts First.
For all of these performers, Arts First will be a way to hone their individual skills while getting attention from the Harvard community. As they progress in their musical pursuits during their college careers and beyond, it is events like these where the students can showcase their own work, play with fellow musicians, and have fun experimenting with their various musical interests.
A common thread among many of the musicians at Arts First is their view of music as a passion and extracurricular interest, rather than a strictly academic experience. Although some, like Shim and Masterson, are studying for their secondary field in music, for most music is simply a form of release from normal life. “I’ll be playing my guitar and singing mostly songs that I wrote through my experience in college and abroad,” says Baker. She is currently taking a semester off in New York City, and uses music as a way to gain perspective. “It became a way for me to get closure or get a better understanding on things that happened,” she says about music. “My songs are collections of life experiences.”

Often, romantic comedies are more romance than comedy, more sap than slapstick, more crying than chuckling. In a genre where the endings are sometimes as predictable as the jokes preceding them, it seems as if comedy is becoming nothing more than an afterthought. Tim Story’s “Think Like a Man” manages to achieve a much better balance of romance and humor—resulting in a romantic comedy that is actually, well, funny.
“Think Like a Man” follows the love lives of four friends, all of whom fall into four different categories of undesirable daters. Romani Malko stars as Zeke, the “player” who tries his best to date and dump as many women as he possibly can, while Michael Ealy stars as Dominic, the man who is always dreaming of big things but can never manage to hold down an actual job. Terrance Jenkins is Michael, the “mama’s boy” who still occasionally lets his mother tuck him in at night. Comedian Kevin Hart rounds out the group as Cedric, not a happily married man, but a self-proclaimed “happier divorced man.” In his mind, love is only comprised of the three progressive rings: “engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering.” The men see nothing wrong with their love lives until their respective romantic interests (Gabrielle Union, Taraji P. Henson, Regina Hall, and Meagan Good) turn the tables on their lovers after reading comedian Steve Harvey’s new book “Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man.” The men catch on to the ladies’ secret weapon and try to use the tactics in the book against them, only to realize that love transcends sexual and materialistic appetites.
The strength of this movie lies in its humor. Cedric comically carries the movie in the form of one-liners and delightfully inappropriate behavior—such as hitting on his friend’s mother and describing his sexual encounters in embarrassing detail. Some jokes are more race-oriented, which makes sense given the movie’s target African-American demographic. When one of Hart’s white friends calls him out on his failed relationship with his ex-wife, Hart replies, “Hey, man. My people marched, fought, and died for the right to treat each other like shit.” The predominantly black cast relies heavily on racial humor but not to the film’s detriment. It should be noted that while Hart is a stand-up comedian by profession, the other cast member are also funny in their own right. Hart’s one-liners and inappropriate quips would have been far less successful had it not been for the comedic support of the entire cast.
The movie also boasts a ridiculously star-studded cast. Most of them are famous for their roles in other predominantly black movies or television shows. Various cameos in the movie include but are not limited to Wendy Williams, Chris Brown, Sherri Shepard, and even Steve Harvey himself. Those in the main cast have been featured in at least one major movie in the past year, and their smooth on-screen interplay creates delightful banter. The caliber of acting by each of these big names is directly related to the importance of each character’s role in the movie, and this added familiarity enhanced the film’s overall enjoyability.
The plot is only a slightly nuanced version of “He’s Just Not That Into You.” The ending is predictable. Luckily, these elements don’t matter all that much in a realm where people pay money to see the same storylines played out in slightly different ways. The humor in “Think Like a Man” sets it apart from other romantic comedies in that the hilarity in the actual movie excuses the unoriginal plot. There are cute moments full of tender kisses, confessions of love, and implied sex scenes acted out by extremely attractive people. But the beauty here is in the details—the small, funny moments that make the movie worth watching.

If the lyrics on Jack White’s “Blunderbuss” are reflective of reality, then White is in a relationship, and he’s totally whipped. “I hear a whistle, that’s how I know she’s home,” White yelps on “Sixteen Saltines.” On “I’m Shakin,” he references the story of Samson and Delilah, one of the earliest and most famous recordad instances of woman dominating man. It would seem as though White, one of the most charismatic and powerful musicians of his time, has ceded control of himself to another even mightier than he.
But while White may not be in control of his love life, “Blunderbuss” shows him to be in complete control of his songcraft, arrangements, and vocals. This is perhaps the most fleshed-out album White has ever attempted, and it shows for the first time the artist’s musical sensibilities when given complete creative control. It is sometimes hard not to get the feeling that he has been constrained by the groups he played in: he was locked into stomping bass-drum grooves with Meg White by his side and stuck behind a drum kit and without a microphone in The Dead Weather. Instead of using his newfound freedom to turn wildly experimental, White relies heavily on the blues, which he has done throughout his career. However, he also peppers his album with Dixieland, cello-led ballads, and unapologetic, thrashing rock anthems. Although White sings of his subordination throughout, don’t be fooled: for the past 10 years, there have been few better in the music business.
A three-song section in the middle of the album shows White exercising his ability to explore all corners of his musical vocabulary. “Freedom at 21” is a dark tale of abuse urged forward by rumbling snare hits and heavily distorted guitars. Shortly after the final guitar chord wahs  out, vanishing in a haze of feedback, a delicate organ line introduces “Love Interruption,” the first single and one of the strongest songs White has ever written. With its bare-bones instrumentation and frail harmonies, “Love Interruption” is incredibly raw. Many words have been spilled over the concept of love, but White sounds refreshing and genuine when he sings, “I want love / To walk right up and bite me / Grab a hold of me and fight me / Leave me dying on the ground.” The song’s raggedness is highlighted all the more when placed right before title song “Blunderbuss,” an immaculately produced pop ballad that centers around a simple piano phrase and swells and crests through waves of slide guitars and strings.
Yet while the instrumentation and musical style change drastically through just these three songs, they all sound natural sitting next to each other. White’s vocals play a major role in achieving this easy progression. The three songs paint three very different aspects of love, and White carries a new attitude with each one. “Freedom at 21,” the most aggressive of the set, is filled with crisp ad-libs like “Hey!” and “That’s right.” In contrast, White’s voice trembles with nostalgia on “Blunderbuss;” he sings with an impassioned desire that never becomes overly sentimental.
The album has many strengths, but White’s collection of underwhelming melodies means that this latest effort is not a realization of the artist’s full potential. Although “Weep Themselves To Sleep” opens with a powerful piano-and-guitar riff and possesses a moment of classic Jack White guitar artistry, the melody consists of one phrase based around a single note repeated over and over again. Given that some of strongest melodies White has recorded have been collaborative projects with Raconteurs guitarist Brendan Benson (“Hands” or “You Don’t Understand Me”), melodies may be the one musical area in which White isn’t able to manage completely on his own.
However, Jack White’s music isn’t focused around melodies. It’s much more about the storytelling and the emotions he can coax out of a guitar. In this way, White can be seen as an authentic bluesman—an heir in a dying breed—who possesses the ability to sing very specific narratives and make them felt on a universal level. On “Blunderbuss,” White deeply conveys the pain and ecstasy of unrequited love and uncontrollable desire.

With roles ranging from political assassins to romantic bankers, John Lithgow ‘67 has built a varied and distinguished career as an actor in theater and film. However, Lithgow’s resume isn’t limited to stagecraft. He also played a major role in creating Harvard’s Arts First festival, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. In a phone interview, Lithgow talks about the process of building Arts First, his fond memories from the festival, and why it is so similar to a certain aquatic theme park.
The Harvard Crimson: In your autobiography, you said that you came up with the idea of Arts First when thinking about your undergraduate experience at Harvard andthe environment’s “wild variety of creative ferment,” as you call it. What were some of the most memorable experiences during your undergraduate education?
John Lithgow ‘67: Oh, boy. There were so many. I would say some of the most memorable were playing Gloucester in “King Lear” my freshman year, when I was only 18 years old, directing Mozart’s “Marriage of Figaro” in the Leverett House dining hall and the “Beggar’s Opera” in the Adams dining hall. That was a fraction of what I did at Harvard, but those are high points that leap to my mind.
THC: What was the process of starting Arts First like?
JL: I was on the Harvard board of overseers for six years, between 1989 and 1995. I proposed that we create a committee for the arts, and the first and only thing that that committee did was create the festival. President, Neil Rudenstine embraced the idea wholeheartedly, and Myra Mayman, director of the Office of the Arts, created an operating committee. It’s remarkable how many of the elements of that very first year are still in place 20 years later. The extraordinary performance fair on Saturday, the big concert on Friday night, bringing together a dance repertory on Saturday afternoon...all those things were there, just very modest. In 1995, I proposed the Harvard Arts Medal. The idea was to celebrate the fact that, although it’s rare, Harvard men and women do go into the creative arts. Over the years we’ve had major, major figures, like Jack Lemmon, John Updike, Yo-Yo Ma, and Bonnie Raitt. This year, it’s Tommy Lee Jones.
THC: Have any Arts First events stuck out in your mind?
JL: I’ve always enjoyed the Q&A with the various medal winners –there was a wonderful interview with Yo-Yo Ma. I’ve always loved going to Adolphus Busch Hall and hearing the choral groups. I loved it when John Adams came up and conducted his own work with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. I could literally list things for 20 minutes.
THC: It’s been said that Harvard’s Arts First was inspired by the Edinburgh Festival.  How did that event influence you?
JL: When we created it, I sort of named it Harvard’s version of the Edinburgh Festival, but I’ve never even been to the Edinburgh festival. What I always compared it to was SeaWorld, where at any given moment there’s always something going on. You go from one venue to another, and no matter what you do, you can only see 10 percent of the offerings. You leave with a wonderful sense of fulfillment and dissatisfaction that you haven’t seen everything.That’s how SeaWorld always struck me.
THC: What, in your opinion, are the benefits of events such as Arts First?
JL: It seems obvious that it’s a good thing. It’s a wonderful moment of creative rebirth. It’s a wonderful moment for parents to visit. It’s a great kind of morale builder, and it’s a great moment of self identity for the university.

If dramatic lives require grand art to do them justice, then the life of influential American poet Hart Crane deserves a grand staging. “Hart Crane” is an original opera about the life and work of the eponymous poet who sought to create a new, modern vernacular for American poetry. Both the score and the libretto were written by Matthew A. Aucoin ’12 and the show—directed by Devon H. Dunn ’12 and running at the Loeb Mainstage until April 27—follows the Hart Crane’s life as he struggles with his homosexuality and art in the wake of his parents’ lack of understanding. The hauntingly discordant music and a beautiful set help to situate the opera in its historical context while painting Crane as a larger than life figure.
Crane (Jason Connell) as a teen living at home, locked in conflict with his disapproving parents and about to run away to New York to fulfill his poetic destiny. As he struggles to make a living as an artist, he becomes inspired by the Brooklyn Bridge—one of the great marvels of 19th century engineering—and the site then functions as the centerpiece of his most famous poem “The Bridge.” The permanance of the  Brooklyn Bridge stands in stark contrast to Crane’s unstable life.
Connell is especially adept at portraying Crane’s emotional sensitivity and turbulence through his grappling with homosexuality, creative disappointment, and unfulfilled love. For example, the end of the production, Connell is standing on his bed, emotionally wrecked over his lost-love and artistic failures. Connell’s body language portrays with aplomb the emotional transition between excitement for the possibilities of future poetry and despondency over Crane’s life’s inadequacies that this scene requires.
Even though scenes of emotional toil are prevalent throughout the show the show, there are times when the narrative, score, and staging work together] to deliver an optimistic beauty. A particular highlight is the duet between Crane and his lover, a Dutch sailor named Emil Opffer (James B. Danner ’12). Crane enters the scene looking for Opffer, accompanied by a dissonant section of music that mirrors his own anxieties. Upon meeting, the two begin singing, and the score resolves into a section of exquisite harmony. At this point the libretto consists of overlapping lines from Crane’s poetry. The two climb up the stairs, their embrace shown in profile against the Brooklyn Bridge­—elevating their love to the same height and monumental permanence as the city around them.
The score of the opera is filled with dissonant chords that at times briefly resolve into sections of great harmony. The orchestra also functions as a mechanism for situating the opera in its historical timeframe, as it is sometimes called on to play sections of upbeat period jazz music. Under the direction of Aucoin himself the orchestra navigates these abrupt tonal shifts with ease. However, there are times when the volume of the instrumentation overpowers the libretto, with the vocals lost among the cacophony of the score.
The set design­­—impressive in its scale and economy—matches the grandeur and drama of the narrative. The opening scene takes place in Crane’s childhood home against a wall of rich yellows. The set changes in front of the audience, and nowhere is this more magnificent than in the transition from Act I to Act II, when this wall is lifted up to reveal the looming Brooklyn Bridge, the inspiration for Crane’s seminal epic poem. The size and grandiosity of this set provides a great backdrop for the outsized emotion of the narrative. This backdrop undergoes a few minor transformations with various platforms placed and removed in the foreground, but the city remains in the background of the characters’ lives throughout.
“Hart Crane” is an impressive offering from Aucoin. Through a score that uses discordant music to highlight the inner turmoil of its subject, the opera provides a look both at one of America’s most gifted artists and the time period in which he lived. Regardless of one’s pre-existing knowledge of the subject or familiarity with opera, ”Hart Crane” is a spellbinding work of art that casts a spotlight on the poetry of an important era of American history.

“You should be kissed every day—every hour—every minute.” This phrase was faithfully transcribed directly from the lips of Zac Efron, though at the time, his lips were more immediately occupied by the lips of Taylor Schilling. The particularities of the scene—where, when, exactly why this carefully scripted makeout sesh was taking place—are not of importance, but the quotation itself is of interest simply because it might be the overarching thesis of Nicholas Sparks’ career. Sparks, whose romance novels such as “The Notebook” and “Nights in Rodanthe” and their subsequent film adaptations have won him the dual glories of the bestseller list and the box office success, has a singular vision to sell: Fate has someone perfect in store for you, and it’s only a matter of time before you are carried safely to your happy ending. Thus, the motto in its broader context is a claim of what you, the viewer, deserve. “You should be kissed every day— every hour—every MINUTE!”
Audiences have responded well to this comforting doctrine; this week, Sparks offers up his seventh film adaptation, titled “The Lucky One” and starring the aforementioned big-name snoggers. Efron, stubbled and studded-out in a post-“High School Musical” burst of masculinity, plays Logan, a Marine returned from Iraq with PTSD and a guilty conscience. Traumatized by brushes with death and the loss of his buddies, Logan credits his chance survival to a lucky charm: a photograph he happened to find in the sand after an intense nighttime firefight. The photograph—of course—depicts a pretty lady. Upon his return, Logan tracks down the lady in question (Schilling) with stalkerish determination, falls for her as well as for the requisite 8-year-old son who scurries around being cute (Riley Thomas Stewart), and gets embroiled in confrontation with the also requisite swinish father/ex-husband/douchebag (Jay R. Ferguson). The deck is now rigged for the inevitable. Thanks, Fate!
Shockingly enough, “The Lucky One” actually has its powerful moments, thanks entirely to director Scott Hicks. The film, after all, is at least ostensibly organized around a more serious topic than the vicarious erotic desire of its audience: namely, this war, its human toll, and the question of why it exists. Hicks understands that this is where the questions of fate and chance have serious weight, and he milks the drama for all it’s worth, zeroing in on violent events in unstinting slow motion as if trying to isolate the single explanation of why things happen among so many chunks of flying shrapnel. The image of a water bottle rent spectacularly by irresistible force as a blast shakes Logan’s Humvee, the rippling of the skin on his cheek as his body reacts against the blow, his buddy up top annihilated in an indefinable instant. The silent hero of this section of “The Lucky One,” as Simone Weil wrote of Homer’s “Iliad,” is force itself, mangling human lives or slipping quietly past them, its reasons or causes as inscrutable as the concept itself.
But of course, this movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. The notions that the universe’s absurdity is outside the realms of our understanding and that violence and chance might be the final common denominators of life are quickly abandoned in favor of sappy Hollywood fatalism. Hicks, at times, seems to be revolting against the path that the script, or destiny, is dragging his film along. In one maudlin montage, as each of the predestined lovers sits alone trying not to think about the other, Hicks has placed a copy of “Moby Dick” in Logan’s lap open to an illustration of the whale’s tail suspended out of the water, the cartoonish phallus lunging comically out of Logan’s frustrated loins.
Visual gags like this, although hilariously subversive to the film’s tone, can’t make up for the fact that it is selling a sham. There are those who see their lives filled with a lot of bizarre and absurd events, chance encounters, disasters, disappointments, lucky breaks, and triumphs. Some bullets hit and some miss, objects are lost and then found by strangers, governments take entire nations into wars on false premises, and some aren’t kissed every day, much less every hour or minute.
As harmless as Sparks, in all his earnest feel-goodiness, might be in the context of romance, it is difficult to take as an apology for the Iraq War and the thousands of human lives, American and Iraqi, that have been eaten up by a fruitless search for elusive WMDs. “He didn’t die for nothing,” Logan assures his babe of her brother, whose death, we learn, precipitated Logan’s discovery of the dropped photo. The conclusion is debatable at best. That those lucky ones who end up with a final happy ending attribute their resounding success to the hand of Fate is all well and good, but don’t blame others if it leaves a bad taste in their mouths.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vary rarely do shows written by Harvard students leave the confines of Cambridge, but this summer two Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club shows, “The House of Shadows”—written by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13—and “Nine-Sided Box”—created by Adriana I. Colón ’13 and Margaret C. Kerr ’13—will be traveling to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, the largest arts festival in the world, to perform their plays in front of hundreds of people. The month-long festival allows actors, writers, and directors from all over the world to showcase their talents, and has been a historically significant launch pad for big names to get their first start. This year will be the first time the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club sends any work to Edinburgh, and for both shows the decision to make the journey acted as the catalyst for the productions themselves.
“It was something I’ve wanted to do since high school,” says Kerr. Kerr is not the only person who has wanted to bring a Harvard show the the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. “It was something that HRDC had been trying to do for years and years but not been able to work up the funding to do so.” In fact, even though the shows have the support of the HRDC, they have to raise their own funds, are collecting donations at www.glasselevatortheatre.com and www.ninesidedbox.com. After deciding to set forth, Kerr and Colón began toying around with different concepts, and these musing turned into “Box.”
The actors in the show improvise within a previously arranged structure. Members of the cast acknowledge that it will be interesting to see how the dynamic between characters changes throughout the course of the 25-show festival. “One of the amazing things about theater is that the audience very much informs the structure of a performance; the dynamic will change significantly,” says Kerr, who also acts in the show. “In improvisation it can be difficult to know what the other person will do next. By the end of the show, I may be able to guess what’s getting out of her mouth before she says it.”
McTaggart also acknowledges the challenges of performing so intensely for so long. “I hope by the end of the process we don’t kill each other,” he jokes. “There’ll be performances that we’ll be proud of and others that we’ll want to forget. I’m not going there just to present but to learn.”
McTaggart’s road to Edinburgh began spontaneously after a conversation with the cast and crew of “Shadows.” “We were all sitting in a room­—it was very Harvard-esque—and I was like, ‘I want to go to the Fringe,’ and they were like ‘Well, I want to go to the Fringe, too’ and then later I went up to them and was like, ‘You were serious about that, right?’”
But what may have sprung from a lighthearted conversation has turned into a massive endeavor on the part of the production. Along with the work required beforehand, both teams acknowledge that audiences at the festival will be expecting performances of a very high caliber.
“The second Tuesday is known as ‘Suicide Tuesday,’ when you start to question why you went there in the first place,” says McTaggart. While bringing plays from college to the ‘real world’ can be daunting, both “Box” and “Shadows” credit their Harvard educations as the foundation of their work.
“Having an academic background allows you to form new ideas,” says Colón. “People always shortchange how much critical thinking and analysis are in the arts,” says Elizabeth Y. Y. Mak ’12, responsible for set and light design of “Box.” The festival will serve as a way to engage with theoretical aspects of drama and grow as performers and directors.
“It won’t be the best piece I’ll ever write but it’s a chance to learn and grow; if it stays in a desk drawer you’ll never grow [as an artist,]” says McTaggart. He feels that now is the time to do things without being too concerned with practicality. “I’m at the age of 21. It’s not that I have nothing at stake, but I have nothing to lose and everything to gain,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Capoeira was born of desperation. Slaves created this Afro-Brazilian martial art during the era of Portuguese colonialism to train themselves in hand-to-hand combat without their masters catching on. They would use music and song to cover up capoeira’s actual purpose, and over time it became both a disciplined martial art as well as a physically demanding gymnastic dance style. Over time, song and dance became integral parts of the practice.
This year, Harvard’s Arts First festival will see Harvard Capoeira Regional—a group on campus that practices the marital art—perform “capoeira regional,” which, unlike some other styles of capoeira, emphasizes the original Brazilian heritage of the art form. The leader of this group, John Hill ’12, is excited about the performing in the festival. “[Capoeira] is an art form in that it is a martial art, but it also incorporates gymnastics and dance.”  For Hill, the history of capoeira is one of the things that makes it such a unique fighting style. “All martial arts have their historical foundations, and capoeira is no different,” he says.
Hill described how he got into the martial art after seeing it in “The Protector,” a Thai film in which one of the fighters is a capoeirista. After he saw the movie, he researched the fighting style and watched YouTube videos of famous fighters. However, he only started really practicing the art form after he came to Harvard. “I saw a demonstration at the activities fair, and the rest is history,” he says.
What makes capoeira distinct from other styles is the environment that must surround its practitioners. There’s a ring of singers and musicians playing the traditional instruments of capoeira, and in the center the dancers compete to the rhythm set by the group. The entire structure of a fight, including the fighters and the musicians, is known as a “roda.” The songs sung at these “rodas” traditionally are about the lives of slaves and the places they had visited.
Over time, capoeira has taken its musical roots and incorporated it into the practice. The result is a martial art that is beautiful to watch. “It’s a dance-fight-game,” Hill says. Instead of using phrases like, “fight” or “dance,” he emphasizes that the members of the group come to “play” capoeira. “Yes you’re kicking at somebody else, but you’re doing it in a rhythmic fashion. It’s a game played between two people, among a number of other people,” he says.
As one of over 200 exhibitions and performances at Arts First, Harvard Capoeira Regional will put on one of the only performances  featuring martial arts. For Jack Megan, the director of the Office for the Arts, Arts First is in part a showcase of the variety of artistic groups on campus. “These four days call attention to the fact that the arts are important to students at Harvard, and we ought to celebrate what we have,” he says. Between capoeira, Russian folk music, a cappella performances, and Punjabi dance recitals, Harvard Capoeira Regional is one of the groups on campus that exemplifies the artistic diversity of Harvard. “From cultural extremes of A to Z, we’re really trying to capture the breadth of the [Harvard] environment,” Megan says.

Students have likely heard some of the buzz around campus surrounding David Michalek’s “Slow Dancing.” Or rather, they may have seen the gigantic scaffolding-like structures in front of Widener Library projecting larger-than-life images of dancers moving in extremely slow motion. The installation made its debut on Harvard’s campus on Friday, April 20, as part of an Arts First initiative to make art a more visible part of the student experience here at Harvard.
This is not the first time Arts First has brought noted artists or artworks to campus, but it is one of the largest projects there has been in a few years. Often, these projects take months—even years—of planning before they can be put on dispay. Cathy McCormick, Director of Programs for the Office for the Arts says, “It takes time to incubate these kinds of projects. It’s not like artists show up one day and you go, ‘Okay!’ It’s like a research process.” This production differs from other Arts First pieces in that it was not specifically created for Arts First and is primarily focused on dance and movement. “Slow Dancing” was first shown in New York at the Lincoln Center and then toured to London, Venice, Edinburgh, and Paris. The project has come quite a long way from the scribblings in Michalek’s notebooks from 1994.
Michalek worked as a photographer in the fashion industry for clients like Vanity Fair and Calvin Klein. “I had a cushy, bourgeoisie, terrific career that was just chugging along. I started to feel like a fake. There was nothing wrong with it…but it didn’t feel authentic. So I made a decision: I quit. I gave up $20,000 a day, and it was the scariest thing I ever did in my life but of course the best thing I ever did in my life,” he said. This transition was Michalek’s first step in becoming less commercial and more focused on abstract concepts. His recent works have dealt with subjects based on more than just aesthetics. Now a visiting professor at Yale Divinity School, he seeks to answer questions regarding the spiritual connection that people have with art. “Slow Dancing” appeals to a very primal, common human experience in its emphasis on the movement of our bodies.This is reflected in the dancers, who are of many different backgrounds, body types, and ethnicities.
Jack Megan, project director of “Slow Dancing” and Director of the Office for the Arts, maintains that there are deeper levels to the project. “There’s a spiritual quality about it. I’m knocked out by so many not only gifted dancers, but dancers in so many different forms. To me, it feels like this is the Harvard of 2012, not 1940. That led to my wanting to bring “Slow Dancing” to campus,” he says. Megan credits President Drew Faust for being a champion of the arts and for working with the OFA to allow projects like Michalek’s to have a presence on campus. “Here in this iconic Yard, it’s more than a thing of beauty. It’s a statement that yeah, we do art here, too. Who knew?” Megan said.
The goal of those involved with the project was to have students and the public take a pause from their busy lives to encounter art. This does not necessarily mean that the project itself has to be abrasive. “It’s not a loud project. It’s very quiet,” says McCormick. Michalek notes that, caught in the midst of watching the dancers, “People realize they’ve been there for four hours and it’s called them [to stay and watch]. The speed being so slow creates a kind of homogeneity—all seem to have come from a common base. The best portraits teach me to look harder, longer, and deeper at my fellow human beings.”
The coordinators acknowledge the importance of not only slowing down, but also being exposed to art on campus. “If you’re going to [graduate] from a liberal arts college, part of the beauty is that you’re exposed to different subjects,” says McCormick. “There are some students who may not choose directly to take part [in art] but will be exposed to it, and it will make them think in a new way.”
Jill Johnson, one of the dancers featured in the production and director of the OFA Dance Program holds that “Slow Dancing” directly benefits the Harvard community. “It’s mesmerizing in the way that fire and water are mesmerizing; you never tire of it. It reveals the incredibly beautiful practice that dance is. There is a National Endowment for the Arts statistic that only 8% of the American public will ever see a live dance performance. It’s important to expose [undergraduates] to great art,” she says. This project is especially important because of its proximity in undergraduate life, which contributes to student exposure to creative thinking.
“Creativity is a form of knowledge to share information,” says Megan. Indeed, the piece has the potenital to leave a lasting impression on the Harvard community. “I feel so, so lucky and so privileged for the opportunity to do this,” says Michalek. “Anybody would.”

On Sunday, April 29, poetic stylings as different as those of e. e. Cummings, Class of 1915, and Wallace Stevens, Class of 1897-1900, will meet during the event “Poetry at Harvard: A Love Story” in the Agassiz Theater. Their voices will be joined by the voices of an incredible cast of other Harvard-affiliated poets from throughout history, including Anne Sexton, Robert L. Frost, Class of 1899, T. S. Eliot, Class of 1910, and Adrienne C. Rich ’51. Under the guidance of Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory Jorie Graham, Harvard’s current community of young poets will create a single, ambitious poem entirely constructed from excepts of the works of great Harvard poets. The poem will be recited by a cast of about a dozen students, all of whom had a hand in constructing it.
Matthew A. Aucoin ’12 explains the yearning and frustration at the heart of the piece. “It’s a love story because all of these poets had tumultous relationships with poetry, with Harvard, with themselves, [and] with other people. This composite poem—if it’s about anything—is about trying to express your love for a person or a place through poetry,” he says.
Harvard College has played host to some of the world’s most brilliant poets, and this event aimed to link that poetic history to the larger narrative of Harvard’s 375th birthday, which focuses on celebrating the legacy of its students. The voices of all of the different poets that have been affiliated with the College span a massive stylistic range, which the final poem attempts to gather into a unified whole. “The poem goes all over in terms of subject matter—there are excerpts from love poems, philosophical poems, really every period and style. That’s one of the most amazing things about Harvard’s history—there’s every kind of poem in every conceivable style. We’re bringing back to life all the voices of the poets who have come before us,” one of the collaborators, Julian B. Gewirtz ’13, says.
The project began earlier in the year, when Graham and Aucoin reached out to poetry students from the college, asking them to collect excerpts from Harvard poets that were especially moving for them personally. Once the students were assembled, armed with an intimidating supply of brilliant past works, the creation of the poem itself was improvisational and deeply rooted in community. “We all started reciting kind of spontaneously. [Graham] just said ‘Go.’ Since then, a lot of people have said [that] it felt almost magical. It was an inspiring process, and it made us feel like we all had a real say in its shaping,” says Stephanie L. Newman ’13, another collaborator.
The final poem strikes its creators as thematically cohesive in a way that its disparate elements might not have initially suggested. “We didn’t have a central theme in mind, but a couple have emerged,” says Aucoin. “We have seen a lot of the poets struggling with finding someone to fall in love with. And if they can’t find someone, [they look] for a community of like-minded people to live with and to try to be happy with,” says Aucoin.
The community that past poets have struggled to find is here represented in the large cast of students who will recite the poem in rotating shifts, each saying a few excerpts in an effort to create one unfied voice out of many. The act of recitation is especially important to the students, who divorced it from performance, instead viewing the act as a kind of genuine revealing of oneself. “When you memorize a poem, it becomes a part of you internally and something that you own, in a way. It’s in your blood. The rhythm is in your blood. The conceptual part of it is in your spirit,” says Newman.
Harvard’s rich cast of historical poets will come together to present a single piece, filtered through the College’s modern community of poets. Graham and her students aim to celebrate Harvard’s poetic history as well as tap into the pure emotion and experience of poetry with their recitation. As Aucoin says, “What you really want to feel in a recitation is that the poem is the entire world in that moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article about Das Racist almost never happened. I picked up this assignment last Saturday, April 14, and quickly emailed the group’s publicist, as well as its frontman, Himanshu Suri, known more colloquially as Heems.
Saturday night passed. No response. By noon on Sunday, the day of YardFest, I still hadn’t heard anything. At 5 p.m., when YardFest began, my email inbox sat inactive. At 6:30 p.m., when Das Racist took the stage, I still hadn’t heard from them, and at that point I didn’t expect to.
This wasn’t particularly surprising. It’s not that Das Racist refuses to talk to the press or actively avoids them; it’s that they have such a devil-may-care attitude that doing things like scheduling interviews takes more effort than they care to exert. Before their performance, Heems posted to the Das Racist Twitter account, “Harvard today. I am sleepy but I will rap. -H” (Coincidentally, the time of the post is exactly 4:20 p.m.)
A Das Racist set is—probably intentionally—the opposite of refined. Heems and his fellow MC Kool A.D. (Victor Vasquez) and their hypeman Dapwell (Ashok Kondabolu) put on performances that are not so much rehearsed showcases of skill as they are parties: the rappers are aloof, laid back, and seem like they are singing along to someone else’s lyrics rather than they are performing their own.
During the show, Heems spends half the time playing air guitar with his microphone. Kool A.D. picks up an equipment box clearly marked as belonging to The Cataracs and carries it around on stage like a boombox. Dap bounces around the steps of Memorial Church in blue, one-piece coveralls. Somehow, Kool A.D. ends up wearing Heems’ shirt and three baseball caps simultaneously, and at one point, Lakutis—DJ and long-time group affiliate—grabs a half-eaten bag of chips being offered to him from the crowd and unflinchingly proceeds to pour the bag over his head, because, what else is he going to do? Eat them?
At 6:50 p.m., in the middle of their set, Heems posts to his personal Twitter account, “Kid in the crowd look like @harryfraud. Tweetin while rappin. Harvard.”
But I still have no idea when or where I’m supposed to meet these guys. It turns out not to be an issue. As Heems leaves the steps of Memorial Church and makes his way back to his green room—a repurposed seminar room in Sever—I walk up and introduce myself, and he invites me to come along.
My first question is about where Das Racist got its name from. The more verbose answer to this question, as I’d gleaned from prior articles about the band, has to do with taking some of the seriousness out of racial commentary. But to me, Heems simply responds, “It was a stupid decision. We regret it.”
I ask how they thought their set went. “It was fun. Harvard knows how to party,” Heems says with a smirk. It’s difficult to tell if he is being genuine or sarcastic, though I suspect the latter. “I had a great time. This one half-Asian guy in the front crowd knew all the words so I walked up to him to give him a hug.”
I start to ask my next question. “Whenever they announce the artists for YardFest every year—”
“—Everyone gets upset,” Heems finishes, clearly aware of the predictable whining from the student body. However, Heems seems to think the anger is justified. “They’re probably right. We’re pretty overrated.”
“In what way?”
“I don’t know, but we’ll milk it up while we can,” he says.
By now, Kool A.D. has also joined us in Sever, and I ask if they have any other plans for tonight. Heems is intent on having dinner with his girlfriend and her mom, while Kool A.D. contemplates an invitation someone handed him for a party at The Owl Club later that night.
“After the show, someone handed me a thing for a party, but I might just go back to New York.”
Kool A.D. reviews the show with an apathetic grade of “All right,” and Heems is quick to chime in a sarcastic tone, “We thought it was great. Harvard is so fun.”
Later, hanging out in the green room, Kool A.D. starts drawing some characters on the blackboard. The first is a puffy-eyed man with rabbit ears smoking a blunt. The second is a cat with six breasts raising one of its arms in a waving motion. Content with his creation, he turns away from the blackboard, pauses, and then returns to the drawing for sole purpose of adding a vagina.
Both Heems and Kool A.D. say that “Rapping 2 U” is their favorite song to perform. “I like my verse on it, and I rap good,” Heems says. One of Heems’ rhymes on the track states, “They called us joke rap, we kinda weed rap / We just like rap, we don’t even need rap.” The lyric encapsulates Das Racist’s hyper-referential, racially- and socially-conscious style. It is clear from spending time with the group that they don’t take themselves too seriously. As for their self-proclaimed distinction as members of the so-called weed rap genre, I ask Heems if the group did anything to prepare, in a sense, for the concert. “Uh, nothing,” he says. “We did nothing at all to prepare. We don’t really care.”
Despite their apathetic demeanor and winking, critical comments during the show, the band seems to have had a pleasant Harvard experience. Earlier in the day, on the steps of Sever, Lakutis gives me his thoughts on the Harvard student body: “I think they’re hot as shit, and they’ve got an ass that won’t quit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The former glass-walled map store on Mt. Auburn Street will get a brand new look on April 26. In its place will soon boom to life the scintillating 4th Annual Harvard Student Art Show with over 30 artists and more than 50 artworks in the space at 92 Mt. Auburn Street. Undoubtedly one of the most widely publicized art events of the year, the show has aimed to providing artists at Harvard with a platform from which they can not only exhibit their works outside the academic spaces in the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, but also sell them..
Lauren J. Ianni ’12, co-director of the show along with Anna H. B. Ondaatje ’13, says enthusiastically that the new space is a tremendous improvement to the event. “We did not want to have visual arts encased within a theater space, where we would have to compromise the layout and design of the show. Last year, there were stage shows going on concurrently, so it was kind of a hassle to work around,” she says, referencing last year’s exhibition at Farkas Hall. “The new space signifies a separate and own space for the visual artist. We wanted that to stand out,” says Ianni.
There are, of course, other perks to the 92 Mt. Auburn Street venue other than independence from the constraints of the theatrical and choral productions that dominate Arts First. “We picked this space in particular,” Ianni says, “because it’s on the corner of Mt. Auburn and JFK, which is a clear threshold between the public and private spaces of Cambridge and the University.” The gallery’s three glass walls will amplify this visibility. Ianni says that this architectural aspect of the building is basically free marketing. Snoweria Zhang ’12, a liason between the artists and the show’s board members, will also be featured at the show. She is thrilled by the fact that the show finally acquired a professional gallery space. “No more buying cheap partitions and hanging things,” Zhang says.
Unfortunately, there is a downside to the venue, as well: it’s much smaller than the previous spaces. Board members say that they had to limit submissions to two pieces per artist to ensure equal representation. Nevertheless, this change seems to have brought about a more rigorous selection process for the works to be exhibited. “The quality is just as good [as those of previous shows]––if not better,” says Zhang. Ianni is also proud of the diversity of the artists they will be presenting this year. “We brought in an artist-liaison, who is a student at the medical school and a tutor at one of the Quad Houses, so we made a point of soliciting submissions from all grad schools. This year we have increased the number of pieces from graduate schools.”
The students involved do not hesitate to extend lasting improvements to the infrastructure of the event beyond the exhibition space. One such improvement is the creation of a website. “The Art Show is an event-space platform for Harvard artists,” says Ianni. “The website ensures that the event lives outside the time of the event itself, which is both before and after the show.” In addition to this comes PayPal’s corporate sponsorship, which will help the organization with their goal of remaining financially stable over time.
The hugely revamped Harvard Student Art Show will provide a markedly different experience for previous attendees. Its new, professional space will amplify the already outstanding work of the artists involved.

THC: Who are your greatest influences, at Harvard and in the larger artistic world?
ERC: Watching my visual artist friends develop their critical and intuitive faculties has been fascinating. I love the way visual artists think. The philosophical and political questions are different, and even when they’re not, they ask questions with a different attitude. They are encouraged to be irreverent. They also know how to throw a good party. They have to practice for being out in the art world.
ERC: Greatest artistic rival at Harvard?
Norman Mailer [’43].
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
ERC: Even things from a few months ago are a little embarrassing. I think that’s a common problem. College has given me four years to make mistakes with my work, to build my taste, and to move towards a politics for my writing. Now I am excited to focus on a longer project. My friend Tess writes long fiction stories, and is doing a tremendous amount with them, and still they’re not anywhere near the size of a novel. I was editing one of them a few weeks ago, and I thought, this length feels very luxurious.
THC: What is the funniest/strangest arts event you’ve been involved in?
ERC: Earlier this year, I got to tell [writer Joan] Didion, “You are chic.” For me, that was an event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jones Receives Medal
“Why not? It’s Tommy Lee Jones,” said Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts at Harvard, when asked why Academy-Award-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69 will receive the 2012 Harvard Arts Medal. On Thursday, the Arts First festival will kick off with a ceremony in which University President Drew G. Faust will present Jones with the award. The medal, Megan said, is meant to call attention to an alumnus or alumna who has done extraordinary work in the arts and who inspires Harvard students to imagine a life in the arts. “Tommy Lee Jones hits on all these levels,” Megan said.
Jones will discuss his work in conversation with fellow actor John Lithgow ’67. A former English concentrator and Dunster resident, Jones acted in student theater productions and played for the varsity football team while at Harvard. In past years, he has helped advise the University on its arts policies.
Student Composers’ Works
Some collaborations are more than the sum of their parts. On Friday at the Lowell House Library, seven student composers will present their original compositions that will be played by student musicians.
The Student Composer Concert, presented by the Harvard Composers Association, includes the work of three composers enrolled in the Harvard/New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) Five-Year B.A./M.M Joint Program. “The caliber of the concert is really high,” says Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14, board member of the Harvard Composers Associaton and student composer whose work will be featured in the concert.
The Harvard Composers Association promotes the presence of 20th- and 21st-century music concerts and supports the work of young composers on campus. “[The event] is a collaboration between artists who are writing and performing, and that is so rare,” says Rabinowitz. “It makes a powerful statement for what we can do on this campus without any outside influence.”
Swords Drawn in Ring of Steel
Amid the usual instrumental music and vocal harmonies, this year’s Arts First festival will also feature the clangs of metal against metal. Ring of Steel, Harvard’s very own theatrical stage-fighting group, will showcase its carefully choreographed drills and fights for all to see. The group is led by Athena E. Eyster, a graduate student in the Deparment of Earth and Planetary Sciences.
“[Ring of Steel] blurs the line between martial arts and acting,” said Jason LaRue ’12, a member of the group. “We’re actually reacting to what our opponent is doing” on stage.
Ring of Steel will perform on Saturday on the Harvard Yard stage and the Science Center lawn. The group will invite audience participation, and LaRue looks forward to seeing spectators try out the art form. “If anybody…wants to participate, we’ll probably have some practice swords lying around they can pick up.”
Harvard’s Music Festival
For those who missed Coachella or can’t wait for the Newport Folk Festival or Outside Lands, the Arts First festival will feature 11 artists in its own BandFest. The festival, held on Sunday outside the Holyoke Center, will include performances by students and affiliated musicians in styles ranging from folk-rock to dubstep.
Leah Reis-Dennis ’13 sings for The Nostalgics, a Motown soul band performing in BandFest, and said she looks forward to increasing her band’s exposure as well as promoting live music on campus. “It is a cool opportunity for a lot of live bands to play for each other, to play not only for the Harvard community but also the Cambridge community,” she said. “You have people who are coming to see you—friends and family—and then you have random people walking by Harvard Square who wonder why there is a random Motown band playing outside Au Bon Pain.”
 
Il Teatro Comico
Holden Chapel will become an Italian-language theater on Thursday as the students of Italian 40: “Advanced Oral Expression. Ciak... si parla!” present their annual staged performance of Italian literature. This year, the production incorporates texts like Luigi Lupi’s play “Le metamorfosi di Arlecchino” and Carlo Goldoni’s monologue “Il teatro comico” in a meta-theatrical performance.
The class hopes to inspire lower-level students of Italian to continue studying the language, performers said. With this aim, the storyline of their production is especially fitting. “[The play is] about the transition, or metamorphosis, from being struggling actors to becoming blossoming, well-trained Italian performers,” Christian E. Garcia ’13 said.
The performers said they hope to entertain their fellow students in addition to inspiring them to new heights in their studies. “This is a way to get them to recognize that they can understand more than they probably think they can,” Victoriya Levina ’14 said.
 
Theater and Prejudice
Although we might think that we live in a world free of persecution, the fact is that we never know when prejudice will rear its ugly head again. This idea is, in part, the message of Jean-Claude Grumberg’s play “Dreyfus,” which will be staged at the OBERON on Sunday under the direction of Guila C. Kessous. The play is centered on the notorious Dreyfus Affair that rocked France in the 1890s, a scandal in which a Jewish officer was wrongly accused of treason.
For Kessous—a UNESCO Artist for Peace and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School—this production is not just relevant for Jews. “It is not only about anti-Semites, and it is not only about anti-Semitism,” she said. For her, it is ultimately a play about people taking action after their false sense of security is broken. The show is set in Poland in 1931, where several Jews are putting on a play about the Dreyfus Affair. “The characters are putting on a play that they feel very far from, but actually they are right before World War II,” she says.
The play will be followed by a talk by His Excellency François Zimeray, the French Ambassador for Human Rights.
VES Film Screenings
The Visual and Environmental Studies department will hold its own miniature film festival in the Carpenter Center from Thursday through Saturday. The films, both live action and animation, are the culmination of VES students’ work this year. In addition to screening pieces created by underclassmen, the department will be holding its annual screening of senior thesis films.
Brian A. Paison ’12, whose thesis film “Good Cop, Bad Cop” will be screened, said he appreciates how the festival includes work from across the VES department. He remembers fondly the screenings of his sophomore and junior year pieces at previous years’ festivals. “It brings everyone together. Not only do you have the film screenings through all the VES classes, but you have photography right next door,” he said, referring to the Carpenter Center’s neighboring exhibition of VES visual art theses.
According to participating filmmaker Sheema Golbaba ’14, the screenings offer attendees a look into the department. “It’s always nice to know what a department like VES is up to—what kind of curriculum is being instated and what kind of students and work are being developed,” she said.
Shakespeare Scavenger Hunt
Truly unique interpretations of Shakespeare are few and far between. Yet the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s upcoming production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” on Saturday is framed as an interactive scavenger hunt, which begins at the West Patio of the Loeb Drama Center. The play is performed in multiple locations of the yard, which participants will have to discover by using clues.
The concept of director Margaret C. Kerr ’13 was inspired by a play she saw at Oxford University her sophomore year of high school. “I always wanted to do an outdoor production of ‘A Midsummmer Night’s Dream,’ but when I got to campus as a freshman I started seeing more potential locations.”
Though the play is still presented chronologically, the interpretation allows the audience to choose their own path from scene to scene. “Creating this air of [mystery, in which] you might see something [or] you might not adds some dimension to the play that you might not otherwise see if you were sitting through it straight through,” says Kerr.
Last-Minute Orchestra
The aptly named Last Minute Orchestra plans to rehearse only once before its Sunday performance in the Lowell House courtyard. To conductor and Lowell House Opera music director Lidiya Yankovskaya, it is this spontaneity that makes the performance exciting.
“Everybody’s put together at the last minute,” Yankovskaya said. “It’s not something that’s organized in the traditional way, and we don’t necessarily know who’s going to [play].”
“Untraditional” seems to be a theme of the Last Minute Orchestra’s annual performance of Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture.” The orchestra might be joined by helium balloons from the science departments, the Lowell House Bells, and even kazoo players, according to Yankovskaya. Participation in the performance is open to the public.
Yankovskaya expects the performance to be a hit. “We’ll be outside in the courtyard, and people can sit outside…and just enjoy the music.”
Breaking Boundaries
For the student artists featured in “Breaking Boundaries: Arts, Creativity and the Harvard Curriculum,” liberal arts courses have taken “arts” literally. The exhibit, which runs tomorrow through Saturday at Arts @ 29 Garden, will showcase art made by students for classes ranging from General Education courses to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 52: “Biology of Plants.” The projects were funded by grants from the Elson Family Arts Initiative.
Some works were created in subjects not traditionally associated with art, while others represent students’ first serious art projects. Alexander K. Delaney ’14, an engineering sciences concentrator whose book of photographs is featured in the exhibit, said he had never taken any art-related courses at Harvard before he took Culture and Belief 30: “Seeing is Believing: A History of Photography.” The course, he said, helped him see the world from an artists’ perspective. “Gaining this better grasp of how to analyze photographs definitely assisted me in determining what I wished to achieve with individual photographs as well as with the project as a whole,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
JNM: One of the best moments of my time here has been very recently, when I came to the realization that it was okay to not have something explicit to say. My thesis involves a lot of mindless, repetitive tasks which evolved out of things I started doing and couldn’t stop: I startled doodling in class one day and after pages of test doodles, it eventually grew into a 5’ x 11’ doodle, which I’ve spent over 200 hours on so far. I started out wanting to create something that anyone could appreciate, that someone would walk in to the exhibit, see, and think, “Wow.”
THC: Who are your greatest influences, at Harvard and in the larger artistic world?
JNM: My mother, Tara Donovan, and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, in that order.
THC: In 30 years where do you see your skill with your medium having taken you?
JNM: Ideally I would be an artist who is able to live off the sale of her work. However, that rarely happens. While I have no plans for after graduation other than Burning Man and a cross country bike trip, I can see myself 5 years from now working on a film in either the art or sound department, and spending my free time making my own art. Whatever I do, I am determined not to become an accountant—not that there’s anything wrong with that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
MJC: I think the defining moment was going to a Brad Watson “Writers in the Parlor” reading when I was a junior.  He talked about the different things that inspired him, kind of rubbed his writerly beard for a while, and then suddenly he started reading this really quiet, really slow, unbelievably moving and explosive story--it was about two sisters and a recovering addict who goes to rent their empty bedroom. Right after that I thought, I really want to write something half as good as this.
THC: Who are your greatest influences?
MJC: There’s that great line in “Midnight in Paris” where Ernest Hemingway’s character says something to the effect of, “If someone else writes something great, you hate that it’s great.  And if they write something bad, you hate that it’s bad.” But actually I love when my friends write great stuff, just like I love when I write good stuff.  It’s all just an additional amount of good stuff anyway, and all we’re trying to do is make more good stuff, right? I remember one fellow member of the Advocate wrote a story that had a gypsy reading in it.  I loved it so much that I tried to incorporate one into a story of my own.
THC: Where do you see yourself in 30 years?
MJC: Hopefully employed. God let’s hope so.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
MJC: I’ll think: God, no wonder nobody hired that guy.

THC: Defining artistic moment at Harvard:
SNK: I suppose I could say the production of “The Marriage of Figaro” I did with Dunster House Opera this past winter.  The translation I worked on with Matt Aucoin ‘12 feels rather like the first genuine accomplishment I’ve made in my life. Of course, it’s far from perfect (I’ll be editing it heavily over the summer), but I finally feel as if I’ve made some sort of solid contribution to the art form.
THC: In 30 years, where do you see your skill with your medium taking you?
SNK: Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea.  The fact is that, as an artist, I have no grand ambitions. I just want to work in the theater, no matter what the job entails. Maybe I’ll be directing, maybe I’ll be acting, maybe I’ll be translating, maybe I’ll be sweeping up the stage after everyone leaves.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on college work?
SNK: With the greatest embarrassment.  It’s how I look back on just about everything I’ve done. I’d like to think that I’ve been improving, but somehow every time I look back all I can find are more slip-ups.

THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
BL: I’m currently designing the set for “Hart Crane” on the Loeb Mainstage. I’ve spent the last four years working on various shows in the space, but this is my first time designing a set. I feel so very privileged to be working on this project with Matt [A. Aucoin ‘12] and a very talented staff and cast. It feels like the culmination of all our years of dedication, and it’s just so rewarding to see it all come to fruition on this scale.
THC: Greatest artistic rival at Harvard?
BL: I wouldn’t say I have a rival, but that’s not to say that we aren’t competitive. Theater is an inherently collaborative process, and we all push each other to “make art”—to make something new and exciting and beautiful. The goal is to push the limits of what can be achieved.
THC: What is the funniest/strangest arts event you’ve been involved in?
BL: I was producing “Antony and Cleopatra” for a good friend who insisted that his high school teacher’s snake be involved in the suicide scene. So we arranged for the snake to live in the theater, and it repaid us by almost burning down the building. True story. That is one of the most stressful phone calls I have ever received.

THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
THC: One defining moment was seducing Julianne Moore to kiss me while playing Mark Zuckerberg on the Hasty Pudding stage. It made me realize if you’re convincing enough as a nerd, ANYONE will kiss you.
THC: In 30 years where do you see your skill with your medium having taken you?
THC: After Harvard, Plan A is to go to L.A. and learn how to be a film and/or TV producer. While there haven’t been a lot of opportunities to gain experience in that area here, there are common elements in most artistic projects, and I’m excited to bring those experiences to the big, scary real world.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
THC: In a lot of ways, I’ve never been happy with anything I’ve done. There’s never enough time, never enough sleep, never enough manpower. But every mistake I try not to make again, and I guess that’s what all the failing is for. I’m glad for all the stuff I got to try here because I’ll never have to do it again!

REFLECTION:
My thesis is titled Genius Loci, and it is precisely that “spirit of place” that sparks and organizes my poems. How a poem takes shape to me is the direct product of the place where I write it. The season, the weather, the accent, the landscape, and the type of flora and of fauna are important. Also, the rhythm, the pace of speech, the nature of the dusk, and the colors of the places where I write poems have a compositional- arranging effect. Writing poems to me is a process of looking hard, of sensory mosaic. It’s all about image progressions. It’s a matter of allowing the senses to rove, to impinge upon and collide with things, and then to gather the queer echoes that come back and to try to describe them as accurately as possible. If abstraction comes in, it’s only if images create a friction when they rub against others brought into proximity on the page. Perhaps that’s why I’m drawn to the masters of the deep image and to the Spanish surrealists, Lorca and Vallejo in particular.
The thesis itself consists of 51 poems, divided into 5 sections. I wrote them while back home in West Virginia, with the tulip poplars and the mountain ravines; in lower Manhattan and in Brooklyn, with their faster heterogeneous landscape; and while in Spain and in Massachusetts. I found that the form my poems take depends on the landscape surrounding me, and also on the seasons. Spring is a season that exfoliates itself, that breeds, that never stops expanding. So the spring-poems in section II of my thesis have lusher imagery and have longer prose-like lines, punctuated largely by em dashes, because spring never lets the senses rest. Conversely, in winter, the poems took the form of spare quatrains with sparse imagery because the season left the senses naked, cold. And while in New York City, the poems became short and descriptive, in an effort to organize the expansiveness, the suddenness, of the constantly-fluctuating urban microdramas.
The Murmur
 
And always the murmur begins—
the embedded trance
ripping to
and rising—the moth-
wing letting empty of dust—And
the skin will be part of it, the worst
skin, the desertflesh, the whiskey dunes of
shoulders—and seen from the
back—birds pausing  to consider diving to eat—
So hasp the hedgerows they are improper—and
the fetid burbling of hermit thrushes crack
open in wind—Be at home in them—
Just now, the faint bone-
system of the wicker-broom still held in scent
from the oil
preserves the tan-blond
nerves of hard silhouettes—sour now—
there is no food for them—
If one bends to see the blown glass
laying its trance on each of the ribs
the motion closes, the breath
builds skin, pocks—at once the fingers are dank
root systems—uncover
foxmilk, spoils, troves of ash—
cavernous purples—
Could I ever ferment—and the nature of
my roundnesses soften—the oil-
slicks of May be re-
possessed—Now here, in the crenellated
pause preceding laughter—the magnolias
shriek open—where the old
owls laugh—Leaflessness was never
a prophecy—Pills of
snow curl into their own throats
and lay claim there, intrude on their own
blanched flesh—This ripped light
slits open, releases, cauterizes
every hole —The larvae’s tongues harden somewhere—
the blood-ice seems smudged with
lice—
 and everything is a wetness—and
the forehead feels the
sky permit it—Then
a reddish silence claps over everything—
moths drown in that well, their strong ligaments
dissolve into curs barking—
If I can protect you it can only be from
the blurts of knives—the spacious
licks of mauve—The dolls’ heads
that roll out of them and away
are not without eyes, no one has yet to
eat them—So I ask you to
lean in—Know the cold is just-done from
the bleached semen smell of chestnuts
blooming—clean splinterish light that threads
over everything—I ask you to
listen—you can never possess
the loudness of a tossed cigarette—
Reuse the wicker’s oils, crawl into
the leaves, into the wefts of snow—
in greenish light—I tell you
this: Court the beautiful
tone-deaf woman who stops every day to clench and
pick up a leaf—just outline—
Imagine how she could ever vow for
anything—And know—Nothing
in this brackish ice-lit time was ever
wasted—
Locus
 
This collection of torches convulsing in ink:
it is not what I wanted to give you.
All whites look older at night and yet
the tapestry has to include them….
I wanted you to sip this one swatch of light
that stands singly, and
the tan peasant wind that catches and fans
the thin milk of its undergarment, and
how morning blood un-hasps
the hatches behind sleep's cogs, flooding
and the blasted furnace that risks ecstasis
according to… Is this truly the color of my hands?
I wanted to give you the searing first glance
again, wanted you to grab and fold
into that one swatch of cloth
and stay and raise your hands
and your children's hands later when
I melt into cadenza and we waft hoarsely past these
pinewood rafters, records of starlings—then—
till chance is at last served raw to stirring gods,
till I can’t name the scent of any ripeness
and no longer know what cool water means,
I will needle my eyes into
the position of afterstars. I will make
light trip and sift off sandstone in
the quarries. We have witnessed
too many rutilant past tenses.
Now I shall be the saver of pauses.
We will need breath later.
We erred. Sky should be easier.
I thought this would be different, this looking up.
I thought there would be a granary.

REFLECTION:
The hardest part about writing my thesis was explaining it to people. You should be able to pitch any good script in about a sentence, like, “After her grandson gets hurt in a surfing accident, an old lady decides to learn how to surf to win the big competition,” (Title: Surfing Grandma. Tagline: “Surf ’s up!” Choice dialogue: “Hey look, it’s a surfing grandma!”). The story I wanted to tell was a little more complicated. It’s about a Catholic family living in New York in 1965, around the time when the Catholic Church held the Vatican II Council that decided that Masses should be given in the vernacular instead of Latin. Joseph (he’s the father) finds himself alienated from the Church while trying to keep his family together during a period of social change—his daughter who’s discovering her sexuality, his son who’s starting to hang out with a bunch of guitar-playing bums, and his wife who’s secretly volunteering at a soup kitchen. See? That was not a successful elevator pitch. That took like two sentences, and one of them had a dash in it. But it was the story I wanted to tell. My family’s Catholic, but my grandparents (my mom’s parents are divorced, so I have three sets) are as different as canbe. My father’s parents are devout Catholics and devout Democrats; my mother’s father and stepmother are Florida Republicans; and my mother’s mother married a Jewish guy. But they’re all the same age, and they all spent the ’60s living just across the Hudson River from each other, in Nyack and Ossining (where my thesis takes place). So how did they all end up with such different beliefs? And where does anybody get their religious beliefs anyway? I did a lot of research into Latin Masses and ’60s slang, and I interviewed one of my grandparents and some family friends, from whom I fragrantly stole a number of anecdotes. (You can’t tell me that your priest once came onto the altar dressed as Jesus while singing Jesus Christ Superstar and not expect me to put that in a script). But I never delved too deep into my family’s own beliefs. This isn’t what happened to my family in the ’60s; I wanted this to be an imaginary story, a parable about reconciling our faith and our country, about what we leave behind when we move forward, and about how we always hurt the people we try too hard to protect. Over the course of writing, I did the best I could to hone in my story, thanks mainly to the help of my adviser Danny Rubin. (Goodbye periodic flashforwards to 2002, goodbye lengthy discussions about Dorothy Day, hello montages set to protest rock). And eventually I figured out the easiest way to pitch it: “It’s like Fiddler on the Roof, but for Catholics in the 1960s.” It doesn’t quite capture the nuance I was going for, but it gets the job done.
SCENE FROM “AMERICAN CATHOLIC”:
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
The Spot has been kicked up into high energy. Bonfires are going, BEATNIKS and HIPSTERS sit around smoking, scantily clad GIRLS, BOOZE, DRUGS. Billy and Mary walk through the crowd of teenagers.
MARY: This place... is... so neato. I can’t believe you’ve even been here before.
Billy stiffens up ever so slightly.
MARY (CONT’D): Do you know anyone here?
BILLY: Yeahh! Those guys over there, they go to Ossining High.
MARY: What are their names?
Billy glares at her, then looks past her shoulder.
BILLY: There, I know that guy.
Mary turns around. Her eyes widen. Sitting on a log across from her is HARRISON, a dreamy hipster. Long hair, chiseled features, a little facial hair.
MARY: You know that guy?
BILLY: Harrison, he’s from Schenectady or something... What, you think he’s cute?
Mary’s just staring at Harrison.
BILLY (CONT’D): Mary!
MARY: What?
BILLY: Do you, y’know, find him attractive?
MARY (almost in a daze): He’s a fucking stud.
BILLY: Ah, all right.
MARY: What’s your problem?
BILLY: Let’s just go.
MARY: Are you serious? We just got here!
Mary grabs onto Billy’s arm, trying to turn him back around.
VOICE (O.S.): What the heck?!
Mary and Billy turn to see JO JR behind them.
MARY: Oh crud.
JO JR.: What are you doing here?
MARY: I just wanted to do something fun.
BILLY: Give her a break, Jo-Jo--
JO JR.: Oh shut up! Why the hell did you bring my sister here?!
BILLY: Hey, listen...
JO JR.: What?!
BILLY: She asked me to bring her.
JO JR.: That’s your explanation?!
BILLY: She asked!
JO JR.: So you shoulda said “No!”
MARY: Oh, screw you, why can you come here but not me?
JO JR.: Because you’re a stupid girl!
MARY (beat): Fine.
Mary storms off, heading out toward the parking lot.
JO JR.: Dammit!
Billy looks at Jo Jr. What should we do?
JO JR. (CONT’D): What are you looking at me for?! You brought her, you take her home!
Billy walks off after Mary. Jo Jr sighs. He turns around, knocking over a box of Colt 45’s. Jo Jr jumps down to pick them up---only for Harrison the Hipster to kneel down next to him. Harrison’s got his guitar strapped on.
HARRISON: Here, lemme help--
JO JR.: Thanks, sorry.
HARRISON: No harm done.
JO JR.: That’s, uh, that’s a really cool guitar you’ve got.
HARRISON: Oh thanks, man! You play?
JO JR.: Oh, no! I mean, I’m trying. I can’t play yet.
HARRISON: No way! You should bring your guitar around here, I’ll show you a thing or two.
JO JR.: Really?
HARRISON: For sure. I’m Harrison.
JO JR.: Hey.
HARRISON: And your name--
JO JR.: Oh, I’m Joseph. Junior. Jo Jr.
Jo-Jo. You can -- my friends call me Jo-Jo.
HARRISON: Jo-Jo. Far out.
Harrison sticks his hand out to Jo Jr. Jo Jr slowly smiles and shakes his hand.
INT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT
A slightly rundown bar, but full of character. The crowd is packed with BIG MEN on their way home from work, beers in hand, the air thick with smoke. Joseph sits at a table. Tommy -- Joseph’s pal from work -- walks over from the bar, carrying two pints. He passes by a GROUP OF MEN with FIDDLES tuning their instruments.
TOMMY: Hey, I’ve got a suggestion for ya: “Kumbayaaaa my lord, Kumbayaaaa!” The Fiddlers boo Tommy, waving him away.
TOMMY (CONT’D): Oh come on! Haven’t you heard? We’re supposed to be singing like the goddamn Protestants now!
Tommy walks off, laughing.
JOSEPH: I don’t think they like your voice.
TOMMY: Neither do I!
Tommy puts the pints down on the table.
JOSEPH: Oh for crying out loud--
TOMMY: I am not leaving here til Isee the bottom of your glass!
Joseph sighs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
REFLECTION: 
 You get selected for the creative thesis in, I don’t know, March or April of the year before the year you’re going to spend writing the thing, and you get this wonderful, attentive advisor, and—here’s this open project. And all this time. Yikes.
One great thing was the leeway. I worked on an essay or two in the fall, barely; I worked and worked in the two weeks after February 22, 2012. That’s Ash Wednesday—the longest essay in my collection was set on that day, the day after Mardi Gras, in New Orleans, LA. I was remembering and revisiting locals I had met the summer before, people who were in a lot of ways trying to recover from their city, with their city. I wrote fast about all the slow time I spent knowing them.
I got the idea for that essay—the bulk of my thesis—in early February. I met Walter Isaacson, of recent Steve Jobs fame, who’s a New Orleanian, and I told him I’d been an “interloper” in the city the previous summer, and he said, “Everyone is,” and I told him I’d grown up there, too, and then he suggested I go back for this Ash Wednesday angle. I booked.
I guess you come to know something in your own time. My advisor, Darcy Frey, if he’s being generous, will say I came to write something in my own time. He gave me the leeway for it.
Writing quickly on a deadline—that’s what came of a creative thesis in nonfiction, literary journalism, and I’m glad I had those editors, their encouragement, and all that time, given and compressed and expanded and made.

EXCERPT FROM “SQUARES”
The 1-bus in Cambridge runs from Harvard Square, down and through Central Square, passing some other Squares, I’m sure, on the way.  Hunched people from the no-name places scatter around the open bus.  If you see one of them getting off at Harvard, across the street from an Au Bon Pain on Massachusetts Ave., and not wearing the glum, how about this bus? look that other riders do, know—there’s a chess player.
What he was—he was a chess player.  I watched him sit down one night at a stone chess table.    There are half a dozen chess tables here on Mass. Ave., all with the black and white of them chipped into rock.    It’s the tables that take the people from the bus.     Chess players.  They play—they array, they position, they clock, and they place pieces.     Their hands flit and wring and think and press.  It has a certain rhythm to it, what they do, like a symphony at street side.
“We only talk about chess,” this guy told me, later.
“That’s how we know each other,” said another.
I saw that first chess player, and I kept watching—he was playing himself in chess.     Strange.    He looked ragged.  A homeless guy heckled him.
“Eighteen minutes,” the guy said, and he had a bearded clock-mouth, and he sunk into a pile of blankets.    Near the door, the place was a gallery of fools.  There were two addicts, each weaving around the other, like a pair of boxers, muttering.    And still this man in blankets, still berating the doors.
“Eighteen minutes until it closes,” he said.    His voice rocketed through the night.     “When you going to leave?”
I ought to have been asking myself the same question.    But I was in a lull with this scene—the chess player, especially.    He wandered around the room, craning at his board from every angle.    He fluttered down into a seat—white’s seat, black’s seat.    Resting his chin in hands, maybe for a minute, maybe three minutes, he would occasionally snap up his head like he was looking for air.    He played a move for black, and then circled to the other side.    White, black.    He moved with the pieces.
It was a Tuesday late in September, and, if we could trust the clock-mouth, it was eighteen minutes before 2 AM.    The chess player had made five moves in as many minutes, each with the same slow intent.    He was oblivious, and his oblivion kept drawing me in.    I noticed some crumbs on his unwashed cheek.    He breathed into the glassy windowpane.    He danced and danced a dance of small steps, all leading up to the next shift of plastic on cloth.    He slid the white bishop on a long diagonal.
A girl in an apron asked him to leave.

REFLECTION: 
I was never under the illusion that the second time would be easier. But I had no idea how much more challenging writing this novel would be. It has been (and continues to be) a very exciting journey, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work on this novel for my creative thesis and to develop my writing under the expert guidance of Bret Johnston—I could not have dreamed of a more fantastic advisor.
I realized that I wanted to be a writer when I was eight years old. On a recent visit home, while looking through a box of childhood items, I discovered that, while (thank goodness) my writing style has changed quite a bit, I have more in common with my eight-year-old self than I realized.
When I was eight, I undertook my most ambitious writing project yet: a short story about a young Jewish girl who immigrates to America to escape the pogroms in her shtetl in the Old Country. It was fourteen pages long, and it featured some very skilled marker illustrations of people whose eyelashes extended halfway up their foreheads and several large drawings of something that looked like a sailboat on steroids. I called it “A Different Life,” and I decorated the title page with brown and grey suitcases.
During my archaeological dig through childhood mementos, I also found and read through a journal full of entries written when I was eight years old. On January 12, 1999 at 8:40am, I wrote:
My body fills with joy when I think of the perfect way to begin a story, but I am much happier when I think of the bad person in the story, the setting, and the problem. Then I’m over excited.
When it comes right down to it, I feel the same way today. This is why I write, and why I want to spend my life writing: for those unparalleled moments of, as my younger self described it, “over-excitement.”
EXCERPT FROM “RESERVED FOR AMERICA”
Meredith hadn’t realized that there were any Jews left in Ukraine. She grew up imagining Ukraine as a faraway place frozen in the 1930s. It was the Old Country. That was what Nana called it. Not Ukraine, not the Ukraine, not Russia. She realized that the country of Ukraine still existed, but it felt abstract. The Ukraine she imagined was a country full of shtetls with lively marketplaces and peddlers proffering fruits and vegetables and fish and pickled goods; babushkas in kerchiefs; goats and chickens in front yards; people whose last names referred to their family profession— shoemakers were named Schusterman; mothers kvetching in Yiddish and baking challah with their daughters; and families sitting warmly around the table for Shabbat dinner in a modest home, the room illuminated by the glow of the two tall Sabbath candles.
And then the deafening sound of hoof beats, pounding down the quiet shtetl lanes. The pogroms. The vicious Cossacks riding their white horses (were they actually white? Had Nana told her this, or had she looked it up, or was this her own contribution to the story?). Meredith couldn’t quite remember where or how she had been when she obtained some of the threads that had made their way into the image she had developed of the Old Country. She imagined the Cossacks invading the shtetls during the winter, the sky dark and the woods blanketed with snow. There was fire (why fire? were there rifles, too?) outside, in the distance, and there was Nana as a young girl huddling in a cold corner of a dark room with her mother and brothers, plotting their escape. And Nana’s father shivering in the snowy woods, trying to hide from the Cossacks— he was a kulak, and a prime target during the pogroms.
Meredith collected all of the fragments Nana Esther told her over the years and tried to put things together the best she could. Nana and her family could not secure passage on a boat to America, so they went to Argentina first and lived there for several years while they struggled to scrape together enough money to immigrate (illegally) to America via third-class tickets on a cruise ship. The ship stopped for one day in New York City, and Nana’s family got off and never returned. There were several holes in the story, multiple pieces that didn’t add up. There were rumors of an illegitimate half-brother conceived during the boat trip to Argentina. (Who was the father? Meredith’s mother said that her Uncle Mo, Nana’s brother, said it was an Argentine, but there couldn’t have been any Argentines on the boat from Russia). The family tree was a mess. Everyone was related to each other in more ways than one, which was apparently how things were done in the shtetls, in the Old Country. Nana’s first husband, Meredith’s grandfather, was also her first cousin once removed. (Her subsequent three husbands were not blood relatives, however.) And then the question of how old Nana had been when she emigrated. Meredith had narrowed it down to between eleven and fourteen, give or take. Nana frequently changed her mind about her date of birth, which made it difficult to construct a chronology. Usually, she was born in 1916, but occasionally she was born as late as 1919. The day of her birth was July 30th or December 1st, depending on the year. Meredith’s mother never knew which day was the “right” one ahead of time, so she gave Nana birthday gifts on both days. In past years, before Meredith was born, she only celebrated Nana’s birthday once a year. Nana sometimes hinted that she had an upcoming birthday; this was how her mother determined the date for that year. But other times, she wouldn’t mention anything, and after the fact would take to bed, devastated and lamenting that nobody loved her, which was an activity Nana frequently indulged in when she was not occupied by a man.
In February of her senior year in college, while she was busy trying not to fall apart, Meredith received an e-mail from the American Jewish Community Council, calling for applications for a two-month long summer trip to teach English to Jewish elementary school students and help reinvigorate the Jewish community in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. Meredith had never heard of Dnepropetrovsk, and she had never traveled out of the country by herself before. She knew no Russian or Ukrainian. She had never taught English as a second language.
She decided to apply.
Her mother thought that she was out of her mind. “You want to go to the fucking Ukraine?”
“It’s just an application. I haven’t committed to anything. I just—I thought it might be interesting,” Meredith said.
“Our family risked their lives to escape, and now you want to go back?”
“I would be teaching Jewish kids. I could have been one of those kids.”
This softened her mother some. “I just hope you’re not doing this for Nana’s sake,” she said.
“I’m not.”
“Because you don’t owe her anything. She wasn’t a good grandmother to you. She let us down.”
“I know,” Meredith said. Now, five months later, she was on her way to a city in south-central Ukraine whose name she still couldn’t figure out how to pronounce.

REFLECTION: 
 My thesis is mostly made up of poems to be read in the usual ways, on the page or aloud. But “Poem for Violin” is a duet for solo violin and the silent speaker of the poem; it’s a musical piece intended for performance. In performance, the violinist plays the score (excerpted here), and the text of the poem is projected, letter by letter, onto a screen behind the performer, at the points specified in the score. It’s important that the text be performed, that is, that someone sits a a laptop and types the words out in real time. The typer is a performer too, and can decide exactly where and how fast to reveal the text in the same way the violinist can decide what tempo to take and how to inflect the notes.
The piece is a duet, but the two voices speak in different mediums, one in words, one in music; one manifests itself visually, in silence, and one reveals itself in sound. I want to emphasize the shared loneliness of solo violinist and solo lyric speaker. Each seems to envy the powers unique to the other’s medium, and each tries to break into the other’s world: the violin line strives for linguistic eloquence -- the pleasure of naming -- and the poem’s speaker tries to treat words as notes. Neither manages to cross over, but the effort pushes both voices to their limits. They are on parallel tracks, helplessly separated, looking longingly at each other.
I wrote the piece for violinist Keir GoGwilt ‘13, who helped me a lot throughout the composition process and who has played the piece beautifully at recitals here and in New York. So far, in performance, I’ve used an awesomely simple computer program that Ben Woo ‘13 cooked up in about half an hour. It allows white text to appear and disappear with elegant ease on a black background. So much better than PowerPoint. Every day, when I returned to the growing manuscript, my own language looked foreign for about thirty seconds. The poems were kept fresh by their incubation in a foreign environment. The other period was winter break, when I was at home doing a lot of orchestrating for a new opera. I didn’t talk to many people, and was thinking more in music than in words from day to day. That got pretty exhausting. Even though it was a thesis, this poetry was a constant relief.
I was fortunate enough to work with Jorie Graham, an advisor who -- beyond her own astonishing poetry and her peerless knowledge of the poetic canon -- has a capacity to think and feel with the voices of the students she advises. She uncovers narratives you didn’t know you were writing, and she notices when you break laws you hadn’t realized you’d mandated. It’s uncanny. I’m really grateful.

Wandering noon, obliterate
your doubleness, be
only your cry:
I would reach that loneliness
but your blaze of making
postpones me: at the hands
of backward light
I can make just this world
of praise: the cathedral
chants symmetry’s question:
the pursed-past-suffering
arches sustain
the angels’ dripping
play: the ceiling’s
spheres flush light
where bounty where loss
are downwardness
and the floor’s cut quartz planets
are open milkjars,
swirled, to be stepped on,
to stain, to lie
unchanging – 
   and the crosses
of column and cloud
hold on shoulders knifethin
the masterpiece,
opened space:
it is all buried in gold

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Cardinal Jaime L. Ortega, the head of the Catholic Church in Cuba, will speak privately with a group of undergraduates and publicly in the JFK Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics. The Cardinal, only the second in Cuba’s history, was criticized recently in a blistering editorial in The Washington Post for being “a de facto partner of Raul Castro,” but based on the advertisements for today’s event, you wouldn’t know why. Cardinal Ortega, in the publicity materials sent out by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and the Harvard-Radcliffe Catholic Student Association, was described in a rosy biography as “instrumental in opening a dialogue with the Cuban government [and] negotiating the release of political prisoners.” The description failed to mention that the Cardinal did not object to the prisoners’ forced exile to Spain, nor did it mention his other failures to protect political dissidents in Cuba. The full story ought to be told.
Las Damas de Blanco, or The Ladies in White, is a group of wives and mothers of political prisoners who take to the streets in Cuba to spread their message and call for freedom. Their message is honorable, but their courage must be strong. In a communist nation known for systematic abuses of civil liberties and human rights, they are often met with violence by the government, and many end up in prison with their sons and husbands. The Cuban government imprisoned The Ladies in White the week before the papal visit. They had publicly asked for a few minutes to speak with Pope Benedict XVI during his three-day trip to Cuba in late March. The Catholic Church in Cuba led by Cardinal Ortega refused to schedule a meeting with them or any dissidents, saying that the Pope didn’t have enough time. However, Cardinal Ortega was able to find time for Pope Benedict to meet with Raúl Castro twice and Fidel Castro once. The day following the arrest of the Ladies in White, a handful of other peaceful political dissidents sought sanctuary in a Cuban Church. Breaking with Church precedent, Cardinal Ortega called the government to arrest the political dissidents, arguing that “Nobody has the right to spoil the celebratory spirit of Cuban Church-goers.”
The Cuban government imprisoned the Cardinal during the 1960s, and he has called for limited reforms as he works with Raúl Castro. However, Castro has made clear that true political reforms and the recognition of human rights are not part of his plans. As one political dissident put it, “The rumors fly but the locks never open.” To continue trading human rights in exchange for the false hope of limited reforms is to abandon the people of Cuba. Per Edmund Burke, “All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.”
When Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in late March, many saw it as an opportunity to continue potentially the most important and lasting cause of his predecessor: advancing the cause of human freedom. When Pope John Paul II visited his native Poland in 1979, millions came to see him, and with his words they found their voice. In the words of Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement instrumental in bringing down the Soviet government, “The Holy Father, through his meetings, demonstrated how numerous we were. He told us not to be afraid.” During the reign of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, the Catholic Church saved hundreds who sought sanctuary in their churches. Throughout their struggles, those with the courage to take a stand knew that the Church had their back. Today, at least in Cuba, they see a Church without a spine.
Harvard provides us with amazing opportunities to engage with world leaders and learn first-hand about changes occurring around the globe, but we waste these opportunities if we are not willing to engage with the truth. Avoiding the full truth at today’s event teaches us nothing; engaging in an honest and respectful dialogue makes everyone wiser. We, as individual students, are not in positions to potentially bring real change to Cuba, but Cardinal Ortega and the Catholic Church are. So, ask the Cardinal the tough questions, because those are the ones worth answering.

In the past few months, Americans have been exposed to a barrage of hateful and offensive commentary by public figures. Maybe the seeming deluge of caustic statements owes itself to the presidential campaign, or maybe we’re just becoming more sensitive to this kind of speech, but it nevertheless seems as though we are inundated daily with comments that cross the line of decency. First there was Rush Limbaugh calling a Georgetown Law student who testified before Congress a “slut”; then there was actor Robert DeNiro making an off-color joke about whether “our country is ready for a white first lady”; finally there was Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen claiming that Ann Romney, wife of presidential candidate Mitt Romney and mother of five children, “has never actually worked a day in her life.” And there are countless other examples, just within the past few days and weeks, of comments that have caused a firestorm of controversy for offending specific individuals and groups.
Opinions on our offense-prone culture have been mixed. Last month, comedian Bill Maher published an article in the New York Times entitled “Please Stop Apologizing,” in which he argued that Americans’ tendency “to be outraged about nothing” was impoverishing political discourse: “If we sand down our rough edges and drain all the color, emotion and spontaneity out of our discourse, we’ll end up with political candidates who never say anything but the safest, blandest, emptiest, most unctuous focus-grouped platitudes and cant.” If a radio commentator or television show annoys you, Maher says, the answer is easy: Stop listening to the program.
Maher’s got a point: Americans do tend to be offended when they shouldn’t, and a little less sensitivity might encourage politicians to break through the banality of campaign slogans to offer innovative political ideas. But his editorial is typical of a certain type of response to offensive incidents—a response that argues for tolerating speech you disagree with, ignoring speech that offends you, and (to paraphrase Voltaire) defending others’ right to speak even when one disagrees with the content. Sarah Palin typified the latter point in her defense of Limbaugh after last month’s controversy: “I think the definition of hypocrisy is for Rush Limbaugh to have been called out, forced to apologize and retract what it is that he said in exercising his First Amendment rights.”
This is where the argument goes off the rails. Individuals characteristically regard criticism of their actions as criticism of their right to engage in those actions. In this case, the attack on offensive comments is misconstrued as an attack on the offending individual’s “free speech” rights; in actuality, it is simply an attack on the content of that speech. Rush Limbaugh had a First Amendment right to say exactly what he said, but listeners have a corresponding right to call in and complain about the comments, and to urge advertisers to drop their financial support for the program.
In fact, in contrast to Maher’s argument, individuals who are offended by what Limbaugh or others said have an obligation to attack his words and urge him to apologize. This is the nature of democratic debate and intellectual discourse; it’s the core of the give-and-take that goes with argumentation. One of the highlights of such debate is that it tends to kill bad ideas: Once exposed to criticism and objections, the emptiness of bad ideas becomes apparent, and they can be dismissed. But a world in which we only listen to radio programs or talk shows with which we agree—Maher’s utopia—is a world that lacks this give-and-take, that allows bad ideas to flourish among those who unthinkingly agree with them, that fails to expose those ideas to the kind of argumentation that would result in their deserved death. The solution to an offensive comment isn’t to allow it to pass unnoticed into the airwaves; it’s to criticize vehemently the comment and demand a rightful apology, just as occurred with regard to the Limbaugh, DeNiro, and Rosen comments mentioned above. The system worked in these cases, and we have an obligation to engage in the same critical behavior when future comments give rise to offense—not to passively change the station.
This is the paradox of Maher’s position: in search of a more vigorous political discourse filled with “emotion and spontaneity” he stumbles into a more impoverished one. One-sided conversation—the “safest, blandest, emptiest, most unctuous focus-grouped” conversation of all—is the kind that would thrive in Maher’s world. That’s not a world in which I would want to live.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least once over the last few years, most of us have probably heard about or personally felt the need for the internal renovation of America’s public schools. The inequalities that persist in the country’s public school system propagate entrenched socioeconomic disparities and compound complications for society at large. I believe that a quality K-12 education and access to strong post-secondary options serve as great equalizers for students of different backgrounds and lead to stable economic conditions in the long run. Unfortunately, in some of America’s most resource-deprived areas, quality and access in neighborhood schools are foreign concepts to students. Having graduated from a low-income and predominantly African-American high school, this is not new to me. My experiences growing up encouraged me to get involved in whatever way possible to strengthen America’s schools.
While most of the high schools in my district were majority White or racially diverse, my zoned high school was predominantly Black. Even in the largest district in the state, with much of the curriculum standardized across all schools, structural inequalities emerged between my high school and the two that bounded it to the North. My school was less likely to have a highly certified teacher or one with greater than five years of teaching experience, while the two high-flyer high schools nearby boasted a majority of teachers with an average of more than ten years of experience.
The large number of new teachers coming in and experienced teachers transferring out every year reinforced the already pervasive stigma that my school was inferior and not a place where teachers were excited to work. The system seemed to cater so effectively to the desires of adults–if you wanted to teach at a flagship school, you could leave the needy school; if you wanted to be paid more to teach in the gifted classrooms, you could leave the needy classrooms–but I always wondered about my classmates who were left behind. The current system compels the best teachers to teach the most highly achieving students in the most advantaged schools. That was one of the greatest shortcomings I saw in the status quo. I wanted the best teachers to have incentives to work in the environments where they were needed most, those that were previously the least conducive to academic achievement. That brought me to explore opportunities to making education work more effectively to meet the needs of all children. When I found out that Michelle Rhee was starting an organization designed specifically to address the interest of children in education policy decisions in districts and states, I knew it was a place where I wanted to be.
As a summer associate at Students First, I worked on the Mobilization Team to develop strategies to attract new members and get existing members more involved in our campaigns. I had the opportunity to travel with Michelle Rhee and Students First staff to cover the signing of the education reform bills in Michigan and to launch a partnership with Better Education 4 Kids in Elizabeth, New Jersey. While using social media to publicize events and speaking to community members in person and in small crowds, I realized the urgent need for improvements in educational opportunities in communities other than just my own. I finally came to understand the impact of these grassroots efforts, even while at an age when I was unsure I could make a positive contribution. Working at Students First was evidence for me that even students can make a lasting impact in a national non-profit organization and in ensuring that all children have a right to quality education.
Fortunately, for millions of students in this country, reform-minded agendas and organizations are gaining a lot of national attention. Still, too much time passes while we wait for other people to try to improve our education system, and a lot of aspiring social entrepreneurs and change agents are beginning to understand that. As students not too far removed from our experiences in primary and secondary school, we are in a unique position. Our perspectives can be incredibly useful in making policy decisions, developing best practices in the classroom, and understanding and relating to younger students. As Harvard students search for roles in which to make a large impact, we should consider opportunities in teaching, education consulting, policy research, political advocacy, and mentorship. For the sake of children across the nation, we must be both diverse and integrated in our approach to making America’s public schools as excellent as possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Committee on Undergraduate Education met to discuss possibilities for restructuring academics at Harvard. One of the issues discussed was a proposal to extend the number of times classes might meet by decreasing the length of finals week. This would be done by holding evening exams in addition to the current morning and afternoon exams. We firmly believe that a change of this type to the final exam calendar would be unproductive, as well as destructive to students’ mental health and academic achievement.
The current final exam schedule includes a morning and afternoon exam each day for eight days of final exam period. Although some students do occasionally take two exams on the same day, it is generally rare for students to have two exams or more in a row. This new proposal, set forward by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, would condense final exam period into six days; however, it would also add a third, “evening” exam slot.
Currently, final exams take place either from 9 A.M. to 12 P.M. or 2 P.M. to 5 P.M. We expect that an evening exam could take place from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., in order to give students sitting both afternoon and evening exams the chance to eat dinner.
We are very concerned about the effect this exam schedule would have on students who already become considerably stressed during the current exam schedule. Although no one would be required to take three exams in one day, more students would face two exams in the same day, and some students could seemingly be required to take one exam that ended at 10 P.M. and another that started at 9 A.M., leaving them very little time to sleep, eat, and study in between exams.
Administrators and professors who support the plan suggest that it would allow classes that are already compressed at the end of fall semester to meet for two extra days. While the revised academic schedule introduced in 2009-10 has indeed placed worrisome constraints on class time, two extra days of lecture will not reasonably be of great significance to a student’s academic experience. Thursday and Friday seminars that, because of the current schedule, meet for one fewer session than Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday seminars, do generally make up a last class during reading period anyway. In any case, these concerns are not sufficient to justify a change in the final exam calendar that would have a large adverse affect on student life.
More to the point, the major issue with the proposed restructuring is potentially increased student stress. As final exam scores account for a huge percentage of many students’ grades, even those who have diligently kept up with every reading assignment and problem set all semester will desire many hours to study and prepare for their final exams. Furthermore, like it or not, Harvard students are not always perfect about planning out their exam studying weeks ahead of time. Packing more final exams into a shorter amount of time will give students less time to do necessary preparation, thus leading to unnecessary pressure and anxiety. We do not think it unreasonable to fear that the stress resulting from such a schedule would contribute to the sleep deprivation and mental health issues that consistently plague Harvard students in an intense academic environment. These problems would probably also affect students studying the sciences and mathematics disproportionately, as many humanities and social science classes require final papers instead of final exams.
Some might suggest that waiting almost an entire week from the end of reading period to take one final exam is unnecessary, inefficient, or boring. But when it comes to academic preparation, extra time is almost always better than not enough time. Packing final exams into six days instead of eight would not add nearly enough to make evening exams worth their potential stress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The month of April has already seen twice as many laptop thefts on campus as the previous month, an uptick driven especially by thefts from residence halls and undergraduate classroom buildings.
Harvard University Police Department logs indicate that 14 laptops have been stolen in April as of Sunday. Eight of the computers were taken from Houses—four from Quincy, three from Winthrop, and one from Lowell—and others were stolen from Boylston Hall, William James Hall, the Advocate, the Holyoke Center, and the Center for Astrophysics.
In March, HUPD recorded seven laptop thefts, all from locations less regularly frequented by undergraduates. Four of last month’s thefts were reported in Gund Hall, where the Graduate School of Design holds classes, and the others occurred in Cruft Laboratory, Paine Hall, and the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall.
HUPD posts its logs only from the past 60 days, the minimum period required by law, and HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to provide older data.
Students and administrators have voiced concerns within their Houses at what they perceive as an increase in laptop theft.
Quincy House Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman sent an email to House residents last week informing students of recent thefts in the House.
The email said that three laptops, two backpacks, and two gaming systems were taken from a single suite in New Quincy during one night and a laptop and purse had been taken from the dining hall.
“These two incidents of theft are upsetting, and they erode trust and community—two values I hold dear,” Chapman wrote.
In an email to fellow Quincy House residents on Sunday, Melanie J. Comeau ’13 described “a group of four male youths...probably non-Harvard Cambridge teens” whom she said several residents had seen playing pool and spending hours in the dining hall. She said in her email that she believed them responsible for the thefts but declined to comment to The Crimson on her justification for the accusation.
According to HUPD logs, three of the cases of stolen laptops reported in April are closed, which Catalano said means that either a suspect has been identified or all leads have been exhausted. He added that officers are investigating the possibility that the remaining thefts are related to each other.
Three Winthrop residents reported that their laptops were stolen from their common room while they slept.
“Our door has a tendency to stick when you close it; it doesn’t close all the way,” said Leslie N. Kim ’12, one of the residents of Winthrop whose computer was stolen.
“We got in the habit of just leaving it open if someone else was home,” Kim said, adding that many students leave a hanger on their doorknobs or otherwise prop open their doors even if they have working locks so that they can easily access their suites.
“We figured it was a lot simpler to leave it open. We’d just gotten very careless,” Kim said, “I guess we didn’t check that night before going to bed if it was closed.”
Joshua R. Garcia ’13 said his laptop was stolen from his Lowell House room last Saturday night.
He had left the door to his bedroom open to “create a cross breeze” during a small party in his room. Although he knew most of the guests at the party, he wrote off a few unfamiliar faces as prefrosh.
When he went into his room after the party, his laptop was gone.
In her email, Chapman cautioned students to monitor who follows them into the House when they flash their IDs to enter the locked building.
But students acknowledged that her advice can be uncomfortable to follow.
“It’s sort of hard when [you think you’re] going to seem paranoid,” Kim said about questioning piggybackers before allowing them in. “It’s usually a good idea to be better safe than sorry.”

An earlier version of this article stated that Melanie J. Comeau ’13  wrote in an email to Quincy House residents that she had seen four young  men whom she believed to be responsible for recent thefts of laptops  from Quincy playing pool and sitting in the dining hall in the House. In  fact, although Comeau wrote in her email, “I am quite positive I know  who is responsible for at least two thefts,” she wrote that she had  spoken to many people who had seen the four young men, not that she had  seen them herself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suffering from multiple disabilities, Kylie Murray told University Health Services when she came to Harvard as a graduate student in 2010 that she needed a monthly injection to manage her debilitating pain and blood pressure drops. As Murray’s attorney tells the story now, UHS employees told her that they were unable to give her the medication, but that she could easily inject herself.
Murray tried, and days later, she collapsed in the Harvard Square T station, suffering from an adverse reaction to improper administration of the drug. She was hospitalized for five weeks. Then she sued Harvard.
Murray’s suit, which saw its latest day in court on Friday, charges the President and Fellows of Harvard College with discrimination, negligence, and fraud.
A UHS spokesperson declined to comment since the investigation is ongoing, and the three lawyers from the Boston firm Diedrich & Donohue who, according to court records, are defending Harvard did not respond to requests for comment.
Murray came to Harvard from Oxford for a year-long spot in the Knox Fellowship graduate program. Suffering from long-term conditions that cause joint dislocation, temporary paralysis of one side of the body, and muscle pain, according to Murray’s court filing, she told Harvard that she would need medical assistance and housing without stairs.
“Under the antidiscrimination laws, when a student applies for reasonable accommodations, institutions like Harvard have an obligation to take all steps necessary in order to enable that student to fulfill their studies,” said David P. Angueira, Murray’s attorney.
But although she advised Harvard of her medical requirements prior to her arrival, Murray claims that she was housed in a building with stairs and that UHS told her that her necessary monthly injection of Octreotide, a drug which had been successfully handling her symptoms, was not covered by her health plan.
At the recommendation of UHS employees, according to her lawsuit, Murray then attempted to self-administer the injection, with her cardiologist in the United Kingdom guiding her by Skype.
Since she is left-handed, the suit said, she had difficulty injecting herself on her left side—a problem exacerbated by her hand tremors, which the suit said were also known to UHS personnel.
A few days after the difficult injection, the court filing said, Murray collapsed at the T station. She was taken to Mt. Auburn Hospital and then Massachusetts General Hospital, where she was treated for a drastic drop in her blood pressure, a known side effect of an improper administration of Octreotide, according to Murray’s suit. After several more collapses over the following days, she was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital again for a total of five weeks, then transferred to a hospital in her hometown of Bristol in the United Kingdom. A year later, in Oct. 2011, she filed suit against Harvard.
In the court filing, Murray’s lawyer said that Octreotide should have been covered under a UHS insurance policy guaranteeing coverage of “medically necessary injections.” The policy took effect in August 2010, according to the lawsuit, but Murray was told that it was new in October, after she had already been hospitalized.
“[UHS] misrepresented whether or not they could assist her,” Angueira said, “They later on told her that they had changed the policy, and that was false.”
Her lawsuit accused Harvard of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, misrepresenting insurance policies, and deceiving her about the care to which she was entitled.
“This case represents a complete institutional failure which I believe occurred as a result of lack of proper training and a lack of communication between the Harvard employees,” Angueira said. “The case envelops the totality of the failure of Harvard as an institution in making sure that this outstanding young lady was given the resources she needed to pursue her career.”
At the hearing last week in United States District Court, a judge ruled that Murray’s attorney and Harvard each have until Sept. 2013 to gather evidence for a trial, a period that Angueira said was unusually long due to the difficulty of interviewing witnesses in the United Kingdom.
But Angueira said he would like to reach a settlement rather than go to trial.
“We always hope that there is a successful and reasonable resolution of the case after completion of discovery, but if it doesn’t, we are prepared for trial,” he said. Massachusetts law prohibits Murray from specifying the amount of money she is seeking in the complaint.

Harvard University Health Services is considering plans to close Stillman Infirmary, Harvard’s center for 24-hour care, and after-hours urgent care between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. this summer, according to University spokesperson Nanci Martin.
UHS recently notified Harvard’s schools of the potential changes and is now in the process of reviewing the plan after receiving the schools’ feedback, Martin wrote in an email.
The Stillman Infirmary is UHS’s ten-bed facility for inpatient care that currently operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, according to the UHS website. The infirmary is meant for students who are too ill to stay in their own residence but who are not in a condition serious enough for hospitalization.
The Stillman Center is the primary on-campus treatment center for students with acute alcohol-related illnesses.
The summer nighttime closure would last from June 4 to Aug. 12 of this year. During those weeks, urgent care would still be provided during the day, and after-hours urgent care would be provided on weekdays at UHS’s Holyoke location from 4 to 11 p,m. and on weekends and holidays from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
But when the after-hours care center is closed, calls to UHS requiring urgent care would be forwarded to a clinical triage service, which would either give the patient advice, recommend a follow-up visit the next business day, or instruct the patient to visit the nearest emergency room.
According to Martin’s email, UHS is considering this approach “in response to a careful review of the utilization over the past few years that revealed limited need for overnight coverage during the summer months.”
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents many UHS employees, said that HUCTW has been assured that the potential closures would have “no impact” on its members. Jaeger said this meant that there would be no layoffs, no reductions in hours, and no involuntary schedule changes involved.
Aaron N. Cheng ’15, who is staying on campus this summer to take Chemistry 20 and work on a project for the President’s Challenge, said that given the reduced number of students who stay the summer compared to term-time, the closure is understandable. He added that he feels safe knowing that University health services will still be open during the day.
“I can’t say I’m overly concerned,” Cheng said. “I don’t think this will really affect me. Then again, if I were to get sick, I wouldn’t be expecting it.”
During the summer of 2009, HUHS closed or reduced some services normally provided by its Department of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling, which includes the Bureau of Study Counsel, the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.

Members of the Harvard community gathered on Monday afternoon to discuss the University’s evolving relationship with female affiliates throughout the course of its history during the Dean’s Lecture on the History of Women at Harvard, delivered by former Radcliffe Fellow Helen H. Horowitz.
The lecture, one of many events this year to commemorate Harvard’s 375th anniversary, included opening remarks from University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Lizabeth Cohen.
According to Horowitz, women overcame a series of obstacles before receiving full membership in the University’s academic community in 1977.
“Moving an institution towards equity turns out to be very hard work,” she said.
Starting in the 19th century, Horowitz said that women demonstrated an interest in becoming full participants in the University community.
When the University first opened its lectures to the public, she said, women attended in large numbers. By 1870, 70 percent of those in attendance were women.
Despite this show of enthusiasm, Horowitz said that the University hesitated to fully open its doors to female students. Even as women studied at Radcliffe College, formerly a women’s undergraduate institution that shared some University staff and faculty, they were not granted access to some University resources, including full use of Lamont Library.
In 1977, the University began to remedy the disparities between genders in abandoning its policy of maintaining a 4:1 male-to-female ratio and adopting a sex-blind admissions process.
However, Horowitz said that there is still work to be done on this topic at Harvard. While she agreed that much progress had been made, she concluded the lecture by mentioning the disparity in tenure positions held by men at the University compared to the number held by women.
She said that this was indicative that the initiatives begun several decades ago continue to be a work in progress.
The audience, which included Harvard affiliates, Radcliffe alumni, and local community members, said that the lecture provided information about an important topic in Harvard’s history.
“I thought that it was a very incisive and also a very fair-minded talk,” said Cheryl Robertson, a community member who attended the event. “And I do believe that her emphasis on chronology, the dates that things happened, was very helpful in framing the history, but also in allowing the listeners to make their own judgments.”

Psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert and economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw asked the audience, “What is your N?” in a conversation about psychology, economics, and happiness on Monday. The talk aimed to engage students in a cross-disciplinary debate about why people make the choices that they do.
“I actually thought about this question last night, because it was date night in the Mankiw household,” Mankiw said.
Organized and moderated by professors Nicholas A. Christakis and David I. Laibson ’88, the event was sponsored by the Harvard University Initiative on the Foundations of Human Behavior.
“Both Nicholas and I are big believers that making social science more interdisciplinary is going to be fruitful,” Laibson said. “We believe that the different social scientists should come out of their silos from time to time and talk to one another across the standard disciplinary boundaries.”
The speakers proposed a hypothetical situation to the audience. A person had to choose between different types of alcohol to maximize happiness. The moderators asked the audience to vote on a value of N from one to 100, with N representing the number of types of alcohol that they could choose between. The audience could have a maximum of 100 options or could limit their choices by picking a lower value of N. Both Mankiw and Gilbert predicted that students would choose values for N between 70 and 90.
“I think that an economist has to choose larger Ns,” said Mankiw. “I’d be inclined towards a larger N, and I’d want someone to give me a larger N if they were choosing for me.”
Gilbert said that he estimated in this range because he guessed that Americans “don’t want Big Brother in there choosing for [them].”
The results from online voting, in which 220 students participated before and during the program, were streamed in real time during the event. Participants were asked to submit their responses for two hypothetical scenarios: one in which they were choosing a value for a participant who knew that originally there were 100 choices and another in which the participant was unaware of the number of options that they had.
Student results were lower than Gilbert and Mankiw had predicted for both scenarios.
The low N values that students voted for surprised some students as well as the speakers and moderators.
“I wasn’t surprised by my position and I wasn’t surprised by Professor Mankiw’s position, but I was very surprised by the data they collected. I thought most people would expect maximal choice to be best,” Gilbert said.
However, some students said that their views were in line with other students and that Mankiw’s and Gilbert’s opinions were unexpected.
“I was surprised that both Mankiw and Gilbert thought that the numbers would be so high. My own choices were much lower, and I expected that other people would select lower numbers too,” Rachel E. Zax ’12 said.
Laibson and Christakis hope that this event will be the first of many events in a series of social science talks.
“It was a great event, and I think probably the first of many that Professor Christakis and Laibson will organize as they attempt to put the bio-social sciences on the map,” Gilbert said.

City Manager Robert W. Healy presented the budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year at the Cambridge City Council meeting on Monday. The proposed budget, which represents a 2.87 percent increase over the current fiscal year’s budget, amounts to a total of $488 million.
The council voted unanimously to refer the 643-page budget to the finance committee to be more thoroughly discussed. That body, which consists of the nine members of the City Council, is chaired by Councillor Marjorie C. Decker rather than Mayor Henrietta J. Davis, who leads the Council’s general sessions.
At just short of 30 percent of the total proposed operating budget, education is poised to make up the largest portion of the city’s budget as it has in past years.
The proposal also allocates significant funds to public safety and to community maintenance and development and smaller sums to governmental, intergovernmental, and human resource development spending.
Property taxes will fund more than 65 percent of the budget, by far the largest source of revenue under the proposal.
After that, only charges for services—a category including water and sewage bills—make up more than 10 percent of the budget, at 14.3 percent of the city’s projected revenue.
In Massachusetts, nonprofit organizations, including universities, are not required to pay property taxes. Instead, large institutions send payments in lieu of taxes to cities. In the upcoming fiscal year, Harvard is expected to pay $2.9 million, and MIT is slated for $1.8 million.
Decker praised the city during the meeting for the fact that the property tax rate, which according to the new proposal was $8.48 per $1,000 of property value in 2012, would remain low in Cambridge in 2013. The proposal noted that Cambridge’s rate rested well below its neighbors—in 2012, Somerville and Boston asked more than $13 per $1,000 of property.
"I don’t think there’s many communities in the Commonwealth that can talk about keeping the tax levy at such a low rate and know that even a few months from now, it’ll probably be lower than what we’re suggesting it should be," she said.
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 noted that the proposed budget has not changed dramatically from last year’s budget.
"I think it’s significant that the number of [city] employees won’t go up or down," he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School student Bo Guagua corresponded with Crimson staff writers Hana N. Rouse and Justin C. Worland on Tuesday via his Kennedy School and Google email accounts and sent The Crimson a statement, which is published verbatim below.
To Whom It May Concern:
Recently, there has been increasing attention from the press on my private life. As a result of these speculations, I feel responsible to the public to provide an account of the facts. I am deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation. It is impossible to address all of the rumours and allegations about myself, but I will state the facts regarding some of the most pertinent claims.
Facts:
• My tuition and living expenses at Harrow School, University of Oxford and Harvard University were funded exclusively by two sources—scholarships earned independently, and my mother’s generosity from the savings she earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer.
• My examination records have been solid throughout my schooling years. In the British public examination of GCSEs, which I completed at the age of 16, I achieved 11 ‘A Stars,’ whereas the necessary requirement is no more than 9 and ‘A’ grades are considered good marks. I also earned straight A’s for both AS level and A-level Examinations at the ages of 17 and 18, respectively.
• At the University of Oxford, I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics. I was a ‘tripartite’, being enrolled in all three subjects, rather than dropping one in the second year, as is the norm. Upon graduating, I earned a 2:1 degree (Second Class, First Honours) overall and achieved a First in Philosophy.
• During my time at Oxford, it is true that I participated in ‘Bops,’ a type of common Oxford social event, many of which are themed. These events are a regular feature of social life at Oxford and most students take part in these college-wide activities.
• Like many other university students, I also devoted time and energy to extra-curricular activities. For example, I debated in the Oxford Union and served as president of the Politics, Philosophy and Economics Society. These extra-curricular activities enabled me to broaden my perspective, serve the student community, and experience all that Oxford has to offer. I am proud to have been the first mainland Chinese student to be elected to the Standing Committee of the Oxford Union, and I truly value the close friendships I formed with my fellow students.
• I have never lent my name to nor participated in any for-profit business or venture, in China or abroad. However, I have been involved in developing a not-for-profit social networking website in China, the aim of which is to assist NGOs in raising awareness of their social missions and connecting with volunteers. This initiative has been based out of the Harvard Innovation Lab, with the participation of fellow students and friends. The project remains in the development stage and is not live.
• I have never driven a Ferrari. I have also not been to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since 1998 (when I obtained a previous U.S. Visa), nor have I ever been to the U.S. Ambassador’s Residence in China. Even my student Visas were issued by the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, which is closer to my home of five years.
I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank my teachers, friends and classmates for their support during this difficult time. In particular, I wish to thank the Harvard Kennedy School for the support it has extended to me as a member of its community. I understand that at the present, the public interest in my life has not diminished. However, I wholeheartedly request that members of the press kindly refrain from intruding into the lives of my teachers, friends and classmates.
Faithfully,
Guagua Bo

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students are preoccupied with acing a final project or exam, a select group of Crimson football players have their sights set on a different goal, far from the confines of Cambridge and Harvard Stadium: Playing in the NFL.
With this year’s NFL Draft running from April 26-28, we take a look at two NFL hopefuls: defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11 and senior left tackle Kevin Murphy.
Check back later this week, as we discuss the latest developments with former captain Alex Gedeon and quarterback Collier Winters ’11.
At Harvard, Ortiz blossomed from an underperformer into the league’s most dominant defensive player. In the 2011 season, the fifth-year senior, despite frequent double teams from opposing offensive lineman, still controlled the line of scrimmage, tallying a league-best 10 sacks. With his performance, Ortiz earned the Asa S. Bushnell Cup, given to the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, in addition to an Associated Press All-America third team nod.
“In the terminology our kids use, [Josue is] a freak,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said after Saturday’s Spring Game. “He could do things you didn’t coach. He could be unorthodox and still make plays…. He was one of those difference makers.”
In the months following the end of the season, Ortiz, listed at 6’4” and 260 pounds on Harvard’s roster, has received attention as an NFL prospect. Recently, the senior worked out with the New York Jets and the New York Giants as a potential linebacker.
“I thought [the workouts] went pretty well,” Ortiz said. “I thought I was able to show how athletic I am…even though I was playing out of position.”
“The Jets gave me a test to see how much I could retain and how quickly I could, and I felt like I did pretty well with that,” Ortiz added.
Ortiz has received interest from other teams as well, including the Green Bay Packers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Seattle Seahawks, and the Arizona Cardinals.
While the first three rounds of this year’s NFL Draft are on Thursday and Friday, rounds four through seven—when Ortiz would likely be selected, if at all—are on Saturday.
If not selected, Ortiz expects to sign a free agent contract in the days following and would report to his team’s minicamps within two weeks of the draft.
“I would be shocked if I wasn’t signed by Monday,” Ortiz said.
But Ortiz isn’t the only Harvard lineman receiving serious NFL consideration.
Murphy, who anchored the 2011 team’s offensive line at left tackle, has also worked out with a pair of NFL teams.
“The [Atlanta] Falcons came up last week, and the [Falcons’ rep] said I looked really good, and then I worked out for the Patriots during the [Boston College] Pro Day, and [the Patriots’ rep] also said that the O-Line coach…[said] I did a really good job and that I’ll be hearing from them some time.”
Murphy began preparations for the NFL almost immediately after his last game in a Harvard uniform—a 45-7 drubbing of Yale in The Game on Nov. 19. Just two weeks after the contest, the senior had “pretty much committed” to agent Joe Linta.
“He was one of the first guys I talked to down on Yale’s field after The Game,” Murphy said of Linta, a Yale graduate. “[Linta] said, ‘You’re an NFL player, I know that, and I’ll represent you. You’ll be hearing from me soon.’”
Linta came to Cambridge for a breakfast with Murphy a few weeks later. The senior later signed with Linta, who also represents Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk ’98.
Five months later, Murphy, believes a fifth-, sixth-, or seventh-round pick is a possibility and notes that the Falcons, among other teams, have expressed interest in drafting the first-team All-Ivy leaguer, who is listed at 6’7” and 295 pounds on the Harvard roster.
“It’s really humbling hearing from all the different teams that have called me, but I’m just trying to keep my head about it,” Murphy said.

Manny Cominsky’s presence at the podium early on the second day of the Cabela’s Collegiate Big Bass Bash on Lake Lavon in Wylie, Texas must have drawn more than a few curious glances. It wasn’t immediately clear what school he represented—his jersey carried no indication of it—and certainly no one could recall seeing him at a tournament before.
Then the announcer called out the name of his school: Harvard University, a place situated 1,520 miles from where he currently stood and even farther away from anyone’s impression of a contender in collegiate bass fishing.
But there was no getting around it. In the day’s first session, the sophomore from Utica, New York had placed second out of 94 anglers, with a bass weighing in at 3.77 pounds. As the saying goes, everything’s bigger in Texas, but that doesn’t usually apply for a Yankee from the Northeast.
IF YOU TEACH A MAN TO FISH...
What was perhaps more remarkable than his big catch was that Cominsky and his teammate, sophomore Jake Boy, had even made it to Texas in the first place.
“In these tournaments, there are a lot of regional schools that own their own boats, get in the truck in the morning, drive to the lake, and compete,” said Association of Collegiate Anglers director Danny Blandford. “[The Harvard team] traveled farther, didn’t have a boat, and didn’t have tournament experience.”
But the path to Lake Lavon was even more complicated than that—as early as this fall, no such fishing student organization existed at Harvard.
The origins of what is now known as the Harvard Fishing Club lie in the spring of 2011, in an aborted attempt by a pair of seniors on the football team to start a Harvard chapter of Ducks Unlimited, a non-profit group committed to wetland conservation. Though the endeavor was ultimately unsuccessful, Cominsky was peripherally involved and decided to pursue the cause further, through a different avenue.
“[A Harvard chapter of] Ducks Unlimited would have to be controlled by the national organization, and in order to have a club at Harvard, it needs to be autonomous,” Cominsky said. “I happened to be surfing the web one day and came across a college fishing website. It looked like a lot of fun, and I realized it could achieve the same goals as Ducks Unlimited—to raise money and awareness for conservation purposes—just in a different way.”
At the same time, Cominsky, then a member of the football team, was dealing with a torn labrum suffered during the 2011 season, for which he underwent surgery in December, keeping his shoulder in a sling for six weeks. Confronted with the prospect of an arduous rehab, Cominsky decided it was in his best interest to leave the team.
With his newfound wealth of free time, Cominsky searched for a way to stay active and found it in the burgeoning fishing club, which was showing promising signs of growth.
Cominsky began working on the Office of Student Life’s application for official club standing in November, which includes a constitution, signed commitments from a faculty adviser, and a proposed annual budget.
On December 19th, Cominsky pitched his proposal to the university administration, and on January 17th, he received an email notifying him that the Harvard Fishing Club had been officially recognized as a student organization.
REELING IT IN
But Cambridge, Mass. is not exactly an outdoor sports hotbed. According to the club’s constitution, one of its primary purposes is to participate in tournaments, but most competitive bass fishing is conducted in the southern United States.
Furthermore, neither of the two had ever competed in a fishing tournament, though both had a large body of recreational fishing experience. Cominsky fished often in the summers with his family at a camp in the Adirondacks, and Boy was exposed to the sport through his family’s hunting and fishing business.
After researching upcoming tournaments, Cominsky identified the Big Bass Bash as the first in which the Harvard Fishing Club would attempt to compete. The club’s immediate challenge was now to figure out a way to get there, and more importantly, how to pay for it.
With the help of leads obtained through his parents, Cominsky contacted the marketing departments of various outdoor companies and pitched to them a sponsorship and marketing program he had devised.
Ultimately, Cominsky and Boy’s efforts raised $2000 for the club, mostly from donors with ties to the outdoors, like Ferris Industries, a commercial mowing company, and Deer Breeders Gazette, a deer farming publication started by Boy’s mother, Donna. Portable Shade, a company that sells outdoor canopies, donated the team’s jerseys.
But according to Harvard club by-laws, the Harvard logo cannot be displayed alongside those of non-Harvard-affiliated companies, making perhaps the most notable aspect of the team conspicuously absent from their tournament gear.
“No one knows we’re from Harvard, besides the fact that we say we’re from Harvard,” Cominsky said. “But it’s more space to sell.”
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER
Their story caught the interest of Blandford, the tournament organizer, who also served as the liaison for Cominsky in working through the logistics of starting the club, gaining membership to the Association of Collegiate Anglers, and subsequently making the trip to Texas.
Blandford provided the two with a video camera to document their jour
ney and a cameraman in their boat during the competition to film the action. The footage will air later this summer as part of the 2012 BoatUS Collegiate Bass Fishing Championship Television Series on the NBC Sports Outdoors channel.
Given that they do not charge a fee for entry into tournaments and only a nominal charge for membership in the ACA, Blandford and his organization were disposed to facilitate the development of a club-level initiative like the Harvard Fishing Club.
“Growing the sport is what I’m in charge of here,” Blandford said. “One of the ways to do that is to serve as a resource for programs that want to get things started. I get probably three to four inquiries a week about how to start a college fishing club, and those are things I prioritize on my task list.”
Though competitive bass fishing is overwhelmingly the domain of the South, the sport’s reach is expanding northward. The 2012 Northern College Bass Series, organized by fishing clubs at Penn State University and the University at Buffalo, features four events north of the Mason-Dixon line, including three in New York.
Though collegiate bass fishing has yet to penetrate New England—only three schools from the region, Harvard, Vermont Technical College, and Castleton State College (VT), are represented in the ACA’s 132-team national rankings—Blandford believes that the idea is not out of the question.
“College bass fishing is probably the fastest-growing section of the fishing industry,” Blandford said. “[Fishing is] such a pervasive thing that people enjoy. I’m proud we can get some recognition for a school like Harvard that comes out and does well.”
MORE FISH IN THE SEA
On the morning of March 23rd, the Harvard Fishing Club finally found itself on the water, in live competition for the first time.
“The first day, we weren’t really sure what to do,” Cominsky said. “Neither Jake or I had ever competed in a tournament, so we just drove around, then stayed in one place for awhile. It was kind of a rough day overall. There weren’t many fish caught at all.”
By virtue of their poor finish on the first day, the team was among the first to launch their boat on the beginning of the second day—and their fortunes shifted quickly and dramatically.
“We picked out a spot we hadn’t tried the day before,” Cominsky said. “We were the first group over that area, and we caught four fish in the first 45 minutes, three of which were keepers [at least 14 inches long].”
One of those keepers turned out to be the second-largest fish caught in the morning’s first session, earning Cominsky his place at the podium.
“The thing that surprised me most was that they came to body of water they’d never seen and secured a boat from an individual they’d never met, so seeing them come across stage on the first day was great,” Blandford said. “Just coming down and catching a fish was an accomplishment in itself.”
For the weekend, Harvard finished tenth out of 40 schools in what was one of the largest events in the ACA season so far. Their strong showing in Texas earned them enough points to climb all the way to 28th in the ACA’s national rankings, despite competing in only one tournament.
“They capitalized on the opportunity to earn big points, and that’s what got them in the mix,” Blandford said. “The challenge will be to continue to perform well.”
The Harvard Fishing Club will next take to the waters for the national championships, held in May on Lake Pickwick in Florence, Ala, hoping to build on what proved to be a very successful learning experience in Texas.
“[Tournament fishing] is a lot more intense,” Cominsky said. “You have to be more lucky, and there’s a lot more strategy involved. You’re constantly flying around as fast as you can to different areas.”
Cominsky and Boy’s plans for the future of the club include a deep sea fishing trip in the Boston area, attracting more followers to the club’s Twitter account (@HarvardFC), and organizing fundraising activities in the fall, with the proceeds going to benefit Ducks Unlimited.
Though the club still counts only 14 people in its membership and one tournament under its belt, Cominsky is already planning outreach programs to include as many students as possible in competitive fishing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 25, 2012, at 5:45 p.m.
Four regattas in one weekend spelled a mixture of success and failure for the Harvard sailing team. The co-ed team raced at the Wellesley Invite and competed for the the Thompson Trophy and the Admiral’s Cup, while the women raced at the Women’s New England Championship.
THOMPSON TROPHY
The Coast Guard Academy hosted the Thompson Trophy, an intersectional regatta.
On a foggy Saturday morning, the fleets sailed the W-4’s into a dying southern breeze. In the afternoon, sun came out and the breeze strengthened to eight to 12 knots before weakening towards the end of the day.
Sunday began with gentle northern winds that increased to eight to 12 knots throughout the day. The breeze stayed steady until a monsoon arrived in the afternoon.
The Crimson placed 17th out of 18 teams. Rival Yale, who Harvard has faced time and again this season, took first place once again.
A young FJ boat composed of freshmen Gram Slattery and Brian Drumm competed for the Crimson and finished in 16th. Sophomore Ames Lyman and freshman Mary Finlayson followed in 17th in the B division in giving Harvard 278 points.
ADMIRAL’S CUP
King’s Point hosted the Admiral’s Cup intersectional regatta.
Saturday began with KP trapezoids in a shifty southern wind which measured 4 to twelve knots. In the afternoon, a burly 15 to 22 knot southern wind surfaced, helping out the larger crews.
Colder weather and rain on Sunday created larger waves and made for tighter runs.
The division A boat with senior Brendan Kopp, sophomore Sarah Pierson, and freshman Richard Bergsund held onto seventh place. The other boat, skippered by freshman Michael Drumm, finished with 197 points, putting Harvard into 14th place for the B division and seventh overall.
WOMEN’S NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS
Boston College hosted the Women’s New England Championship, which was the conference championship regatta. These races determine who goes on to the women’s semifinals in Austin, Texas in late May.
Racing in FJ’s, Harvard sailed into seventh in a 17 team field while the hosting Eagles claimed victory.
In division A, seniors Emily Lambert and Alexandra Jumper finished with 117 points for fifth in their division.
“Emily Lambert has led the way as our top skipper in competition,” sophomore Ben Lamont said. “But she has also led the way in preparing the younger members of our team for competition at the highest level.”
The division B boat came in behind the senior boat with 154 points. The combined effort of the two divisions earned the Crimson a spot in seventh place overall.
WELLESLEY INVITE
Harvard boats raced at the in-conference Wellesley Invite meet, hosted by MIT.
The Crimson came in fifth out of 12 teams while Tufts took first and second.
Harvard finished the first set in first place with only six total points. But in the second set the Crimson sunk to third after eighth and ninth place finishes in the A and B divisions, respectively.
From there, the Crimson’s rank continued to fall–after the B division boat failed to complete race four, receiving a 13 point addition, it tied for seventh place with Brandeis. But solid fifth and fourth place finishes in the fifth race propelled the squad up into fifth place overall.
“I think we’re right where we want to be. We’re a young team overall with some very talented seniors,” Lamont said. “Therefore we’re focused on both winning Nationals this spring and gaining experience for the future.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 25
An earlier version of this article contained  several errors. The article incorrectly stated that Isabel Ruane  skippered during weekend; in fact, she crewed. It incorrectly stated  that  Ben Lamont skippered the division B boat at the Admiral's Cup; Michael  Drumm actually skippered the boat, which Lamont crewed in one race.  Finally, the article incorrectly stated that the Crimson women competed  in the Wellesley Invite. In fact, three of the four athletes who sailed  there for Harvard were men.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those who don’t believe in hot streaks should think again.
In the Harvard baseball team’s first of four games against Brown last weekend at O’Donnell Field, sophomore Jake McGuiggan stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the first inning. The Bears’ (8-29, 5-11 Ivy) Anthony Galan hurled a pitch towards home plate, and McGuiggan took a crack at it. The shortstop made solid contact and rocketed the ball over the left field fence, opening the weekend’s scoring with a homerun in his first at-bat.
The homer was just a preview of the hitting prowess McGuiggan showed in the three wins the Crimson (11-27, 7-9) took on Friday and Saturday. Over the weekend, the Hingham, Mass. native notched an impressive .500 batting average (7-for-14), including two doubles and the homerun, to go with two RBIs, while also crossing the plate himself at least once in each game his team won—twice in the first contest.
In fact, if you take away his poor performance in the fourth and final matchup of the weekend—a game in which almost the entire home team struggled—McGuiggan recorded a hit in seven of 10 at-bats, making his batting average over the first three games an astronomical .700.
“I think you can ask anybody else on our team, the hottest players in baseball right now are Matt Kemp who has like nine homeruns in the major leagues, Josh Hamilton who is like the best baseball player alive, and Jake McGuiggan,” junior third baseman Kyle Larrow said. “He is ridiculous right now. The kind of player he is, when he’s hot, anything that a pitcher throws in or around the strike zone, he’s going to hit it, and he’s going to hit it hard.”
But McGuiggan’s hits weren’t just impressive in number; they were timely, as well.
Each of the four times the sophomore got on base in Friday’s opening game—two hits in two at bats and two walks—Harvard scored either directly or indirectly through his efforts in the same inning.
In Friday’s second contest of the day, O’Donnell Field saw the two Ancient Eight teams tied at two going into the bottom of the eighth frame. With two outs and senior Jeff Reynolds on first, McGuiggan sent the ball into center field, advancing Reynolds to third and securing himself safely at first. Two batters later, sophomore Carlton Bailey cranked a hit into deep center field that sent both Reynolds and McGuiggan home, scoring what ended up being the game-winning runs.
Saturday’s first game was no different.
After already registering a double in an inning that scored two runs, McGuiggan came up to bat in the bottom of the fourth frame with his team down by one.
Reynolds was on third, and sophomore Jack Colton was on first. With an 0-2 count McGuiggan smacked the ball to right center field, driving in Reynolds and putting Colton and himself in scoring position. Reynolds’ run tied the game before senior Marcus Way won the game in the bottom of the last inning with a dramatic walk-off homerun.
“We call him ‘clutch’,” Bailey said. “Any time we really need a hit or need an inning started off, or if there are runners on the bases and we need them moved…. He typically is always in a position to do a job, and he rarely fails.”
Though the final contest of the weekend was not a successful one for McGuiggan—or Harvard for that matter—McGuiggan’s stellar performance against the Bears was not a fluke.
Last week the Ivy League named him Player of the Week for his exceptional play in Week Eight of the season. In six contests, he hit .458 (11-of-24) with three doubles, four runs, and four RBIs. The sophomore also stole two bases and had a .583 slugging percentage as the Crimson went 4-2 for the week.
McGuiggan’s Ivy League honor was the first weekly award a Harvard player had earned since 2010.
In the overall context of the season Harvard really needed McGuiggan’s skill at the plate last weekend. Going into the back-to-back doubleheaders against Brown, the Crimson knew it needed to win at least three games if it wanted to stay in contention for first place in the Rolfe Division of the Ivy League.
With the winner of the Rolfe Division still up for grabs, Harvard will need McGuiggan to step up again in the back-to-back doubleheader against Dartmouth this upcoming weekend.
“I’ve just been trying to stay feeling good,” McGuiggan said. “My swing has been feeling good the past few weeks, so hopefully I can continue for at least another weekend going against Dartmouth.”

Students formed a queue stretching from Boylston Hall to Weld Hall last night as they waited to enter the biannual food expo, organized by The Harvard Culinary Society.
This semester's event, entitled "A Taste of the Square: Spring Restaurant Expo," showcased savory and sweet eateries that catered to students' diverse palates.
Rebecca A. Ruskin '13, president of the Harvard Culinary Society, said that the purpose of the expo was "to get students aware of restaurants around campus."
On the savory side, Qdoba served black beans, grilled chicken, and guacamole in a bowl, while Boloco gave out vegetarian and meat burritos, chocolate chip cookies, as well as coupons for a free small burrito. Sandwiched in between these two Mexican eateries, The Upper Crust Pizzeria handed out slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza.
For those craving sweets, Finale Desserterie & Bakery provided samples of its signature desserts, from Boston cream cake to crustless cheesecake to chocolate brownies.
Kickass Cupcakes offered mini cupcakes, with unique flavors ranging from lemon cupcake with white chocolate buttercream and candied ginger to chocolate brownie cupcake topped with bittersweet chocolate ganache and covered with chocolate shavings.
Clover and Zinneken's both set up a "kitchen" in the back of the room, where they chopped up cucumbers, oranges, pineapple, and apples for a fruit salad and prepared fresh Belgian waffles, respectively.
Ruskin said that a strong publicity effort led to higher student attendance at the food expo, as compared to the Culinary Society's first event in November.
