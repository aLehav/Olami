After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, where the issues of adequate social space and student fun are perennial concerns, the shutting-down of just a handful of weekend parties can feel like adding insult to social injury. When the parties in question are registered, under control, and operating within the prescribed time constraints, it seems particularly heinous to evict them, dooming their several dozen partygoers to Saturday-night dejection.
Such were the circumstances at two parties in Quincy House over the past several weeks which HUPD shut down upon receiving noise complaints. These events and the adverse student reaction they precipitated led Quincy Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman to issue an email discouraging students from calling HUPD with noise complaints. While we think it unwise for administrators to advise students against calling the police, this incident has made it exceedingly clear that there ought to be formalized processes for issuing noise complaints against parties in the Houses.
A good process would begin with a call to the tutor-on-call or, alternatively, the resident dean. The police should only become involved if the in-House avenues are unresponsive or there is evidence of dangerous behavior. The House is a community of neighbors and friends, and while there will inevitably be those who wish to study while others are partying nearby, it seems antithetical to the spirit of the House community to call HUPD before first pursuing more local avenues.
If a single complaint to HUPD can end a registered, under-control party, then it calls into question the relevance of party registration in the first place. There ought to be a system by which HUPD can be made aware of registered parties, so that their registration can serve as a sort of noise permit during the allowed hours. It goes without saying that a party registration should never be construed as a blank check. If there is reason to believe that a party is out of control, people are in danger or noise levels are far beyond what could be construed as reasonable, then there are grounds for intervention.
It is important to remember that the guiding notion behind our—and others’—defense of the registered party is the House’s superiority in all respects to off-campus party locations like Final Clubs. The more inhospitable to socialization the Houses become, the greater the exodus to off-campus locations that lie outside the jurisdictional and communal umbrella of Harvard, and where unattractive gender power dynamics reign. It is in everyone’s interest to let parties flourish in the Houses.
All this in mind, we must be cognizant of the perennial need for study spaces at Harvard. Many, if not all of us, will have to spend several weekend nights a semester hitting the books. Currently, some House libraries close at night on weekends, as do Lamont and Widener. Rather than being forced to study in their rooms, surrounded by parties, students should be able to go to a library. To this end, keeping Lamont Library open 24/7 year-round, not just at exam period, should be explored.
Sure, Harvard isn’t known for being a party school. But if we respect each other’s right to blow off some steam on the weekends, as well as our necessity to study and, sometimes, just chill when we have to, then we can move in the direction of more abundant, inclusive social space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am a committed environmental activist, and I think Earth Day is the bane of the environmental movement. Why? Because every day that we drink, eat, or breathe is “earth day.” Yet Americans officially devote only twenty-four hours to being green deliberately. Too many people believe that celebrating Earth Day can exempt them from further action. This is absurd, and it’s damaging the environmental cause. The environmentalist movement needs new strategies that drive environmental awareness into everyday life if we ever hope to address the challenges of climate change.
Earth Day has produced some benefits. The first Earth Day in 1970 rallied 20 million people in the United States alone. Today one billion people in 180 countries around the world participate in Earth Day. This is a testament to the solidarity that so many environmentalists yearn for. Clearly, people do desire to participate in meaningful collective action on behalf of the planet.
But the enthusiasm aroused on Earth Day is not sustained and does not create meaningful change. I turn to Aristotle’s description of the two types of virtue: virtue of thought and virtue of character. Virtue of thought “arises and grows from teaching; that is why it needs experience and time.” But virtue of character is achieved only through action. Knowledge plus action creates a habit, and a habit is durable.
The actions people take on Earth Day do not form habits. People are green for one day—maybe even for one week. Unfortunately, the pressure to recycle, bike, or change a light-bulb on Earth Day does not carry over to the other 364 days of the year. You won’t get coupons, free gifts, or the feeling of solidarity when you use your reusable bag on November 15. No one will remind you to recycle on August 22. Behavior tends to degrade as the memory of Earth Day fades.
Two recent reports highlight the movement’s need for new strategies and show that green actions have not turned into everyday habits for most Americans. A recent Gallup poll reveals sobering data comparing Americans’ perceptions of climate change in 1997 and 2010. The number of people who think that they will never experience the effects of climate change in their lifetimes increased by 10 percent. In 2003, 61 percent of American thought that climate change was caused by human activities. This number dived to 50 percent in 2010. Another report by George Mason University, “Climate Change in the American Mind,” reinforces this picture. In 2008, 44 percent of respondents said they would switch to energy efficient light bulbs, but by 2011 that figure had dropped to 34 percent. In 2008, 42 percent said that Americans’ energy-saving actions would reduce global warming. Only 26 percent believed this in 2011.
The environmental movement is drifting further from its goals as fewer people are committed to energy-saving actions or believe they can have an impact. The apparent “power” of Earth Day has not converted thought to habit. Instead, Earth Day has a soporific effect of creating a false sense of accomplishment. At the same time, millions of dollars and massive human energy are spent on mounting, advertising, and coordinating single events on Earth Day alone. If these financial and human resources were distributed throughout the year, there would be a much more tangible effect.
Instead of focusing on one day, environmentalists need to take a more holistic approach that will create lasting habits: Launching campaigns that promote environmental education every day of the year, starting programs that make it easy to recycle in the winter, and mobilizing bottom-up support for climate legislation. The mission should be to provide permanent opportunities for people to be green. Frequent events and awareness-raising gatherings should pervade communities as well. Constant reminders to be and think green—light-bulb swaps, incentives, and green logos on websites—should permeate society. Then these activities will become ingrained in our lives, converting ideas to habits. On Earth Day, it’s easy to be green. This should be true on all days of the year.
The one billion people in 180 countries participating in Earth Day annually can lead the healing of our planet when they begin to commit 365 days of the year. This will not happen instantaneously. But it is an important goal. We cannot let Earth Day create a false sense of security. We shouldn’t be fooled by energy savings that accrue over twenty-four hours or by enthusiasm that does not produce sustainable action. Environmentalists need new strategies that will turn healing into habit, and create a movement, not a moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We live on a campus where over $20 million of property is reserved for men and their dates, where the location and circumstances under which sexual assault happens are allegedly obscured by the University, where some students are forced to choose between becoming academics or becoming mothers while others take up illegal unpaid internships on which the school casts a blind eye.
And yet: At this year’s Women’s Week, there were discussions about gender in children’s literature and the intersections of feminism and hip hop, but nothing educating women on how to organize for equality. At Take Back the Night this month, most of the events were panel discussions covering sexism everywhere but Harvard itself.
Feminism at Harvard is too cautious, too fearful of disagreement to erase gender inequality at the school. No more explanatory events or speaker talks—what we need is to face the inequities within our own campus.
The landscape of Harvard feminism is currently largely dominated by Radcliffe Union of Students, a group derived from the former governing student body at Radcliffe College. The organization’s mission is broad—it is both the vehicle for feminism activity on campus and expected to present a wide variety of feminisms. RUS wishes to impart “an image of feminism on campus that is all-encompassing,” said Keerthi Reddy ’14, one of the group’s co-presidents (as well as a Crimson Arts chair). As a result, the group focuses on events and activities, not specific campaigns. These are, for the most part, non-controversial and apolitical.
Many of the women involved with feminist activism I talked to expressed frustrations with this broad outlook. And there’s the possibility of some new activity. Kate Sim ’14 started the International Women’s Rights Collective last February, frustrated with “lack of radical feminist vision I imagined I would be getting involved with [at Harvard].” Much of the group’s approach seems sound: Sim noted that they had been attending workshops and educating each other on the fundamentals of activism and organizing. The group, however, mostly looks beyond Harvard’s borders.
What we need is a group driven by a similar spirit, but that would focus on Harvard itself. In terms of education, the organization could follow Sex Week’s example and help provide answers to questions that Harvard students often have but are afraid to ask. Here are two for starters: “How do I go about reporting a sexual assault?” and “how do I confront my friends when I find their actions to be sexist?” In addition, the organization would be the source for direct actions and campaigns, housing efforts to release sexual assault statistics or increase the university’s day care support. Activism on campus means recruiting from an ever-changing student body and setting up a concrete structure would help ensure that these concerns do not go forgotten as one class graduates and another enters.
When I talked with representatives from RUS, they argued that their friendly approach allowed them to reach out to many people and have “them rethink things in whatever way we can.” Should the situation arise, they would take a more aggressive tactic. “If we were at Yale last year…we would want to respond in a way that was just as in your face,” Reddy explained to me. While it’s not my place to compare sexism at Harvard with that of another school, I do not see how the examples of daily inequalities on this campus do not deserve a strong response. In fact, shouldn’t a feminist organization respond to these situations before they escalate into legal confrontations?
Activism can be difficult on a campus, where we are all in close contact. Someone whose views you oppose could be in your section or living in your entryway. He or she might even be a friend. I think it’s this fear—as well as anxieties about confronting authority or attracting controversy—that leads so much of feminist activity on campus to be quiet, friendly and polite.
But we owe it to each other to be direct about the sexism we see in our own surroundings. Harvard is our home for four years; students carry away ideas formed here throughout the rest of their lives. What authority do we have to go out and change the world if we are not improving the issues that face us day-to-day?
It’s wrong to think that others will join your cause if you simply draw attention to it. You don’t get people involved by making them aware, you get them involved by making them angry and making them implicated. If we want to make Harvard a place where equal opportunity is more than just a possibility, we need to stop being afraid to speak our minds. Let’s ask for what we want—it’s the only way we’ll ever get it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It used to be that things had a primary function and perhaps a secondary function or two. This order of things in turn yielded to the insight that parts could be made replaceable, and that the best way to think about things might be as these component entities, rather than their composite sums. Differentiation happened in other areas, as well; mouths and feet, despite their occasional encounter, are now encouragingly seen as two distinct specialties. We now have many varieties of salad dressing, a myriad of cheeses, frozen yogurt flavors without end. And this is a good thing. But it is only half of the story.
One of the great innovations of the modern world is not only how many different types of things we have, but also how useful those things have become. Our phones are computers, and our computers are movie cinemas. Websites are television stations, and television stations are personalized websites. Our (e)mail is collected where we look up recipes for dinner, and our “desktop” is perilously close to the “trash.” Now, of course these things aren’t in any kind of geographic propinquity; even more importantly, they clutter our mental armature. But the most troubling juxtaposition of all is that we use the same device to word process as we do to inhabit the internet. We take this for granted, and we are most conscious of it when the universe of distraction beckons us temptingly from writing or computing. But the use of computers as writing implements is, I suggest, nothing less than a catastrophe of modern intellectual life.
To understand why this is the case it is necessary to think a little bit about distraction and its comrade in arms, procrastination. Think of it this way: Academic tasks are local and discrete, and they require us to think in a sustained way about seemingly intractable problems. Friedrich Nietzsche famously demanded that we read slowly, a perhaps more important injunction than reading closely because it is a much more difficult one. In the Middle Ages, monks were wont to come down with what was called “acedia,” a melancholic distraction that rendered them unfit for the mind-numbingly boring clerical work they were often asked to perform. But for most of history, the “task at hand” and “the world out there” were resolutely distinct.
The pull of the latter was powerful, but the object of study might exert a correspondent force and perhaps fight the distractions of the world to a standstill. A typewriter was meant for writing and nothing else, and a quill and parchment would idle if not used to write. Most importantly, the limits of the possibilities for distraction were delineated by the imagination on the one hand and one’s circle of acquaintances on the other. Thus, the attractions of distant lands were hopelessly ethereal, and the contingencies of family or social life stubbornly local.
But the convergence of functions in and within the computer with which I type this piece makes life much more difficult for those of us who value this peculiar mix of imaginative globetrotting and intimate focus. On the same machine, we attempt the most painstaking of intellectual labors, and we are understandably enticed by the ability to be anywhere in the world. What purchase does even the most inspiring of tasks have in the face of the possibilities of communication, of understanding, and of empathy engendered by a world entirely connected? The ways in which the humanities—literature in particular—instruct on how to live are being attenuated by the icon that sits next to Microsoft Word but has designs on how and in what manner we process words.
And, of course, “process” is very much the heart of the matter; the internet is so enthralling not so much for what we read on it, but rather because of how we read: the jumping, skipping, frenetic movement from one page to another. The blank page that is the homepage of every paper seems both lonely and empty in comparison. But that is because it is a terrible mistake that we have come to write on these miraculous devices in the first place. Like Kubla Khan’s magical dome in Samuel Coleridge’s great poem, they can make time melt like ice on a sunny day. “Beware, Beware!”

UPDATED: April 24, 2012, at 9:03 p.m.
In an effort to improve wireless internet access in some of the campus’ weakest hot spots, Harvard University Information Technology will install a new wireless core and 4,000 wireless access points by September, according to HUIT Executive Director of Infrastructure Jacques N. Laflamme.
“The plan is to improve performance, availability, and density across campus,”  Laflamme wrote in an email.  “There will be ongoing work beginning with commencement through the fall with the initial focus being the freshman dorms and selected classrooms.”
As part of this Wireless Improvement Project, the Undergraduate Council conducted a survey along with HUIT to identify places with inconsistent wireless internet access. The survey, which garnered 175 responses from students, found that Lowell Lecture Hall, Sanders Theatre, and Sever Hall were most frequently cited for connectivity problems.
According to HUIT’s chief technology officer, computer science professor James H. Waldo, both Lowell Lecture Hall and Sever had previously been identified as potential dead spots, but plans for installing new WiFi access points were never approved by administrators.
Sixty-seven students who took the survey identified Lowell Lecture Hall as a problem area. One respondent wrote, “No WiFi in Lowell Lecture Hall or basement. Ever. It is the worst.”
The three locations, along with several freshman dorms, had already been listed as priority locations for the Wireless Improvement Program.
“The results didn’t surprise us particularly,” said Waldo. “What the survey really helped us with was setting relative priority for these locations by the number of students that complained about them.”
But the identification of dead spots is only the first step in a lengthy process. Laflamme said that due to issues of historical preservation and the realities of the buildings’ existing infrastructure, certain buildings on campus cannot easily undergo the renovation necessary for improving WiFi access. Waldo said that budgetary concerns will also affect the progress of the WiFi improvement process.
“HUIT is, at times, like an engineering organization,” Waldo said. “We have to balance additional wireless access with other priorities.”
HUIT began working to address campus wireless programs early this fall. In October, UC Secretary Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news editor, approached the office to ask how students could contribute to these efforts.
“HUIT has been very supportive in identifying problems and soliciting student input,” George said. “The results of this survey really show the potential for working on wireless improvement in conjunction with the students.”

Muhammad Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding the micro-lending institution Grameen Bank, spoke at Harvard Business School on Thursday about the importance of social ventures that depart from profit-driven business models.
Yunus also ate lunch with the ten finalist groups in Harvard’s President’s Challenge and visited Sociology 159, a class on social entrepreneurship.
At his talk at the Business School, Yunus discussed his work at Grameen Bank and urged students to consider pursuing businesses motivated by social causes rather than profit alone.
Yunus said that social businesses are a positive alternative to charitable efforts and government spending, the traditional methods of solving social problems. Unlike charities, which rely on external donations, social businesses use sustainable, self-perpetuating models, Yunus said. Profits from a social business feed back into expanding its operations, leading to growth so that the company can serve more people.
“It becomes a perpetual cycle. You recycle the money again and again and again. So in that way, the same money works infinite times, while in a charity, it only works once,” Yunus said.
Yunus’ own project, Grameen Bank, began in 1976, when Yunus loaned $27 to poor women in a village in his native Bangladesh so that they could pursue entrepreneurial endeavors. When the women repaid Yunus, he allowed them to take out larger loans.
His idea of micro-financing quickly gained traction among beggars in Bangladesh and led to the establishment of Grameen Bank in 1983.
Today, Grameen Bank has more than 8 million clients, 96 percent of whom are women. The average client borrows $100.
“People ask me, how did you figure out all the rules and procedures of banking? I always tell them that it was very simple,” Yunus said. “Whenever I needed a system, I just looked at conventional banks and did the exact opposite.”
Yunus was controversially removed from his position at the head of the philanthropic company by Bangladesh’s central bank in 2011 on legal grounds which he challenged.
After listening to students in Sociology 159 pitch their business ideas at the Innovation Lab, Yunus encouraged them to channel their creative energy toward social change.
“You are the luckiest generation of young people in the whole human history...because you came to life at a stage when technology is in your hands,” Yunus said.
One team of students told Yunus about their plan to launch a carbonated ice cream business that donates its profits to ending childhood hunger, starting in the fall at the Harvard Farmers Market.
“We have this idea of Harvard students who want to change the world, but it’s really hard to know where to start,” said Laura E. D’Asaro ’13, a member of the team. “[Yunus] said to start with a problem and do it bite-sized, which I thought was really good advice.”
Yunus expressed enthusiasm for the students’ projects.
“Don’t ignore these 15 ideas presented here. Some of these can be fantastic changers of the world,” he said to the class. “This is how every big idea comes. At first it’s sloppy, hazy, but after a while, it becomes a real gem.”

Geophysicist Maria T. Zuber applied her knowledge of Earth science to one of the world’s most universally studied astronomical bodies—the moon—at this year’s annual Neekeyfar Lecture on Math and Science, hosted Tuesday by the Undergraduate Council’s Student Advisory Board on Science.
“Basically every human who has lived on the rocky earth has observed the moon,” she said. “So it’s not surprising that when humans first stepped on the moon it was viewed as one of the greatest achievements, if not the greatest achievement, ever accomplished by humanity, at least from a technological standpoint.”
Zuber, E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics at MIT, focused on her work on planetary phenomena in the moon’s interior and lunar surface modeling at the talk, titled “Journey to the Center of the Moon.”
Zuber, who is also the department head of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, is the first female department head in the history of MIT and also the first woman to be selected by NASA to head a major planetary spacecraft mission.
Zuber related her experiences with lunar geophysics to the NASA Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Mission, which launched for the moon in September, 2011.
In particular, Zuber explained the details of how to go from research projects in the lab to an applied astronomical endeavor.
Zuber explained to the audience, which ranged from curious undergraduates to astrophysics concentrators and professors, that the moon’s surface consists of two types of rock. One type, anorthosite, or white rock, represents the areas of the moon’s surface that were once covered by the lunar magma ocean.
The other type is basalt, or black rock, whose formation is indicative of lava flows from volcanic melting in the moon’s distant past. Zuber mentioned that the discovery of the once-present magma ocean is considered one of the greatest fruits of the Apollo Mission.
Early in the Earth’s history, Zuber said, it was hit by a Mars-sized object that struck at a sharp angle, tearing off a piece of the Earth’s mantle and sending it into the atmosphere.
Over time, the piece of the mantle folded into a disk and then condensed into the modern-day moon.
The moon also has a rich history of “impact events” or being hit by giant rocks, as indicated by the numerous craters scattered across its surface.
The biggest crater, or impact basin, is on the side of the moon not visible from Earth. This impact basin is two-thirds the width of the United States and is 8 km deep.
One still-unanswered question Zuber discussed was why the near side of the moon is topologically different from the far side. One theory is that the differences are caused by internal lunar activity.
“If you’ve sent 109 space crafts that have essentially mapped the surface and brought back samples, and you haven’t found the answer, then you’re probably not looking in the right place,” she said.
This internal activity could include phase changes in matter, causing fluctuations in energy flow and distribution, as well as “moon quakes” that occur more often when the moon is closest to Earth.
In her research, Zuber works to study the moon’s gravitational field by increasing the resolution of imaging on the moon.
“The results are really transformative when you can improve measurements by three orders of magnitude or better,” said Zuber.
However, she feels her most profound contribution to society stems from her ability to engage the minds of the future. As part of her GRAIL mission, she incorporated cameras on her spacecraft specifically devoted to educating students around the country. The students use online software to monitor the location of the spacecraft in orbit and look at images.
“I want to teach kids physics is not only interesting but also fun,” said Zuber.
According to Deana Ste. Marie, Executive Assistant to the Dean of Science and an advisor to SABS, said that this year, students were able to spend time with Zuber in breakout sessions throughout the day, which proved to be “engaging and rewarding.”
Attendee and one of the event’s organizers, Alexander L. Jaffe ’15, who is also a member of SABS, enjoyed hearing about brand new topics from such a renowned expert.
“The subjects covered were some that I had no experience with before,” he said. “To hear about them, especially from a first hand research project, was fascinating.”

Harvard Medical School Professor Shiv Pillai is an immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and teaches students at both the undergraduate and graduate level. He is currently interested in autoimmune diseases, the development of the immune system, and the role of the immune system in cancer.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you become interested in immunology?
Shiv Pillai: I became interested when I was quite young. The education system in India is very different, so I entered medical school and began conducting research when I was only 16. It was there that I began working on leprosy, a disease that is regulated by the immune system.I also remember one book in particular that inspired me—“Microbe Hunters” by Paul de Kruif—which I thought was fascinating.
THC: What brought you to the United States?
Pillai: I came to the United States after I received an invitation to join the Whitehead Institute [for Biomedical Research] at MIT. David Baltimore, an immunologist and Nobel Prize winner, was the director of the Whitehead for several years, and I worked there as a post-doctoral student during the mid 1980s.
THC: Can you tell us a little bit about your current research?Pillai: The work I’m doing now centers around the question of how genes contribute to autoimmune diseases. Why, or how, does genetic makeup lead to disease? Most of the other work we do is concerned with how basic types of immune cells develop in the human body. What are the stages in the development of immune cells from stem cells to their final form? Finally, we’re also looking to see what makes us susceptible to disease.
THC: How do you conduct most of your research?
Pillai: Since we can’t test on human subjects, a lot of our research is conducted on mice. We can genetically engineer mice to remove specific genes. It’s all so unbelievable—when I was your age, this would have been a pipe dream. Who knew we would one day be able isolate and target specific genes in model organisms? If you had asked me about my research back then, I would have told you that these are interesting questions but no one would ever know the answers. There was a revolution in biology in the 1970s and 1980s and recombinant DNA technology allowed scientists to chop DNA into bits in order to study and manipulate genes of choice. It was an exciting time to be working in this field, and it is inconceivable that we’ve come this far.
THC: What do you find to be the most difficult part of your job?
Pillai: When I talk to my students about science and medicine, it’s difficult to let them know what a challenge science can be. Those who go into science must be prepared for disappointment. A scientist takes a lot of risks, and it doesn’t always work out. You’ve got to stay upbeat and learn to take it in stride. You write papers, you get rejected, and you get used to it but you have to keep high standards. Today, funding is the most difficult problem in science, and it can be difficult to pursue science—especially when you’re young and trying to break into the field.
THC: It’s no secret to your students that you are a great rapper and poet. Is there anything that you would like to say about that?
Pillai: Well, I did a lot of theater in my youth—all of it amateur, of course. I’ve come to the conclusion that its my old my desire to be onstage that led me to teaching. I enjoy communicating and keeping things lively for students—my captive audience. Each year, I’m invited by medical school students to the “Second Year Show.” They parody lots of their professors, and each year they have someone up there rapping in an Indian accent—it’s clearly me. They give me a new name every year. I think this year it was “Sly Shiv Pillai.”

Caitlin E. Carey ’12 has spent the semester immersed in the Social Neuroscience and Psycho-Pathology Lab in William James Hall, studying somatic associations and schizophrenia.
Carey has a very personal stake in the research. Her uncle suffers from schizophrenia and her family has long advocated for better treatment of the disease. According to Carey, her grandmother has run educational exercises and awareness sessions for many years, and Carey has memories from being ten years old and sorting the brochures for the meetings.
“I thought the brochures were more interesting than Saturday Night Live,” she said.
Though she is still an active advocate, Carey is even more passionate about being able to delve into the scientific side of schizophrenia. Since her freshman year, Carey has worked under thee guidance of Psychology Professor Christine Hooker to examine how people react to words indicating physical interaction such as “Spank” or “Cuddle.”
“In order to understand how people are feeling, you must recreate the feeling in your own mind—forming a kiss in your brain and then associating your somatic representation of the feeling with how the other person is feeling,” Carey explained.
However, people with schizophrenia suffer from a number of social deficits, predominantly stemming from a lack of ability to understand what others think.
Carey’s study includes 22 healthy adults and 20 adults with schizophrenia. She said that when healthy people view somatic words like “cuddle, kiss, slap, and beat,” they have more activation in regions associated with somatic sensation.
“I really like analyzing the data and seeing my results the first time,” Carey said. “I am really sad when my hypothesis seems wrong, but it is  really gratifying, when I am right, to know that what I thought was happening in the brain is actually happening.”
Carey’s  psychology concentration with a secondary in Computer Science has helped her to build the skillset required by her research.
Because of her Advanced Standing status, Carey is graduating with the class of 2012 rather than 2013, and will be pursuing a degree in psychology at Washington University in St. Louis in the fall.
Her psychology concentration with a secondary in Computer Science has helped her to build the skillset required by her research.
“Writing my thesis would have taken so much longer [without automation and other computer programming skills],” she said.

Following an irregular sleep and meal schedule over a prolonged period can lead to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, according to a new study from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Researchers restricted the meal times and sleep schedules of 21 healthy adults, both young and old, over the course of five weeks. For three of those weeks, the participants were exposed to “circadian misalignment,” meaning that the participants were put on a 28-hour day schedule during which they were allowed to sleep for 5.6 hours out of every 24.
Participants lived in the lab for the duration of the study and were monitored closely.
Results showed that participants experienced a decrease in resting metabolic rate and an increase in glucose secretion, and three out of the 21 participants were pre-diabetic by the end of the study. Once participants were allowed to resume normal sleeping and eating habits, they all recovered.
“Your internal 24 clock can’t synchronize to a 28 hour schedule. Most of the time in the week when those participants are sleeping or active, eating or fasting, are times when their bodies are not optimally primed to respond,” said Harvard Medical School professor Orfeu M. Buxton, a lead author on the study titled “Adverse Metabolic Consequences in Humans of Prolonged Sleep Restriction Combined with Circadian Disruption.”
Professor Steven A. Shea, an HMS professor and the paper’s senior author, explained that the study was partially inspired by epidemiological research showing increased rates of diabetes and obesity among shift workers who sleep during the day.
Although the recent findings do not  prove conclusively that shift workers are likelier to become diabetic or obese specifically because of their unusual sleep schedules, they do support the data of the epidemiological studies.
“Standing alone based on a month-long experiment in very healthy people, it’s very difficult to extrapolate the results to diabetes, but in the face of all the epidemiological studies showing the adverse metabolic changes associated with shift work, it’s tempting to think about this extrapolation,” said Shea.
“If these findings [...] persist over many months or years, this could well be the reason by which shift workers gain weight and some of them become more prone to diabetes,” he continued.
Buxton explained that college students, like shift workers, often experience circadian disruption, partially due “social jet lag,” which occurs when people stay up late and sleep in on weekends to socialize and then catch up on lost rest.
Computer and cell phone use can also cause sleep disruption, since technological devices emit blue “daytime” light that further confuses circadian rhythms and makes sleeping more difficult.
“Sleep researchers are up against a $100 billion dollar industry that is dependent on college students using cell phones and computers getting this night time blue light that disrupts circadian rhythms,” said Buxton. “I feel like a we’re a little pebble against a tsunami.”

Anne Wojcicki said that she was not comfortable sharing her daughter’s photograph in public, but she did not hesitate to put up a different kind of picture for a packed audience in Emerson Hall on Tuesday night.
The CEO and co-founder of 23andMe—a biotechnology company that sequences and analyzes customer DNA —was invited to speak at Harvard in a lecture titled “Deleterious Me: Whole-Genome Sequencing, 23andMe, and the Crowd-Sourced Health Care Revolution.”
Wojcicki projected an image of her daughter’s chromosomes on to the screen and pointed out the brightly color-coded segments indicating which parts of the genome had come from which grandparent.
“Sequencing opens up a whole world that is going be very complicated,” Wojcicki said. “We have no idea what most of it means.”
But she spent much of her lecture highlighting the kinds of information that individuals can already find out from their genome—from learning one’s risk for diseases such as breast cancer and Alzheimer’s to calculating one’s degree of relatedness to evolutionary ancestors like the Neanderthals.
23andMe customers who submit their DNA in a mail-in “spit kit” can receive information about their genes through online profiles that are constantly updated as genetic research advances. The company relies heavily on “crowdsourcing,” whereby information volunteered by their customers is used to further research and make both ancestral and medical connections between other 23andMe clients.
”We’re the product that keeps on giving,” Wojcicki said. “The heart and soul of the company is research.”
Access to genetic testing has increased considerably in the last few years, with the cost of sequencing dropping from 999 dollars in 2008 to 399 today, according to Wojcicki. This increase in accessibility has made databases of companies like 23andMe some of the largest aggregates of genetic data in the world.
“Whether we want this to come or not, it’s coming,” said Wojcicki. “It’s going to revolutionize healthcare.”
But a number of panelists who spoke after Wojcicki expressed their reservations with the 23andMe model.
Jeremy A. Greene ’96, a history of science professor, commented on the “increasing convergence of risk and disease” and the changing role of the doctor-patient relationship. Within 23andMe’s structure, he said, patients are not only consumers but also “producers” of genetic information.
HKS Professor Archon Fung questioned whether such large amounts of genetic data should be governed by the private sector, adding that genetic information might be used against individuals in unjust ways.
“How much is that data worth?” he asked. “It may be the case that [23andMe] should be paying [customers] for the data.”
Wojcicki admitted that 23andMe intentionally sidestepped the medical profession during its inception because “it’s impossible to work in the system.”
“I don’t necessarily want my physician making all my decisions,” she said. “There should be choice in healthcare.”
Some attendees said the mix of perspectives complicated their own opinions on personal genetic testing.
“There’s this curiosity factor where I want to see what would pop up on the screen—but at the same time, I think I’m just wary really of what the larger implications are,” said Graduate School of Education student Noha Mahdi Hayder.
Wojcicki’s talk was part of the Science and Democracy Lecture Series organized by the HKS Program on Science, Technology and Society. Event moderator and director of the STS program Sheila Jasanoff said she was pleased with the variety of responses presented.
“Although these issues are being discussed in a lot of places, they tend to be fragmented in ways that don’t allow a coherent social picture around the moving frontier of an emerging technology to develop,” she said.

Former Utah Governor and Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr. lamented a void of leadership in his political party and the government as a whole at a talk at the Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday.
Referring to himself as a “failed politician,” Huntsman said that Americans are looking for real leadership to fix the current communication breakdown in American politics.
“There is a leadership void in the world,” Huntsman said. “And when you have a leadership void, mischief tends to play out in the void.”
Free from the glaring lights and perennial pressure of the campaign trail, Huntsman spoke candidly about the problems facing his own party.
“The party is not in a good place right now, given its recent rhetoric on immigration,” he said.
He opined that the party suffers from an inability to excite voters and encourage potential candidates.
“Here you are during a time of the great crisis for this nation...and you say, this is all this great country can offer up?” he added.
“I think boldness is thrown right out the window. I think courage is not on display,” Huntsman said. He said that many Republicans would rather sit on the sidelines than enter the race, and that the party’s base is growing frustrated with their leaders’ concern about their personal political safety. “I think most Americans are pretty fed up.”
Huntsman danced around making predictions for the fall’s general election, but he briefly discussed Mitt Romeny, the all-but-crowned Republican presidential nominee who has outlasted Huntsman and other contenders for the 2012 nomination.
“I think Romney will show leadership on the economy,” Huntsman said. “But on the trust deficit, I don’t see a whole lot of leadership.”
Huntsman’s long résumé reaches into both the private and public sectors. A veteran of the State Department and several presidential administrations, he also headed the Huntsman Corporation, a multi-billion-dollar chemical company, before he was elected governor of Utah in 2004. He most recently served as the Obama administration’s ambassador to China before leaving the post in 2011 to pursue a Republican nomination run.
In Jan. 2012, having struggled with a lack of support during the party’s primaries, Huntsman ended his campaign.
In his speech Thursday, Huntsman lamented a growing gap between the political and business classes.
“My concern is that we don’t have the fluid environment we’ve had in years past,” said Huntsman, who has navigated both realms himself. He compared the two sides to independent silos, each developing their own culture.
Despite the dearth of leadership that he said he sees, Huntsman said he is optimistic. Americans, he said, will demand a solution, and reliable candidates will step up.
“People forget that we’re in a human game, a people game,” Huntsman said.

Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health published a new study last month that suggests that young children are more susceptible than adults to particle deposition in their lungs through inhalation.
“Before this paper, everybody thought that baby lungs were a miniature version of adult lungs. They didn’t consider anything about structural change,” said Akira Tsuda, a research scientist at the School ofPublic Health and the leader of the project.
The study, entitled “Nanoparticle Delivery in Infant Lungs,” was conducted in Munich, Germany with the help of scientists from the Helmholtz Zentrum München German Research Center for Environmental Health.
Scientists tested the deposition of particles in rat lungs using radioactively labeled particles. Rats and humans have very similar lung structures, making them the ideal animal model for the study, according to Tsuda.
“By knowing the radioactivity in each organ and tissue of the rat, we could calculate the amount of particles deposited,” said Tsuda.
The results revealed that 21 day-old rats, an age which is equivalent to approximately two human years, were much more susceptible to particle deposition through inhalation.
“This is a startling and surprising finding,” said James P. Butler, senior lecturer on physiology at the School of Public Health. “Until we did this experiment, there were all kinds of speculations that particle deposition would be continuously increasing or decreasing, but the peak [in deposition] in humans is two years.”
Tsuda attributed these results to the phenomenon of chaotic mixing, a theory he pioneered in 1990.
“When we breathe out, we think we breathe out everything. However, some residual air remains in the lung,” he said.
Particles inhaled combine with this residual air in pockets of the lung’s alveoli, leaving behind problematic particle deposits.
The recent study proved that the effects of this chaotic mixing are most profound in children around the age of two.
Dosages for inhaled medicines have been greatly affected by these findings, according to Butler and Tsuda.
“It has been the assumption that we can treat the exposure of children as just small versions of adult humans. That is just not true,” said Butler.
The study found that therapeutic inhalation treatments must be scaled towards the patient.
“In clinical cases, they would estimate doses by body weight,” said Tsuda, adding that this method can lead to the dangerous over- and under-medication of children.
Children around two years of age are also at a higher risk of air pollution, the study reported. Current levels of pollution monitoring are geared toward pollutant deposition levels in adults, and do nottake these differences into account.
Both Tsuda and Butler said they believe there is more research to be done. Tsuda said that using this study’s findings as a foundation, he hopes to further investigate “whether the particles are going from lung surface to the blood stream.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new electronic music club has found a home in a room high atop Eliot House that holds a piano on which famed composer Leonard Bernstein ’39 once practiced. The newly formed student group called The Final Dubs hopes to create a community of music lovers and music makers on campus whose preferred tunes sound quite different from the ones Bernstein once made—since they are produced using tools that did not exist in Bernstein’s days at Harvard.
The electronic music group was founded by DJs Laura A. Evans ’13 and J. Andre Mauri ’13 and producer Matthias C. Wickenburg ’13.
Using the Leonard Bernstein ’39 room as their home base, the group can take advantage of Eliot House’s newly outfitted recording studio and keyboard.
“Every time I walk in [the studio] I feel like I’m entering a shrine,” Wickenburg said.
The club members said they hope to share music and ideas while creating a streamlined database of DJs for student groups on campus. They also plan to host lessons on DJing and music production and perhaps release a compilation album.
“Right now the DJ scene is really all word-of-mouth,” Mauri said. “We think it’s important to have a centralized source where people can compare and contrast different DJs’ skill sets.”
Mauri started DJing in Jan. 2011. Since then, he has signed 22 gigs on campus, ranging from House formals to this Saturday’s Eleganza.
Many in the club said that The Final Dubs aims to foster an open environment for musical experimentation. In a medium that lifts musical elements from many sources, club members say that they want to encourage that sort of inherent artistic collaboration among members of the Harvard community.
“We’re mostly trying to promote unity and the free flow of thought,” Evans said.
In the process, Evans said, the club will unite a cohort of talented musicians who can reliably play at planned gigs.
“The best resource everyone has is each other,” Mauri said.

Students have expressed mixed reactions to the digital editing of publicity photos for this weekend’s charity fashion show hosted by Eleganza, with some defending the aesthetic process and others calling it contradictory to the organization’s mission.
Some students who have seen the photos said they appeared to be significantly altered with photo editing software to make some women look thinner, enhance some men’s muscles, and possibly lighten the skin tone of some models.
The photos were part of a publicity campaign for the annual event in Lavietes Pavilion, which benefits the Boston charity Teen Empowerment. The mission of the event is to promote diversity and charity and to celebrate different cultures, backgrounds, and forms of expression, according to the group’s web site.
One of the models, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was apparent to him that his photo had been digitally modified to give him more pronounced muscles.
“They said they’d do some photoshopping, but they didn’t make it seem like it was going to go that far,” he said.
The model said that he was not offended personally but could understand why some people would be if they were made to look thinner or stronger.
“To me, it was sort of funny, because anyone who knows me knows I’m not that guy,” he said. “But it’s weird, because the message of the show is to redefine beauty, but they’re conforming to fashion magazines.”
However, the photographer, Nicholas X. Tan ’12, denied the allegations that he altered the photos to make models look thinner, more muscular, or lighter skinned. Tan, who has worked as a professional model, said that any editing he did conformed to basic professional tricks.
“Most of my post-editing techniques are standard for the industry,” Tan said.
Tan said that he focused on lighting, good angles, and oil to make the models look their best. In response to questions about the musculature of some of the males in the photos, he said he would ask the men to flex before a shot to enhance their muscle tone.
Though Tan said that he removed the occasional blemish or scar, he said he did not alter models’ figures.
Michelle B. Nguyen ’13, one of three executive producers of Eleganza and a Crimson magazine editor, also said that post-production editing was typical of most fashion campaigns.
Nguyen added that the photos did not indicate any kind of discrimination or judgment based on shapes, sizes, or skin colors.
“If you look at the models in our official ad campaign, you can see the range of sizes, and there’s a range of everything,” Nguyen said. “There is no specific stick-thin figure for Eleganza.”
The goal of the photos, Nguyen said, was to promote Eleganza and encourage people to buy tickets, and the allegations distract from the show’s true cause.
“This year, we are aiming to raise the most money for this charity,” Nguyen said. “It’s not about the accusations of modifying models. They are incredible looking.”
Paoakalani A. Midro ’15, a model in the show, also defended the photo editing tactics. She said Tan had informed her that the photos would be edited but promised her that he had a strict rule of not altering subjects’ faces.
Midro said she saw only minor photo editing in the publicity pictures, including accentuating or cleaning up photos to maintain sharp lines. She said she asked the photographer to digitally modify her body but appreciated that her face did not get retouched.
“If you push it too far and you photoshop it a little too much, then it’s very noticeable and I think that is not okay,” Midro said. “But I know in the case of my pictures, it was done just to the right extent.”
But Kate Sim ’14, founder of the student group International Women’s Rights Collective, said that, although she was not familiar with the photos or involved in Harvard’s fashion scene, she found the prospect of such editing troublesome, especially given that the event tries to promote diverse forms of beauty.
“To make that kind of mission statement and alter the posters so they look a certain way is obviously contradictory to their mission statement,” she said.

Associate Dean for Finance in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Eric Kopstain—who played a key role in steering FAS through the 2008 financial crisis—will leave Harvard to take on the position of associate vice chancellor for finance at Vanderbilt University, according to an email sent to senior administrators and financial officers Wednesday afternoon.
“My service at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has offered a wonderfully enriching set of experiences where I have been privileged to work alongside an amazing group of talented colleagues and faculty,” Kopstain wrote in an emailed statement.
FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan, who sent out the email on Wednesday announcing Kopstain’s departure, described Kopstain as a “key partner in the FAS’s fiscal recovery, multi-year planning, House Renewal funding strategy and other financial and operational achievements.”
Kopstain arrived at Harvard in 2005 as budget director and was promoted to associate dean in March 2010. Before coming to Harvard, Kopstain worked in similar administrative roles at Dartmouth and Northwestern.
Kopstain’s tenure at FAS coincided with one of the greatest financial crises ever faced by FAS. In 2008, he and his staff found themselves saddled with a $225 million two-year deficit after the University’s endowment plunged by nearly 30 percent.
At that time, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith instituted hiring and salary freezes—both of which were lifted within a year.
“Under Dean Smith, the FAS has vastly improved its processes for planning and resource allocation,” Kopstain wrote. “I am proud of the small contributions I’ve made to ensuring that the FAS’ financial position is strong and sustainable in the wake of the significant challenges that have been faced.”
Unlike the ongoing searches for a new dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a faculty director for the Derek C. Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, the search for Kopstain’s successor will be carried out by an external search firm, Opus Search Partners.
“This position has a wide range of important responsibilities, including a $1.1 billion budget, and is a key partner in House Renewal financing, among many other projects,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email. “We have a solid transition team and will take the time we need to find the right person.”

Popular artist Rihanna’s music released in recent years can be read as a response to the violent assault she experienced at the hands of Chris Brown in 2009, argued Kevin Allred, a doctoral student at Rutgers, on Thursday night.
Allred, who has taught a course at Rutgers called “Politicizing Beyoncé,” delivered a lecture entitled “Reading Rihanna’s Political Response to Personal Assault” at an event sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Harvard College Women’s Center, and the Radcliffe Union of Students.
Allred showed several of Rihanna’s music videos, pointing out repeated images of violence and intense sexuality that may be a reference to her assault. He noted that Rihanna received criticism from the media for the explicit nature of the videos, just as she had following her abuse by Brown.
“It doesn’t fall into an easy narrative of what we like to hear about a woman moving beyond it and surviving,” Allred said.
Allred said that Rihanna’s song “Russian Roulette” appears to refer to the media scrutiny of her assault, an experience which he likened to being “victimized all over again.”
The music video for “Man Down,” released in 2010, similarly contains images of rape and depicts Rihanna subsequently shooting her attacker. While Rihanna was criticized for allegedly promoting violence in her video, Allred said that these critiques overlook the possibility that she intended to make a meaningful statement about her personal experience with assault.
Allred said that he also believes that the male lead in the video “We Found Love” closely—and purposefully—resembles Brown, both in looks and in his proclivity toward angry outbursts.
In particular, Allred noted that the video includes a scene in which Rihanna and the male lead are fighting in a car—a situation reminiscent of Brown’s real-life attack on Rihanna.
“It’s not really a happy resolution,” Allred said. “She’s rewriting the story of that night with this video.”
John N. Azubuike ’13 said that he appreciated the discussion because it reinterpreted Rihanna’s art “as an expression of real social issues” including violence toward women.
“I realized that it was essentially looking at art as a lens for evaluating social problems,” Azubuike said.

Two Harvard graduate students have recently launched a campaign to ban smoking in all Harvard graduate student housing.
Medical School student Kristin T. L. Huang ’07 and her husband Yi-An Huang ’05, a Business School student, started the push to prohibit smoking in graduate student apartments since they were concerned about the effects of second-hand smoke on their seven-month-old child. Currently, 40 percent of graduate apartments are smoke-free.
While Huang and her husband say they first noticed smoke in their unit last summer, they only began actively protesting the University’s policy after a chance warning at Massachusetts General Hospital.
“I was going into an interview at Mass. General Hospital,” Huang said. “While I was there, I came across a newsletter detailing the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke.”
The newsletter included information demonstrating that children who live in apartment complexes have higher levels of cotinine—a chemical indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke—in their bodies than other children, even if there are no smokers in the units where they live.
After her visit to the hospital, Huang began her own research on the subject. “I presented to the Housing Office all the information I had gathered,” she said. “Despite the clear dangers, they maintained that they would not change their policy.”
She said the Harvard housing representative she spoke to suggested that if she continued to find the second-hand smoke to be a problem, she should move to another building.
“They told us they would cover the transfer fee but wouldn’t address our moving costs,” Huang said.
Huang and her husband considered moving to a new unit but decided against it.
“We have been considering the option, but we think it’s selfish to stop there,” she said. “After everything I’ve learned from my research, I feel it’s my responsibility to advocate for all the children who live on Harvard property.”
Harvard currently designates 40 percent of its graduate apartments as smoke-free. After July 1, the University plans to make 56 percent of these apartments smoke-free.
“We will continue to expand our smoke-free apartment program, building on a non-smoking policy we piloted in 2010,” University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an emailed statement. “We recognize that many residents prefer to live in a smoke-free property and [Harvard University Housing] has steadily increased the number of designated non-smoking apartments.”
But some medical experts said that Harvard is not doing enough. According to Jonathan P. Winickoff, a Harvard Medical School professor and pediatrician at Mass. General Hospital who contributed to the newsletter that caught Huang’s attention in the fall, Harvard should expedite the process of converting its units to smoke-free residences.
“Having smoke-free buildings is the only option,” Winickoff said. “Smokers can go outside if they need to smoke. But everyone has to breathe.”
He added, “There’s only one answer here, and we’re hoping the Harvard housing society will be on the right side of history.”

After sweeping Yale in last weekend’s four-game series, the Harvard softball team holds an 11-1 record in conference play, the best in the Ancient Eight. The squad needs to win just three of its next eight conference contests in order to clinch its third-consecutive North Division title.
Originally, the earliest possible date that the Crimson would be able to secure the title was this Sunday, as it was set to play two doubleheaders against Brown this weekend, split between Saturday and Sunday.
But now, due to forecasts predicting nasty weather towards the end of the week, Harvard’s schedule has been rearranged, and the team will have a chance at clinching as early as Saturday.
By postponing Thursday’s game against Boston College, the Crimson was able to move the doubleheader initially slated for Sunday to Friday, in order to avoid the projected bad weather.
Last season, Harvard won all four of the contests it played against the Bears, scoring a total of 35 runs while holding the Brown offense to just four. Crimson hurlers Rachel Brown and Laura Ricciardone threw back-to-back shutouts to open the four-game series, both of which finished in six innings due to mercy rule.
This time around, the Harvard defense is going to have to perform just as well if it intends to earn the three victories needed to lock in the North Division title. Though the Bears are only 5-7 in conference play, the squad’s offensive lineup boasts a .269 batting average and a .418 slugging percentage, ranked second in the Ivy League.
Leading the Brown offense is junior Stephanie Thompson, who leads the Ancient Eight in slugging percentage, batting average, and on base percentage. Thompson’s current batting average of .494 is second highest in the NCAA and she leads the Bears in every offensive category except for doubles.
So far this season, Thompson has struck out just twice, so things are bound to get interesting this weekend when she faces off against the KO queen, Rachel Brown. Having struck out 177 batters, Brown, who is also this week’s Ivy League Pitcher of the Week, ranks first in the Ivies in strikeouts.
Last year, Thompson came up to the plate four times against Brown and finished with two walks, one strikeout, and one hit. The hit was a solo homerun.
But even against Thompson and the tough Brown offensive attack, the Crimson appear ready to try for a repeat of last season’s performance, having won nine of its last 11 contests and leading the Ancient Eight in overall team fielding percentage, batting average, and ERA.
“This weekend’s games are important for us to continue to get better as a team,” senior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “A huge reason for this team’s continued success is that we’re never satisfied and have continued to improve. These games are also huge for us to host the Championship series, which is a significant goal of ours as well.”

With spring seasons winding down and championship races heating up, it’s been a busy week in Ivy League sports. To help you keep up with everything that’s going on around the Ancient Eight, we’ve compiled a list of the biggest stories from each school.
BROWN: Pool Features ‘Fast’ Technology
The Ivy League has a new addition, and boy is it flashy. The Katherine Moran Coleman Center will play home to the Bears water polo, swimming, and diving teams and opened to the public on Monday. Brown swimming head coach Peter Brown said the state-of-the-art facility will help put the program on the map.
“If people know you have a fast pool, they want to swim in it,” he said. “It gives you a nice reputation. If you go across the country, you know where the fast pools are. You can have a beautiful pool, but if you have a fast one, it makes it extra special.”
COLUMBIA: Four Columbia Fencers Will Represent the U.S. in the 2012 London Olympics
The Lions suffered a tough loss in the fencing Ivy League Championships, but four current and former members of the team will have a chance to redeem the Ivy disappointment by succeeding in the Olympics. It was recently announced that “Nzingha Prescod and Nicole Ross were selected to be a part of the women’s foil team, while Jeff Spear and James Williams will represent the Light Blue in the men’s foil.”
Williams graduated in 2007 and gained Olympic experience while taking silver in Beijing in 2008.
CORNELL: C.U. Hosts Nationals at Oxley
Both Cornell polo teams are hosting the National Polo Tournament at Oxley Equestrian
Center this week and weekend. Four top women’s teams and six premiere men’s squads will battle through Sunday for the title. The Big Red men are attempting to improve upon a second-place finish at nationals last season, and sophomore Nik Feldman thinks his team is hitting its stride at just the right time.
“We’re really playing the best polo we’ve played all year,” Feldman said. “I don’t think we could be any better prepared at this point.”
DARTMOUTH: Rugby Soundly Defeats Ivy Foes
After a slow start, the Dartmouth rugby team demolished Harvard and Princeton over the weekend to cement their spot at the top of the Ivy League. The Big Green will now be the sole representative of the Ancient Eight in the 16-team national tournament. Dartmouth will play its first two games in Hanover, but co-captain Derek Fish understands that anything can happen in the first rounds of a single-elimination tournament.
“It’s one-and-done from here out, and we’re playing all conference champion teams,” he said. “We can’t look at what they’ve done, but we need to just play our game of territory and ball control.”
PENN: No Excuse to Miss Penn Relay
The Penn Relays, which will take place Apr 26-28, will be free to students with a “PennCard”. About 985 U.S. high schools, 33 Jamaican schools, and 29 from elsewhere around the globe will be represented at Franklin Field. In 2010, Usain Bolt electrified a record crowd at the Relays. A number of other star Olympians have made their appearances here through the years, as well.
PRINCETON: Many Support Current System Over Ivy Tournament Proposal
At the present time, the Ivy League is the only conference that chooses its representative in the NCAA basketball tournament based solely on regular season success. But that may change. Coaches are reportedly pushing to institute a four-team playoff, but several Princeton players and coaches have come out against that idea.
“I’ve been in first place, I’ve been in seventh place, I’ve been in third place, so I’ve been in all areas, and I couldn’t be more black-and-white in my thinking that I don’t think any single-bid conference should have a tournament,” said women’s basketball coach Courtney Banghart. “We need to make sure that our best teams are going to the [NCAA] tournament.”
YALE: Bulldogs Outlast Bears in 4-OT
Last Friday, the Yale men’s lacrosse team extended its winning streak to four…but it took a while. After three scoreless overtime sessions, junior Deron Dempster finally broke the tie as the Bulldogs won, 11-10. The marathon win secured a spot for Yale in the Ivy League Tournament. It wasn’t the longest game in Yale history, though, and isn’t even the longest contest of the year. Earlier this season, the Elis lost to Princeton after five overtimes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of off-season workouts and early morning lifts, long afternoon practices and hours of video, the next eight days will determine the postseason fate of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team. Luckily for the Crimson, it still controls its own destiny.
Harvard, which missed an opportunity to solidify its spot in the Ivy League Tournament when it lost to Pennsylvania last weekend, has a second chance as it hosts No. 13/14 Princeton (8-3, 4-0 Ivy) at Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. A win guarantees the Crimson (6-6, 2-2 Ivy) a spot in the four-team field, while a loss will potentially force Harvard into a must-win situation in its final league game of the season at Yale on Apr. 28.
With Saturday’s game falling on Senior Day, the squad’s 11 veterans will be honored in pregame festivities. But the gravity of the matchup against the Tigers is not lost on the Crimson’s most experienced players.
“[Princeton] is always a very good team,” senior attackman Jeff Cohen said. “We know that it’s going to be a battle.”
While the Crimson hasn’t yet fulfilled the preseason hopes of many, a postseason berth offers the promise of a clean slate and the opportunity to compete for a national title.
The Ivy League, which includes only seven members in men’s lacrosse (Columbia does not have a team), offers bids to its postseason tournaments to the top four finishers in the regular season.
Harvard currently sits at fourth place in the standings, a half-game behind third-place Yale. The Crimson is also one full game ahead of Brown, which it defeated earlier this season, thereby clinching the tie-breaker should the two squads finish the season tied in fourth place.
No. 3 Cornell and Princeton are atop the Ancient Eight with perfect 4-0 records, winless Dartmouth occupies the basement position, and Penn, which got its first league win against the Crimson last Saturday, must win its final two games and get some help in the form of multiple losses from Brown and Harvard to make the tournament.
The bottom line for the Crimson: a win in either of its next two games—tomorrow at Princeton or the following Saturday at Yale—secures a spot in the Ivy League Tournament. With the tournament champion receiving an automatic bid to the 16-team NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Championships, each member of the four-team Ivy Tournament field is only two wins away from the chance to compete for a national title.
After squandering an early lead against Penn last weekend and finding itself unable to escape a four-goal deficit in the second half, Harvard will look to put together a complete game on Saturday. But that will be no small task against a formidable opponent.
“Princeton is a team that we know well,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “They’ve been playing at a very high level. They excel in every phase of the game.”
The Tigers enter the contest ranked among the nation’s best 15 teams.  The squad’s only losses have come at the hands of No. 7/6 Johns Hopkins, No. 9 North Carolina, and No. 14/15 Syracuse by a combined total of four goals.
Princeton boasts a balanced offensive attack that is ranked ninth in the nation at 12 goals per game. Eight Princeton players have tallied double-digit point totals on the season, with sophomore attackman Tom Schreiber leading the way with 25 goals and 20 assists.  Junior midfielder Jeff Froccaro has 20 goals of his own, and four other Princeton players have scored at least 10 times.
Equally impressive has been the Princeton defense, which has allowed an average of just under seven goals per contest. The Harvard offense has averaged eleven goals through its twelve games, but the Tigers have not allowed more than ten in a single game all season. In five of those contests, the Princeton defense held its opposition to six goals or fewer.
One key matchup will come at the midfield, where Crimson freshman midfielder Keegan Michel will take the majority of faceoffs against Tigers junior Bobby Lucas, who boasts a .583 win percentage on the season. Michel has won over 60-percent of his faceoffs,12th in the nation, and has been dominant in the middle at times, winning 13 consecutive first-half faceoffs against Quinnipiac earlier this month.
“We’re going to have to play very well,” Wojcik said. “But we control our own destiny, and we’re excited about the opportunity we have on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The countdown to the London 2012 Summer Olympics reached double digits this week, meaning that it won’t be long before we witness the next feats of greatness by the best athletes on Earth.
Four years ago, American swimmer Michael Phelps captivated the globe by becoming the first athlete to capture eight gold medals in a single Games. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also grabbed headlines for his other-worldly speed that has yet to be consistently matched. These are just two of the tens of thousands of athletes who have the honor to compete for their respective countries every four years.
But apart from national pride, these athletes have different institutions that they are also representing. For some of them, their roots stem back to Cambridge, Mass., where they went to or currently attend school.
Since the inception of the Summer Games in 1896, over 130 Harvard alumni have participated in the Olympics, representing a plethora of countries but only one alma mater.
A few Harvard alumni have excelled in figure skating, including Dick Button ’52, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who later became a commentator for ABC Sports. Tenley Albright ’53-’55 also secured the gold in the 1956 Olympics, and Paul Wylie ’91 won silver in 1992.
Crimson hockey has always been well-represented at the Games, with several standouts garnering medals: Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Bob Cleary ’58, just to name a few. Current Harvard men’s hockey coach Ted Donato ’91 played in the 1992 Olympics and competed in the NHL for 14 years, scoring 150 goals at the professional level. Bill Cleary ’56 played alongside his brother Bob at the 1960 Olympics, both earning gold medals. Bill went on to take the helm of the men’s hockey program before becoming the Crimson’s Athletic Director.
A world power for several decades now, Harvard rowing has naturally sent many athletes to compete and win medals at the Olympics. At the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, former Crimson rowers Caryn Davies ’04-’05 and Malcolm Howard ‘05 took home gold in the eights, while Michelle Guerrette ‘02 won the silver in the single. For Davies, this was her second medal after winning the silver in 2004.
Apart from Davies, Howard, and Guerette, three other former Crimson athletes and one current student—senior Noam Mills—flew to Beijing to participate in their respective competitions.
With only 98 days left before the opening ceremonies in three-time host London, there is still no definite list of Crimson athletes that will cross the Atlantic to take part in the Games. Many are still on the bubble, such as freshman Temi Fagbenle, who was included on the preliminary roster to the British women’s basketball training camp that starts on May 5. Several Crimson rowers, such as Davies, Howard, Dave Wakulich ’11, Esther Lofgren ’07-’09, Henrik Rummel ’09, and sophomore Andrew Campbell, to name a few, are still vying for spots on their respective teams.
There is one Harvard athlete who has made it to the Olympic roster, though. Last summer, Alex Meyer ’10 placed fourth in the FINA Open Water World Championships to become the first American swimmer to book his ticket to London. After suffering a broken collarbone this February, recent reports from USA Swimming state that Meyer is back in the pool again, still on track to compete this summer.
Finding out which Harvard alumni or which of your peers is participating in the Olympics is exciting to me. Four years ago, when watching the Beijing Olympics, I was so captivated by Phelps, Bolt, and Team USA that I didn’t even pay attention to which Harvard athletes were competing; after all, I hadn’t even attended this school yet. But after nearly four years of residing in Cambridge, I will most certainly keep an eye out for Meyer and the numerous Crimson alumni who make it to the big stage, despite whatever crazy thing is happening in the Games. I feel like this will be something I will always do from here on out—I’m sure some of my peers will continue trying out for their national squads in the future. Who knows, maybe in four years, Jeremy Lin ’10 will be vying for a spot at the 2016 Olympics. Just saying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few days after the Harvard baseball team’s failed attempt to take the Beanpot title against UMass, the squad will look to move past the loss this weekend.
On Friday and Saturday, the Crimson will host Brown, currently tied with Harvard for second place in the Rolfe Division—in a pair of doubleheaders.
Harvard (8-26, 4-8 Ivy) was down, 8-0, after six innings against the Minutemen at LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Mass. on Wednesday, but in the last three innings, the Crimson closed the gap, pulling within one.
But UMass ultimately earned the victory, 8-7.
The Crimson looks to use this loss as motivation for this weekend’s games against Brown (7-26, 4-8), which holds playoff implications for the team as the season winds down.
In Wednesday’s matchup with the Minutemen, senior infielder Jeff Reynolds brought the game to a score of 8-7 with an RBI single to right field in the eighth inning. But after freshman third baseman Tanner Anderson was caught between second and third base, the Crimson’s rally was halted.
Harvard was unable to score any runs in the game’s final inning, and lost by one run.
“Even though it ended in a loss, I thought the guys felt pretty good about coming back in the second half of the game,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said.  “The team feels pretty confident about the fact that we swung back pretty well.[against UMass].”
“That kind of momentum that we had in the last three innings is what we need to come in with this weekend,” junior infielder Rob Wineski added.  “The way we fought is a good sign for the upcoming games of our series [against Brown]…. We pulled a lot of positives out of the loss.”
Brown is on losing streak of its own, having dropped its last five matchups, and is looking to reverse that trend against the Crimson.
The Bears boast a balanced offense. Freshman infielder Nick Fornaca leads the team with a .316 batting average, while classmate Will Marcal sits tied for fourth in the Ivy League in home runs, with five on the year.
As a team, Brown sits third in the Ancient Eight in batting average (.282), with Harvard holding the sixth position (.266).
The Crimson will need to match its opponent’s offensive firepower if it hopes to topple the Bears.
Harvard will likely look to  Anderson, Reynolds, and fellow veteran Kyle Larrow to provide an offensive spark from the team.
“Brown always seems to give us some trouble,” said Walsh, whose squad split last season’s series with the Bears, 2-2. “So we’re just going to concentrate and continue to swing the bats pretty good.”
Though Brown has put pressure on opposing pitchers throughout the 2011-2012 season, its own pitchers have been faulty at times. The Bears’ team ERA of 8.28 is the worst in the Ivy League.
Unlike most of its games this season, the Crimson will have home-field advantage for this weekend’s matchups at O’Donnell Field.
“It’s going to be nice to be at home and be able to hit in the last inning,” Walsh said. “I hope we take advantage of this because we don’t get many chances to play at home.”
After the loss against UMass, the Crimson is confident coming into the series against Brown.
“Even though we lost, there is definitely something to build off for this weekend,” said sophomore captain pitcher Andrew Ferreira. “We’re pretty confident of our ability, and we should get results this weekend. It’s always nice to be home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The spring season is coming to a close, and the championship picture is becoming ever clearer. On the court, on the diamond, on the course, and on the river, the Crimson has a chance to win it all. We take you through the contenders in this week’s Power Rankings.
5.  Men’s Tennis (20-2, 4-1 Ivy)
The No. 24 men’s tennis team couldn’t have asked for a much better start to the dual season: 17 wins in 18 tries. But in its second Ivy League matchup, Harvard hit a bump in the road with a 5-2 loss to Columbia. Since then, the Crimson found its winning ways once more and is in the midst of a three-game winning streak. So despite the league loss to the Lions, with two games left on the conference slate, Harvard controls its destiny—if it wins out, the Ivy title is coming to Cambridge.
4. Women’s Golf
The stars have appear to have aligned for the women’s golf team. In a weekend when the two best players in program history didn’t crack the top 12, Harvard still managed to win the 14-team Roar-EE Invitational on April 13-14. After failing to win a tournament all last season, last weekend marked win number three for the Crimson squad, who comes into next weekend’s Ivy League Championships as the favorite.
3. Softball (26-11, 13-1 Ivy)
In the North Division of Ivy League softball, there’s Harvard, and then there’s everybody else. With a sweep in Friday’s doubleheader against Brown, the Crimson clinched the division crown—with six games left—for the third straight year. The second best team in the division? Brown, which sits a full 8.5 games back. Oh, and the juggernaut Harvard squad now has nice little 12-game league winning streak going. And whether it’s been Kasey (Lange) or anybody else at the bat, the Crimson has had no shortage of runs, averaging 7.64 per Ancient Eight contest.
2. Men’s Volleyball (18-5, 10-4 EIVA) 
It was hardly an ideal finish to the regular season for the No. 15 men’s volleyball team. After winning 17 of its first 20 contests to open the year, the Crimson was one set away from pulling off a mammoth upset of then-No. 7 Penn State. But thanks to a choketastic display of volleyball, Harvard dropped the final three games to fall, 3-2. The next weekend, the Crimson lost in five sets again, this time to NJIT, before finishing its regular season with a 3-1 victory over Rutgers-Newark. Despite limping into the playoffs, men’s volleyball still has the second seed in next weekend’s EIVA tournament.
1. Men’s Lightweight Crew (5-0)
The softball team’s 12-game league winning streak has nothing on the No. 1 men’s lightweight crew’s current run. The Crimson 1V (5-0) has topped its last 24 dual opponents, including a Biglin Bowl win last weekend with a 4.2-second victory over Dartmouth. (The real story of the day was MIT, which somehow managed to lose that race by 36.3 seconds). Harvard will look to continue its streak on Saturday, when it squares off against Navy and Georgetown.

Just like the paintings on his walls, the Currier dorm room of Ernesto X. Gaxha '14 is a work of art itself. Covered with masking tape designs and pieces he's created throughout the years, the room reflects Gaxha's artistic talent and creativity.
"I kind of had the feeling to make this as useful as possible and as functional as possible. I wanted it to be like a house within a room. Plus, I wanted to put up my artwork."
Gaxha further gave his own touches to the room by painting a Tron-inspired mural on the wall above his bed. "The only thing is I'm going to have to paint over it before I leave," he said with a sigh.
His paintings make his dorm differ from a typical college room. "I was actually really inspired by one of the paintings in the Sackler," Gaxha noted about his painting of the Bosphorus Strait.
There are other unique aspects to the room. His masking-tape patterns turn the space into more than just a simple rectangular room by dividing it into what he dubbed "sections".
"I wanted to do something with this big white wall, and this was a means of separating the space. It acts sort of like a quasi-paneling, if you will."
The tape divides the room into three separate sections: a sleeping area, a sitting area and a studying area. Gaxha's favorite part of the room is the sitting portion, complete with a TV, couch, and a Play Station.
Gaxha also loves his room because of the location. "I love the Quad. When you come to the Quad, you feel like you're coming home." He also noted the large size of his single.
And the finishing touch to Gaxha's room? The light. "I took a bunch of lamps because I really like lighting." The extra lamps add to the airy feel of the room and further illuminate the artwork that gives the room its personal feeling.
His tip? "You can never have enough light."

Every Friday, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
April 21, 1953: Moscow University Gets Sacred Ibis
Threski, the Lampoon's Sacred Ibis, now rests in Russian territory.
Semyon K. Tsarapkin, Deputy Representative of the U.S.S.R. in the United Nations, accepted the Ibis on behalf of the Russian Government yesterday at Russian Delegation Headquarters on 680 Park Avenue, New York City.
Michael Maccoby and George S. Abrams, CRIMSON President and Managing Editor who made the presentation on behalf of the Lampoon, expressed the hope that the Lampoon's Ibis would find its final resting place on one of the spires of the new Moscow University, to be opened next fall.
Mr. Taarapkin and Mr. Svirin, first secretary of the delegation who acted as interpreter, indicated they would send the bird to Moscow immediately and voiced thanks from the U.S.S.R. for the gift.
April 20, 1970: Admissions Heads Say Rise in College Costs Causes Applications Dip
Applications for admission to Harvard and Radcliffe declined by about six per cent this year-the first time in several years that applications have not risen.
Harvard received applications from 7979 students this year, a decline from 8536 last year. Radcliffe applications went down from 2723 last year to 2538 this year.
Acceptance letters to 1450 prospective members of the Harvard class of 1974 were mailed out last Friday. Harvard accepted 114 blacks for the class, as compared to 109 for the Class of 1973. Radcliffe's acceptance of blacks rose slightly, from 51 last year to 54 this year.
Both Harvard and Radcliffe administrations officials cited rising costs of going to the colleges as one of the principal reasons for the decline in applications "As state universities get better and better, parents have a hard time trying to justify sending their son or daughter to Harvard or Radcliffe when their children could attend a state university for half the price," commented David K. Smith '58, director of admissions at Radcliffe.
April 20, 1973: Radicals Give Ec Hiring Brief To Commission
Several radical groups yesterday submitted to the Commission of Inquiry a detailed brief describing alleged political biases in the hiring policy of the Economics Department.
The Commission has not yet discussed the brief or decided whether to investigate the Economics Department, but Commission chairman James S. Ackerman, professor of Fine Arts, said last night that he thinks "this kind of charge is within the jurisdiction of the Commission."
The brief came in response to a request by Ackerman earlier this week that the groups give the Commission more detailed information on a similar but less specific complaint they filed April 13.
The earlier complaint--signed by SDS, the New American Movement and the Union of Radical Political Economists--asked the Commission to investigate "systematic political biases" in Faculty hiring practices and in the University's policy toward the Afro-American Studies Department.
April 20, 1983: Senior Bars Reappear With Less Publicity
A lively Harvard spring rite, the senior bar, is once again underway, albeit with less fanfare than in previous years
Because of an agreement between House Masters and Senior Class Marshalls, the traditionally popular week-night parties are not being publicized in hopes of keeping them under control
Last year, several of the parties got out of hand when many underclassmen showed up uninvited, having heard about the bars through schedules distributed by the senior class committee
This year, however, the dates and times of the 17 bars scheduled thus far are being closely guarded by Masters and senior tutors
Turnout for the affairs, says one Senior Class Marshall, Ingrid D Jacobson '83, should be "a lot more reasonable."
The senior bar tradition started about five years ago when some enterprising party-throwers served a different drink in each room during spring-time bashes, according to M Theresa Frick '83, who organized a senior bar last night
Nowadays scarcely a day goes by in the springtime when a bar isn't held to provide bored outgoing seniors something to do in their final days at Harvard.
The bars noted back are "one of the role of spring that everyone is involved with.
