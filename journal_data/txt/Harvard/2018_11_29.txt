It’s an hour before closing time on a Sunday but the line for the Laughing Room still extends past the door and wraps around the lobby of the Cambridge Public Library. The space is an interactive art installation powered by artificial intelligence, and it’s connected to an algorithm that plays a laugh track whenever the room finds visitors’ jokes funny. The Laughing Room has clear criteria for a good joke: it uses an algorithm based on a dataset of stand-up comedy.
A laptop with the machine’s algorithm displays, in code, the sentences the machine understands and the percentage of humor awarded to each sentence. More than 50 percent “funniness” on the meter solicits varying intensities of laughter. If the room truly loves your sense of humor, you are rewarded with applause on top of a thunderous roar.
Sometimes, the room laughs when no one tells a joke. Other times it remains dead silent after a punchline.
The installation space resembles a living room sitcom set — there are lamps, flowers, and red and beige couches situated around a coffee table of joke books. It is cozy, brightly lit, and abuzz with visitors (the room has not been empty for one minute of its three-day run). On the other side of the room, production lights and cameras face the set. The Control Room in the MIT Hayden Library plays a live stream of the footage.
Jonny F. Sun, humorist and author, created the Laughing Room. Sun published the book “everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too” in 2017, born of his own Twitter jokes, which quickly gained a massive following.
Sun says he was inspired by his Ph.D. work and how people curate their content on social media. “I got interested in the idea of identity and social performance online,” Sun says. “I was thinking a lot about the algorithms that are sort of an underlying invisible hand, slowly shaping and changing the ways we communicate and talk to each other.”
The Laughing Room also derives from Sun’s love of theater, stand-up, and TV. “I got really into the idea of the laugh track because it’s a strange thing that is so artificial in a way, but also suggests a realness,” Sun says.
Social anxiety played a role, too: Sun says he wanted to “create a simulated audience to follow me around and laugh at my jokes… without actually having to be in front of people.”
To complete the project, Sun collaborated with Hannah E. Davis, a machine learning artist and researcher. Davis’s other projects include translating books into music based on emotion and creating an AI-generated symphony, which played at the Louvre. For the Laughing Room, Davis says they considered using other technological methods, but settled on using the transcripts of comedians to train their machine in timing, syllables, and repetition.
Nikhil K. Dharmaraj, a high school senior from California who worked on the project with Davis and Sun over the summer, explains the algorithm as a neural network capable of analyzing “syntactical structures of a sentence. It has been trained on a huge corpus of late night stand up specials,” he says. “It classifies every sentence into either set up or punchline.” If the room deems the punchline worthy, a laugh track ensues.
Matthew Battles, the Associate Director of metaLAB at Harvard, the incubation place for Sun’s project, sees the machine learning process as obscure. “What’s curious is the rules that emerge out of this evolutionary process are a blackbox to us. We can’t get in there and see specifically what the algorithm is responding to.”
Teaching the Laughing Room what “funny” means requires a series of intentional choices. “What you feed into the model is what it understands in terms of values,” Davis says. “We definitely wanted it to not be misogynistic or racist, so the data set [consists of] only women comedians and people of color.”
“We wanted to think about comedy as a set of people and performers that is incredibly diverse and intersectional,” Sun says. “It was a way for us to sort of, at least in a little way, filter out or undo what is traditionally a very white, male system.”
Though Sun’s creation centers around laughter, he does not think the social role of artificial intelligence should be viewed entirely in a positive light. “I think the flip side of the fun, positive environment is… The terrible things [AI] is actually doing — which is mining data, collecting your information, surveilling you 24/7,” Sun says.
Beyond the public library’s connection to Harvard metaLAB, the location was perfect: the library is accessible to everyone. “There’s something very public about libraries that is different from galleries and more closed off institutions,” Sun says. Reinhard Engels, the Manager of Innovation and Technology at the Cambridge Public Library, says this is the first art exhibit the library has ever hosted. He adds the installation formed a much more fascinating way of bringing to attention the issue of AI than the tech Ted talks he originally had in mind. It’s “how we as a library can fit into this intellectual ecosphere,” he says.
After this three-day run, the Laughing Room will return to Cambridge and MIT in May 2019. “We have a lot of visions for this,” Davis says. The team looks forward to bringing it to more people and locations, and integrating more features into future algorithms.
The Laughing Room has a very specific personality. It is capricious and difficult to impress, but it can also be very generous at times. When I walked into my room, I brought with me some of my crudest jokes, which garnered no laughs. I realized that the Laughing Room is a thoroughly wholesome character. Dharmaraj says the the machine blacklists words that some might deem offensive or politically incorrect.
The laugh track playing by itself in the middle of someone’s sentence is humorous in and of itself. The cold lack of response is its own joke, as in sitcoms. The Laughing Room’s silence, in its nonchalance, seems less like an inaccuracy in detection than a personality come to life.

You may be a Harvard freshman, but you probably haven’t watched five handsome bachelors vying for your attention, been accused by the Ad Board of publishing the Hasty Pudding Social Club’s Punch Book in The Crimson, and submitted a short story to the Advocate so paradigm-shifting that the New Yorker calls to offer you an internship on the spot.
This is, in very rough terms, the plot of “The Ivy,” a four-book young adult (YA) series, published in 2010, that purports to detail the travails of being a Harvard freshman. The series follows Callie Andrews, a suburban Californian trying to find her sea legs in the land of silver-spooned socialites and final club bacchanalias. One of a small subset of YA novels focused on college life, “The Ivy” filters Harvard life through a “Gossip Girl” lens, imbuing the typical first-year Lamont trips and Annenberg dinners with romance, revenge, and scandal.
Lauren E. Kunze ’08 wrote the first book when she was a senior at the College and wanted to see whether she could succeed in supporting herself as a writer. A classmate, Kaavya Viswanathan ’08, wrote a book called “How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life” that used semi-autobiographical details about her Harvard experience to great success — a six-figure advance, an order for a multi-book series, and a movie development deal. Things came crashing down when The Crimson later reported that the book was largely plagiarized. Still, Kunze took other cues from Viswanathan.
“Looking at the market, and what the market was willing to accept from me as a 21-year-old woman in college at the time, it seemed like YA — which I didn’t even know about, I didn’t read it growing up — was the thing that was going to sell,” Kunze recalls.
Kunze attended a talk sponsored by the English department at which an editor from Little, Brown and Company doled out helpful tips to undergrads interested in publishing. At the Q&A, someone asked him if he accepted unsolicited manuscripts. He said no, but gave the caveat that, if someone sent him “a very interesting email,” he’d consider it. Kunze emailed him, and the manuscript got handed around until she found an agent and landed a contract for a four-book series at HarperCollins, she says.
HarperCollins billed the book as a salacious exposé of what goes on behind the closed doors of the nation’s most infamously elitist university. In most of the promotional material for the book, Kunze evaded the question of authenticity with a coy demurre — in her author’s bio, she writes that she “refuse[s] to say how much of it was true.” Clearly, there are some aspects of Harvard culture that Kunze exaggerated for dramatic effect; take, for example, her depiction of Fifteen Minutes as a den of blackmail and sexual intrigue, consumed with publishing articles about whether freshman hemlines are “statistically… shorter than those of the female upperclassmen.”
But many of the series’ more sensational characters and plot devices had roots in Kunze’s actual college experiences. Alexis Thorndike, the fictional Fifteen Minutes comp director and advice columnist who supplies the college with final-club gossip, was Kunze’s favorite to write about (“Like John Milton’s satan,” Kunze said, “who doesn’t love a villain?”). Thorndike is a caricature of Harvard WASP elitism; in a column that opens the novel, she encourages freshmen to eat nothing (“Seriously. Nothing.”) if they want to steer clear of the Freshman Fifteen, and to stick to wearing the “3 ps” (“pearls, Prada, and La Perla.”)
Re-reading this first chapter 10 years later, Kunze is struck by how accurate it was. “I definitely knew people who were really like this,” she explains. “In the social scene that the books focus on — people who were punching — I knew people who were reading Forbes to find out who were the richest people in the class.”
Not everyone was so entranced by this salacious vision of Harvard life. Kunze received some negative reviews, the most stinging of which attacked her personally. “Someone wrote that I was a homely girl acting out my fantasies of having multiple men interested in me,” she says. “Someone else wrote that it was unclear if the author had ever met a smart person.”
Even Harvard publications viewed the series critically. An article in Flyby slammed the book with a review that began “Bored? Not that creative? Simply out of other ideas? Fear not, for you, too, can write a Harvard novel!” Written in 2010, the article links “The Ivy” with other “Harvard tell-alls” like Keith A. Gessen ’97’s “All The Sad Young Literary Men” and Nick McDonnell ’06-’07’s “An Expensive Education.” The list of “Harvard Novels” continues to grow — recent examples include Teddy Wayne 01’s “Loner” and Elif I. Batuman ’99's “The Idiot.”
While many of these titles have racked up highbrow accolades — “All The Sad Young Literary Men” earned a glowing review in the New York Times, and “The Idiot” was nominated for a Pulitzer — perhaps they wouldn’t be so out of place on a shelf next to “The Ivy.” All are love stories, featuring a middle-class protagonist suspiciously similar to the author, who is trying to find his or her way as a fish-out-of-water in Harvard’s culture of elitism and aristocracy. A scene in Gessen’s “All The Sad Young Literary Men” in which the protagonist tries (unsuccessfully) to seduce Al Gore’s daughter could easily exist the same universe as the glitzy clubbiness of “The Ivy”’s Harvard.
Sometimes truth is just as strange as fiction.

Look, I have nothing against vessels that are shaped like animals. They’re pretty cool, I guess, because you can drink out of them and they look like animals. But that certainly does not mean I want to write an article about the Harvard Art Museums’ new exhibit, “Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings.”
I consider myself a serious, dignified journalist, and I should be writing about hard-hitting stuff like corruption and grade inflation and that one warm spot on the walk between Annenberg and Canaday. I’ve been Old Faithful at pitch meetings this semester, throwing out bona-fide gems the way a lonely child throws food at pigeons in Washington Square Park. But what’s that worth to the Crimson bigwigs in the cloistered halls of 14 Plympton? Not very much. So I’m writing about these pig-shaped sippy cups, and I’m not happy about it.
You’re probably asking: Why does anybody have to write about Animal-Shaped Vessels? I certainly asked that. For the past semester, the magazine editors asked themselves that same question. Each week, a different reporter suggested that we pay a visit to the hippo-shaped flasks, and each week they pushed it off. Still, someone has to pay the piper. Congrats, Harvard Art Museums, I guess you got what you wanted. But even as I stand between a duck cup and a wild cat rhyton, I know that I’m better than this.
The vessels themselves take up only two rooms. At one point my roommate, whom I dragged along, noted that he preferred the pieces in a neighboring room. I had to inform him, much to his dismay, that those pieces belonged to a Géricault exhibit, and that he had to return to the room I was in. You know, the one with the vessels shaped like animals.
The exhibit opens with a description of ancient feast culture, explaining that “the consumption of wine, beer, and other mind-altering alcoholic beverages elevated the mood and loosened the tongue, encouraging new relationships and strengthening social bonds.” This sets an appropriately baffling tone for the exhibit: the phrase “mind-altering alcoholic beverages” can only have been written by a 12-year-old temperance activist in the body of a DAPA fellow, while the latter part sounds like the work of liquor lobbyists.
Beneath this introduction is a note that the gallery received a “major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.” Standing on that spot, on the east side of the third floor of the Harvard Art Museums, I almost became a Republican. And, mark my words, if people knew that the government of these United States of America had given a “major grant” to Harvard University to put on an exhibit about gazelle shot glasses, there would be a fully warranted revolution.
The first piece I saw was called “Pitcher in the form of a hippopotamus.” I’m a simple boy with simple tastes, so I feel quite strongly that this should have been called “Hippopotamus pitcher.” We would have been quite aware, even with that more ambiguous title, that the pitcher was merely in the form of a hippopotamus and not a literal hippopotamus.
Some of the pieces in the exhibit are noticeably less animal-shaped than others. The “back panel of a funerary bed” is on display, killing any semblance of festivity. The panel’s carving features a man raising “a rhyton with the head of a bull” — a tenuous justification for its inclusion. This is the curatorial equivalent of changing all the periods in a 12-point font essay to 14-point font, and I almost have to hand it to them for their ingenuity — but I won’t, because I could be writing about anything else right now — even bike lanes. Bike lanes.
The museum has outsize confidence in the hipness of its exhibit and has attempted to claim the Instagram hashtag “#partyanimals.” The effort seems halfhearted, as the Harvard Art Museums have doomed themselves to compete with 461,000 #partyanimals-related posts. Two of these are about the exhibit. The remaining #partyanimals posts feature animals wearing party hats and people drinking. I stumble upon a photo of a Scottish tabloid featuring this “Mel B Exclusive”: “I Snorted 6 Lines of Coke A Day On X Factor.” Intended or not, this seems to be the the thing I like best about the exhibit, of which my only lasting takeaway is that the Ikea highballs my family uses might someday find their way into an NEH-sponsored museum.

Illuminated shards hang from the ceiling as Cambridge’s annual Harvest Party begins. Family, friends, and local residents gather at La Fábrica Central in Central Square to browse the marketplace’s newest offerings. The mayor of Cambridge, Marc C. McGovern, takes the stage to offer his support and admiration for the program while waiters roam the aisles offering hors d’oeuvres to the guests.
The “harvest” featured at this market, however, isn’t farmers’ produce. Cambridge’s Community Supported Art is a unique program — purportedly the only one of its kind in the country — that sells local artwork using the traditional farmshare model.
The program started in 2016 as part of the Creative Marketplace initiative, a group of three programs meant to revitalize arts in Cambridge and fuel the economy through artistic ventures. Community Supported Art offers a way to recognize individual local artists in Cambridge and showcase their roles in boosting the city’s innovation economy. The program also aims to connect artists in Cambridge with each other and build a stronger network of support “so that everyone is able not just to survive but thrive,” says Jason Weeks, executive director of Cambridge Arts and founder of the program.
The artists are handpicked by a professional jury comprising art experts and corporate sponsors. The seven artists selected are then given one-on-one and small-group assistance during professional workshops throughout the year. The project culminates when the artists create 25 pieces and exhibit them at Harvest Party.
Weeks lists off the three primary goals of the program: value, connection, and recognition.
“On one hand, we work with the original artists. We help train them, help them network, and help give them the one-on-one and small group attention they need to thrive. On the next level, it was to help connect the work to the office, business, and corporate retail space here in the city because those natural pathways don’t always exist,” he says. “The last part was just to make sure we were crossing the threshold and getting the folks the most out of the marketplace.”
Gretchen Adams, a Cambridge resident who attended the event, says, “It’s a really cool idea to have people buying art the same way they would buy vegetables. It’s a part of life… and spreads a lot of support to the artists to help them market themselves.”
Emily Cobb is one of the artists who participated in Community Supported Art this year. Cobb, who specializes in painting and drawing, says the program helped her develop her skills and made her feel appreciated and welcomed.
“It makes the artists feel supported in our work here in the city,” she says. “Being able to be connected to different resources, have a venue to reach people with my art... and meet amazing artists has been really awesome.”
It may strike some as odd to buy and sell artwork like a basket of vegetables. Weeks, however, says he believes that bringing art — and artists — into public spaces where they can interact with people in the community only serves to enhance the creative environment in Cambridge.
“I think the idea that it looks at art as something transactional is a good thing. I think as long as people think artwork happens as some form of alchemy or magic and is not done by real people, it’s not going to be something that they feel like they can access,” he says. “But this [program] gives us a common platform and a common marketplace where we can connect all the dots to the different audiences along with the artists.”
Donna Socha, a Harvest Fest guest, said she believes this program is needed to maintain the artistic community in Cambridge. She noted that rents are on the rise in the area and says she worries that “we’re going to lose our identity as a funky town unless we retain our arts population.”
In the spring of 2018, average rent in the Greater Boston Area increased by more than 4 percent as compared to the same time period in 2017, according to a June 2018 Boston Globe article. This increase is marginally higher than the rate of inflation and has the potential to force out many artists if they cannot make a living by selling their work.
Programs such as Community Supported Art, however, allow Cambridge to maintain its status as a city that supports and promotes creative endeavors. Weeks says he believes Cambridge’s artists add to the diversity and depth of the city in the same way that Harvard’s professors do.
“These are folks whose creative work and creative instincts are no different than the creative instincts and work of scientists or technologists or education folks from the university,” he says. “They just don’t get acknowledged as such. And by the time we wring our hands and pull our hair, I’m worried they will have to leave Cambridge because it’s too expensive. It’ll be too late.”

On a cloudy November afternoon, I meet Mike D. Stanley at the unassuming CubeSmart Self Storage in Brighton. While the setting is more suited to college students boxing up their belongings, I’m here to take a seat in the pod of the future. Stanley is the CEO of Transit X, a Boston-based start-up that aims to someday replace almost all road vehicles — including cars — with public pod transit.
It’s cold and I’m wearing a winter coat. Stanley, on the other hand, wears a short-sleeved, bright purple polo embroidered with Transit X’s logo, and a similarly branded purple baseball hat.
He’s pulling an H-shaped wooden frame into the empty parking lot, but pauses to greet me.
“You wanna do some wingnuts?” Stanley asks. I get to work, fumbling to tighten the wingnuts on the pod’s presentation stand.
The two of us together lift the pod onto its wooden mount. After the pod is positioned, I approach it like I would a UFO, slowly extending my arm toward one of the windows.
To my surprise, my hand sails through where I expected the window to be. Drumming my hands against the surface, the material feels plasticy and hollow.
Stanley rips off the white duct tape holding the pod’s door shut, and I step inside, situating myself in the carpeted first row. The pod purportedly fits a “family of five,” but I can’t imagine anyone comfortably riding shotgun. Its sloped interior prevents me from stretching my legs fully. Eventually, the wall space will be a “personal IMAX theater,” Stanley tells me.
As I sit, immobile, in this “flying solar pod” model, I realize the pod feels like what it is: a first prototype.
***
When I met him a day earlier at the Smith Campus Center, Stanley was immediately identifiable, repping yet another purple Transit X polo. He enthusiastically explained his vision, which far exceeds the confines of the molded carbon-fiber prototype.
Each Transit X pod will weigh 75 pounds and stretch 44 inches wide. Pods will hang off a network of overhead rails supported by vertical poles. A commuter could simply step outside, walk a couple steps, and call their very own transit pod. Stanley says this could be done by mere eye contact, by using a kiosk, or by phone.
The shiny, white pod would emerge from hibernation, lowering to sidewalk level by “cantilevered lift.”
I remark that the pod seems light. Stanley concurs that it’s relatively light: “I mean, considering, let’s let Elon Musk try to lift up his Tesla.”
He envisions a world where cars are obsolete, where blacktops and parking spaces are replaced with green spaces and parks. Instead, pods would zip at 45 miles per hour through neighborhoods on rails following the contours of what were once roads.
Stanley, an MIT graduate, tells me he’s been building robots since he was 12 years old. He shows me a childhood photograph on his iPad of a young Stanley posing in front of science fair tri-fold boards featuring computer-controlled robots with voice interface.
He flashes a knowing, salesman-like smile. “And before that,” he adds, swiping to a baby photo, “I was in my crib doing structural engineering.”
Transit X marks a natural continuation of Stanley’s lifelong engineering story. When Boston’s 2015 snowstorm created transit hurdles across the city, Stanley began thinking about why and how this happened. “Practically speaking, it was just trying to get my wife to work safely,” he says.
Since 2015, Stanley has logged 500 proposals on his website for municipalities worldwide. He tells me he has another 450 in store, not yet posted. Each proposal comprises a 13-page PDF document with facts and figures including estimated single passenger fare and the number of pods needed to accommodate peak demand.
He’s visited 15 countries with the hope of eventually spreading Transit X across the globe to countries including Rwanda, Ghana, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, China, and Guyana.
So far, he’s received 14 “memorandums of understanding” from municipalities, which signify that a necessary number of government decision makers have agreed to work toward a formal process of making Transit X a reality. But Transit X has yet to break ground creating a network. Stanley explains that Transit X will be an entirely privately-funded venture, and that as he gathers construction partners, he is seeking investors who understand his vision.
To Stanley, enacting the goals of Transit X necessitates reorienting the established cityscape and questioning modes of transit that use “the existing road system.”
I ask him to describe what it’s been like to market Transit X abroad. His voice breaks as he recounts what people tell him about their transit troubles. “These are people's lives and they just can't, they have a really difficult time, you know?” he says, wiping away tears.
In Stanley’s view, the possibilities of a pod-filled world are endless. He says the pod network infrastructure could carry public toilets, could be used “for water, for sewer, for trash, for recycling, for packages, for freights.” Tanker pods, car pods, ambulance pods, and home pods are just the beginning.
“It's basically replacing the Internet, the Internet and everything's on the Internet and everything that's on the roads,” he says urgently.
A fan of The Walking Dead, Stanley says he’d like to see an episode where Transit X features amidst the zombie apocalypse. He envisions zombies using their own pods to avoid contamination, facial recognition to prevent zombie “interactions” with the uninfected, and “no matter what, it still works.”
Stanley is convinced that a pod-based utopia is within reach. "This is the silver bullet. This is the silver bullet for not just transportation, but for happiness. This is the happiness pill."

The entire thing was my fault. Really. I couldn’t even blame anyone else, because, objectively, I did it to myself.
What happened first was that I did not clean my room. The clothes just piled on the ground, creeping steadily over every last inch of floor space. That was my first mistake.
I had no excuse for the state of my little room; it wasn’t like I was too busy to clean or anything. It was summer in New York City and I had long days filled with very few activities. My life was cyclical: Sticky subway rides every morning, sunscreen leaking out of my pores and trickling down my neck. Wide-awake nights tossing and sweating without air conditioning; murky, feverish dreams when I finally fell asleep; and then morning again, with monotony ahead, and the city closing in.
Small-town girl moves to big city, never looks back. This had always been my plan, and I was doing a practice run over the summer in a cozy sublease in Morningside Heights. I entered the summer optimistically: I would be living with my best friend of 10 years, interning for a lovely theater company in the East Village. It was more perfect than I could have hoped. New York is a city that is obnoxiously overwhelming and I am a person who is obnoxiously overwhelming; I had thought this would make us eminently compatible.
It took me only a few weeks to learn that living in this city is not at all the same as visiting it. That the buzzy thrill of so many sights to see every moment of every day wears off when you are no longer a guest here for the kicks but merely a person trying to exist.
In this tiny, cramped metropolis, everyone is going somewhere to do something. Everything in New York has a purpose. I felt like I was going nowhere, ever, except in circles. I am sorry, I wanted to say to everyone I passed. You are very important and I do not matter, and I am sorry I am here, in your way.
“I think I might be too narcissistic for this city,” I told my friend Natasha over the phone one day with a sigh. “I just feel so inconsequential here.” At school, at home, I am used to existing within a small-enough cosmos that I am afforded a small but persistent presence.
I like to matter. At least a little bit.
The next mistake I made on that day I totally messed up and it was entirely my fault — floor full of sweated-through t-shirts and the rest of me full of pulsing resentment for the looming structures outside my window — was that I left a glass Tupperware container sitting precariously on the edge of the bed. I don’t know why the Tupperware container was in my bedroom, but, seeing as the floor was occupied, I guess it needed somewhere to sit.
I tried to get past the doorway but couldn’t because a massive pile of clothes blocked my way, so I decided to leap dramatically across the room onto the bed. The heft of my landing turned the bed into a kind of seesaw, which flung the Tupperware container across the room, onto the floor, and into a million pieces.
What happened next was that I cleaned the shards of glass up, but, because shards of glass are clear and tiny, I missed a few spots. Which was probably my least culpable blunder of the whole debacle, except that I immediately compounded my guilt by walking around the room barefoot, willfully ignoring rule number one of my mother’s shattered glass protocol. Sure enough, it was not long before I felt a sharp pain in my foot. I had stepped on a tiny shard; a shard so tiny I did not, upon inspection, believe it was still involved with the foot, and so instead of picking it out — my final, fated choice — went to sleep.
When I left my bed the next morning, I discovered that the shard of glass was indeed involved with the foot, and had remained involved for long enough that a thin layer of skin had sealed the wound shut during the night.
At this point, things got messy. I picked away at the congealed bits of skin and then Emily, aforementioned best-friend-slash-summer-roommate who had suffered 10 years too many of my bullshit, lent me tweezers. This act was incredibly generous, considering my next step was to insert the tweezers into my foot. It took us about an hour of prodding and whining and zooming in on iPhone pictures of the wound site to realize that the shard was in there for good.
We were late; it was Saturday, and we’d had a plan for the morning, because in New York you always need a plan (plus six changes of clothes in a backpack you carry with you because God help you if you have to go home in the middle of the day), because if you do not have a plan (and six changes of clothes), you will feel as though you have squandered the cultural bounty available to you.
Lest we lose any more of the day, we set out toward the subway. As we walked — I swore I could feel the shard making its way deeper into my foot with every step — I called my aunt, who is a doctor.
The piece of glass is so tiny, I told her, and it will not leave my foot. Will I die?
My aunt has two young children who were no doubt at that moment consuming 90 percent of her attention. She also has a sense of humor.
“I mean, sure,” she joked warmly, in between shouted instructions to someone to stop chewing on something. “I guess if it seeps into your bloodstream and makes it all the way to your heart.” More mumbled instructions. “Then, yeah. I suppose it might kill you in, say, 10 to 15 years.”
I ended the call. It took approximately one minute for the tears to bubble out.
“I am being absurd,” I told Emily, who was laughing. “But I really do not want to die in 10 to 15 years.”
I was being absurd. I knew my aunt was kidding. But her words set off something inside of me. I needed to recalibrate my entire life plan! I had only 10 to 15 years left to accomplish something of value! Death was imminent and terrifying!
Emily rolled her eyes, but also offered me a hug, because she is the person I have called crying about absurd things for a decade, and she knows how I get. We changed our plans: after the Guggenheim, after brunch, we would stop by the Urgent Care on 86th Street.
Something happened after the phone call, after the prognosis. I don’t know how to describe it except to say that the rest of the morning was electric.
We flitted through the Guggenheim, inhaling the art while conducting incisive criticism of society and ourselves, chattering at double-speed. We passed Picassos; it sucked, we said, that he was so good at art, because he was a terrible person, but we couldn’t not feel what we felt when we stared at his painting, so what gives? We talked about the future and about how pencils are stupid writing implements when you’re left-handed and can the concept of consensual sex apply to animals? We spoke superficially and then sincerely; we said things we had never said before about bodies and feelings, thoughts that lived in deep places and hurt coming out. And then a minute later we passed a tiny sculpture of a tiny lady and Emily sighed and said that body standards were really just absurdly unrealistic these days, and we fell over laughing, once again buoyant.
Everything that day mattered so much; the dials turned all the way up on all of my feelings. Funny things were riotous. Anodyne observations became deadly serious. Repeat, all over again. Mixed in with occasional searing pangs of guilt, because if I had only cleaned my room, or worn shoes, or removed the shard when it happened, the clock inside me would not be ticking down every minute until 10 to 15 years was up — but then never mind, because we were laughing about pretentious baby names all over again.
When we got to urgent care, they put the two of us in a room to wait. We pretended to be annoyed as the morning stretched on and the doctor had not appeared, but we weren’t. I kept saying I was sorry Emily had to spend her day like this, but I wasn’t, and I knew she wasn’t either, because together we were plowing through the world at the highest possible intensity.
Everything was thrilling, fast, important. For once, we were keeping pace with the thrumming of the city around us. We were existing at the speed of New York.
When I tell people I don’t know about New York for me the way I used to know about New York for me, they say things about how I should give it time; how New York City is a place that can swallow you if you let it, but if you grow into it you will be big enough to eat the city up. You can eat and eat and there is always more to eat, and isn’t that beautiful?
Or, they tell me, just wait until you have a network. You won’t feel so lonely, then. Brace yourself against the parts of the city that intimidate you; you’ll stop noticing them, and it will be easier.
Except that I do not want to grow myself into someone who can eat the city. I do not want to network myself into significance or retreat into myself so I don’t have to see what I am scared of. If I have to stomp on people in order to matter, I think maybe I’d better stay back in Ohio.
New York City worked for me that day, though. High on existential dread and something else — purpose, perhaps? — I felt unassailable. Maybe it was the thrill of living at such an intensity, of fitting in. Or maybe it was something about walking down the sidewalk two-in-a-row so that no one could pass, intruding on other people’s lives with the volume of our giggles. Feeling a little bit significant, because we were here, together, with thoughts and feelings, and someday we would be gone, and that mattered.
In urgent care, after hours of waiting, the doctor finally came by. She numbed my foot and started to fish around.
I cried very hard and Emily held my hand and we couldn’t stop laughing, neither of us, even though my face was covered in snot and tears and sweat, because the shard of glass was literally so tiny and I was being absurd again.
After a few minutes, the doctor stood up and pulled down her mask. She was sorry, she said, but she couldn’t find the glass. Emily and I locked eyes, and then burst into a fresh batch of laughter.
The doctor said she thought the glass probably fell out while I was walking. So maybe it’s sitting in a corner of the Guggenheim, slowly disintegrating. Or maybe she’s wrong. Maybe it’s still inside me, climbing slowly through my veins, ticking down my mortal clock. I don’t like to think about that, though. Death gets me panicky, and I can only exist so intensely for a few hours at a time.

Over a decade after his much loved novel “The Book Thief,” Australian writer Markus Zusak returns with his latest work, “Bridge of Clay.” Although parts of “Bridge of Clay” are infused with the historical elements that pervade “The Book Thief,” first and foremost his newest novel is a work of contemporary fiction. The story of the five unruly brothers in the Dunbar family relies too heavily on flashbacks and the constant shift from present to past gives the reader whiplash. Perhaps most startling is the author’s writing style, which easily lends itself to confusion.
As the novel begins, it becomes abundantly clear that Zusak is trying something different from his previous work. There are five boys, a mule, a house in disarray, and a mysterious man called “the Murderer.” While many novels begin in medias res and take a few chapters to reveal pivotal information, Zusak seems to have no motivation to fill in his readers. For example, the nickname “the Murderer” remains unexplained for 500 pages. Instead, the short chapters flip from the Murderer’s point of view to the brothers’, a disorienting practice that forces the reader to play a game of catch-up that is more frustrating than enjoyable.
Unfortunately, this change of perspective is actually the one saving grace of this novel as the present timeline of the boys is only mildly interesting while the flashbacks allow for some reprieve. Here, Zusak flexes his writing muscles as he describes the boys’ mother’s experience as a young refugee from a European country under the grip of communism. The backstory of the boys’ childhood or the histories of their parents is just interesting enough to overcome the mundane plotlines of the boys as they bet on horses, train for races and build a bridge. It is not until most of the backstory is revealed that the seemingly meaningless actions of the boys are understood as symbolic for something bigger. By then, however, the symbols themselves have been repeated too often to no effect to change much.
The most startling aspect of this novel is the strange writing style. The structures of certain phrases are unnecessarily odd: “There was she and I and her teeth and town.” Almost as a tic, Zusak frequently writes a phrase that ends in a colon, starting a new paragraph, and listing one or more sentence fragments:
“I know what you might be thinking:
Our mother was highly educated.
Greek masterpieces at bedtime?
Lessons in classical music?
But no.”
This halting style of prose adds to the general confusion that results from the withholding of information.
Another interesting stylistic choice is the way in which the novel is framed. The oldest brother, Matthew, is retrospectively writing the story, with a particular emphasis on the second youngest brother, Clay. It is unclear why the narrative doesn’t come directly from Clay, and this choice becomes even stranger when it is revealed that all Matthew knows — about Clay, about his parents’ histories, about the supporting characters — has been told to him by Clay. Matthew as a narrator often inputs unnecessary reminders of his existence: “It’s me, and I’m Matthew, and here I am.” Furthermore, Matthew is obsessed with hinting at information the reader has yet to be told. The boys are “just a bunch of Dunbars, oblivious of all to come” while Michael and his ex-wife Abbey Dunbar are also “oblivious of all to come.” The repeated foreshadowing is like a taunt from Zusak about all the information his readers have yet to uncover.
Zusak fans eagerly awaiting another hard-hitting historical fiction novel should be prepared to be disappointed by his newest novel. However, as a contemporary novel about family, “Bridge of Clay” has its merits.

Just two weeks ahead of the Nov. 21 release of “Ralph Breaks the Internet,” the sequel to “Wreck-It Ralph,” Disney animator Darrin Butters delivered a presentation and participated in a question and answer about his animation career. Covering topics from princesses to character design to sloths, Butters gave his audience a sneak peek into the often underappreciated work behind the magic of Disney.
Butters began his talk by describing the twists and turns that led him to such a career. Growing up in a rural farming town, Butters likes to describe his childhood self as “that one kid,” which in this case refers to the kid with a puppet. Butters knew from a young age that, rather than spending the rest of his life in a farming town, he wanted to entertain. Following his puppetry stint, this desire to entertain saw Butters work as an actor and an illusionist, until he set his heart on a different sort of magic: Disney.
Since then, Butters has played a key role in the animation of several Disney classics, from his first credit for “Dinosaur” to more recent hits like “Tangled” and “Frozen.” However, according to Butters, “The height of my career was doing this shot in ‘Zootopia.’” The shot in question is one of the most popular, and difficult to animate, in the entire film: Flash, the ironically named Sloth, moving in incredibly slow motion while working at the DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles). “So there’s my street cred,” Butters said.
Shifting focus, Butters then gave the audience a behind-the-scenes look at his latest project, “Ralph Breaks the Internet.” The sequel to the 2012 hit “Wreck-It Ralph” follows the titular character (John C. Reilly) as he embarks on a journey through the most dangerous terrain imaginable — the Internet — in order to save his best friend’s arcade game from being destroyed.
This attention to detail can easily be seen in the series of sneak peek clips Butters then premiered. In each of them, the Internet is portrayed as a big city, with digital cars zooming along the wire-based roads. This techno-urban environment lends itself to many web-related references, from the Google-esque “Search Bar,” to a series of vaguely familiar cat videos. In addition, the relevant topic matter allowed Disney to slip in some key lessons for children and adults alike.
“We didn’t just want to show what’s great about the Internet,” Butters said. “We felt we had a responsibility to show the things that are a little more complicated.” Anyone who has spent any time on the Internet can probably tell that Butters is referring to the potential evils of the comments section. Accordingly, this concept of cyberbullying is a major theme and tension that Ralph must face as he is exposed to Internet fame for the first time.
As an animator, Butters was particularly eager to show the ways in which concept sketches are transformed into the designs we see on screen. Of course, there are many different steps in this process, but each is integral to the overall product. One step that Butters particularly enjoys is going from still sketches to fluid movement. “With my performance background, I’m comfortable with acting out a shot for reference,” Butters said.
He also highlighted the ways in which costume design comes into play, particularly with the character Yesss (Taraji P. Henson), who constantly changes her outfit to keep up with the latest trends. Designing characters like Yesss is a continual project. “We go through many iterations in our designs and we’re very careful about how we portray our characters,” Butters said.
Another moment that demonstrates an extreme investment in character design is a scene in which Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) encounters Disney’s beloved princesses, many of whom are voiced by their original actresses. Butters described the exciting experience of designing these princesses’ 3D models, and he noted that Disney even employed the assistance of an animator who had drawn several of their original 2D designs many years ago. Butters considers this one of the most iconic parts of the film and, as the presentation moved into its question and answer portion, several audience members showed their appreciation for the princesses’ “casual-wear” designs.
The audience, which was primarily composed of members of a Fundamentals of Animation class, also asked questions that ranged from Butter’s previous jobs to the relationship between different departments in the production process. In response to the latter question, Butters remarked on the family-like environment in which everyone is more than willing to help each other out. “Everybody can contribute,” Butters said. “It’s a great atmosphere because we’re all creative and all trying to make the movie better.”
Most importantly, however, Butters gave valuable insights into the entertainment industry, particularly pertinent to the aspiring animators in the audience. “I was really excited for this presentation because the reason I started animating in the first place was because of a Disney short called ‘Feast,’” Caitlin Lam ’22 said. “To have the chance to listen to a Disney animator talk about his experience and how he got where he’s at now was a great chance to hear what my potential path will be.”
Butters’ presentation even taught lessons on par with those taught at Harvard itself. “One of the main takeaways I had, and I’m starting to realize the more time I spend at Harvard, is that there is really no one way to learn how to do a career or reach a specific goal,” Ramona Park ’22 said. “It’s all about self-motivation, especially in visual arts.”
This is a sentiment Butters may agree with, as becoming an animator is no small task. However, his childhood desire to entertain and to create magic pulled him through.  As he noted toward the end of his presentation, “For many of us, working at Disney is a dream come true.”

Students celebrated body positivity on Wednesday night in Ticknor Lounge during the annual “Love Your Body Day” — replete with fluffy dogs and relaxing massages — planned by student group Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach.
The event offered therapy dogs, free food, a photo booth, and raffle prizes. For the first time, the event, which dates back to the 1970s, featured chair massages performed by employees from the Wellness Center.
“That’s one way to actually help people tangibly feel better about their bodies, is making their bodies feel better,” ECHO Co-director Jacob E. Schwartz ’20 said of the massages.
Other wellness-related groups staffed informational booths circling Ticknor Lounge, providing students with resources from Student Mental Health Liaisons, Harvard Recreation, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and nutritionists.
Schwartz said the purpose of the event was to create “a space to come into a culture that has a lot of body negativity and talk about sharing and loving and honoring and respecting our bodies in different ways for different people.”
Student Mental Health Liaison Amira Song ’20 said she felt the event provided a space for students to learn more about the wellness resources on campus.
“Those who are struggling with body image or eating issues can come and feel like they’re not alone,” she said. “There’s a whole host of others struggling as well, and there are places you can go to for help.”
“It really means a lot to have an event that celebrates your body,” Song added. “You don’t really have to have a reason to celebrate. It’s your body — you should embrace it for what it is.”
Attendees said the event provided a good break from academic obligations.
Tony Shu ’21 said he saw the event as a “great opportunity to take some time off and just be intentional about relaxing and enjoying life here at Harvard.”
Another attendee, Sienna R. Santer ’22, said she was drawn to the event because of the free massages and said she felt Love Your Body Day provided an important break from studying.
“Our bodies take a lot of stress and wear over the semester, and I think just feeding our body good food, being around good people, good music, getting massages… it just reminds us to just take care of our bodies a little more,” Santer said.
Ariel E. Wahl, a fitness coordinator with Harvard Recreation who staffed one of the booths at the event, said exercise and physical activity can be beneficial to building body positivity.
“I think it’s important because it’s really easy to get held up in your rooms all winter long, and you're gonna be able to study better, sleep better, learn better if you have a chance to escape and move your body and sweat,” Wahl said.
ECHO is a student organization that aims to provide body image-related “nonjudgmental, nondirective peer counseling to individuals on campus,” Schwartz said.
“If people leave and feel that acceptance and cherish their own body and others’ bodies as well, whatever that means for them, I think that’s what we’d look at as a success,” he added.

It was a frigid Sunday night in Boston when Courtney Barnett took the stage at the House of Blues on Oct. 21. Over a 21-song set encompassing both new songs and old, Barnett and her supporting band gifted those in attendance with a mastered but at times warped performance.
American artist Katie Crutchfield, performing as Waxahatchee, set a high bar with her opening set. Armed with only an acoustic guitar, she mesmerized the crowd with original compositions, an unreleased track, and covers (Lucinda Williams’ “Fruits Of My Labor” and Kevin Morby’s “Downtown’s Lights”). Waxahatchee shined when she brought on Barnett’s tour guitarist, Katie Harkin, who contributed to her 2017 album “Out in the Storm.” The pair did not lack chemistry. In between songs, Crutchfield joked with Harkin that she was unaware of the World Series’ presence in Boston, to which Harkin, a Brit, responded that baseball forgot to invite the rest of the world. The highlight of their time together was “Chapel of Pines,” a song Crutchfield originally released under a different project (Great Thunder). While Crutchfield proved she could hold her own after Harkin left the stage, Harkin also demonstrated ability that exceeded her role as a touring guitarist, which could signal success in her future. Crutchfield’s use of lighting also merits praise. For most songs, they alternated between a soft yellow, a bright orange, and a deep purple. However, during “Chapel of Pines,” the yellow lights cascaded upwards during the repeated chorus of “Will you go?” in a sort of heavenly ascension. Overall, Crutchfield left the audience wanting more without stealing the spotlight from Barnett, making her a near-perfect opener.
While Barnett’s set alternated between fast and slow, it did so in a way that felt natural. Barnett and her band opened with “Hopefulessness,” the opener off her newly released album “Tell Me How You Really Feel.” The song’s closing lyrics — “I’m getting louder now / Getting louder now” — gave the sound engineers the perfect excuse to increase the set’s volume and intensity. The song’s closing solo nearly shook the building. That energy continued into “City Looks Pretty,” although an extended version of the song’s outro slowed things down. This allowed Barnett to play an older cut, “Avant Gardener,” which is featured in Netflix’s “BoJack Horseman.”
The slow songs showed Barnett at her best. “Crippling Self-Doubt And A General Lack of Confidence” may not have stood out at the time, but Barnett played the song on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” later that week. She also played a new single, “Small Talk,” off an upcoming label compilation. It took Barnett’s tendency to write conversational lyrics — “Do you have any siblings? / I got a brother” — to the logical extreme. If her set ever dragged, it was during the extended solos of her older tracks: “Are You Looking After Yourself” was nearly eight minutes long and full of Barnett’s signature rambling tone.
Barnett also played a few quick cuts, the highlight of which was “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch.” The song is a bit of a sonic departure on “Tell Me How You Really Feel” album, displaying Barnett’s intensity and anger. During the performance, Barnett’s voice was reduced to a punkish groan, but the onslaught of lights and instruments did enough to make up for the misstep. Another fast song, “Elevator Operator,” demonstrated Barnett’s storytelling prowess. The song, a favorite of former President Barack Obama’s, was played with a driving drum beat and accompanying lights.
All that said, the emotional height of the night was Barnett’s cover of Gillian Welch’s “Everything is Free.” While Welch initially wrote the song in the aftermath of the Napster lawsuits, “Everything is Free” could not feel more relevant today. Barnett reappeared on stage for her encore alone and apologized in advance for what was about to follow. She told the crowd she was happy to have them here despite the lyrics they were about to listen to. In minimal lighting, Barnett strummed the opening notes on her acoustic guitar as the crowd fell silent, reveling in the charged, vulnerable rendition of Welch’s masterpiece:
“Everything is free now / That’s what they say / Everything I ever done / Gotta give it away / Someone hit the big score / They figured it out / That we’re gonna do it anyway / Even if it doesn’t pay.”
Barnett’s best performance being a cover does not take away from the concert as a whole. Indeed, the main takeaway from the House of Blues that night was that Barnett is extremely adaptable. Through the changes in intensity, tempo, and key, she kept control of her set, even as her voice failed her at times. In the end, during the Boston leg of her “Tell Me How You Really Feel” tour, Barnett let the audience feel just about anything.

“If anyone here hates themselves, this song is for you,” Billie Eilish yelled to an adoring crowd before jumping into an upbeat version of her song “idontwannabeyouanymore.” The giant LED spider behind Eilish flashed red and blue as the 16-year old singer enchanted the audience with her eerie soprano vocals and energetic dance moves.
One of Apple Music’s Up Next Artists in 2017, Billie Eilish is a rising star. At only 16 years old, Eilish has had three songs chart on Billboard’s Hot 100. Her debut EP “Don’t Smile at Me” is comprised of nine songs written by Eilish and her brother in which Eilish showcases her powerful and haunting vocals. Live, Billie Eilish is just as impressive as she is in recordings. On Nov. 2, she performed a sold out show at Boston’s House of Blues as part of her “1 by 1” Tour. Following sets by her older brother Finneas O’Connell and hip-hop artist Childish Major, Eilish brought a lively performance to the 2,500 attendees.
It was obvious from the very beginning that Billie Eilish’s interests were centered around keeping the crowd’s attention every minute of her set. Opening her performance with a light show and the theme song from “American Horror Story” followed by her upbeat song “My Boy,” Billie Eilish kept the audience on its toes from the start. One of the most notable elements of Eilish’s performance was the dramatic ways in which she transitioned from song to song. Between every number, she made sure to keep the crowd engaged with flashing lights, instrumental solos, and intricate dancing. A ukulele cover of Drake’s song “Hotline Bling” opened the doors to “Party Favor” and remixes of the popular melodies from the Nintendo Mii Music and “It’s the Hard Knock Life“ from the movie “Annie” provided transitions into her songs “Bitches Broken Hearts” and “Watch” respectively.
Hardcore fans of Billie Eilish would have been able to pick out the subtle yet effective changes she made to her songs as she performed them live. From having the drum beat in “You Should See Me in a Crown” more prominent than the album version to making “Copycat” more guitar heavy, Eilish was able to make her songs easier to dance — or just jump around — to, and overall, they translated very well to a live setting. Along with the changes made to the various songs — and for a small venue — the sound mixing was nothing less than perfect. Not once were Eilish’s vocals overshadowed by the accompanying instruments, the bass was prominent but not overpowering, the guitars and ukulele used for a few numbers rang throughout the venue effortlessly, and the steady drum beats can be heard perfectly in the background of each song. While her vocals and ability to dance energetically around the stage never faltered, Eilish’s tendency to have the crowd sing the choruses of her songs for her left something to be desired in her performance. Although doing this created more audience engagement, at certain points, I felt as if I heard more singing from the audience than Eilish herself. Nonetheless, when Eilish did sing, her voice rang beautifully throughout the entire venue.
One of the most unique elements of the show was the massive LED spider that sat in the center of the stage. The spider’s legs formed arches under which Eilish’s accompanying guitarist/keyboardist — her brother Finneas — and drummer played on opposite sides of the stage. Hardcore fans of Billie Eilish would recognize the spider as a reference to the music video for her single “You Should See Me in a Crown” — where the name of the tour also comes from. Bright multicolored lights synchronized to the beat of each song helped make the show as visually appealing as it was auditory.
The moments in which Eilish’s performance were lackluster — like when she had the crowd sing for her — were overshadowed by her overall impressive ability to work a crowd, dance around a stage, and maintain strong vocals for nearly an hour and a half at only 16 years old. Eilish’s performance demonstrated that she is not only impressive in recordings but also live. When she finished what she said was going to be her last song of the night, “Bellyache,” Billie Eilish left the crowd wanting more. After the crowd chanted “Ocean Eyes” for what felt like forever, she came back for an encore made up of the ballad followed by a rock-heavy version of her song “Copycat.” In doing so, Eilish left the crowd feeling more than satisfied and ended the show on a high note. Every moment of Billie Eilish’s performance from the beginning to the very end proved that despite her young age, she is a powerful artist who will only rise from here on out.

Harvard researchers are far from immune to retractions, according to new data published online last month.
In October, Retraction Watch — a blog “tracking retractions as a window into the scientific process,” according to its website — published the largest, most exhaustive searchable database of retractions issued by scientific research publications to date.
The database includes over 18,000 listings dating as far back as the 1970s — and details how at least half a dozen Harvard affiliates saw their findings rescinded in the past decade or so.
Prominently featured in the database are a series of scandals involving Piero Anversa, a renowned heart researcher formerly of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
This October, Harvard called for the retraction of 31 of Anversa’s articles — which posited that damaged heart muscle could be regenerated with stem cells — after other laboratories failed to reproduce his findings. Officials at HMS and Brigham and Women’s Hospital ultimately concluded that Anversa had fabricated or falsified data.
Such a large-scale retraction recommendation is rare, even given the Anversa laboratory’s rocky track record. In 2014, Circulation retracted a 2012 study by the laboratory on charges it had corrupted data, prompting Harvard to launch an investigation. A few days later, prestigious medical journal the Lancet issued an “Expression of Concern” over an even more famous paper co-authored by Anversa. That paper had been cited 270 times and demonstrated “promise for treatment of heart failure,” according to the Lancet’s initial press release.
Anversa sued Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital for the ongoing investigation into his research and subsequently left the University to take a new post in Switzerland. In 2016, Anversa lost the appeal — and, a year later, Harvard was forced to pay the United States government $10 million to settle charges that the Anversa laboratory had fraudulently obtained funding from the National Institutes of Health.
A less-publicized set of retractions came from yet another researcher at HMS and Brigham and Women’s Hospital: assistant professor of medicine Weishu Y. Weiser. In 1995, the Public Health Service’s Office of Research Integrity found that Weiser had falsified data in two research papers she produced on macrophages, a type of white blood cell.
The Journal of Immunology, which published the studies, claimed they never received the letter of retraction Weiser had agreed to send. It retracted both papers in 2012 — 17 years (and about 70 citations of each paper) after the initial finding of falsification.
The database reveals that research papers authored by several other Harvard affiliates earned retractions for iffy ethics or methodology.
In July, Nature retracted a highly cited 2011 paper by cancer biologist Sam W. Lee — formerly affiliated with the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT — after several researchers raised concerns over the treatment of animals involved in the study. Figures showing mice with massive tumors suggested the animals may have “experienced more pain and suffering than originally allowed for,” according to a 2015 correction notice.
Last December, Genetics Professor and 2009 Nobel Laureate Jack W. Szostak retracted a 2016 paper on the origins of life published in Nature Chemistry after subsequent experiments conducted by members of his laboratory failed to reproduce the 2016 findings. A research fellow in the laboratory concluded they had misinterpreted the initial data — a mistake Szostak told Retraction Watch was “definitely embarrassing,” but one he was relieved his own laboratory identified.
Last March, HMS Professor C. Ronald Kahn retracted a 2003 paper published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry — the third paper he retracted in the span of a year — citing the omission of key data and the manipulation of multiple figures.
Correction: Nov. 29, 2018
A previous version of this article misidentified the gender of Weishu Y. Weiser. It has been updated.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is launching a new Technology Innovation Fellowship Program available to all current juniors interested in solving problems and building skills in entrepreneurship.
According to the HBS co-chair of the fellowship program, Business School Professor Thomas R. Eisenmann ’79, the desire to increase connections between HBS and undergraduates prompted administrators to create this opportunity.
“If you go back historically, there wasn’t a lot of interaction between the College and the Business School,” Eisenmann said.
The collaboration is “a perfect example of what we can achieve with a ‘One Harvard’ approach,” Computer Science Professor Hanspeter Pfister, SEAS co-chair of the program, wrote in an emailed statement. “One Harvard” refers to an effort former University President Drew G. Faust began to bridge Harvard’s schools, which have historically operated relatively independently.
“The program complements the mission of Harvard College and its particular focus to ‘educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,’” Pfister wrote. “We believe students who are grounded in the liberal arts, skilled in technology development, and trained in innovative and problem-solving techniques, will go on to become impactful and positive global citizens.”
Pfister wrote that he hopes students will gain “a wide variety of knowledge – everything from the skills needed to succeed as an early-stage entrepreneur to exploring topics such as the societal and ethical implications of technology.”
Students admitted to the fellowship program can expect to participate in a variety of activities geared toward enhancing their skills and their understandings of technology and innovation throughout the spring of their junior year and fall of their senior year.
Fellows will have the opportunity to engage in an HBS Bootcamp, which Eisenmann said involves “a mix of learning-by-doing exercises and speakers, and then studio time for the teams in the afternoon.”
Following the bootcamp, fellows will attend a two-day business and innovation fundamentals program and seminars featuring “alumni entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, faculty members from different parts of the University,” according to Eisenmann.
In the summer between their junior and senior years, fellows will have the option to either intern at a technology company or work on their own startup idea with financial support from the program.
The fellowship program will culminate in an event for incoming fellows and current fellows to showcase students’ work.
Pfister wrote the ultimate goal of the program is “to create a cohort that is excited about the challenges and rewards of innovation and entrepreneurship.”
“We want to equip the fellows with the skills to figure out if they’ve got a good idea, a good solution,” Eisenmann said. “We want to give them the full set of business skills to take an innovator and prepare them to make their vision real.”
The application for the Technology Innovation Fellowship Program opens Dec. 3 and closes Jan. 3, 2019. Decisions will be released in late January.

Bench and balance might be Coach Tommy Amaker two favorite words to describe this season’s basketball team, and for good reason. Four days after outscoring the Saint Mary’s bench by a 31-2 margin en route to a seven-point road victory, the Crimson reserves proved to be the catalysts for a 73-62 home win over Holy Cross.
Despite missing Seth Towns, Bryce Aiken, and Chris Lewis for a second consecutive game, the Crimson (4-3) rolled to its most complete victory of the season and is hitting its stride halfway through the non-conference slate.
The Crusaders (4-3) entered the game on a three-game win streak, and with history on their side between the two teams. Harvard had not recorded a victory over Holy Cross since the 2013-2014 season, a campaign that saw the Crimson win the Ivy League before upsetting No. 5 Cincinnati in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Harvard will hope this victory over in-state foe Holy Cross (4-3) is a step in the right direction towards emulating the 2013-2014 year, which marks the last time the Crimson won an NCAA Tournament game. Beating quality non-conference teams, without the teams leading scorers, is a harbinger of good things to come for coach Amaker’s team.
Despite the final scoreline, the contest was not without its excitement. A 12-0 Crusaders’ run threatened the Crimson late in the second half, but a slashing layup by freshman Noah Kirkwood extended the Harvard lead to nine points with under four minutes remaining, quelling the hopes of a Holy Cross comeback.
The Ottawa, Ontario native finished with a career-high and team-high 20 points, one of several career-highs for Harvard players on Wednesday night. Kirkwood had a near-perfect evening from the field, only missing one three-pointer across his eight shots from the field.
“I’m impressed in some ways but not surprised because this is what we think we were getting when we were able to get [Noah] to come [to Harvard],” coach Amaker said. “He's pretty crafty with his ability to drive and make plays. He's a tremendous playmaker, and pretty efficient here tonight with his three point shooting.”
Breaking a four-game losing streak to the Crusaders would be no easy task for the hosts, as Holy Cross brought a vocal group of fans down the Mass Pike, and opened the game with a flurry of shots. A Harvard bench that would eventually outscore its counterparts by a 42-12 mark was key in seizing back momentum in the first half, in large part due to junior forward Robert Baker.
The Woodstock, Ga,. native tallied a career-high three steals, and was one of the key cogs towards the end of the first half, helping Harvard to a 40-29 halftime lead.
“I just want to be active, focusing on getting a lot of rebounds and being as active as I could,” Baker said. “Being in the passing lanes, that kind of thing just supercharged our team and getting everybody going. That was my focus.”
The Crimson were able to weather a storm from Holy Cross, as potential injury was of greater concern than the scoreboard early in the first half. Already without the team’s three-leading scorers, junior wing Justin Bassey hit the floor hard after trying to take a charge just over three minutes into the game. The Denver, Colo. native would limp to the locker room, but much to the relief of coach Amaker and Harvard, Bassey would return midway through the first half.
Undeterred by a slow start, and the Crusaders’ legion of fans, the Crimson responded with a flurry of freshmen three-pointers. As the Holy Cross fan base cheered on its lineup, first-year players’ Kirkwood and Spencer Freedman took turns burying three-pointers. The backcourt duo, along with freshman Mason Forbes, registered 16 of the team’s first 24 points, and embodied the team’s next man up mentality.
On Saturday night in the victory over the Gaels, junior forward Henry Welsh scored a career-high 15 points, and tonight it was Kirkwood, Baker, and Corey Johnson leading the way for Harvard.
Johnson, whose prolific three-point shot had eluded him until Wednesday, was a surprise addition to the starting lineup for Coach Amaker. Electing to start the struggling senior didn’t pay dividends until the second half, but trusting the experienced guard would pay off for Amaker. On the opening possession of the second half, Johnson splashed a three-pointer, which he followed up with a hustle play leading to a fast-break layup, and yet another three-pointer. The six points marked a season-high for the cagey veteran, whose experience and contributions will be relied upon for Harvard to reach an Ivy League title.
Despite a strong night off the bench for the Crimson, the hosts struggled to defend Holy Cross’ sophomore guard Jacob Grandison. Grandison, who entered the game leading the team with almost 16 points per contest, was the latest in a line of explosive shooters who have tormented Harvard this season.
The Oakland, Calif., native scored 21 points on a perfect 5-of-5 shooting from behind the arc, and was one of the lone bright spots for the Crusaders. Grandison was a non factor in last season’s 73-69 Holy Cross win in Worcester, but had no trouble imposing his will on the Crimson defense. Despite turning the ball over 19 times, Harvard was able to clamp down, due to a balanced offense that featured seven scorers tallying six or more points apiece.
The second half provided plenty of highlight reel moments for the hosts. As Holy Cross applied the press to Freedman, the first-year player threw a perfect lob pass across the court to Baker, who swung through the air for an alley-oop dunk. On the following play, the freshman took a charge on the defensive side, before tossing a carbon-copy lob to Baker for yet another alley-oop slam, sending the Lavietes pavilion crowd into a frenzy.
“It’s nice to see Robert have somewhat of a breakout,” coach Amaker said. “Getting stuff over the top with alley-oops and Spencer was able to find him a few times, you can see his confidence growing a bit.”
As the team hits the road again to take on Siena and Vermont, coach Amaker will continue to rely on his bench and the next man up mentality. The selflessness and sacrifice of this team will be crucial if the Crimson hope to find success in conference play and beyond.
“Every game I feel like it’s just whoever’s going,” Kirkwood said. “I think we have a good team dynamic right now that we don’t really care who’s getting minutes as long as we’re winning games.”
After traveling to Albany, N.Y., and Burlington, V.T., Harvard will return to Lavietes Pavilion on December 22nd, to take on the George Washington Colonials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two top lawyers who defended Harvard in the recently concluded admissions trial — William F. Lee ’72 and Felicia H. Ellsworth — discussed the case in an off-the-record meeting with College students and Lowell House affiliates Wednesday evening.
Members of the press were not permitted to attend. Roughly a dozen students who sat in on the discussion declined to comment on the substance of the conversation as they left the event Wednesday evening.
Lowell administrators advertised the gathering over the House email list and provided students with copies of transcripts of the trial’s opening and closing statements as part of a specially curated “reading guide.” The email encouraged students to come with questions for the lawyers. The crowd at the event numbered roughly 30.
The discussion came several weeks after the Nov. 2 conclusion of the Harvard admissions trial, which drew national scrutiny and media attention and revealed intricate — and once closely guarded — details of the College’s admissions process.
The case opened in Nov. 2014 when anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions filed a complaint against the University, alleging the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. Harvard has repeatedly denied these allegations.
The outcome of the trial will likely remain uncertain until spring 2019, after SFFA and Harvard file new documents in the case and Judge Allison D. Burroughs hears an additional set of arguments from both sides in February. Both sides have said that, should the case not fall in their favor, they are prepared to appeal the decision.
In recent months, Harvard students have followed the case closely. Several student organizations hosted on-campus events, while other students participated in public demonstrations. Five current undergraduates even volunteered to testify in support of Harvard in court.
Amid ongoing student interest in the case, the University’s lawyers used the event as an opportunity to share information and their thoughts about the trial with students — but without the attention of the media.
Emma K. A. Rogge ’20, a student attendee who said she has been following news reports about the trial, said the lawyers’ presentation left her with “a more nuanced perspective” on the admissions controversy.
“We had a chance to see some of the detailed breakdowns of some of the analysis, which was very interesting,” Rogge said.
Rogge said she left the event with an even more positive feeling about the way the University conducts its admissions process — and the way it has defended itself in court.
“I think I'm just further impressed with how Harvard has handled this,” Rogge said. “I think it has further entrenched my views rather than changed them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty Council met Wednesday afternoon to review Council election procedures and hear a proposal from the Harvard School of Public Health concerning one of its Ph.D. programs in a “very tame” meeting, according to Council member David L. Howell.
The Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — also approved a list of Summer School courses for next year at the meeting.
Director of the School of Public Health’s Population Health Sciences program Lisa Berkman presented a proposal that would allow Ph.D. students in her program to see their fields of study listed on their transcripts. The program, jointly offered by the School of Public Health and FAS, combines five departments into the broader, interdisciplinary study of Population Health. Students in the program belong to one of five fields of study, each of which are affiliated with a corresponding department — Environmental Health, Epidemiology, Global Health and Population, Nutrition, and Social and Behavioral Sciences.
Berkman’s proposal spurred questions about the need to add field specializations to graduate student transcripts, according to Howell.
“[M]any departments and disciplines have diverse subfields, after all. But the program in Public Health is rather different since it’s an innovative program that amalgamates several preexisting departments,” Howell wrote in an email.
Because the proposed change is substantial, the issue surfaced for discussion only at Wednesday’s meeting. The Council will go over the proposal again and hold a vote on the suggestion at its next meeting on Dec. 12.
Howell also presented a report to the Council on behalf of the committee he chairs, formed to review Faculty Council election procedures. The Faculty approved the current election system in November 2015, with the requirement that a committee review the changes after three years.
The Council previously used a system that required voters to rank their preferences among a large number of candidates and counted votes in rounds. A report issued in April 2015 called the process “unnecessarily complicated” and “confusing.” The Council subsequently switched to a more streamlined system in which three members are elected "At-Large," and three are elected from within each division.
“The committee found that the new procedures are working very well. Nominations to the Council are up, more faculty members agree to stand for election, and voter turnout has broken records every year since the change,” Howell wrote in an email. “So the committee has recommended that the system remain in place.”
The next full Faculty meeting is slated for Tuesday, Dec. 4.

Harvard University Dining Services pulled romaine lettuce from all dining locations as a result of an ongoing E. coli outbreak that has reached twelve U.S. states and some areas in Canada.
The exact cause of the outbreak is still unknown, according to Harvard Environmental Health & Safety Associate Director Valerie J. Nelson. Until the recall is resolved, salad bars across campus will absent of the leafy vegetable.
“This is a Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, which is often found in the digestive system of cattle,” Nelson said. “Because people can get a serious illness with an infection with this type of E. coli, we don’t want to take any risks. This investigation is still ongoing.”
Forty-three cases of infection caused by E. coli have been reported in this nationwide outbreak, according to a food safety alert posted by the CDC on Nov. 26.
EHS maintains a food recall notification system that regularly sends out updates via an University email listserv. About half an hour after the CDC’s initial recall notification for romaine lettuce on Nov. 20, EHS called Martin T. Breslin, the HUDS director for culinary operations, who promptly removed the vegetable from all Harvard kitchens.
“I immediately contacted our chefs and managers to discard all romaine lettuce, remove it from our locations and sanitize accordingly,” Breslin said. “I then contacted our produce vendors and canceled any deliveries of romaine lettuce.”
Breslin said he is not concerned about the lack of romaine lettuce in Harvard dining halls, citing various viable alternatives. He added he has dealt with similar food recalls for romaine lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes in the past.
“We’re replacing it with baby spinach and arugula, things that are not implicated in the recall,” Breslin said. “There’s plenty of other lettuce to choose from that we can provide full salad bars and so on.”
The contaminated romaine lettuce comes from farms in northern and central California; however, the source of the outbreak is still unclear.
“This could be something on the farm, in the way the lettuce is washed, it could be anything that happens before it’s distributed out to the various purchasers,” Nelson said. “We look at the product and where it’s grown and where it’s processed as possible places where the outbreak or cross-contamination occurred.”
As to when students and faculty can begin expecting to see romaine lettuce on their plates again, Breslin said that he cannot safely estimate a date, adding that recalls “can go on for weeks.”
“It depends,” Breslin said. “We just play it day by day until we get notification that it’s being resolved or not or narrowed down.”
Crista Martin, HUDS director for strategic initiatives and communications, said their approach to dealing with outbreaks involves both caution and patience.
“In short, we just take it off the menu until we have 100 percent confidence that it’s okay to put it back on the menu, and only that,” Martin said, “It’s up to the CDC really to provide greater information, so we’ll just keep an eye on that.”
All Harvard kitchens and facilities are inspected independently by EHS as well as by city agencies, according to Breslin.
“We hold ourselves to a very high standard as it pertains to sanitation and food safety,” Breslin said. “We won’t take any risks or chances. We never do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed establishing a safe travel network for bicyclists across the city at a hearing of the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee Tuesday.
The proposed network would build on some of the city’s past efforts to improve bike safety, according to Vice Mayor Jan Devereux.
“We have some painted bike lanes. We have some roads with protected bike lanes, but what we’re aiming at big picture is to have a network that is safe for people of all ages and all abilities,” Devereux said.
Devereux noted three main motivations for the safe travel network. She said the number of bicyclists, particularly those who use ride-sharing services such as Bluebike, has increased — and the city of Cambridge has consequently seen a rise in biking-related injuries. She added that the city hopes to further increase the number of bicyclists, given bicycling is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation.
On March 21, 2016, the Cambridge City Council adopted Vision Zero, a framework designed to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries. In the proposal to the Council, former City Manager Richard C. Rossi and Deputy City Manager Lisa C. Peterson highlighted the growing number of cities in the United States and Europe that have chosen to use Vision Zero.
“Vision Zero is both an aspirational goal and a real goal, and we believe that in a community like Cambridge, it is in fact feasible to attempt to eliminate these types of serious incidents, through the types of engineering, education,” the two wrote.
This February, the City crystallized its ideas into a Vision Zero Action Plan, which sorts actionable steps into seven categories that range from designing and operating safe streets to engaging the public with policy.
Projects in the works for the coming year include a feasibility study of the bike network as well as construction in Inman Square, Kendall Square, and other venues to improve bike safety, Devereux said.
Cambridge Bicycle Safety — an activist group formed by Cambridge residents after several bicyclists, including Amanda Phillips and Joel Lavins, were killed while riding bicycles in Cambridge — called on the city to expedite the creation of the safe travel network.
“In combination with the deaths we’re seeing, three pedestrians killed this year in Cambridge and one bicyclist, it’s just a public health emergency that the city really needs to take significant steps to address,” Cambridge-based bike activist Nathanael Fillmore said.
Cambridge Bike Safety is currently circulating a petition — which had accumulated 2,000 signatures as of Tuesday — that urges the city to complete the proposed safe travel network within the next five years. The group is also hoping to obtain support from local businesses in their efforts.
“There are some problems where it’s really hard to solve the problem, but this is actually a problem where we have a solution,” Fillmore said. “The solution is to change the built environment in such a way that these types of crashes that cause injury and death are much less likely.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Attendees struggled to find room to sit on the floor at the final Harvard College Women’s Center Let’s Talk event of the semester as more than three dozen participants gathered to discuss the challenges facing environmental justice activism on campus and the need for greater intersectionality on Wednesday.
Six student groups — Harvard Black Men's Forum, Harvard College Conservation Society, Harvard Undergrads for Environmental Justice, Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women's Association, Harvard Black Students Association, and the Environmental Action Committee — cosponsored the event with the Women’s Center.
The event’s goal, written on a large Staples Sustainable Earth notepad, was “building a collaborative, transformative politics for an equitable, sustainable planet.”
Julie S. Chung ’20, an intern at the Women’s Center and facilitator of the discussion, said she hoped the event would help ensure “that people understood what the barriers are and then being able to talk about this problem with their very different communities.”
Chung said she was pleased with the turnout and level of engagement from the participants.
“I think people were very honest about their opinions, which I think opened up the space for a better, more productive conversation,” she said.
Much of the discussion focused on how stereotypes of environmentalists privilege nature conservation over policies that address the impact of environmental issues on disadvantaged populations.
“There’s quite a gap between the academic sphere and the social sphere of social issues that we see in general,” said Jasmine N. Hyppolite ’21, a member of the Black Students Association. “Environmentalism can be seen as an engineering issue, as a science issue, but it can also be seen as a social justice issue, and you rarely see those two things in the one classroom.”
While there are student environmental groups and student identity organizations on campus, those groups rarely gather to discuss their shared interests in environmental justice, according to participants.
“Coalition is huge,” Hyppolite said. “I think student groups need to come together such as they did tonight and … understand that this problem is not the same problem for every community — that it’s something that everybody should have a hand in.”
Arielle Blacklow ’21, one of the founders of Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice, stressed the urgency of the discussion, specifically on Harvard’s campus.
“It’s finally time that we’re having this conversation, and it’s very much needed,” Blacklow said. “The environment and environmental justice issues, environmental issues in general, are the biggest challenges facing our world right now, in my opinion, and we need voices. Harvard students have those voices.”
The Women’s Center is the first diversity office to pursue green office status from the Harvard Sustainability Office, according to Chung. The event concluded with a brainstorming session for a letter advocating the inclusion of “environmental justice language” in the University’s next five-year sustainability plan.

With Bacow’s tenure as the president of Harvard University nearing the close of its fifth month, his approach to deciding when and when not to speak out on various issues is becoming more clear. Overall, he has chosen to be vocal on issues directly affecting Harvard but nuanced and reserved on more general political issues in order to foster debate.
Although it is too early to predict how Bacow’s choices on when to speak out will play out over the course of his presidency, we support his full-throatedness in speaking out on issues that directly affect the University. Bacow seems to be determined to defend the University when its long-standing values are challenged.
For example, Bacow has been very outspoken when it comes to the current admissions lawsuit. He has clearly delineated his stance on the admissions trial by sending emails expressing his support of Harvard’s affirmative action policy to students and alumni. While he tended to refrain from commenting on the intricacies of the trial, he staunchly defended Harvard’s overall admissions policy and the financial aid program. We are heartened to see Bacow not being afraid to take a firm standing on Harvard-related issues, while at the same time being considerate of diverse opinions. This demonstrates his commitment to balancing perspectives, which he has made clear.
Bacow also chose to speak out against divestment from the fossil fuel industry and the prison-industrial complex. He upheld the stance of his predecessors, arguing that Harvard will not use its endowment to achieve political goals. In this regard, we believe Bacow has made the right choice communicating the University’s position on critical issues affecting Harvard.
For issues that affect the University less directly, however, Bacow has been less outspoken. He has admitted as much, saying that his leadership philosophy entails speaking out on issues “that are central to the institution, or [about which] the institution has had a long-standing point of view.” Should Bacow wish to speak out on issues that are less central to the University, he has great leeway to do so and significant weight in his words.
There is precedent for such an approach. Former University President Drew Faust addressed issues of national import — for instance, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which does not affect Harvard’s administration so much as members of its community. Faust spoke in favor of the program. Like Faust, Bacow should choose deliberately when to leverage the University’s influence.
Given that Bacow has only led Harvard for a semester, the legacy of his role as an advocate is far from finalized — and we wish him the best as he continues to determine it.
This staff editorial is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Abraham Lincoln famously wrote, in a moment of great moral fortitude, that by “giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve.”
As I’ve poured over the deluge of photos and video footage from this week’s tear gas incident at the southern border, when law enforcement agents launched canisters of the chemical spray at approaching migrants, including many children, I’ve thought also about the precedent we might be setting for ourselves. If we will not give safety to the immigrant, can we ever assure it to ourselves? Lincoln — not to mention the basic law of karma — suggests not.
Some of the images evoke open cruelty: Mothers dodging gas, small diaper-clad children sobbing. Others trade more in the ironic, like the picture of a young Central American woman who found cover under a sheet painted like the American flag. All the images are laden with the markings of suffering and hope, often in close quarters. That combination, I found from my own experience viewing, elicits a particularly strong moral reaction.
A close friend and I were recently trying to make sense of the tear gas skirmishes. He (a conservative) and I have on several occasions talked about how to balance a commitment to human dignity and rights with national security concerns. My personal position after the events of this week was that the chips had fallen too clearly for extensive debate. What the evidence demanded first and foremost was compassion. “It just all feels so wrong,” I told him.
I’ve been thinking since then about what else I might have said. Here is my best effort at a thoughtful response. We live in an era unfriendly to old-school appeals to morality. Our cultural and political commentators, politicians, and businessmen talk for the most part like they’re more interested in the minutiae of governance — whether tax rates, stock market figures, or demographic trends — than in the grander ideas of early democracy: Ideas like liberty, community, and the cultivation of character. Among these voices, the older voices of social progress — of emancipation, the New Deal, the anti-war movement, or Civil Rights — seem to have faded.
The result of three decades of this smothering technocratic talk is our present border war. The Trump administration has deployed the military to the border. It has expanded the size of Border Patrol. It has demanded that migrants remain outside the country as they await judicial decisions regarding entry. It has gone as far as separating children from parents and setting up long-term tent cities in the desert — all to more perfectly track individuals’ movements.
This is one way the border skirmishes push us closer to general anomie. We continue to talk about immigration like it was a science of rates and flows, a problem of missing data. The rub, as one commentator recently had it, is that we can’t precisely count people who are dodging government’s traditional feelers like tax returns or a permanent address.
This kind of thinking is what the French social theorist Michel Foucault famously called the condition of “veridiction”: Of being so obsessed with government as a kind of technical problem that one begins to prefer efficiency over principles like justice, liberty, or community.
We hear the language of veridiction all the time in the right’s criticisms of immigration: that immigrants take jobs, draw doles, and dodge the taxman. Besides being untrue, these myths evince an obsession with efficient — but not necessarily just or democratic — government. They imply that the immigrant’s chief fault is being unregulatable.
What we lose out on with that view is the strong moral dimension of our democratic citizenship, and in particular our call to charity. George Washington observed in his “Farewell Address” that “[o]f all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable.” For Washington, to be a patriot meant to always be guided by a sense of wrong and right, the “firmest props of the duties of men and citizens.” To look on the immigrant as a technocratic concern — another person to house and feed — is to overlook the demands of human compassion.
I’ve written before in these pages on the promise of our collective political inheritance for these difficult times. Last July, I wrote specifically on the potential for a new, reformed American exceptionalism. The argument would no longer be for benign imperialism or shouldering the “White Man’s Burden,” but for a return to what we might call the “moral republic”: The idea that we are a city upon a hill, setting an example of humane democratic conduct for the world. We would again strive to be an exemplar country with a unique civic consensus neither racial nor religious, but human.
Whether this new exceptionalism is in any way practicable remains to be seen at the southern border. As thousands of Central Americans arrive in the so-called “second caravan,” Americans must confront our mounting moral burden to respond, and to respond with kindness and understanding. I hope we will do so despite certain lingering questions of veridiction, like where to house or whom to employ or educate — what Lincoln called the “mere catch arguments” of obstruction.
If we are worthy of the rich political heritage afforded to us, we will answer these calls in the distinctly American way, “with malice toward none, with charity for all, [and] with firmness in the right.” To do otherwise would mean permanently surrendering the moral high ground, which I worry has already slipped out from under our feet.

Harvard women’s basketball (4-3) posted a pair of impressive showings to take home the championship trophy in the 2018 Warner Center Marriott Thanksgiving Basketball Classic in Los Angeles over the weekend.
The Crimson topped Jacksonville State (2-2) in its first game and easily dispatched CSUN (2-4) in the tournament final. Junior guard Katie Benzan and sophomore forward Jadyn Bush were both named to the All-Tournament team, and Bush also earned MVP honors for her efforts.
The award carried a little extra meaning for Bush, a Washington native.
“It was special to me...because being that the tournament was on the West Coast, my immediate family was able to come,” said the force of the Harvard frontcourt. “It was the first college basketball that some of my family members had seen me play in person, and this past weekend meant a lot to me.”
Harvard 75, CSUN 55
Harvard played excellent defense on CSUN, holding the Matadors to a paltry 25.4 percent from the field. Skinner kicked off the Crimson’s blitz with a triple following the tip, and Harvard never looked back. It led wire-to-wire on the strength of hot shooting up and down the lineup.
The Crimson led 22-8 after the first quarter and turned on cruise control, holding as much as a 17-point edge. CSUN tried to sneak back late in the second quarter, pulling within 10, but Benzan nailed a dagger three with thirty seconds left in the half to essentially put the game away for good.
Bush was the story of the game, racking up another 17 points in addition to 15 rebounds, three assists, and a block. Like Benzan, she deferred praise to her fellow cagers.
“My success...I would attribute to my teammates,” she said. “I can think of specific plays where they trusted me and got me the ball.”
Harvard took advantage of the Matadors’ misses and ran up a strong rebound tally with 43. Bush’s career-high 15 led the way for the Crimson.
“CSUN had a poor shooting game, so I had a heightened rebounding mentality,” Bush said.
Katie Benzan poured in 17 more, and the dynamic duo of Raster and Skinner put up 12 and 14, respectively. All told, four of the starting five broke into double digits.
The Crimson will look to carry its momentum into its next games. Jadyn Bush highlighted improving chemistry as a key driver of Harvard’s recent success.
“After our loss against Hartford, [Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith] challenged us to come outside of ourselves and give our teammates the energy and communication we need,” Bush said. “I think the most important thing we can carry forward is a team-first mentality.”
Harvard can put that advice to the test on its upcoming four-game homestand. First up is a duel with Quinnipiac back in the friendly confines of Lavietes Pavilion on Nov. 30.
Harvard 69, Jacksonville State 62
Bush led Harvard with 18 points against Jacksonville State, including 10 in the first quarter alone, and Benzan wasn’t far behind with 15 points on an efficient 5-of-8 from the field.
The Crimson was crashing the glass all night, grabbing 46 boards to the Gamecocks’ 37. The rebounding helped Harvard post an impressive 38 points in the paint and ultimately claim the victory.
Jacksonville State hung around for all 40 minutes, but the Crimson didn’t have much trouble staving off the Gamecocks’ dogged comeback attempts.
Katie Benzan knocked down a trey with 7:38 remaining in the second quarter to give Harvard a lead it would never relinquish. The Wellesley, Mass., sharpshooter would finish the game 3-for-6 from downtown.
The Crimson started the contest stingy on defense, and Jacksonville State managed just two points in the first three minutes of the West Coast showdown. The Gamecocks quickly regained their poise, though, and climbed back into the game before opening up a double-digit lead in the late in the first quarter.
Harvard then ripped off a 12-0 run capped by Benzan’s clutch hit from beyond the arc, and outscored Jacksonville State 18-8 in the second quarter. Benzan credited her teammates for her strong performance.
“They found me when I was open,” the junior said. “I was just fortunate to knock down shots. Everyone had a role to play to succeed and everyone did their job to win.”
Sophomore guard Rachel Levy added 11 points for the Crimson, and captain guards Madeline Raster and Sydney Skinner combined for 12 more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has a long and storied history of students’ wartime sacrifices for the United States — one that is honored inside the Memorial Hall transept and Memorial Church. However, notably fewer names will likely be inscribed from our more recent conflicts in the Middle East, in comparison to most major conflicts in American history. Many Harvard graduates in these historical wars have made the ultimate sacrifice — indeed, Harvard has graduated more Medal of Honor winners than any university besides the service academies — but fewer have in the most recent conflicts.
Next October, the war in Afghanistan will turn 18 years old. For almost every student in the College, the war has been a fixture of political discussion our entire life, and for most members of Harvard’s Class of 2023, it’ll be a war that has been going on for their entire life.
The war would be able to drive, buy cigarettes in most states, serve on a jury, and vote. Ironically, this is a war that no American voted for and a sizeable majority supports withdrawing from. Nonetheless, almost 9,000 soldiers remain deployed in Afghanistan — a number that excludes military contractors upon which the United States increasingly relies upon — and it is very likely that these soldiers will remain there into the future.
Our involvement overseas is not limited to Afghanistan. Despite no formal declarations of war since World War II, the United States currently has almost a quarter-million troops deployed abroad. Some of these troops are stationed at peacetime bases in allied countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, but others come under fire daily.
The tranquility Americans enjoy at home is not extended to our troops engaged across the Middle East and in Northern Africa. Troops in these foreign conflicts put their lives at risk every day, and yet there is little accountability for where they are, when they will leave, and why they’re there: The location of almost 40,000 troops remains classified by the Pentagon, and as journalist and academic Steve Coll puts it in a New York Times op-ed, “President Bush, President Barack Obama and President Trump have all offered convoluted, incomplete or unconvincing answers to [an] essential question: Why are we in Afghanistan?”
Ultimately, the lack of clarity surrounding these deployments has real consequences and has cost many service members their lives. Over the course of the war on terror, almost 7,000 soldiers have lost their lives and more than 50,000 have come home wounded. As long as we continue to place our troops into conflicts, the casualties will continue to occur and their number is no longer decreasing. In fact, military casualties are on the rise this year for the first time since 2012.
Just this week, three American service members were killed by a roadside bomb. Those lives have become added to the ever-growing list of promising individuals sent overseas only to come back wounded, scarred, or not at all. Though these figures were reported on evening news broadcasts, they will fade from the news cycle almost as quickly as they came up.
However, the deployments will not fade out.
The war in Afghanistan and our greater engagements overseas are part of a new normal that those of us stateside are privileged enough to ignore. Technological advancement and changes in warfare have enabled us to fight on an increasing number of fronts with an ever-decreasing number of soldiers. While this has increased our readiness and ability to respond to threats, it has also enabled us to engage in more conflicts and deploy our troops more broadly across the globe.
When will we ask ourselves where these overseas engagements should end?
More importantly, how many American lives will be lost needlessly and thousands of miles away before we decide to withdraw from wars outside our dominion and before we become more deliberate about our use of force?
Rather than having a military-based foreign strategy, we should grow our diplomatic presence abroad: The face of the United States should not be a soldier with a gun but a diplomat with the promises of democracy and the support of U.S. aid.
It’s time for us to draw down our engagement around the world and bring our young service members home. The end of the war in Afghanistan and of our other needless military engagements is well overdue. If we have not declared war or committed troops as part of an international mission, our troops should not be placed in harm’s way.
We have the moral imperative to use our soldiers, many of whom are not much older than many of us at the College, in a judicious and responsible manner, because they’re more than just figures — they’re people, they have families, and they’re irreplaceable human lives.

The ever-increasing Canada Goose sightings and steadily declining quality of HUDS meals can only mean one thing: the end of the semester is near. Before finals, though, we have to make it through reading period — a weeklong purgatory of not-quite-break but not-quite-grind. Instead of bringing a sleeping bag to Lamont for the week, we’ve collected some festive alternatives.
Roast your profs on the Q
Nothing says catharsis like an extended, anonymous rant about the classes that have made you suffer all semester long. Since your final grades are held hostage until you submit feedback, you might as well check this annoying item off your to-do list now. Typing up all your grievances beforehand may just help you focus during your exams, instead of getting distracted by the built up rage you’ve accumulated over the past months—we love fake productivity. And if you spend your newfound free time perfecting a poetic roast, who knows, you may just get featured in the Crimson.
Host A Friendsmas
You’ve heard of Friendsgiving, now get ready for its winter, not necessarily religious cousin, Friendsmas! The lull in between classes and finals is the perfect opportunity to blast Mariah Carey’s "All I Want For Christmas Is You" on repeat to get into the holiday spirit. Grab your friends, decorate your common room with twinkle lights, make cookies in the Student Oasis (it’s under Mem Church; did you know that we can bake there?), and marathon wonderfully terrible Hallmark Christmas movies. If you want to go all-out, even try organizing a Secret Santa or gingerbread house making competition.
Eat Away Your Feelings 
With exams approaching, Harvard gives back to its student body what any smart institution would for college kids on the verge of mental breakdowns: free food. Join the Harvard Square Business Association on December 1st in front of the Smith Center from 1 to 2 p.m. for free latkes. Or on the 15th stop by the Smith Center again from 2 to 4 p.m. to awkwardly avoid eye contact with carolers as you take your your cup of free hot chocolate and make a run for it.
Ice Skating in Boston Common
Voted the best outdoor skating rink by USA Today, the ice skating rink at the Frog Pond in Boston Common is a must for any of us looking to be the next Olympic champion figure skater. A mere 20 minutes away on the T (get off at Park Street), it’s an easy half-day trip that’ll have you forget all the studying you have left to do. Don’t stress about having to bring your own skates: the rink’s got you covered, with rentals available for $12.
ZooLights at Stone Zoo
Looking to really escape the bubble? Head 30 minutes north of Boston to the Stone Zoo. Decked out in twinkling lights, the zoo offers you the chance to see bears and other cute animals in a setting straight out of the North Pole. Need even more motivation? The zoo offers a special “Holiday Hot Chocolate with the Reindeer” program, giving you the opportunity to snap a pic with the real-life Rudolph with sipping some pure chocolate goodness. Count us in.
Newbury Street Shopping
If you’ve been saving up all semester and looking to treat yo’ self, Newbury Street is the place to go. You’ll find stores catering to all styles and budgets on a street that’s packed with breathtaking window displays. If you’re looking to splurge, head to Met Back Bay and take part in their Hot Chocolate Experience, featuring four different types of decadent chocolate. Your sweet tooth will thank us later.
Beacon Hill
Beacon Hill is the go-to neighborhood if you want to catch a glimpse of Boston’s ~elite~. But what makes a trip to Beacon Hill appealing — aside from the quick T ride — is the plethora of quaint and Instagram-worthy streets with townhouses decked out for the holidays. Wreaths and elaborate Christmas light displays will undoubtedly be out in full force, making all your high school friends jealous they don’t go to school in a city as cute as you do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off its 7-3 victory against Holy Cross, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team traveled to face the number one team in the country, the Wisconsin Badgers. The Crimson rolled into the weekend looking to continue its win streak, ultimately falling short twice, but not before forcing back-to-back overtimes.
WISCONSIN 2, HARVARD 1
After losing in overtime on Friday night, Harvard (2-5-1, 1-3 ECAC) entered LaBahn Arena in Madison, WI. on Saturday looking to return the favor.
“It really excited us,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “Knowing that we finished the Friday game with a tough ending, that overtime goal that Wisconsin (15-1-0, 7-1 WCHA) scored was really in our minds.”
In the first period saw a swirl of activity, with each team taking multiple shots on goal, but unable to capitalize as the first period ended scoreless.
The first score of the game came nearly six minutes into the second period thanks to Wisconsin’s freshman forward Britta Curl with an assist from junior forward Abby Roque. The Crimson could not answer back in the second quarter, entering the final period behind by one.
“Never too high, never too low,” captain and senior forward Kate Hallett said. “If a team puts up a point on us, we don’t get low, we stay up and we get right back to the center face-off, ready to respond. A huge thing is resilience and being able to answer back.”
In the third period, the Crimson capitalized on an opportunity to even up the score. Freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere stole the puck and let it fly towards the goal, bouncing off the Badger goalie. Rushing in from the side, captain and senior forward Kate Hallett scooped up the rebound and buried it behind the Badger net.
With the score tied up, both teams headed into overtime ready to play another period of hockey front of the excited Madison crowd.
“Going into overtime,” Hallett said. “A huge piece is just to continue, it’s like a fourth period. You keep doing what you have been doing, continue leaning one another, and keeping each other up.”
In overtime, the Badgers managed to take advantage of a power play opportunity. Senior forward Annie Pankowski scored the final goal with 23.7 seconds left, netting her second game-winner against Harvard.
“These two games this past weekend are keeping us hungry and eager to play, ” senior forward Bradley Fusco said. “Keeping us excited to get back out there and show everyone what we can do.”
WISCONSIN 3, HARVARD 2
Looking to continue its win streak, Harvard arrived in Madison, WI. to take on the number one team in the country, the Wisconsin Badgers on Friday.
“One thing our coach said to us was this weekend we were going to be the hunters, not the hunted,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “We went in with that hunter mentality and we were not going to give Wisconsin anything.”
The first period of play was a fast-paced one with galvanized offenses trading shots. Within the first four minutes of the period, freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere slammed the puck in the net during a power play, with senior defender Kaitlin Tse and captain and senior forward Lexie Lang each netting an assist.
During the rest of the first period, the Badgers managed not only to answer back with a goal from senior forward Annie Pankowski, but take the lead with an additional tally from junior forward Presley Norby.
The second period saw a show of formidable defense from freshman goalie Lindsay Reed. The rookie made 14 saves against the Badgers, leading her eventual game total of 47 saves, two saves shy of her career high of 49 saves.
In the final two minutes of regulation, captain and senior forward Lexie Lang hammered the puck home, tying the game at two apiece and forcing Wisconsin into its first overtime of the season.
“We were all really excited,” senior forward Bradley Fusco said. “We knew that we deserved to play there and we deserved to be in that moment. It was really fun because it had a sold out crowd, so we were playing in front of over 2500 people.”
With 1:54 remaining in overtime, senior forward Annie Pankowski scored again for the Badgers, resulting in a Wisconsin victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team will not have to wait long before it sees No. 16 Cornell again. After defeating the Big Red (5-4-0, 3-1-0 ECAC) last week in front of a Madison Square Garden crowd, the Crimson (3-3-2, 1-2-2) plays host to the Ivy League rival this Saturday, only now with conference points up for grabs.
Before turning its attention to Cornell, Harvard will battle the Big Red’s Upstate New York travel partner, Colgate, on Friday evening looking to avenge last year’s series sweep at the hands of the Raiders (3-7-1, 1-2-1).
In 2017-2018, the Crimson’s January homestand against the two ECAC foes marked the most frustrating weekend of the campaign. On the backs of stellar goaltending — and a bit of bad puck-luck for the hosts — Cornell and Colgate both held Harvard off the scoresheet, halting an eight-game point streak for the Crimson.
It’s a new year, however, and Harvard will ride its MSG-born momentum into a crucial opportunity to earn its first four-point weekend of the season.
“We know that we’re going to have to start really bearing down in those [conference] games,” said Crimson co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “This weekend, in particular, with Colgate and Cornell coming in, we know that it’s a huge opportunity for us.”
Last Saturday at the Garden, the Crimson’s strengths were on display against the favored Big Red. The team’s cohort of young, skilled forwards penetrated the esteemed Cornell defense and prevented the Big Red from gaining the advantage through its characteristic physicality and aggressive forecheck.
Freshman winger Casey Dornbach (2–10—12 this season) notched three primary assists, powering both goals from sophomore Henry Bowlby (3–1—4) and a powerplay strike from Zerter-Gossage.
Both the success of Dornbach’s line — which includes Bowlby and freshman Jack Drury (2–7—9) — and the potency of the powerplay are forces that Harvard will look to leverage in its bouts this weekend.
The squad’s young second line has combined for 25 points early on this season, setting the tone up front for the Crimson, which leads the ECAC and sits fourth in the nation in goals per game (3.88). In part, the early chemistry seen between the linemates began well before their respective collegiate careers.
Bowlby and Dornbach, both hailing from Edina, Minn., skated together in their youth hockey days. They continued to build their relationship as high school teammates before overlapping for a season in junior hockey, too.
“We did have the same path,” Dornbach said. “It’s kind of fun being able to play together again…. I honestly didn’t think about it much, and then once [I was placed on a line with Bowlby], I was like, ‘Alright, I remember why we were playing together.’”
Harvard’s powerplay, which leads the NCAA at a 35.1% clip, went 1-for-4 last weekend against Cornell, capitalizing on a struggling Big Red penalty kill unit. After finishing top-15 last season in man-down efficiency (83.2%), Cornell is currently tied for eighth-worst in the country at 75.7%.
Junior defenseman Adam Fox (4–13—17) is a primary reason why the Crimson’s man-advantage has been so effective. The two-time CCM/AHCH All-America First Team selection facilitates the power play from the left point and has done so since arriving at Harvard.
As a freshman, Fox finished second in the NCAA in powerplay assists per game (0.63); as a sophomore, the rearguard sat atop the nation (0.55). Through eight games this season, Fox is setting the pace nationally in assists per game and points per game.
Zerter-Gossage (6–2—8) has also been an effective piece in Harvard’s attack. The senior heads into the weekend on a three-game goal streak (4–1—5 during that span) and provides a larger presence at the net-front as well as more veteran experience amid a young forward corps.
Zerter-Gossage saw improvements in his team’s play in its recent victory over the Big Red.
“We managed the situation well, played well after goals, and did all the small things well,” the co-captain said. “That’s what we are starting to learn, is how you win games in this league, especially against teams like Cornell…that try to play a physical defensive style.”
Despite the success at the Garden, Zerter-Gossage knows that another win against the Ithaca rival will be more difficult.
“I’m sure they won’t be happy with how the result went on the weekend,” he said. “It’s going to be a completely different game, they’ll be gunning at us, and we’re going to have to be ready to weather the storm.”
Saturday’s contest will likely see a rematch between two goalies whose play is crucial to their respective teams’ destinies. In net for the Crimson, senior Michael Lackey (3-2-2, 2.92 GAA, .893 SV%) posted his best performance of the season at MSG (1 GA, .968 SV%).
Staring down at Lackey will be sophomore Matthew Galajda (5-4-0, 2.59 GAA, .885 SV%), whose numbers thus far have not lived up to expectations after he led the nation in goals against average (1.51), sat third in save percentage (.939), and posted a freshman-best 21 victories in 2017-2018. Galajda dominated the Crimson last season and will be looking to return to form against Harvard on Saturday.
Cornell also suffered from the injury bug last weekend, missing four regulars in the lineup including two top-four defensemen. Regardless of these banged-up skaters’ statuses come Saturday, the Big Red will prove a formidable opponent for the Crimson — a pair of victories over Cornell in the 2018 portion of the schedule would solidify Harvard as a contender for the ECAC this season.
Of course, the Crimson must first direct its attention to Colgate, its Friday night foe and deliverer of a season sweep last year for the first time since 2009-2010.
The lynchpin of the Raiders’ success last year was former net-minder Colton Point (16-12-5, 1.74 GAA, .944 SV% last season), who has since embarked on his professional career with the Dallas Stars organization. In two meetings last season, Point stymied Harvard, allowing just a single goal and posting a 51-save shutout at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
With Point no longer fielding pucks, Colgate lacks a sturdy last line of defense and has struggled due to its anemic offense. The Raiders own the second-worst goals per game average in college hockey (1.09) and suffer from a bottom-five powerplay (9.5%).
Nevertheless, Colgate earned an impressive victory over ranked conference opponent Princeton, a team the Crimson tied, 4-4, earlier in the campaign. So parity, especially in the ECAC, is a very real phenomenon, and one that causes Harvard to take every game seriously.
“These games have the same standing for us at the end of the year in terms of ECAC points,” Zerter-Gossage said. “They’re both important games. If we lose to Colgate, we’ll feel that as much as if we beat Cornell the next day.”
Each week, the Crimson continues to hone its game and work toward the goals it failed to attain last season. A victory against a ranked Cornell squad under the bright lights of MSG was a start, but a pair of wins this weekend would put Harvard back in the ECAC conversation.
“I think we’ve grown a lot closer,” said Dornbach, reflecting on the strides the team has made since pre-season. “[We have] a lot more trust in each other now from top to bottom of our lineup and our goaltending. We’re starting to believe in each other and hopefully this weekend we can get above .500, and I think we’re really taking off from there.”

The night before the 135th playing of The Game — as football players for both Harvard and Yale prepared to do battle on the gridiron — student singers took the historic rivalry to the stage.
Glee clubs from both Harvard and Yale mounted the wooden dais at Sanders Theater on Friday, Nov. 16 to perform the Harvard-Yale Football Concert, an annual joint production. Yale's mixed undergraduate choir sang alongside Harvard's Tenor-Bass choir, an affiliate of the Radcliffe Choral Society. The concert closed, per tradition, with a number sung by both students and alumni.
Below, relive the evening in photos.


Sanders Theater has long been the venue of choice for Harvard choral groups. Singers point to its historic value — completed in 1875, it is a member of the League of Historic American Theatres — and its stellar acoustics.


Nina K. Chung '22 of Virginia accompanied the Harvard Glee Club for two songs on the flugelhorn. A member of the Harvard Wind Ensemble and the Bach Society Orchestra, Chung said she stays very involved in the music department at Harvard. She noted in an interview that flugelhorn soloists rarely get the chance to accompany vocalists and said she felt excited to play at the concert.


Members of the Yale Glee Club chuckled when director Jeffrey Douma momentarily misremembered the lyrics of a composition he was introducing.


The Yale Glee Club quickly switched into Yale apparel as they sang the Yale Football Medley with alumni onstage.


Harvard’s choir positioned performers in an unconventional orientation during the opening song — a strategy meant to allow singers to move about the stage as the number progressed.

 
Harvard Glee Club Lite, an acapella subset group, performed a medley of pop songs. Their divergence from traditional choral music reflects the organization's effort to expand the normal repertoire of Harvard choir performances.


The concert ended with a joint performance by the Harvard and Yale Glee clubs; alumni from both groups joined in to sing “Bright College Years” and “Fair Harvard.”


As spectators exited Sanders Theater, they met with the sight of Annenberg dining hall, lit up in Crimson red in support of Harvard football.

Early in his medical career, Erich Lindemann grew interested in patients who had lost a part of themselves: those with amputated legs, failing eyesight, organs that had been surgically removed. In 1941, the psychiatric unit where Lindemann worked at Massachusetts General Hospital ran a study on patients who had undergone hysterectomies, or the removal of the uterus.
Several of these women responded to their operations with levels of distress that surprised and confused them: They became furious with their doctors, generally disliked people more, couldn’t stand movie scenes depicting violence. Suddenly, one woman with seven children developed a tendency to break glass and china after her operation. “I sometimes have an irresistible impulse to smash something,” she explained. In another case, a patient, against her conscious will, knocked her surgeon to the floor.
The psychiatric unit decided to run a study comparing these patients to those who had undergone cholecystectomies — the removal of the gallbladder — and found similar reactions of anguish.
Lindemann told this story to a group of huddled nurses and doctors one February morning in 1972. He wanted to teach them about loss, and this seemed to be the simplest way to do it: by starting with the loss of parts. Lindemann and the group of medics stood in a small, windowless room in the basement of Stanford Medical School. A few years earlier, he had retired from his position as a Harvard psychiatry professor and the chief of psychiatry at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital.
Lindemann had spent much of his career researching loss. He soared to national prominence after conducting a historic study of bereavement in the wake of the deadly fire at Boston’s Cocoanut Grove nightclub on Nov. 28,1942. His work — on Cocoanut Grove and beyond — would reshape the way the medical world understood grief and redefine the landscape of mental health treatment in the United States.
“Partial death,” Lindemann called the instances of organ removal he studied a year before the fire in 1941. The body part’s literal function was defunct. The person was now a different person, one without the part. The new person had to rethink how they could relate to a constellation of altered social ties. And they had to figure out what to do with their sorrow.
This was the cause of the patients’ distress, Lindemann explained to the group of medics — being forced into figuring out this new life without the missing thing.
***
There’s a photo from 1942 of the northwest corner of the Melody Lounge that looks pretty innocuous — funky, with its zebra-striped couch and walls made of palm-stems and unfinished wood — until you notice everything pictured is scorched.
The Melody Lounge was the basement of Boston’s Cocoanut Grove, located in the city’s Bay Village. Witness testimonies said this was where, around 10:15 p.m. on Nov. 28, a sailor unscrewed a lightbulb so that the corner, usually dimly lit, would become pitch-black and he could kiss his girlfriend in private. A busboy lit a match to find the missing bulb. He screwed the bulb back in and stamped out the match under his shoe. Soon after, bystanders saw sparks in the kissing corner. They saw the plastic palm tree fronds that reached along the starry sky-painted ceiling begin to blur red at the edges. A fire spread rapidly across the Melody Lounge, then up the stairway throughout the whole nightclub.
The Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire is America’s deadliest nightclub fire, and, until 9/11, it was the second-deadliest single-building fire in United States history. It was the night of the Boston College-Holy Cross football game at Fenway Park. It was the weekend after the Harvard-Yale game. Families and couples were gathered at the club. That night, it was uncomfortably cold outside and uncomfortably hot inside, especially since the club was at nearly two times its human capacity — more than 1,000 people were crammed inside. An estimated 492 people died in the fire or its aftermath. The next day, in the midst of the Second World War, the front pages of American newspapers belonged to Cocoanut Grove.
One patron that night was a national celebrity, the Hollywood western actor and bona-fide Montana cowboy Buck Jones. He boasted nearly 120 country-western credits to his name, but, over the preceding years, singing cowboys had come to dominate on the national stage — and Buck Jones did not sing. He had come to Cocoanut Grove on a promotional tour through Boston meant to put more traditionally stoic cowboys back in the spotlight. A 17-year-old singer named Dotty Myles was also chasing fame that night. Despite being too young for the venue, she was hired for a four-week slot performing at Cocoanut Grove, her first professional gig. Her four weeks were nearly up whent he blaze started.
Both performers made it out of the club. Myles even continued her singing career after receiving extensive operations from Dr. Varaztad H. Kazanjian, the first professor of plastic surgery at Harvard Medical School. Jones died in the hospital in December.
As victims flooded Boston hospitals, Harvard Medical School professors temporarily joined medical staffs. Harvard students and instructors arrived at the scene of the fire before midnight to serve as stretcher bearers and hospital orderlies — and to help identify the dead and injured. This last task was especially difficult when it came to women; in the chaos many had been separated from their handbags and therefore from their identification.
At Radcliffe, administrators scoured the sign-out books that Radcliffe women had to fill out before leaving for any given evening to see who had gone into the city that night. City desk phones rang off the hook with calls from school officials at Boston’s many colleges. School officials’ phones rang off the hook with calls from anxious parents.
Cocoanut Grove first opened in 1927 during Prohibition. It was dreamed up by a pair of orchestral musicians, but its financial backers had ties to the mob and soon opened a speakeasy in the space. A Russian mob boss named Charles “King” Solomon bought the club in 1931. A few years later, King was shot in the men’s room of the Cotton Club in Roxbury, and his lawyer Barney Welansky took over and kept managing Cocoanut Grove right up until the fire.
Welansky, in the style of his former boss, kept side doors locked shut so patrons would not leave without paying. During the fire, the front revolving door jammed due to the mass of people trying to push through. In what proved to be a fatal design flaw, other swing doors opened inward, so the weight of people trying to exit prevented the doors from opening. Following the fire came an onslaught of fire code and safety standard reforms, in Boston and across the U.S.
On Nov. 28, the day of the fire, Welansky was at Massachusetts General being treated for an unrelated heart condition. After the fire, he was convicted for manslaughter when police investigations found that he had neglected safety codes. Boston Mayor Maurice J. Tobin was reportedly friendly with Welansky and had enabled his negligence. (Three-and-a-half years into Welansky’s 12 to 15-year sentence, Tobin would grant him a pardon from his new perch as Governor.) Bostonians had enough familiarity with crooked politics to smell cronyism, and the public was outraged: they felt the politicians responsible for their safety had failed them.
The fire came at a strange moment in Harvard’s history, a time when life at the University was saturated with war. “We must rearm at once,” Harvard President James B. Conant said in 1940 in a nationally broadcast radio address endorsing the war effort. “We will gain the inevitable triumph so help us God,” President Roosevelt said in 1941, the day after the Pearl Harbor bombing, and 1,200 students gathered in Sanders Theater heard him declare it over the radio. They heard Conant pledge Harvard’s full support for the Allies. After that, ROTC members ran drills in Memorial Hall; researchers broke codes and developed radar jamming and night vision and napalm. A naval communications school was installed — four of its students died in the fire. So did one from Harvard’s Navy Supply school, three from its Laboratory Radar school, two from the Business School, seven alumni, and five students at Harvard College.
John J. Rizzo was 21 years old and waiting tables at the club on the night of the fire. He escaped through a window and managed to help 15 others exit, too, by hoisting them up from a bartop. Rizzo testified in the investigations immediately following the fire, at one point responding to a line of questioning posed by the Boston Fire Commissioner William A. Reilly:
Q. The first you saw of the fire [was] a commotion in the lobby near the Piedmont Street front door, and you went that way thinking it was a fight?
A. Yes.
Q. And you saw it was a fire?
A. Yes...
Q. Would you say the fire spread along the ceiling or along the walls?
A. It was right in the middle of the room just like a forest fire, coming right down along the aisle.

The story of the Cocoanut Grove fire has been well documented by Boston historians. Boston talk radio pioneer Paul Benzaquin published a narrative version of the story in 1959. In 2005, Boston journalist Stephanie Schorow published “The Cocoanut Grove Fire,” which detailed the disaster’s pivotal role in Boston history. The same year, a New York-based consumer protection attorney named John C. Esposito published “Fire in the Grove: The Cocoanut Grove Tragedy And Its Aftermath.”
When historians discuss the fire, they often bring up the developments in burn treatment that sprang up in its aftermath, or how it changed building design and safety codes. But there is another outcome of the fire that rarely gets mentioned outside of academic texts. Under the scrutiny of psychiatrists working at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University, the fire reshaped how we understand grief.
Dr. Erich Lindemann moved to the U.S. from his native Germany in 1929 to conduct psychology research at the University of Iowa. He came to Harvard on a research fellowship in 1935. By 1942, Lindemann was the chief of a psychiatric outpatient department at Massachusetts General Hospital, where emergency personnel rushed 114 patients the night of the fire at Cocoanut Grove.
Surgeons treating burn trauma in the wake of the fire found treatment paths that were original, effective, and immediately useful — not only in Boston but for the medical needs of the Allied forces in the war. They also found themselves perplexed, confronted with problems for which they had no vocabulary. A number of patients were not grateful — they were angry. They tore off their medical devices and yelled at their doctors and kicked their nurses.
“You had a problem that didn’t even have its own experts yet,” explains Anne Harrington, a professor of the History of Science at Harvard who studies the history of psychiatry and neuroscience. “So they bring in psychiatrists because that’s the closest they can think of.”
Lindemann was the psychiatrist they chose. The angry patients, he found, were in fact the ones who had lost loved ones in the fire, and the feeling they displayed was much more than anger. It was grief — which, at the time, was not considered by the medical establishment to count as a psychiatric issue.
“And [Lindemann] says, well maybe we don’t think of acute grief as requiring psychiatric help, but I trade under psychiatry and I think I can help,” Harrington says.
Lindemann recorded his observations in a paper titled “Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief.” The paper would become a foundational document in standards of psychological care after disasters. It spawned the field of crisis theory. It was an early signpost in the long road to understanding trauma.
As Lindemann described it in his findings, “acute grief” looked like this: the patients’ throats were tight. They couldn’t help sighing. Their muscles were weak. They felt physical pain in waves that lasted for up to an hour. A mention of the deceased, a visit from a friend, or an offer of sympathy could elicit any of these symptoms. They tended to repeat certain phrases:
“It is almost impossible to climb up a stairway.” “Everything I lift seems so heavy.” “I can’t walk to the corner without feeling exhausted.” “The food tastes like sand.” “I stuff the food down because I have to eat.”
One man whose daughter died in the fire kept picturing her calling his name from a telephone booth. The sound become so loud and the scene so vivid that he often forgot his immediate surroundings. A navy pilot found an imaginary companion in a friend he’d lost, and went on eating and discussing life decisions with him. Some patients embodied their dead loved ones, walking or talking like the deceased, or taking on their interests. One woman, the wife of a deceased insurance agent, wrote elaborate letters offering her services to insurance agencies.
Loss of social habits was common, as were hostility and guilt. One man’s family returned him to the hospital in January after he began to express immense guilt over having fainted before he could help his wife in the fire. “I should have saved her or I should have died too,” he would say. “Nobody can help me. When is it going to happen? I am doomed, am I not?”
On his fourth day in the hospital, the man finally grew calm. Doctors were pleased with his progress and said they anticipated a full recovery. On the sixth day the man leapt through the room’s closed window to his death.
These grieving patients, Lindemann believed, were not dissimilar from those he’d seen before, those who had seen their uteruses or gallbladders removed and lashed out at their medics. He proposed that losing a human relationship, especially one central to a person’s social structures, was like losing a part of oneself.
The way to recover the self, Lindemann wrote, was through something called “grief work, namely, emancipation from the bondage to the deceased, readjustment to the environment in which the deceased is missing, and the formation of new relationships.” And the task of the psychiatrist, as imagined by Lindemann, was to share in the grief work: to help extricate the patients from their ties to the deceased and help them find fulfilling new social patterns, ways of living in their new world.

In the 1930s and into World War II, the landscape of psychiatry in the U.S. was “a kind of uneasy detente,” Harrington says. Some professionals strictly followed Freud’s psychoanalytic theories. Others reworked psychoanalysis, many of them attempting to humanize the approach by attending to people’s lived experiences instead of just the happenings of their unconscious. Proponents of the American Mental Hygiene Movement emphasized a “positive mental health” approach that applied to everyone, not just sick people. Other doctors swore by electroconvulsive therapy and endocrine research.
Lindemann’s homeland of Germany was a wellspring of psychoanalysis, and he was well-trained in its study, but what he’d found in his career made him grow disenchanted with the notion of the individual psychiatrist who seeks to plumb the unconscious mind of the suffering individual. He’d determined from his grief study that it is necessary to reconnect the bereaved individual with the living world, and that this is impossible without the cooperation of the living world.
Recovery, then, would require the whole community.
Ironically, Freudians on the front lines of World War II were producing results around the same time that mirrored Lindemann’s grief study. While looking after soldiers suffering from what came to be called battle fatigue or neurosis, these doctors found that the soldiers experienced acute grief and isolation. During treatment, taking the soldiers away from their platoons hampered recovery, but — if they were treated on site, if they understood that they would be re-embedded in their communities as soon as possible — they were more likely to recover.
At Harvard, Lindemann searched for methods in social sciences like anthropology, sociology and social psychology, which had long used community-embedded approaches. He mapped out a plan to integrate these fields into mental health education and research. Ever since conducting his grief study, he wrote, he had become increasingly concerned with the effect of human relationships on health and illness, and with “the possibility that certain individuals might operate as pathogenic agents for others.” In other words, it wasn’t only viruses and wounds that could worsen health. Other people could, too.
The logic that human relations could be pathogenic extended smoothly into a set of political implications for Lindemann’s work: if disrupted social structures could set into motion a psychiatric crisis for an individual — well, communities were embedded in social structures, too, and surely the disruption of those could take similar psychiatric tolls.
Lindemann looked to research conducted by Dr. Heinz Haefner at Germany’s University of Heidelberg. Haefner, researching mostly Jews after World War II to learn about the psychosocial effects of racial and political persecution, indeed found evidence of psychiatric disturbance among the persecuted group. Surprisingly, members of the racial group who had not lost significant family members showed the same symptoms as those who had.
“It appears that community behavior includes reactions quite similar to those experienced in individual crises,” Lindemann wrote. “Massive emotional responses can be seen as panic or apathy. The manifest danger may be denied or altogether overlooked.”
For the rest of Lindemann’s career, community psychiatry would remain his main preoccupation. When a large-scale urban renewal project evicted residents from Boston’s working-class West End and replaced the neighborhood with high-rise buildings, Lindemann, along with a slew of social scientists and other medical professionals interested in public health, decided to study the effects of the relocation.
Lindemann wrote, “3000 families are being forcibly relocated and thrown out of a context in which they have established reasonably satisfactory networks of interaction... What kind of families, from what kind of origin, will be damaged most by this process?”
People needed their communities to recover from grief, and grief could take place at the level of the community, so people needed to be treated in their communities. This was the foundation of a movement called Community Mental Health, and in 1948 Lindemann founded the Wellesley Human Relation Service, the nation’s first community mental health center.
In Lindemann’s vision, the community mental health centers would emphasize preventive care to promote the wellness of the community at large, rather than the illness of a few. Lindemann imagined community participation in the centers. He imagined excellent psychotherapy; modified care programs, like halfway houses; workshops for occupational training; and educational outreach to disadvantaged people. “There might be a breakthrough on some forms of schizophrenia (I think schizophrenia is a collective name for probably some 50 conditions),” he wrote.
At that moment, he believed, people held an image of healthcare that looked like this: “There is the hospital, the castle, and there it is all being done.” He offered this image in its place: “It’s done right where you sit, in your own family, in your own factory, in your own school, and so on. What arrive at the castle are the long-neglected casualties.”
Lindemann began to receive invitations to speak all over the country. A note came in the mail that read, “Dr. Mead needs a reference to your grief studies, especially your study of the Cocoanut Grove fire.” It came from a secretary of the famed anthropologist Margaret Mead, writing from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. (Mead later nicknamed Lindemann’s field of work “sociatry.”)
In 1954, he became the chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, where he taught courses that danced between medicine and social science and philosophy. He taught his students from the perspective of existentialist philosophers in order to “find a conception of sick man which would be compatible with the dignity and uniqueness of each specific human being.” He encouraged students to consider a patient “not only as a sick organism but also as a human being caught up in the complexity of the various determinants of his life career, a being which only vaguely perceives who he is and where he is going.”
“It is the essence of life to be intertwined with death and the rhythmical coming and going of generations,” Lindemann wrote in his lesson plans for a seminar on “The Existentialist Approach to Psychiatric Problems.” “It is the essence of life that there be strife among human beings, among populations, and among the organism.”
He wasn’t without critics. “It began to sound very different from what psychiatry was like at the time,” says David G. Satin, who was a student of Lindemann’s throughout the 1950s and 1960s and later went on to work as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. “People began to disapprove of this expansion. They felt he was getting into things that were not psychiatric, that were not medical. That were getting into fields that were politics, that were sociology, and physicians should stay out of that.”
Resentment and resistance brewed toward Lindemann, Satin says — “And when he involved non-medical people, in psychology, anthropology, sociology… the medical people were just outraged — letting all these non-medical people into our citadel, and polluting the purity of medicine.”

On a lecture tour in 1951, Lindemann had serendipitously met a British man named Gerald Caplan who’d been independently conducting research on crisis theory in Jerusalem. Caplan joined Lindemann the next year at the Harvard School of Public Health. The two worked and spoke closely on all facets of community mental health. Later Caplan wrote, “My own thinking about these topics was so influenced by Erich that I have never been able to say which of my ideas in those days originated in my mind and which in his.”
Caplan became well known for his work in community mental health, and his work on preventive care inspired and galvanized a man named Robert H. Felix, who was the director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Felix championed community mental health as the model for the nation.
In 1963, less than a month before his assassination, President John F. Kennedy signed into law the Community Mental Health Act, which mandated that the federal government fund centers and research at the national level. The following year, Caplan published a book titled “Principles of Preventive Psychiatry,” which laid out an instructional framework for the many community mental health workers who would start work across the country following the act’s passage. Felix wrote the book’s impassioned forward, calling it “a Bible.”
The community mental health movement gained national momentum not only from Kennedy and Congress, but from increased social and political support offered by Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War activists.
Meanwhile, in the Harvard medical community, Lindemann’s decriers grew louder. In the later years of Lindemann’s tenure, Satin says, “People at the medical school became much more uninterested and hostile, retrenching to biology, lab research, and illness treatment approaches.” Early in Lindemann’s career, the Medical School curriculum had allocated increased time for psychiatry. Later on, the allotted time contracted, Satin says.
And, in one massively significant way, community mental health failed.
“It should be possible, within a decade or two, to reduce the number of patients in mental institutions by 50 percent or more,” Kennedy said when he signed the bill into law on Oct. 31, 1963. This reduction would come to be called “deinstitutionalization.” It was clear that American mental institutions were understaffed and over capacity, and they offered inadequate and sometimes abusive treatments. Community mental health centers had the potential to provide patients with the personalized care that large institutions could not offer.
But in practice, deinstitutionalization often meant releasing severely mentally ill people in enormous numbers to be treated at community mental health centers that didn’t have the capacity or funding to care for them. Many of these people wound up homeless or imprisoned. These problems were exacerbated by national entrance into a politically conservative era stewarded by Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, who both shrank federal funding for community mental health centers.
The budget cuts amplified the inadequacy of the centers, worsening public opinion. By Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s, the movement had lost steam. “‘Community’ kind of became a discredited reference point in psychiatry,” Harrington says.
“The centers weren’t really funded to a point where they could handle issues of medication and medication compliance, and these people were really sick and they weren’t just in crisis,” Harrington says. “Community mental health centers was maybe a really good model for people suffering from acute grief. The idea that it should become a model for people suffering from every single distress or disorder probably was a big mistake.”
More recently, Harrington says, there’s been a shift in the world of psychiatry back to the biological — and a burgeoning lack of interest in integrating social scientific research into treatment paths. She calls this “an era when we believe that all forms of suffering [are] ultimately best treated with a prescription for a good antidepressant.”
“I think there has been a profound medicalization of many forms of mental suffering, possibly in ways that have narrowed perceived options for people,” she says. “In a way these are quiescent times for the psychosocial.”

In the basement of Stanford Medical School that February morning in 1972, Lindemann addressed a group of doctors and nurses on the subject of loss, recalling what he had learned from his research on hysterectomies. He was not their chief. He was their patient. The medics standing before him had spent the past six years treating Lindemann for a sacral chordoma, a rare cancer occurring in the lower back.
It is very unusual for a patient facing death to also be an expert on the subject. Lindemann wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to use all his knowledge of loss to explain to the medics what it was like to be confronted with one’s own death.
It was not only a chance for the doctors to learn how to best treat a dying patient, but Lindemann’s chance to test whether he could benefit from his own theories. What he said on that day would become a published essay titled, “Reactions to One’s Own Fatal Illness.”
He talked through the loss he’d observed in patients with missing body parts; and how, in the case of the Cocoanut Grove fire, he’d seen a huge quantity of people stricken by the loss of loved ones.
“Now let us turn away from partial losses and think about losing of oneself in threatening death,” he said. “Some time left, a little time left, a long time left? — how much, one doesn’t know.”
A surgeon had misdiagnosed his cancer for three years, and, when he finally found it, told Lindemann: “Well, you have three or four years now, can you do with three or four years?”
“Then it really hits you,” Lindemann said, “And the thing that hits you is that you are not immortal.”
Lindemann had been adamant throughout his career that the hospital itself is a site of complicated social dynamics. A mentally healthy ward was one that looked out for the emotional wellbeing of all patients, even mentally healthy ones, as well as that of caretakers, who often faced crises of their own while working. One problem that arose in medical institutions, he believed, was that staff felt limited in their time and emotional resources.
Sometimes, he thought, there was an inclination among doctors to consider good patients the ones who don’t show their misery. It was emotionally demanding for a doctor to think of the dying patient as an individual. The easiest thing was to think of the patient as a biological specimen. But this would not work for the patient who, in Lindemann’s view, had one important task remaining.
The bereaved survivors of the Cocoanut Grove fire had needed to reconstruct their social ties to move past their grief. The patient facing death was faced with “constructing a collective surviving image of oneself which still will be there when one happens not to be there any more in the flesh,” Lindemann said.
Some patients might attempt to reconstruct their identity as they approached death by writing a book. Lindemann, by then, had a building named after him in Boston: The Lindemann Mental Health Center. Having a building named after you marked a good — if not widely available — way to ensure that your identity lived on.
In most cases that Lindemann observed, though, dying patients would simply speak to a nurse or friend or family member and tell that person about what kinds of things they had done over the course of their lives. This is what Lindemann called “the core of grieving, which, if it is done well, is apt to become an an admirable process — a fascinating process if one is lucky enough to witness it.”
Once the medic understands that this is the kind of care the patient needs, Lindemann told his doctors, “one can be surprised at how little actual time expenditure is needed to say the right word at the right time, and not too much.”
He thanked his medics for their attempts to save him, for their unusual degree of care. He had two more years and so much work to do.
