The “Mona Lisa” may have had a thyroid condition. The “Vitruvian Man” may have had a hernia in his groin. The “Gypsy Girl With Mandolin” may have had rheumatoid arthritis.
The distinguished subjects of art sometimes had diseases, and often, so did the artists themselves.
Their symptoms — whether of physical ailments or mental illnesses — are in their art. Rembrandt, who depicted himself in self-portraits with an off-centered eye, likely had stereoblindness, which impedes depth perception. Van Gogh, who painted with color combinations and an extreme productivity characteristic of epileptics, suffered seizures. Toulouse-Lautrec, who painted several portraits of desolate-looking women drinking at café tables, coped with alcoholism and absinthe abuse.
Increasingly, keen doctors are bringing their diagnostic tools to bodies of art to revitalize old conversations about canonical works. But the relationship is symbiotic: Art can also make physicians more in tune with their senses, improving their diagnostic acuity and ability to empathize.
The mutualism of art and medicine is a long-standing tradition that traces back to the Renaissance and even earlier. Andreas Vesalius, who is widely regarded as the father of anatomy, published his richly illustrated “De humani corporis fabrica” (“On the Fabric of the Human Body”) in 1543.
“Vesalius is making an intervention, both in the things that he's finding when he opens bodies, like correcting certain errors from Galen, but also a huge intervention and visual argument in how the work is presented,” Hannah Marcus, a history of science professor at Harvard, says.
Vesalius’s detailed depictions of the human body contrast greatly with the simple images favored by his predecessors. “It's like schematic images versus this beautiful person tearing their skin off in a classical landscape,” Marcus says.
Before photography and modern diagnostic technologies, art was one of the only mediums of the sciences, and aesthetic acumen was an integral aspect of any scientific profession. “Science is a visual pursuit,” Marcus says. “It's always about making a scientific rhetorical argument.”
The visual traditions established in astrology and taxonomy were among those carried over into medicine. Galileo Galilei’s acute illustrations of different angles of the moon attest to his artistic training. Botanists, whose work entailed finding herbal remedies, made critical calls in determining how to depict specimens in books and taxonomic keys. Leonhart Fuchs and Conrad Gessner, 16th century botanists, grappled with whether to illustrate plants exactly as is or as archetypal models.
“There'll be a flower that is depicted in all stages of its life,” Marcus says, alluding to many illustrations of plants with fruit, flowers, and buds all at once. “It is naturalistic, but not realistic, exactly.”
The respective roles of artist and scientist have been fluid over time, as seen at the centuries-old Warren Anatomical Museum, which houses the pathology and anatomy collections at Harvard Medical School’s Countway Library of Medicine.
“The physicians might actually have some artistic skill. And probably the artists have a very good understanding of the human body,” Dominic W. Hall, curator of the Warren Anatomical Museum, says. “They were at least living in each other’s mediums.”
Vesalius created these “gorgeous” and “groundbreaking” images in collaboration with Jan Steven van Calcar, according to Scott H. Podolsky, the Director of the Center for the History of Medicine, which contains the Warren Anatomical Museum. Podolsky is also a professor of global health and social medicine at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “That whole lineage of medical illustration goes through the 21st century,” he says.
The Warren Anatomical Museum has many modern examples of this timeless collaboration between artists and physicians. It holds a collection of watercolors jointly produced by Henry Jacob Bigelow, who was a professor of surgery at Harvard in the 19th century, and the artist Oscar Wallis. One watercolor depicts tongue ulcers, rendered with a pattern delicate as lace, and another a swollen star-shaped wound in deep purples and pinks.
Also held by the museum are the stately “Normann” and “Norma” — sculptures of the average American male and female — commissioned by surgeon Robert Latou Dickinson and realized by sculptor Abram Belskie in the mid-20th century. Hall says that “Normann” and “Norma” are not “straight clinical models,” but rather boast “artistic flourishes” and “neoclassical details.”
“We have these consequences of defining norms of maleness and femaleness which we might really engage with and perhaps deconstruct,” Podolsky says on “Normann” and “Norma.” “Like any type of art or any other piece of information, it requires reflection on the context for its original production and the context for how we would consider that today.”
Insofar as these artifacts invite the admiration of beauty and inspire reflection, then, the Warren Anatomical Museum is also an art museum of sorts.
Hall contrasts “Norma” and “Normann” to the casts — or “direct captures” — on display in the museum. Of the former, he says, “There’s a lot more sort of intellectual fuel happening there and lot more discussion of what you're making.”
By contrast, the latter is largely skill based. “There’s no artists there. There's just a physician making the cast or some sort of technician,” he says. “There's a skill, but it's not interpretive.”
But Podolsky thinks direct capture artifacts that “aspire to objectivity” may still remain art forms. “Thinking about radiology and various degrees of going through X-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs,” he says, “there's still certainly an interpretative frame.”
Shahram Khoshbin, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, is a doctor who applies his diagnostic skills to the canvas.
As a medical student at Johns Hopkins University, Khoshbin attended a talk by the late Harvard Medical School graduate and neurologist Norman Geschwind on hypergraphia — pathological productivity — as a symptom of epilepsy. Afterwards, Khoshbin approached Geschwind and claimed to know of a hypergraphic artist who did not suffer from seizures.
“He said, ‘You mean Van Gogh?’ I said, ‘How did you know?’” Khoshbin says. Geschwind told the young Khoshbin that Van Gogh was indeed epileptic.
Intrigued by Geschwind’s intuition, Khoshbin took it upon himself to find the medical records of Henri Gastaut, a neurologist and an epileptologist in Marseille. The records confirmed Geschwind’s conjecture.
But the evidence for Van Gogh’s epilepsy did not exist solely within his medical records. As it turned out, clues about the man’s disease were contained within his art itself.
Van Gogh’s work is distinguished by a tension between tertiary — or complementary — colors: purple and yellow, red and green, blue and orange. While working at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Khoshbin noticed that epileptic patients produced works characterized by similar color complementarity. The work of depressed patients, by contrast, featured only brown, black, or primary and secondary colors.
Khoshbin began to notice instances of epilepsy — generally read as the subject being possessed or in religious rapture — in theological artworks. He believes that Saint Teresa in Bernini’s “Ecstasy of Saint Teresa” is experiencing a seizure, as is the child in the lower right corner of Raphael's “Transfiguration.”
Not only does medicine reveal tremendous insights into past artwork and artists, but it also teaches valuable skills in medicinal practice.
The course PB 707: “Training the Eye: Improving the Art of Physical Diagnosis” at Harvard Medical School sharpens students’ diagnostic skills with art analysis and observation. Khoshbin co-teaches the course with Joel T. Katz, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
On one of several course trips to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, students studied paintings and lithographs of Toulouse-Lautrec. They examined a poster of Jane Avril, whose distinctive dancing style with jerky, involuntary movements in Parisian cabarets is now thought to be characteristic of Sydenham's chorea. The disease was once known as St. Vitus’ dance, after the patron saint of acting, dancing, and epileptics; devotees would dance before his statue on the day of his feast. While debilitating, disease can provide an original expressive style that arises from an alternative condition..
In one exercise, students analyzed the power dynamic between the two subjects of the double portrait “At the Café La Mie,” while they diagnosed patients based on the subtle changes of a chest X-ray in another. Thick fat pads under the heart suggested the patient uses steroidal medication; a filled aortic-pulmonary window suggests lymphoma.
The course teaches students visual literacy, a skill increasingly emphasized by the medical community. As Kitt Shaffer, vice-chair of the Education Department of Radiology at Boston Medical Center, and a former instructor of “Training the Eye,” says, “Sharpening your ability to look and understand what you're seeing and understand what your preconceived notions about what you're seeing, that's what visual thinking strategies is all about.”
Co-creator of “Training the Eye” Alexa Miller took this opportunity further by starting Arts Practica, a medical education consultancy that creates “arts-based experiential learning opportunities that enable leaders, practitioners, and teachers in healthcare to be more effective and mindful in uncertainty,” according to its site.
The Arts Practica homepage flashes with slides that read: “Observation is knowledge.” “Observation is respect.” “Observation is care.” “Observation changes minds.”
According to Miller, observation does indeed change minds. “We found that students who took the course improved — they made almost 40 percent more observations on clinical pictures,” she says. “Meaning they actually just saw more, they noticed more details.”
In 2008, these results were published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine under the paper title, “Formal Art Observation Training Improves Medical Students’ Visual Diagnostic Skills.”
“There is a difference between looking and observing,” Khoshbin says. Khoshbin uses the renowned example of Sherlock Holmes and Watson camping. “Holmes wakes [Watson] up in the middle of the night. And he says, ‘What do you see?’ Watson looks up and says, ‘Oh, I see the beauty of heavens and I see how God has created this universe, etc.’ And Holmes says, ‘Stupid! Somebody stole our tent.’” According to Khoshbin, observing is an active and dynamic synthesis of information to make inferences, while looking is more passive.
Musical training can also refine the observational skills demanded in clinical practice. Lisa M. Wong, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, invites reflection on its role in her book with a musically alliterative title, “Scales to Scalpels: Doctors Who Practice the Healing Arts of Music and Medicine.”
For two decades, Wong served as the president of the Longwood Symphony Orchestra, which comprises of medical professionals who play music for social change, or “community healing.”
She estimates that about 60 to 80 percent of her fellow clinicians had musical training as children, which she doesn’t find surprising. A developed pitch sense in musicians makes them better able to hear murmurs, she says. She even has a colleague whose oboe sensitized his fingers, making him defter and more dexterous at palpating tumors.
“When you're learning music… you're responsible for every single note in tune and in the right order and the right rhythm. So that is already a big requirement,” Wong says.
“But the right order is not enough,” she adds. “It's putting your heart and soul into it and putting your understanding and telling your story through it — that's where the music comes in. And it's the same when you grow up to be a doctor. You can look at lab values, you can look at the data sets[...] But if you don't apply it to the story of that patient, then you're not really caring for that patient.”
Though medical professionals are often imagined to be reading strictly X-rays and MRI scans, they need literacy in far more than imaging technologies. What often gets overlooked by outsiders is the skill to read the bodies and expressions of patients and their loved ones, because a diagnosis can bear a psychological burden as substantial as the disease’s symptoms.
Khoshbin emphasizes how good caregiving demands more than technical knowledge. “You could know every enzyme in the universe and every gene in the universe and try to go take care of somebody who's in pain and have no idea what that is, because pain is not just a gene or an enzyme. It's human condition.” In their capacity as caretakers, empathy and the ability to understand the experience of the patient is an invaluable skill to doctors.
David S. Jones, a professor in the History of Science and the director of the Arts and Humanities Initiative at Harvard Medical School, says that the humanities offer a “rigorous way to try to understand the human condition, through these various works of art motivated in part by disease or by death and dying.”
Literature is one of these media. “Studying literature — so in other words, thinking about tone, and language, and metaphor — is an excellent tool for sharpening our diagnostic abilities and also increasing our ability to listen to our patients and their stories,” Suzanne J. Koven, the writer in residence at Massachusetts General Hospital and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, says.
Susan E. Pories, an associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, borrows an example from Rita Charon, founder and executive director of the Program in Narrative Medicine at Columbia University. Pories says Charon uses Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” in a clinical context — namely, to elucidate the extreme “otherness” of some patient experiences. She explains how a patient who has a stroke is like Kafka’s protagonist, who wakes up as a cockroach.
The metamorphosis and stroke incite analogous upheavals in people’s lives. “[It’s] how your life can change overnight, and then how your relationship with everyone around you changes, when you can't communicate and when you can't take care of yourself,” Pories describes.
Karen L. Thornber, professor of Comparative Literature and of East Asian Languages and Civilizations who co-teaches the undergraduate course CB 58: “Case Studies in the Medical Humanities: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Experience of Illness,” agrees that the study of history, anthropology, and literature is indispensable in medicine.
Literature, as a social force that conveys the medical experience, can help deconstruct stigma, she says. It helps physicians understand variability in worldviews that feed into patient care and also fosters intimacy with the patient.
She notes that a salient book in her curriculum is “The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,” in which a Hmong refugee family’s understanding of epilepsy clashes with the suggested treatment of the physicians they encounter in California.
Pories encourages her medical students to think of their patients’ lives as narratives. Recently, she co-compiled essays produced in the “The Mentored Clinical Casebook Project” — which describes the experience of first-year medical school students who spend time with patients both in and out of clinical settings for a year — into a collection called “The Soul of a Patient: Lessons in Healing for Harvard Medical Students.”
Pories highlights “Mother’s Day” — about parents whose child is in a vegetative state — and “Heartbeats” — about a couple whose fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome — as two notable pieces.
“It's not just about the patient, but about the medical student making a relationship with the patient — or a relationship with the family — and learning so much about themselves in the process and growing so much from the beginning to the end of the year,” she says.
Artistic expression is a tremendous asset for physicians in supplying inspiration and insight, but the artistic process can also provide release. Jones notes how the arts can be integral in preventing burnout. “The pursuit of the arts is often an important part of individuals’ lives,” says Jones, “and some people mistakenly think that by going into medicine, they have to cut off that piece of themselves and focus just on their clinical work.”
“We find that even if we’ve had a very stressful day, or a day where surgery was difficult or there was a difficult patient, when we come back together again we're playing in harmony,” Wong says on the Longwood Symphony Orchestra. “So it's sort of a multifaceted way of healing.”
Pamela Chen, a Harvard Medical School student who took “Training the Eye,” agrees that medicine and the arts complement one another, but adds a caveat when it comes to seeing art too simply as a measure against burnout.
“I think a lot of people are artistic. And they want that kind of outlet,” Chen says. “I also think that while art can be cathartic and helpful for wellness, it also requires discipline and emotional input and it can be very frustrating in and of itself, trying to produce something and create something. So it's giving you a different outlet, but often one that requires a similar amount of training and discipline, if you want to have a high quality result.”
Art is remedial for Wong and Chen, but it can be healing for patients as well as for clinicians. Susan N. Nathan, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School, harnesses patient narrative as a tool for healing. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs program she founded, My Life, My Story, pairs veterans with students, interns, residents, and fellows from a health background — the largest group of whom are training the become physician assistants. The students interview the veterans about their life histories, taking only notes by hand, and synthesize them into a first-person story in the voice of the veteran.
“When the stories are read back to them, [the veterans] laugh and they cry, and it's really meaningful and emotional,” Nathan says. “It might have been stories that they've told a lot of times — but, somehow, now it's formal, and it's sort of reflected back through another person listening.”
Koven and her patients occasionally co-curated their stories in her monthly column, “In Practice,” which was published in the Boston Globe between 2011 and 2014. “Literally, a patient was dying — a woman exactly my age. And I asked her if there was anything I could do for her, and she said, ‘Yes, put me in the newspaper,’” Koven says.
“I came back the next day, and she said, ‘I decided what I want the column to be about. What I want it to be about is how important it is to have good palliative care at the end of life.’” The column was titled, “Message From a Dying Patient.”
“I received emails from all over the world, from people talking about how they were a palliative care doctor, or they had received palliative care, and how much it had meant to them,” says Koven. “And I forwarded all of these to her, and she just found that incredibly gratifying.”
Students who want to bridge the rift between medicine and the humanities have found spaces both at the College and the Medical School to do so, such as through the Medical Humanities Forum at the College and the Arts and Humanities Initiative at the Medical School.
“At Harvard Medical School, the Dean of Admissions says that if he's given two equal candidates, he'll always choose the musician over the non-musician for admission to medical school,” Wong says.
“They're more comfortable with ambiguity, more comfortable with that a piece of music can go fast or slow — and they're both right,” Wong says about prospective physicians with musical training. “And so they're more resilient and more flexible.”
From the undergraduate side, the Medical Humanities Forum encourages members to develop these complementary skills and traits that medical educators are looking for in applicants. Emily R. Gordon ’20, director of the forum, says the club invites medical professionals to come in as speakers and attest to the value of their alternative artistic experiences in their work.
“The club has a lot of different purposes. We have a blog where people can post pictures, photographs, art, poetry, news articles, that are related to medicine,” Gordon says.
At the Medical School, with funding from the Arts and Humanities Initiative, Chen co-founded the Longwood Chorus in 2017. Having been in the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum during all four years at the College, she describes it as “a vocal ensemble for healthcare students and professionals.” The group, which began with 12 members, has expanded to include nearly 50 students, physicians, therapists, and researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, according to Chen.
“There's a ton of other music opportunities for medical people at HMS,” Chen says — groups that raise money for charities and provide an exhaustive artistic community.
Illness, death, and dying can paradoxically be fruitful and live-giving. “The challenge of illness, disease, and suffering has been artistically productive for humans for centuries,” Jones says. “Many of the great works of literature, of painting, of music have been motivated in part by death, dying, disease — suffering of various sorts.”
Not only does the altered state of illness inspire artists, but their heightened consciousness of mortality can push them to create.
“There's a very long history of artists being transformed and influenced by events in their health,” Miller says. “And there's just story after story after story of an artist getting sick and — just out of a sense of their time being extremely limited — doing what matters most to them.”
Sickness can serve as both impetus and muse to art. It also shapes clinical skills and practices. As the line blurs between the humanities and medicine, it becomes hard to delineate one from the other.
“If you go into a hospital, there is the best of humanity and the worst of humanity and everything in between,” Miller says. “I think of medicine as pretty raw humanities work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representations of gay male characters on TV have been somewhat of a mixed bag — from largely applauded staples like “Will and Grace” to the decidedly mediocre “Glee.” The representation of disability faces a similar predicament, in which viewers are left with little more than a side character on “Breaking Bad” and… “Glee,” again. Both groups see little representation to begin with, and when they do, these portrayals risk falling into tropes that perpetuate harmful stereotypes. As such, there is good reason to be skeptical about a show that dares to tackle the intersection of these issues through the inclusion of a gay, disabled protagonist. Fortunately, “Special” quickly proves that these apprehensions are unwarranted. The show’s unconventionality, coupled with the experience that Ryan O’Connell brings to the table as a gay, disabled man himself make “Special” worth watching for people of all identities.
“Special” follows Ryan (Ryan O’Connell), a young man living with cerebral palsy and a particularly clingy mother. The show begins as Ryan embarks on two major life steps: starting his first real job and moving into his own place. Naturally, this “job” is actually an unpaid internship at the Buzzfeed-esque millennial media source “Eggwoke,” which prioritizes views over integrity of their articles. In other words, Ryan’s boss Olivia (Marla Mindelle) loves having her employees detail superficial “confessionals” about their lives and insecurities as long as it leads to more clicks. This is exemplified within moments of Olivia’s first introduction, when she asks Ryan’s new friend Kim (Punam Patel), “Can you just write another post about loving your curves, or whatever?”
Fortunately, Ryan and Kim’s commiseration over their boss’s shallowness only serves to strengthen their bond as friends and coworkers. Unfortunately, however, this relationship is threatened by a lack of honesty. Because he does not want to deal with stigmas surrounding cerebral palsy, Ryan devises a story in which his limp and idiosyncratic mannerisms are simply the result of a recent car accident. This conflict — between the desire to live one’s truth and the need to maintain appearances — is what drives much of the intrigue of this first season. Beyond this theme, however, “Special” does not have much of an overarching plot and, in effect, each episode feels somewhat self-contained. This, combined with an unconventional runtime — each of the eight episodes is only about 15 minutes long — makes “Special” feel like a collection of YouTube videos more than a Netflix series. Since the main purpose of the show is to depart from the norm, however, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
This desire to stand apart is exactly why the show excels. “Special” takes just about every gay trope in the book and throws it out, which is refreshing in a world where gay men are only ever given the same three plotlines. Though Ryan exhibits stereotypically feminine mannerisms and is certainly a mama’s boy, these characteristics are framed as simply part of who he is rather than an inevitable result of his sexuality. Furthermore, Ryan does not have to go through an arc of struggling with his sexuality like many other characters do. From the beginning of the show, Ryan knows he is gay, and he is open about his sexuality to his mother and coworkers. By shifting focus away from the more exploratory gay storyline, the show is able to focus on more enjoyably relatable struggles like dealing with Grindr hookups and crushing on a friend who’s in a relationship.
Perhaps even more refreshing is this show’s portrayal of disability. “Special” is unique in its unambiguous depiction of Ryan’s cerebral palsy as not only present, but front and center to his life. Like his sexuality, Ryan’s disability is shown not as a tragedy, but a part of who he is. There are certainly struggles and stigmas that come with it, but this does not mean it has to be Ryan’s focus 100 percent of the time. The show also lampshades the cliché views surrounding disability with an exchange between Ryan and his mom: “Your disability is part of you, it’s what makes you — ” to which Ryan interrupts, “Special, I know. And I should embrace it, I know.”
Interestingly, disability seems to take the place of one of the typical gay storylines that “Special” otherwise avoids. Ryan’s biggest secret is not his sexuality, but the true nature of his disability. Ryan’s big “coming out” scene, then, entails his telling the office about his cerebral palsy. It turns out that most people don’t care. Kim, the only one who really does, is mostly just upset that Ryan has “betrayed” her by not being honest about who he is. While this sort of reaction has been seen a million times in sexuality storylines, it is refreshing to see it applied to another situation. It is also indicative of progress in depictions of disability. This progress is further cemented in the last two episodes when the oft-overlooked theme of internalized ableism is brought up, sending Ryan into a journey of self-love and improvement.
The most surprising twist in “Special,” however, is the realization that the show is not all about Ryan. The third episode features the first scene that does not include Ryan at all. In which, his mother Karen (Jessica Hecht) takes the spotlight as she begins flirting with the new silver fox neighbor. From then on, Karen consistently rises in prominence. In fact, the fifth episode (“Vagina Momologues”) sees Karen as the primary focus, with Ryan only making a cursory appearance. Karen’s storyline centers around her need to find a life outside of her son, as well as her budding romance with Phil (Patrick Fabian). Interestingly, this relationship between Karen and Phil is the primary love story of the show, which is refreshing to see in an industry that does not typically allow women in their 50’s to have any semblance of sexual desires.
Karen is one of the most complex characters that can be seen on TV today. Unfortunately, this does not entirely make up for the complete predictability of Ryan’s boss Olivia, who is essentially a composite of every single millennial stereotype, turned up to eleven. If there’s any other reason to be wary of “Special,” it is a lack of consistency in the comedy department. There are times in which it feels like the show is not quite sure whether it’s a drama or a comedy, and these long gaps without particularly funny moments can feel quite awkward. Still, there are far more reasons to hold out hope. “Special” stands out at every chance it gets — the show’s abandonment of conventions around runtime, sexuality, disability, and motherhood makes each episode feel especially refreshing, and leaves the viewer wanting more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diversity of thought cannot exist on campus if nobody is listening.
One of the goals of Harvard’s Institute of Politics is to bring a variety of political opinions into campus conversations. Through events held at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum and the visiting fellows’ study groups, students are able to learn about perspectives on major political issues from the left, right, and center.
This is a seemingly noble cause, especially as many Americans grow wary of the sanctity of free speech on college campuses. They fear that non-liberal thought will lose its place in higher education, cranking out a generation of students with uniform views. Just last week, many voiced concerns about Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53 and his disinvitation to speak at Concordia Liberal Arts College in Canada due to his outspoken conservative views.
No matter how many ideologically diverse events are held for students, turnout is low if speakers and hosts are not promoting a liberal agenda. Is this truly an inclusive environment? Though conservative students and guests continue to be invited to speak out, they are not, however, truly a part of the mainstream conversations on campus. Organizations like the IOP must continue to present a variety of speakers and ideologies to at least offer the opportunity of exposure to different views. But their efforts are fruitless if we refuse to listen and engage. The opportunities for inclusion are here — the culture is not.
A large contingent of Americans are especially concerned about a perceived lack of free speech in higher education, as demonstrated by President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to take away certain funding conditional on the status of free speech on campuses. College campuses are no strangers to conservative criticism regarding a lack of intellectual diversity. Many students now demand increased openness on college campuses, and campuses struggle to balance free speech with inclusivity. Some institutions like the IOP are actively addressing these criticisms and trying to create a more open dialogue on campuses. In this way, the IOP is doing its part by hosting an array of speakers from all different ideological, cultural, and sexual backgrounds.
But are we doing our part?
Since I became involved in the Fellows and Study Groups program, I have noticed that groups headed by conservative fellows receive only a fraction of the attendance as groups led by liberals. U.S. Representatives Carlos L. Curbelo (R-Fla.) Barbara J. Comstock (R-Va.) have to fight for attendance at their groups, while more liberal fellows easily draw a crowd. And content is certainly not the issue: Curbelo, for example, often covers immigration and climate change reform, both popular issues of discussion on college campuses. For example, University President Lawrence S. Bacow recently wrote a letter in support of pro-DACA regulation while just last week, many Harvard students participated in the Divest Harvard rally related to climate change.
Even more concerning is the fact that Curbelo advocates for a progressive approach to climate change, seeking government leadership to implement sustainable policies like carbon taxes. As a result, I believe that his groups are not as well attended because he is branded as a conservative, not because of the content his group discusses.
The opportunity is there for us. Conservative speakers are welcomed on campus and their narratives are publicized by the IOP. However, we are generally not listening. And if we are not listening, is there truly a culture acceptance, inclusion, and open dialogue on campus?
As a moderately conservative individual, I never feel as if I cannot speak up in class or discussions. I never feel that groups representing my views are absent. And I never feel ostracized for my beliefs by my peers. I just feel ignored.
There is a culture on campus that allows all beliefs to be heard but legitimizes few. Think about your token “Republican friend.” That classmate that means well but “has no idea what they’re talking about.” Someone you hang out with and work with but do not intellectually engage with.
How much do their opinions really count, no matter how many platforms they are given to express them?
Students are missing an opportunity to broaden their views and become acquainted with the views they will have to encounter when they leave the Harvard bubble. Speech is not being restricted; rather, conservative voices are being drowned out of the dialogue, our view of the world. And what’s more, conservative students end up feeling powerless in their classes, clubs, and communities.
So how do we fix this? How do we encourage true diversity of thought? How do we get attendance up at Republican fellows’ meetings?
The answer lies in the classroom.
Yes, we have our Mansfields and our Jeffrey A. Mirons, but who else? As a Government concentrator, I am conditioned to expect a liberal curriculum and prepare myself for the uphill ideological battle I will have to face, especially when most teaching fellows and professors identify as liberal. It is easy enough to participate in sections and lectures with a traditionally liberal response, something I have done. It is not, however, easy to offer conservative answers. You will not get the nods and snaps of approval from your peers, and you will immediately be countered. It’s good to hear other perspectives but challenging and limiting to feel constantly invalidated.
How will students listen to their ideological counterparts if the people that teach us legitimize only one side? We need more people in Harvard’s positions of power — department heads, course heads, and the like — who legitimize conservative and libertarian views. Bringing the conservative and libertarian ideologies into the mainstream of academia will not only create a better dialogue between diverse groups but will also decrease hostility. As conservatives and their constituents feel more welcomed, their hostility to college culture as a whole will diminish.
Let’s celebrate the political opportunities available to all of us, but let’s also make sure they make an equal impact on the community and its culture. We can talk as much as we want — but who’s listening?

As the semester winds down, reading period comes with its anguishes but also its particular pleasures. Formal season, study breaks, and College-wide events dot our calendars for the next few days. Unfortunately, these events meant to reinvigorate the student body come with a cost — and that cost has recently risen to unprecedented heights.
Last year, students saw a more than 150 percent hike in the Student Activities Fee — an optional sum rolled into the enrollment costs for Harvard undergraduates — raising the fee from $75 to $200. At the same time, the Office of Student Life — which had formerly been in charge of decide how to allocate these fees  — has been incorporated into the newly formed Dean of Students Office. This body now administers these funds, which are used to support student-led House Committees, programs organized by the College Events Board, and student extracurricular organizations through Undergraduate Council grants.
While we support efforts to promote programming and opportunities for student collective enjoyment, we continue to be troubled by the optionality of the fee, as well as the limited extent to which the University publicizes it.
As it stands, students are not directly informed about the fee’s optionality (aside from its mention in the College’s student handbook). That poses the potential for problematic imbalances between those who ultimately takes advantage of this loophole and those who would perhaps be most benefited by it. Why some students skip the fee, while many students on financial aid may go on paying it, strikes us as largely counterintuitive. Especially as the number of students who opt out has risen, we puzzle over why the fee hasn’t been standardized.
Nevertheless — despite our concerns — the fee is ultimately optional. Given that fact, we hope the College seeks to better publicize future changes in the fee, as well as the process by which students can opt out. Students should have the knowledge and agency to understand these fees and decide for themselves if they would like to contribute to these funds. Two hundred dollars should not be yet another hidden bonus in the labyrinth that enrollment costs already are.
Moreover, as the DSO now takes charge of these funds, we urge them to listen to student input and preferences in their dispersal. Though a large portion of the fees eventually fall under the purview of student-run organizations like the UC and CEB, the decisions made at the DSO are the first step in this process. And before distribution begins, the DSO should be taking into account what organizations and programs best serve student interests. Events such as Yardfest, HoCo activities, and formals are only more enjoyable if they are planned and funded with a better understanding of student interests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universities, like most institutions, are built upon choices. Entrenched choices, perhaps, seemingly inevitable choices, but choices nonetheless. We choose, for example, to neglect our limitations, to ally with hegemonic power, to marshal our truth-seeking as absolution from moral duty.
But these are choices we do not have to make: We can, in fact, choose otherwise. We can choose to confront our scholarship’s complicity, to lead against injustice, to accept responsibility to those around us. We can choose to understand that inaction, too, is a form of action; that refusal to choose, too, is a choice. We can always choose otherwise.
The work we do here, then, need not be useless to our goal of building new futures. This semester, I have argued as much, offering both critique and possibility for modern universities. I have noted that I undertake this inquiry as scholar-activist and activist-scholar, believing in the profound power of ideas to serve justice — but only if they, and the institutions that produce them, are designed with justice in mind, too.
So how might we take on this project — of (re)envisioning, (re)designing, (re)building our choices? In past columns, I have discussed what we need to change. Today, I am interested in closing this series with how we — workers, students, administrators, faculty — are going to change it.
For some, this is an old question. Take the 2016 Harvard University Dining Services strike, for example, in which collective action transformed this University and set labor justice precedent that has had ripples nationwide. Today, workers and allies demand moral courage elsewhere, insisting on the prioritizing justice at this institution. Unions here have always been at the forefront of demanding better, serving as critical guides and teachers for others along the way.
Perhaps it is time for faculty to use this playbook, too. In response to recent trends, some have called scholars to form unions or other “inter- and transdisciplinary solidarit[ies]” with real power to confront University politics and demand the tenure levels (and diversity) necessary for faculty independence. Faculty members can no longer allow expansive University administration free rein over University politics, whether via actual administrative power or faculty deference to administrative suggestion. Such closed-doors governance keeps us from being courageous in pursuit of moral visions.
This pursuit requires collective dissent, such as that exercised by Yale’s ethnic studies scholars, rather than individual efforts that leave dissenting faculty members vulnerable to reprimand and removal. It requires alliances that precede university crises, not just respond to them. Further, as I have suggested, this reclamation of power cannot serve faculty alone — it must also come with accountability structures that look beyond the University, prioritizing collective ownership rather than check-box tokenization.
Administrators, meanwhile, must recognize that, overwhelmingly, they enable a broken system. They must realize that facilitating student growth without accountability is not, in itself, a radical act; that celebrating student progressivism does not prove their own (especially when students face administrative roadblocks at every turn). Administrators, too, are actors; there is work that they can do in their own positions, alliances they can form that give them power beyond their reporting relationships to their employers and to the bottom line.
Which leaves us, of course, with students. Students must, as always, serve as engines of change, using our privilege at elite universities to demand accountability beyond ourselves. But in doing so, we must be precise, locating problems in their proper place. We must temper our selfish logic of “existence as resistance” — of individual flourishing in broken systems as resistance to them — and confront how this logic renders us complicit in domination. We must recognize that liberal multiculturalism’s inclusivity rhetoric cannot secure the justice we seek, because the goal has never been increasing student diversity, or even including all students upon matriculation. It has always been dismantling the structures that limited that diversity in the first place.
This individualistic focus on student struggle and success enables “the cultivation of sympathy over the creation of social justice,” enables student-facing programming to substitute for real accountability for institutional harm. This is not to say that student pain is not real, but it is to say that the problem with elite universities is not, primarily, that they cause (relatively privileged) students pain. The problem is that they support incarceration, war, environmental destruction. The solution to that is not more inclusive programming. It is more radical politics —  a politics that, in pursuing a more just institution, builds a more inclusive one in the process.
This is true across the University. We need a new language to express the difficulty and urgency of this work, one that moves beyond ourselves to the world(s) we want to build. We need new alliances and energies and solidarities, new tools to fashion futures. We — students, workers, administrators, faculty — must hold and be held accountable to realizing transgressive politics at the University and beyond it, not as saviors but as partners in collective worldbuilding.
It is tempting to see such worldbuilding as unthinkable, to see modern universities as inevitably hegemonic forces that cannot be faced. But the truth is, it is our choices that open and close horizons, offer and revoke possibilities. Behind these choices are a thousand possibilities, a thousand ways we can produce and share and steward knowledge in and for this world.
We can see them, if we have the courage to try.
We can see them, if we choose.

A Harvard and MIT graduate who is heavily invested in the Canadian legal cannabis market donated a combined $9 million dollars to Harvard and MIT to fund neurobiology research on the plant.
The donation, given by Charles R. Broderick, is the largest independent donation ever made to fund biological study of cannabinoids on the brain and behavior. The donation will fund research on the medical uses of cannabis to create treatments and better inform societal and political attitudes towards medical cannabis. Harvard Medical School professors Bruce P. Bean ’73 and Wade G. Regehr will lead Harvard’s half of the research.
Broderick said he decided to donate the funds because he saw a dearth in cannabis-related research.
“There wasn’t as much research on cannabis from the lack of funding and social taboos around it,” Broderick said. “I realized I could take personal leadership in helping to kickstart this.”
Broderick said efforts to pass legislation related to cannabis have often been hindered because there has been little authoritative research conducted on its medical use.
“A lot of the times in the policy discussion that has been occurring around the world, there is this desire to fall back to science to help illuminate the answers, and when they would go back to illuminate the answers they were finding that there wasn't very much research,” Broderick said.
The donation was made following roughly six months of conversation between Broderick and Harvard scientists to explore what kinds of research might be stimulated by funding in this area, according to Bean.
Bean said in an interview that the goal of the donation will be to encourage new research in labs with expertise on cannabinoids, and to bring young researchers and postdoctoral fellows to this research field.
“The idea with the gift will be to call for applications from people around Harvard University who may be interested in doing research connected with cannabinoids,” he said.
Bean also said the donation is meant to facilitate collaboration between labs that may work in related fields but do not currently specifically focus on cannabinoids.
Some of the funds will be directed toward studying the use of cannabinoids to treat epilepsy. In this field, Bean works alongside professors Elizabeth A. Thiele and Gary I. Yellen ’79.
Broderick said new research on cannabinoids will help expand medical horizons.
“We have to be happy to address this lack of research as soon as we are able to,” Broderick said. “If I could help lead these two institutions to recognizing that and working on the problem, then I've got a good thing I think for all of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 60 Government department affiliates met Thursday to discuss a report released by a departmental committee tasked with analyzing internal climate that recommended a slate of policies to improve sexual harassment reporting and prevention procedures.
That report, released Tuesday, called for the department to “urgently” take steps to “foster trust, open up channels of communication, and create a safer and more inclusive workplace.” It offered 19 major recommendations, including the authorization of two new faculty searches and the creation of a faculty Title IX liaison position within the department. The committee’s recommendations are not final, and the full Government department faculty must vote to approve the proposals.
The department formed the Committee on Climate Change in March 2018 after more than 20 women came forward to accuse Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez of instances of sexual misconduct spanning multiple decades.
Attendees at Thursday's meeting largely supported the committee’s proposed changes to the department, according to Government Professor and Climate Committee Chair Steven R. Levitsky in an interview after the off-the-record town hall.
Nonetheless, many students voiced concerns about items they felt were missing from the report and the “sustainability” of the recommendations, according to Levitsky. Multiple students declined to discuss the concerns they raised at the meeting.
“I think there was a fair amount of support for the initiatives in the final report, but a bunch of pretty valid concerns that it would be taken up seriously, that it would be sufficiently staffed, these reforms would endure over time,” Levitsky said. “And there was a legitimate concern among many students that rules on paper and initiatives on paper don’t change behavior and culture in practice.”
“There’s only so much that a report can change,” he added.
Government graduate student Andrew M. Leber said he asked during the town hall whether the department could encourage faculty members to fill the various roles outlined in the report’s recommendations — such as that of a Title IX liaison — by providing them with certain “professional incentives” such as a reduced teaching load.
Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild responded that the department currently struggles to fill teaching positions for all of its classes, she wrote in an email after the town hall.
"We’re extremely reluctant to give more course time off because we are very short on both undergraduate and graduate courses,” she said.
She added she would welcome any other incentives the administration could provide.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Emeritus Robert D. Putnam said in an interview after the event that he pointed out at the town hall that the department has previously tried to enact similar reforms. When Putnam served as chair of the department in the 1980s, the department faced challenges combating instances of faculty sexual misconduct, but because of poor institutional memory, the changes it made “didn’t stick.”
“For the next four or five years, the events of the last year will be burned into the minds of people,” Putnam said. “But it won’t last for 35 years if reforms don’t pay more attention to sustainability.”

A pilot pre-matriculation program at Harvard Law School designed to prepare incoming students from varying academic and professional backgrounds for their programs’ academic rigor will become an annual part of law students’ experiences.
Introduced in summer 2018, the “Zero-L” program is a 10-hour long online course that covers the necessary academic grounding for law degrees including topics like the stages of civil litigation, how to read a legal case, and how to use the Socratic method — the Law School’s teaching style that often includes cold calling. Though the program is now permanent, it will be reformed as needed to adapt to incoming students’ changing needs.
Dean John F. Manning ’82 proposed the initiative and said he was inspired to create the Zero-L program based on his own experience as a student at the Law School. Manning — who was a first-generation college and law school student — said he often felt “completely clueless,” and wanted to ensure students from all backgrounds started with the same foundational legal knowledge when they matriculated. The program’s title reflects the common term for law school students who are identified as 1Ls, 2Ls, or 3Ls, depending on their class year.
Manning appointed a committee led by Professor I. Glenn Cohen to oversee the program’s implementation. Cohen said his academic and personal background put him in a good position to create something suited for incoming Law School students.
“I've taught an online course before on reproductive technology genetics I made with HarvardX a few years ago, so I’m very familiar with it,” Cohen said, in reference to one of the University’s online learning platforms. “I am the son of two high school dropouts, and I am a Canadian, so I came to Harvard Law School really with little background in what it is lawyers do and what the law does.”
Based on the student feedback survey conducted with the Associate Dean for Strategic Initiatives and Admissions Jessica L. Soban ’02, Cohen said that the first iteration of the Zero-L program was well received by students.
“Our Dean made a word cloud of the survey responses,” Cohen said. “The top two responses in the word cloud were ‘excited’ and ‘prepared.’ Those were the biggest words and that's exactly what we wanted.”
Based on feedback, including focus groups and meeting with individual students, Cohen said that further reforms to the program will be implemented for “Version 2.0.” Planned changes include releasing the program earlier in the summer and adding more comprehensive content, including interviews with prominent professors.
“In terms of feedback there are things we learned about when we released it and we released it on Aug. 1 last time, thinking that we didn't want to cut in too much into student summers,” Cohen said. “The feedback we got was that that might be a little bit late and that people would have preferred to have access earlier. So for the next go round we are trying to get it out the door on July 1.”
Cohen also said that “interviews of luminaries” will be offered to provide further context on contemporary legal topics in the programs’ next iteration.
“Annette Gordon-Reed is talking about legal history; Holger Spamann who is an economist and empiricist is talking about law and economics; and Cass Sunstein who has won about every prize that ever exists is talking about law and behavioral sciences,” Cohen said.
Cohen said students are excited about the program and that Zero-L provides value beyond just another academic assignment.
“We are pumped about it, and our students are pumped about it. We showed a trailer during admissions and argue this is more than being one more piece of homework to do before law school,” Cohen said. “This is a value added that Harvard can provide students and is another great reason to come to this institution.”

University President Lawrence S. Bacow awarded Tracy K. Smith ’94 — the current poet laureate of the United States — the 2019 Harvard Arts Medal to kick off the annual Harvard Arts First Festival.
The medal is awarded annually to alumni of Harvard or Radcliffe for their achievements in the arts. Past recipients include Margaret E. Atwood ’62 and Matt P. Damon ’92. The University announced in March that Smith — a former Crimson editor — would receive the award, in conjunction with her selection as the 25th reunion chief marshal.
Bacow officially granted the award to Smith at the end of an event during which she read excerpts of her poems and answered students’ questions about her work and career. Bacow said it was a “special honor” to grant Smith the accolade — the first Harvard Arts Medal he has granted in his presidential tenure.
“The privilege of returning to Harvard’s campus to be recognized as belonging to this place means the world to me,” Smith said after receiving the medal.
In her brief remarks, Smith also discussed her view of poetry’s importance in today’s society.
“I place enormous faith in the reading and writing of poetry as tools for repairing our human culture in the 21st century,” she said.
Earlier in the event, Smith read several of her award-winning poems and reflected on them during a conversation with Callie Crossley, a radio show host at local Boston public radio station WGBH.
Smith read an excerpt from her poem titled “I will tell you the truth about this, I will tell you all about about it” — a piece comprising letters written by African American soldiers and their families during the Civil War.
“I think of it as this really beautiful chorus of American voices that have gone underheard but that tell an incredibly relevant piece of the American story,” Smith said.
Students who attended the event asked Smith questions about her identity as a female poet of color, her role as the country’s poet laureate, and the autobiographical aspects of her work. In response, Smith discussed her writing process.
“I put the audience — sorry — last,” Smith said, drawing laughter. “It’s that hard conversation with myself that I’m trying to have when I’m writing a poem and other people aren’t invited to that.”
Smith also said her poetry has changed in tone as she has moved around the country. She has ties to several different states, including California, New York, and Alabama. Smith is now a professor in the humanities at Princeton University and directs the school’s creative writing program.
“I think poetry is something that allows me to feel more anchored to whatever place I’m in,” Smith said.
As Harvard’s 25th reunion chief marshal, Smith will lead the 368th iteration of Harvard’s Commencement exercises. This year’s exercises will take place in Tercentenary Theatre on May 30. German Chancellor Angela D. Merkel is scheduled to deliver the principal address at the ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council issued a statement Thursday supporting Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20, an activist who was involved in a confrontation with a Winthrop House tutor last month.
The statement, which passed by an online vote late Wednesday night 20-9, denounced the tutor’s response to the incident and issued a number of demands, including a public response from College administrators and the dissemination of the results of the College’s climate review of Winthrop.
Mudannayake, who is also a Crimson design editor, and Winthrop tutor Carl L. Miller filed conflicting reports with Harvard University Police after a conflict in the Winthrop dining hall on Apr. 3. Mudannayake said she approached Miller after she believed he had taken photos and videos of her; Miller said Mudannayake harassed and provoked him and his family while they ate dinner.
Days later, Miller’s lawyer George J. Leontire sent an email to Harvard administrators revealing that Miller planned to file a Title IX complaint about the incident. Leontire later said Miller no longer planned to file a Title IX complaint.
“[T]hreatening to file a Title IX complaint against a student for voicing concerns is an unprofessional abuse of power,” the UC’s statement reads. “We therefore condemn all blatant acts of bullying and intimidation enacted upon undergraduate students, especially by House staff.”
Miller did not respond to a request for comment.
The April confrontation between Mudannayake and Miller came amidst growing tensions on campus over Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent film producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault — a tension the council’s statement references. Mudannayake herself has recently made headlines for her activism in calling on Sullivan to step down from his faculty dean position due to his decision to represent Weinstein.
“This altercation comes after much controversy surrounding Dean Sullivan’s decision to represent Harvey Weinstein,” the statement reads. “At a time when survivors may feel particularly voiceless, the Winthrop House administration should be committing its significant influence to ensuring that survivors are supported in their academic and residential lives.”
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment.
The statement calls the College to take many “immediate” actions, including additional research into how the climate in Winthrop compares to those of other houses, greater protections for student activists, and a public response from College administrators.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement that the College is working to gather more information regarding the Winthrop situation.
“The College is committed to ensuring that our students receive the best possible support in their residential communities,” Goldman wrote. “As Dean Khurana stated in his recent e-mail to students, we are working with the Office of Institutional Research to gather additional information from the Winthrop community. This information will provide both a clearer picture of what is happening in the House and will inform decisions on how best to address concerns that have been identified.”
Eliot House representatives Max A. Gillmer ’21, Sean Sullivan ’20, and Jakob L. Gilbert ’21 co-sponsored the statement along with Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21. While UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 was originally also a co-sponsor of the statement, she was unable to act as a co-sponsor after the UC ruled the president and vice president can no longer vote or sponsor legislation at its meeting Sunday.
The sponsors had attempted to pass the statement through the Council multiple times before it finally passed on Wednesday. The UC first failed to pass the statement at its Apr. 14 general meeting. When the representatives presented the legislation as new business at the Council’s next meeting on Apr. 21, representatives voted not to reconsider the statement.
The sponsors presented the statement for a third time at its meeting last Sunday, but the UC did not have enough time to reconsider the statement. Though the Council disallowed online voting earlier this semester, representatives voted to suspend regular rules and procedures at its meeting Sunday to allow representatives to vote online through Wednesday.
Representatives did not debate the legislation at their Sunday meeting. When the sponsors originally proposed the statement at the Apr. 14 meeting, some representatives said they refused to support the statement before hearing Miller’s perspectives on the issue. Other representatives countered that Miller has already expressed his side of the story through The Crimson.
Because the statement was passed on Wednesday under the UC’s Tier 2 publicity — which requires the statement’s inclusion in a Facebook post and in the UC’s weekly newsletter — the legislation only needed a majority of voting members to pass. Tier 1 publicity, which involves an immediate emailed announcement to students, requires a three-quarters vote to pass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Whenever he calls a play in Hawaiian, I always laugh to myself knowing that no one else knows the play that we’re going to run," freshman Ryan Hong said. "It’s our little secret.”
Born less than a day apart in the same hospital in Hawaii, Harvard freshmen Buddy Scott and Hong have always been side by side. From preschool and kindergarten through their senior year of high school, the two had always had one another. In fact, the two even manage to occasionally finish each other’s thoughts and sentences.
“So, we were born in the same hospital at basically the same time,” begins Hong. “We went to preschool together at Central Union and then at Punahou…”
“…we started in kindergarten together and went there for twelve years,” continues Scott. “I left my senior year but still we remained close and we started playing on the same club volleyball team in sixth grade and we were on the school team together the whole time essentially. It’s just ridiculous to think that now we’re here…”
“… we’ve come full circle…”
“…5000 miles away and still on the same team.”
The two volleyball players even began playing volleyball around the same time. For Scott, basketball and baseball were his favorite sports as a young child. However, by fifth grade, he had already played in the national championships. From there, joining the school and local club volleyball team was a natural decision.
Likewise, Hong’s upbringing introduced a variety of sports from a young age.
“Growing up, both of my older brothers had played football, basketball, and soccer,” Hong said. “So, I always thought I would end up playing one of those three sports. However, in fifth grade, my mom took me to a volleyball practice with a club team. At first, I really did not want to try it at all, but when I did, I absolutely fell in love with it.”
Whereas some childhood friendships remain only in memory, the two have continued to stay linked together, especially through Harvard.
“I might’ve called you or texted you [when I got into Harvard],” recalls Hong.
“I was super happy for [Ryan], but it took a while to really process it,” replies Scott.
“It wasn’t until we got here and saw each other that it felt real,” Hong said. “And honestly it has been amazing. I feel like I’ve gotten to know Buddy on a deeper and more genuine level than ever before.”
“For sure,” Scott adds. “Getting to live in Cambridge and experience college together on the same volleyball team has been a once in a lifetime experience. It’s weird that even though I’ve known him my entire life, we’ve bonded a lot more in the past year than ever before.”
Even the teammates’ parents are invested in the relationship.
“During senior year, my mom definitely asked, ‘Hey has Ryan heard back from Harvard?’” remembers Scott. “She was really excited when he eventually got in. I think my parents really like the idea that at the end of the day, five thousand miles away, I always have Ryan to turn to. Someone who I’ve known my entire life and I feel super comfortable with.”
“My parents were psyched when we heard that Buddy had gotten into Harvard,” responded Hong. “And then when I got into Harvard they were like ‘Oh my god! This really is full circle!’ They realized that we would be playing on the same team in the same school.”
On the court, the two remain inseparable. When asked whether they had ever played against each other, Scott was quick to respond no. However, Hong had remembered that they indeed played against each other once in seventh grade. Scott playfully conceded, that yes, in seventh grade intermediate volleyball, the two had competed against each other at Punahou.
“We never really played against each other formally; it would always be in practice,” clarified Hong. “Except in club volleyball. In club volleyball, when he played for a club in California, I played for a local team and we both were competitive teams that went head to head in national tournaments. It was so weird to see Buddy on the other side of the court. There’s just some Hawaiian kid I’ve known my entire life on the other side playing for a California team. But it was good competition.”
The two also have experienced drastic changes in volleyball culture in the past year.
“Not only is women’s volleyball big, but also men’s [volleyball],” Hong said. “[In Hawaii], it starts off playing in the grass and on the beach and then eventually to indoor play. That’s huge back at home. To play recreationally is bigger in Hawaii than in other places where people would normally play basketball. There’s a lot more support for volleyball in Hawaii and the culture has nurtured players to end up at the Olympics and high-level college teams. I remember in our high school, we’d have upwards of 800 people out for a game.”
“So many more people care about volleyball because the University of Hawaii is such a big thing there,” adds Scott. “Volleyball is really a big sport there. Regularly there will be 5000 to 10,000 people for a game; the stands will be completely packed. Hawaii is where beach volleyball started and there have been so many Olympians from Hawaii. It’s just a huge culture there.”
However, the two hope to grow and thrive in the northeast, both on the court and off. Both lauded the team and Harvard for presenting them with opportunities and challenges of a lifetime, noting that without one another, college would certainly be different.
“Because we spend so much time together, it’s nice to be able to talk to [Buddy] on the court, in the locker room, or out around campus about things at home or stories when we were younger,” concludes Hong. “It’s a unique bond and I’m just happy to be at Harvard here with him.”
