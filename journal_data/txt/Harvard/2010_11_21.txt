After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Modern America applauds individualism, praising the people who work their way to the top. However, such values hold far less weight for the Yoruba people of Nigeria portrayed in Wole Soyinka’s 1976 play, “Death and the King’s Horseman.” For them duty to the community is what matters the most. The Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club (HRDC) has taken on this challenging dichotomy between the individual and the collective with a keen and nuanced eye, resulting in a compelling production.
Directed by Abigail F. Schoenberg ’12, “Death and the King’s Horseman,” ran through Saturday November 20. The play is set in Nigeria in 1944, when it was still a British colony. A powerful Yoruba king has just died, and according to tradition, his chief horseman Elesin (Yi Jun Tan ’13) must commit ritual suicide and accompany his lord into the afterlife or risk a curse on the whole community. However, he is interrupted by Simon Pilkings, (Allen J. MacLeod ’14) the local British official, who views the practice as barbaric. The results of this intervention are catastrophic, as the community lays the blame for this failure on Elesin as well as the British authorities.
The play could have easily become a heavy-handed commentary on race and colonialism. In an attempt to avoid this, casting for the play is colorblind.
This did not in any way, however, detract from the production, which boasts impressive performances all around. Nevertheless, several actors rise above the high bar set by their fellow cast members and give some truly memorable performances. Tan is compelling as Elesin, expertly handling his character’s conflicting sense of duty and love of life. He portrays a man caught between his people’s needs and his individual desires with commendable grace and subtlety.
Rachel V. Byrd ’13 also gives an exceptional performance as Iyaloja, one of the head women in the community, a voice of Yoruba collectivism and societal duty. She portrays her character’s multifaceted personality with great depth and clarity, turning a character that could have easily become secondary role into a stand-out.
The best performance, however, is by MacLeod. He depicts Simon as an aloof western official who slowly gains a realization of the consequences of his ethnocentrism. In every scene he inches down this trajectory until by the end his character has become almost unrecognizable. This transition is not easy to express and MacLeod goes above and beyond the demands of the script. It requires a thoughtful approach to the character and some serious risk taking.
The direction of Schoenberg was just as inspired. It is not easy to play to an audience on three sides, and still have the actors engage with everyone. But with some inventive uses of the balconies above the seats and attention to detail in staging, the Loeb Ex became an intimate environment without privileging one section over the other. Additionally, the choice to creatively juxtapose some of the audience’s seating alongside merchants working on stage served to blend audience and actors.
The set design by Madelynne A. Hays ’13 complemented the already thoughtful production. The base of the set consisted of a colonial style house and a dirt floor. For the scenes in the Yoruba marketplace, a tent was set up to obscuring the house. This was a very clever way of representing the divide between the local community and the British colonial administration. The market place shows a bustling and energy-filled Yoruba community while scenes featuring the British colonists highlighted their emphasis on individualism with a sparse stage and little movement.
The use of traditional African drumming and dance also added to the production. Drummers remained on stage for large part of the performance. Repetitive drum tracks accompany entire scenes and helps build the tension that is finally released at the play’s shattering conclusion. The rhythm surrounds the colonists and emphasizes the fact that they exist in an enclave surrounded by a larger, indigenous culture.
This production of “Death and the King’s Horseman” took a difficult script full of complex and at times uncomfortable issues and presented them in a way that was not only accessible, but also thoroughly enjoyable. Every detail of the production was treated with thought and care, bolstered by a remarkable cast of actors that fully embraced the subtleties of their roles. Schoenberg has succeeded in taking a play that is rarely performed outside of Africa and giving it a fresh, relevant look.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated 2:06 a.m.
Three Harvard undergraduates and a Harvard Medical School student number among the 32 Rhodes Scholars announced today.
Seniors Zachary M. Frankel ’11, Daniel E. Lage ’11, and Baltazar A. Zavala ’11 and first-year Medical School student Aakash K. Shah—all members of the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa—will spend at least the next year pursuing their research interests at the University of Oxford in England.
The four were selected from more than 800 students nominated by 309 colleges and universities nationwide on the basis of high academic achievement, personal integrity, and leadership potential. With the addition of this year’s recipients, Harvard now boasts a total of 332 Rhodes Scholars.
All four Harvard Rhodes scholars said they felt humbled and grateful to their mentors, citing their professors and House tutors.
“Harvard was extremely supportive. My mentors and professors have really got me excited about solving complex problems,” said Frankel.
“If I could describe this experience in one word, it would be humbling,” Lage said.
Lage, a history and science concentrator from Miami living in Winthrop House, plans to work toward an M.Sc. in comparative social policy. Lage spent a summer studying geriatrics in France where he saw the differences in the healthcare of both countries. Lage, who was a co-director of the volunteer organization the Elderly Affairs Committee, said his passion for geriatrics and social policy stems from his family history.
“My grandfather developed dementia, and I saw health care from the patient’s perspective,” he said. “I realized it’s more than just being a doctor.”
Lage added that he hopes to bridge the issues of health policy and medicine during his time at Oxford.
Shah, who received a bachelor’s in inequality studies, biology, and neuroscience at Ursinus College, also plans to study comparative social policy. He mentions his work in India as one of the most transformative experiences of his life.
“There I realized that a discovery at the lab bench is the first step of a very long process in healthcare delivery,” he said.
Zavala, an engineering sciences and neurobiology concentrator and a varsity football player from El Paso, Texas, plans to obtain a M.Sc. in clinical neuroscience. He has traveled with Engineers Without Borders to the Dominican Republic to work on clean water systems and has conducted research in neuroscience labs at Harvard and in Shanghai.
Zavala, a Kirkland House resident, said he manages to balance all of his interests by “playing them off of each other.”
“If I have a bad day in class, I go to football practice and just let it all out—maybe hit someone a little harder.” After his time at Oxford, Zavala said he plans on attending medical school in hopes of becoming a neurosurgeon.
Frankel, from Brooklyn, a physics and math concentrator living in Quincy House, plans to obtain a D.Phil. in infectious diseases.
Frankel cited his research with the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative Director Nathan D. Wolfe during a semester off as an experience through which he began to consider the application of the disciplines of physics and math to infectious disease.
“It’s so pressing in a variety of areas. There’s a lot of work to be done that’s both interesting and important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zar Zavala won two things on Saturday: a football game against Yale and the one of the world’s most prestigious scholarships.
Zavala, a walk-on senior wide receiver, found out just after yesterday’s game that he received the Rhodes Scholarship.
“Today is definitely the best day of my life,” Zavala said.
The native of El Paso, Texas, flew home Friday to participate in the final round of interviews for the scholarship. He arrived at Harvard Stadium just before halftime and suited up to watch the Crimson come from behind to beat Yale, 28-21.
“[I was] walking around the field, searching for my family,” Zavala said. “I find them, they have my phone. I turn it on and it says, ‘Congratulations, you’re a Rhodes scholar.’”
Zavala is an engineering sciences and neurobiology concentrator in Kirkland House. He was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa earlier this month.
“I can’t think of a better day,” he said.

Sure, Harvardlunch.com hasn’t  quite scored a million hits, but roughly 300 students (including one Crimson writer) have met at  randomly arranged, “non-romantic” lunches coordinated by the website in the short time since Seth A. Riddley '12 founded it last week.
So who are these 300 people? Riddley gives us the stats.
The House with the highest participation is Mather—unsurprisingly, since Riddley  first sent the link out to the Mather e-mail list. For second place, there is a three-way tie between Cabot, Currier, and Eliot. The highest participating freshman dorm is Matthews,  followed by Wigglesworth.
The site has actually seen a  rise in freshman participation since its inception—originally, the  participators were primarily Mather residents and other upperclassmen,  but a few days after the site’s founding, freshmen became the its  largest user group. They now make up about 25 percent of the total amount of  the site’s participants.
According to Riddley, there are about equal numbers of male and female users. In other words, that “non-romantic lunch” to which the site refers has potential to become so, so much more.
The site continues to grow at a  steady pace of about 10 users a day, according to Riddley, who said he hadn’t expected it to be particularly popular. The site's growth has even earned it a negative post from IvyGate, unsurprisingly  written by a senior who attends a little-known liberal arts institution  in New Haven, Conn.
Riddley, a history of science  concentrator who said he “doesn’t know much about computer programming  at all,” said he constructed the site in a  few hours. He’s since been given  several suggestions from users, such as a “suggested meeting location”  entry field, and has had some of his own ideas to improve the site.
“Hopefully over the winter break I can spend some more time with it,” Riddley said.
