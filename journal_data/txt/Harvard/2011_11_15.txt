After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world knows Marilyn Monroe as an immortal sex symbol, but if one delves deeper into her life, one finds it rife with emotional struggles even more affecting than those in the dramas in which she acted. “My Week with Marilyn” investigates the more intimate moments of Monroe’s life, and goes behind the scenes to depict the true, unadulterated Monroe (Michelle Williams), sans makeup and bombshell demeanor. The film is based on the diaries of Colin Clark, a third assistant director on the 1957 movie “The Prince and the Showgirl,” who fell in love with the starlet and shared an emotional rollercoaster of a week with her during the filming.
For director Simon Curtis, Clark’s diaries provided a unique entry point into Monroe’s story. “Colin Clark’s point of view happened to [show] Marilyn in a different and unexpected light,” he says. Indeed, the movie depicts many facets of Monroe, some less familiar than others: the brilliant actor, confident sexy star, crazed pill-popper, and the sometimes arresting, articulate, self-assured woman. These various features of the renowned movie star combine to provide a fresh take on an actress typically portrayed as merely a bombshell blonde.
Curtis found the film’s particular period ideal for conveying a more complex perspective on Monroe. In 1956, Monroe had moved away from Hollywood and towards more challenging and substantive projects. “My Week With Marilyn” chronicles her experiences during the filming of “The Prince and the Showgirl,” a more highbrow film that starred and was directed by the distinguished actor Laurence Olivier. “She escaped Hollywood to find intellectual sustenance and credibility,” says Curtis.
To Curtis, Colin Clark’s material thus provided the opportunity to render a more complete vision of Monroe on screen. His Monroe repeatedly defies expectations in the movie and betrays far more complexity of character than traditionally associated with the actress. Initially portrayed as an incredibly self-conscious performer, she worries about her inability to connect to her character—fears that are quickly dismissed in the film by a glib “just try to be sexy, isn’t that what you do?” She bemoans this sort of typecasting and its effect on her life. “As soon as [people] realize I’m not Marilyn Monroe, they run,” she laments, in reference to her multiple failed marriages.
But although Curtis’s Monroe is first depicted as a “damsel in distress,” her self-awareness and personal acumen soon emerge. She has the sensibility to realize that her childhood, spent with a mentally ill mother and then in a series of foster homes, has shaped her into a dependent—both on people and mind-altering substances—and unstable person. “I just want to be loved like a regular girl,” she sighs during a difficult moment with her husband at the time, the playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). The film shows how this emotional instability, while personally destructive, was instrumental in crafting Monroe into an incredible actress—and the archetype of starlets of today.
Of course, depicting a character as iconic as Monroe is exceptionally difficult. There is a reason there haven’t been any other actresses who have left such a deep imprint upon society. For Curtis, casting a modern actress as such a legendary woman was especially tricky, given the complexity of Marilyn’s character in his movie. But Michelle Williams, who has proven her  versatility and emotional scope in other acclaimed movies like “Blue Valentine” and “Brokeback Mountain,” seemed just the right choice. “Michelle is as good as doing the extrovert as she is doing the intimate, complicated screwed-up,” Curtis says.
“My Week with Marilyn” is essentially a snapshot of Marilyn Monroe’s life. Yet in that proverbial picture, she is striking multiple poses. The focus is not on her usual sexpot self, but a more real and relatable person. She is someone with emotional troubles, insecurities, and other human foibles. Later on, her more notorious drug-dependent characteristics emerge, briefly overcome in Monroe’s short-lived defiance of critics’ expectations and her own self-doubt. It is a multidimensional look at a figure often portrayed as one-dimensional. As Curtis puts it, the film is “a love letter to a lost time, and a love letter to a tremendous icon ... I hope we can sort of humanize her and bring her to people’s attention in an unexpected way.”

This might be the movie that finally nets Leonardo DiCaprio an Oscar. His portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is one of the best performances of his entire career. Clint Eastwood’s “J. Edgar” provides the perfect platform for such a tour-de-force. The biopic devotes as much effort to painting J. Edgar Hoover as a deeply troubled closeted homosexual as it does to presenting him as the cunning and ruthless personality who built up one of the most powerful and influential organizations in 20th-century America. Thus, although its plot is too fragmented to maintain consistent and compelling energy, “J. Edgar” still serves as a sublimely acted and starkly beautiful portrait of a man who even today holds a very contentious place in the public conscience.
As depicted in the film’s script—written by Dustin Lance Black of “Milk” fame—Hoover was a man who hid his profound insecurities behind a mask of total confidence. Throughout the movie, DiCaprio wears this disguise well, with a furrowed brow and quick, sharp speech that makes him the picture of self-control and seriousness. But when the mask comes off—as it does often enough—DiCaprio lets all of Hoover’s private angst and self-loathing completely consume his persona. The performance is masterfully executed and deeply moving. It alone provides sufficient reason to see “J. Edgar.”
Though DiCaprio’s act is the centerpiece of “J. Edgar,” some of his co-stars’ performances are similarly impressive. Armie Hammer has come a long way from his portrayal of the infuriating braggadocio of the Winklevii in “The Social Network.” Here, he plays Hoover’s right-hand man and eventual love interest Clyde Tolson with a mature subtlety that makes the potentially awkward sexual tension between the two characters much more convincing.
Naomi Watts fills the role of Hoover’s longtime secretary Helen Gandy. Though Watts gives a well-executed performance, Gandy seems slightly peripheral, thanks to her character’s stunted development as Hoover’s conflicted but fiercely loyal personal assistant. While the other two principal characters of the film grow far more cynical and world-weary as the movie progresses, Gandy remains unchanging in her devotion—a depiction that may be accurate but feels cinematically simplistic.
As one would expect from an Eastwood film, “J. Edgar” is visually arresting with fantastic production values. The makeup used to transform the actors as they age is nearly flawless. The sets and lighting situate the characters in a dark, gray world—one that reflects in an almost brazenly unsubtle manner the moral ambiguity and personal repression that characterize Hoover’s life and work.
But the film’s plot—that is, if a series of tenuously connected vignettes depicting only occasionally related events in Hoover’s life can be called a “plot”—undermines the otherwise profound emotional weight that it carries. Ostensibly, the movie’s main storyline involves the very public kidnapping of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh’s child and the manner in which Hoover used this event to consolidate and augment the power of the FBI. But the tale is so fragmented and unfocused that it’s impossible to get a feel for the pacing of the plot.
Indeed, pacing is the film’s biggest problem. “J. Edgar” spreads itself too thin in trying to comprehensively capture a career that spanned a half-century in a little over two hours. It leaps backward and forward in time in a scrambling attempt to cover this immense ground. The result is a film that feels confused in its focus, and jumps disjointedly between and within two massively different eras in a way that only rarely gives a clue as to its direction. Due to its overweening ambition–turned-disorderliness, “J. Edgar” prevents us from becoming completely immersed in its otherwise well-crafted world.
Such missteps are unfortunate, because there is so much here worth seeing. Ultimately, “J. Edgar” fails to truly distinguish itself due to its heavy-handed storytelling, the bane of far too many biopics. That said, “J. Edgar” nonetheless stands out for its unforgettable depiction of one of the most enigmatic, complex, and troubled figures in American history. See it for the person, not the plot.

As eerie flutes and strings float in the background, Werner Herzog is driving through a foreign land: Texas. Herzog has long been known for his work in exotic locales, which includes the Antarctica-centered documentary “Encounters at the End of the World” and the South American epics “Aguirre: The Wrath of God” and “Fitzcarraldo.” With “Into the Abyss,” he now moves through the brush-lined roads of the Lone Star state and its many drawling denizens in order to understand better the movers and actors surrounding American capital punishment. While Herzog makes it clear in the film’s first few minutes that he does not support the death penalty, “Into the Abyss” is not a political film so much as a story with understated political implications. With the steady and practiced hand of an expert documentary filmmaker, Herzog straps the issue to the gurney and injects the stories of murderer, victim, family, executor, law, and lover to create a nuanced picture of cyclical senselessness in capital punishment.
“Into the Abyss” tells the story of the real-life crime and punishment of Michael Perry, who was executed in July 2010 for a triple homicide, and Jason Burkett, his accomplice who is now serving a 30-year sentence. The title could well refer to Perry’s eyes, bottomless and gleaming at the thought of joining his father in heaven. He carries himself like a boy, smiling and enthusiastic. He is unfailingly polite, even when Herzog abruptly declares, “I don’t have to like you, but you are a human being.” After introducing us to the murderer of the piece, Herzog then leaves Perry to explore the murders themselves with footage drawn from improbably poignant crime scene videos: cookie dough remains balled on aluminum pans, a teddy bear lies face-down on a garage floor, and blood is spattered all over the ceiling and floor. Perry and Burkett killed a mother, son, and friend for the senseless purpose of stealing a red Camaro. Herzog makes no argument that Perry or Burkett are innocent, as the DNA and crime scene evidence incontrovertibly place them at each grisly locale.
Yet even though he is cataloging such an undeniably gruesome and cruel crime, Herzog frames his investigation like any ordinary day in Perry’s hometown, Conroe. He interviews an acquaintance of the two killers, a calloused young contractor who learned to read in prison. With folded arms—one tattooed with his girlfriend’s name, Bailey—the man speaks about the fights and murder attempts of the town with the casual air of someone discussing a mild annoyance. He relates how after he himself was once stabbed in the chest with a foot-long screwdriver, he still went to work because he couldn’t afford to stay home.
Herzog portrays this violent, gun-slinging Texas as an intergenerational legacy of fathers and sons. Burkett’s father, who pleaded for his son not to be executed, is serving a 30-year sentence in a prison across the street. Herzog ends the film on an uncomfortably ominous note with an interview with Burkett’s wife, who is carrying his child through artificial insemination, as he was imprisoned before they could consummate their marriage. Her off-putting giggles and nervous phone-checking during the interview creates the sickening impression that history is soon to repeat itself as another child is carelessly brought into a cycle of neglect and violence.
The most poignant part of the movie is its series of closing interviews. A former execution officer breathes heavily as he describes the last meal of death row inmates, and what it was like strapping them to the gurney. He talks about the execution of a woman that led him to quit his profession and leave behind a pension in favor of adherence to the call of conscience. In the end, only the victim’s family member, bereaved for a decade, says that she was glad she saw the execution, but even she seems unsure that more suffering was necessary despite the closure it brought her.
The only dissonant aspect of “Into the Abyss” is the trademark Herzogian humor that seems too off-color for the heavy subject matter. While his musings on the potential insanity of penguins works in “Encounters,” Herzog’s teasing here of Burkett’s wife about how exactly she was impregnated just comes off as highly inappropriate. Nonetheless, Herzog’s probing and provocative questions about love and God in relation to execution elicit profound responses from his subjects that make up for his occasional excesses.
“Into the Abyss” may not be a documentary with a mantra, but Herzog is once more successful in capturing the elusive “ecstatic truth” he worships. The film’s interviews are truly raw and the story is complicated yet effortlessly explained. The end result is a documentary that presents a picture of a world where capital punishment seems to have no willing contributors and merely renews itself endogenously. It is another cinematic accomplishment for the celebrated filmmaker.

After a musical career spanning nearly 20 years, the indie-rock band The Sea and Cake is still fresh. In an energetic and engaging concert at the Brighton Music Hall on November 7 the band presented a distinct sound melding late 1960s Brazilian music, African-influenced guitar lines, and pop from selections of their ninth album, “The Moonlight Butterfly.”
The opening acts, Yellow Birds and Brokeback, provided a balanced introduction to the evening. Their music was distinct from each other and The Sea and Cake in terms of rhythmic style. Yellow Birds presented a classic indie-rock performance that included numbers spanning from punk rock to soft rock. The musicians ended their set with their debut performance of “All the Good Days are Gone,” a slow dreamy ballad reminiscent of 1960s pop music mixed with modern synthesizers.
Brokeback exhibited a much weightier musical style than Yellow Birds. The band presented a heavy guitar anthem that lasted more than 15 minutes into their set. Although the band used a menagerie of vibrant guitar riffs and solos, their sounds were often overwhelmed by excessive vibrato. Halfway through their performance, lead guitarist Douglas McCombs’s guitar broke—producing an awkward pause as he ran off the stage to find another one. Nonetheless, the opening acts provided striking musical contrasts before the night’s main attraction.
The Sea and Cake opened their evening’s work with “Covers.” From their first chords, the band created an intriguing musical texture that blended a mix of 1960s pop with a tribal back beat. Though lead singer Sam Prekop’s soft, lilting voice did not project well in the venue, the band capitalized on drummer John McEntire’s intricate, catchy rhythms. “On the North Shore” highlighted guitarist Archer Prewitt’s musical prowess. Throughout the evening, The Sea and Cake thrilled with a fluid interplay between lyrical guitar and percussion. The band’s selections flowed from one to the next with long guitar riffs and electric guitar and synthesizer solos.
Though the band focused its set on selections from “Moonlight Butterfly,” they also peppered their set with the catchy rhythms of favorites from their past eight albums—including “Coconut” from their album “Everybody” and “On a Letter” and “Aerial” from their album “Car Alarm.” By the end of the evening, The Sea and Cake had provided a glimpse of their versatile sound. Though the musicians were a serene presence on the Brighton stage, swaying slowly to their beats, their music was anything but nonchalant. Their set contained an energy that revealed a bold and innovative artistry.

In the beginning, the black and white forms emerged from the photographer’s developing fluid. “First there was nothing—and then suddenly something.” This is the story of Genesis as rendered in Ingo Schulze’s latest novel, “Adam and Evelyn,” a book steeped in biblical imagery, not least in its eponymous wordplay. Translated by John E. Woods, the novel is also a reflection on the struggles and harsh realities of life in former East Germany. Schulze’s novel is the story of Lutz Frenzel, a women’s custom tailor known to everyone as Adam, and his younger girlfriend Evelyn Schumann. They live together in a well-kept house where Adam does fittings for his rich and influential clients while Evelyn is at her waitressing job. Adam designs outfits for his clients, takes their photographs wearing his creations, and then has sex with them. One day, Evelyn quits her job and comes home early, catching him in the act. When she decides to take a vacation to unstable Hungary with her restive best friend and her friend’s flirtatious cousin from the West, Adam follows, setting into motion a chain of events that will lead to new lives for both of them in the supposed capitalist paradise of West Germany.
“Adam and Evelyn” is a love story based on the fall of man, set during the fall of communism. The story depends on these two falls, but it only succeeds in capturing the first. In general, stories set in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) have the advantage of juxtaposing the human emotions and aspirations of their characters against the impersonality of a police state. To achieve this, such stories must inhabit the landscape and atmosphere of the GDR: the buildings made from concrete blocks stacked on top of each other, the industrial grayness of socialism. Schulze’s novel does not do this, and therefore forfeits the potential resonance of its setting. The two protagonists argue over leaving the East behind, but their passions seem dry and unfounded. Adam wishes to return to his comfortable home and the life with which he is familiar. “Do you think I can just turn my back on everything—on the house, the garden, the graves, everything?” And indeed, this seems like a convincing argument, because Schulze neglects to convey the problems with life in the GDR; in contrast, Evelyn’s rejection of her homeland seems inadequately developed.
And yet, Adam’s struggle to hold onto love as he falls from grace is convincingly and touchingly portrayed. The story is bookended by images of figs and a car repairman, curious symbols which appear at Evelyn’s departure and at the couple’s final reunion. These serve to make their reunion like a new beginning. The regaining of paradise, in the form of escape from communism and a new life in the West, is meant to mirror the healing of the couple’s love. The problem is that we only get a full picture of the latter: Schulze focuses exclusively on the love story and never develops the historical parallels he seems to think are so important. Occasionally, though, Schulze manages to connect the two ideas. “Do you really believe it will all just go one like before? That would be absurd,” says Evelyn, and she is referring to her relationship with Adam as much as to the uncertain situation in the East. Nevertheless, the book never attains the depth for which it strives because it fails to capture the bleakness of the life they leave behind.
Despite this thematic superficiality, “Adam and Evelyn” is entertaining and readable. This is largely due to the dynamic, likeable characters. They seem meant for each other despite the vast differences between them. Evelyn is more impetuous. She keenly feels the stagnancy of her life in the East, having three times applied and three times been rejected to study at the local university. The West is a promised land for her, where waitressing would be a springboard to better things and not an end in itself. She blossoms amid the unknown freedoms of the West. She is always hopeful that things will somehow work out, even though Adam hates that idea. “Enough with the ‘somehow,’ ‘somehow’ is awful,” he says. The strength of Evelyn’s character lies in this optimism, which soothes and balances Adam’s penchant for despair.
Adam is the exact opposite of Evelyn. His life is built around structure, routine, and orderliness. He is comforted by his house, his white picket fence, his garden sandals, and his basement darkroom where he develops photographs of the outfits he designs. But despite this seeming innocuousness, Adam is not a naturally sympathetic character. He never genuinely apologizes for his infidelity. His method of coping with the shock of life in the West is to ignore Evelyn completely. “He acts like he’s the first and only person on earth,” Evelyn says, and she is right. Still, he manages to garner sympathy through sheer doggedness; somehow his stalking Evelyn through multiple countries makes perfect sense and even serves to prove his love. The strength of Adam as a character lies in his need for Evelyn, to whom he clings as if she really were made from his own rib.
Really good novels echo in the reader’s mind after the pages are shut. Putting them down at the end is like trying to set aside a strong emotion. “Adam and Evelyn” does not reach these heights. The contrast between East and West, old and new, is simply too shallow. But despite this fatal flaw, the book still has many lesser merits. Schulze writes with rich imagery, from the first image of the photographs emerging from their chemical bath, to the last image of photographs burning. If the majority of the book were not in dialogue, this sumptuous imagery might help it reach the stylistic beauty for which it strives. As a love story, it is satisfying and resolutely optimistic. It does not devastate, it does not enlighten, but it does not disappoint either. Yet as a parable, one cannot help but wish for something more.

As the Oronsay Boat sets sail into the dark ocean in the opening pages of “The Cat’s Table,” so too does author Michael Ondaatje embark into a drifting narrative sea of memory and imagination. His latest novel is a series of embellished memories from a three-week sea voyage. Each carefully arranged fragment conveys the excitement of puberty, feelings of alienation, and the enigmatic nature of personal connections. Narrating childhood memories through an aged voice, the novel poignantly eulogizes the wisdom of perspective and the transcendence of shared experience.
“The Cat’s Table” is a semi-autobiographical novel that recounts the journey of 11-year old “Mynah” from his homeland of Sri Lanka to his new home of England. The narrative follows the boy and his two friends––Cassius and Ramadhin––as they delve through the ship’s rooms, decks, and off-limits zones. The novel retreats from conventional plot development, and instead unravels via discoveries and explorations the boys undertake aboard the ship. Through this unusual structure, “The Cat’s Table” attains a fragmentary and often dislocated quality that poignantly reflects the unreliability  of memory.
However, this unusual construction does not carry over to the narrative and language of the novel. Ondaatje’s descriptions are exquisitely detailed and quietly sensual. Each encounter is laced with references to looks, or gestures, or movements. It is easy to become lost in the highly sensitized world of this 11-year-old child. The effect of such sharp language is powerfully visceral: as Mr. Muppazi softly touches Mynah’s face, we almost feel his touch upon our own skin.
The Cat’s Table––from which the novel takes its name––is the self-appropriated term for those least important passengers aboard the ship, all of whom are seated together in the dining hall. A mélange of strangers seated together for the period of the voyage, the narrator lavishes description and attention upon these characters, and each one is surrounded with fabricated tales and stories. Ondaatje adopts the fine detailing of a portrait painter: “You could see her in a deck chair reading crime novels within the rectangles of deep shadow, her bright blond hair a little sparkle in her chosen gloom.” These images, frozen in Mynah’s memory, glimmer with intricate visual details, and the result is a strikingly vivid narrative.
Beginning with concrete images, the narrator inevitably progresses into imagination as the three boys adopt the role of detectives. As the they ramble through the ship, “vacuuming up clues,” they hear snatches of conversation and invent back stories for each member of the Cat’s Table. Miss Lasqueti––a young lady who reads crime novels before throwing them into the ocean––becomes, in the boys’ world, a spy with connections to Whitehall. Mr. Mazappa––the entertaining pianist––disappears at Port Said, supposedly, because of his adulterous relationship with Miss Lasqueti. Each tale is ambiguous, and their details are obfuscated, but this lack of clarity appropriately reflects the experience of the prepubescent investigators. The boys can gather details and pieces of evidence, but their misunderstandings of adult interaction leave their interpretations shadowy and even bizarre.
The experiences of the child, told from an aged perspective, means that the boundaries between memory and imagination, between reality and youthful creativity, are often blurred. Pushing back against the limitations of reality, “The Cat’s Table” emphasizes the human desire to know and understand others around us. This desire is most potently actualized in Mynah’s intimate encounter with his cousin Emily on the voyage. Ondaatje describes the trembling sensation that accompanies a moment of affinity, before the unutterable feeling of loss when the encounter is at an end: “Suddenly there was a wide gulf between Emily’s existence and mine, and I would never be able to cross it.” Even later in life when he meets Emily again, Mynah cannot re-capture this fleeting instant of youthful intimacy. This transient connection is poignant and, indeed, riveting. Moments like these transform the novel into a poetic voyage of self-discovery.
As the novel unfolds, characters and events become increasingly sinister. Criminal activity, muffled shouts at night, and mysterious deaths are all recounted from the perspective of Mynah crouching beneath an upturned lifeboat. The freneticism and absurdity of these events stretch the imagination, and sometimes fit oddly with the subtle imagery and wizened perspective of the novel. Ondaatje emphasizes the collective experience of the passengers aboard the Oronsay, and this negates the potential flaw. His use of the collective consciousness is a dramatic strategy and one of the prime virtues of the novel.
Ondaatje’s focus on the collective experience, as opposed to the events themselves, is apparent in Mynah’s description of the Oronsay entering the Suez Canal. The details are rich and chaotic, and the author eloquently describes trades between the ship and the mainland merchants, exotic goods, fleeting conversations across the water. The narrative goes on to recount an experience later in life when Mynah visits an art exhibit by Cassius––one of his compatriots upon the ship––and recognizes the paintings as representations of their trip down the Suez Canal: “I suppose it clarified how close Cassius and I had been, real brothers. For he also had witnessed the people I saw that night, with whom we had felt so oddly aligned, whom we had never seen again. Only there.”
“The Cat’s Table” is a voyage on multiple levels: it is a physical journey, a voyage of youth to adulthood, and also a journey back into the memory, as the narrator unearths a deeper understanding of his past. What he realizes is profound and significant: he wants intimacy but cannot break down emotional walls, and he recognizes the deep changes that individuals can wreak upon each other’s lives. However, Ondaatje is ultimately more interested in the intimacy of collective experience. These moments of perspective, which recognize even the most fleeting instances of closeness, ultimately allow Ondaatje’s newest effort to triumph.

The ceramic artist and designer Christian S. Tonsgard is not one to put his work on a pedestal. For his thesis presentation at Arizona State University (ASU), where he received his Master of Fine Arts in 2009, Tonsgard displayed the bowls, plates, and cups he had crafted on tables from IKEA rather than in a traditional gallery setting. While this might have seemed like a postmodern joke, Tonsgard is by no means an ironist. Rather, his work focuses on the dynamic between design and craftsmanship, a topic that was central to his talk at the Office for the Arts Ceramics Studio last Thursday.“
I try to add elegance to the everyday,” Tonsgard said. “My pedestals are in the home.”
Tonsgard—who received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in ceramics at the Rhode Island School of Design in 2005 before completing graduate studies at ASU—makes asymmetrical and minimally colored ceramic pieces that still retain their functionality. His visit to the Ceramics Studio was divided into a demonstration of his techniques and a slideshow where he discussed the influences and goals of his work. Tonsgard focused on his attempts to find balance in his art: balance between design and craftsmanship; between accessibility and artistic respectability; and between machine-like precision and the human touch. Though the demonstrations were filled with humorous insights—Tonsgard attributed his confident working technique to being an “ex-jock” and joked that clay “was able to smell fear”—his discussion about artistic balance was prominent throughout. “
People’s aesthetics are changing because of the fact that they have to make money,” Tonsgard said. “I didn’t get into this to get rich, but I have to broaden my clientele.”
Tonsgard said that he makes an effort to stay true to the art of ceramics while reaching a wider audience. One way he has attempted to do this is by creating alternative gallery spaces: in 2009, he began a traveling exhibition called “a la cARTe,” where restaurants would serve food on plates and bowls made by ceramic artists.
“You could go in, eat off the work, and then buy it,” Tonsgard explained during the slideshow.
Though Tonsgard’s said “a la cARTe” proved to be logistically challenging, he currently has plans to stage similar events at a restaurant in Providence, R.I., close to his home.
Tonsgard has also attempted to reach a broader clientele by including elements in his work that appeal to both ceramics insiders and the greater public. During the slideshow, he spoke about how he will sometimes leave fingermarks in his work; instead of removing the prints, he highlights them with a small circle of color, leaving an artistic signature.
“[The prints] are noticed and appreciated by both people in the medium and people that have no idea whatsoever about clay,” Tonsgard said.
These subtle signatures also serve another purpose: they highlight the interplay between machine-like rigor and the more human elements in Tonsgard’s work. He is inspired by both natural sources such as flower buds and man-made objects such as tennis shoes.“
What really strikes me is precision,” Tonsgard said. “I want to fool people. I want them to question if it was made by a machine. Along the way, I leave little hints that it’s man-made.”
Tonsgard’s bold precision was on full display during his technical demonstrations as he exhibited his spinning and glazing techniques.
“I don’t drink a lot of coffee before this,” Tonsgard said while spinning. “My actions are straight and to the point. I’m not timid about it—I just go in and do it.”
Though Tonsgard repeatedly apologized for the painstaking nature of some of the demonstrations, the crowd proved receptive. Alice L. Abrams, a resident artist in the Ceramics Program, said both Tonsgard’s talk and his demonstrations were enlightening.
“Everyone always touches clay in different ways,” Adams said. “That always reveals a new technique. He touched the clay the way that he spoke—very clearly, very deliberately.”
Ceramics Program Instructor Pamela Gorgone shared Adams’s sentiments. “He’s very comfortable, tactile, determined,” Gorgone said.
Shawn L. Panepinto, acting director of the Ceramics Program and a ceramic artist, said she was particularly impressed by Tonsgard’s confident presence during the demonstrations. Though Tonsgard said after the event that although he was actually quite nervous during some demonstrations, he found the presentation to be a success.
“I had a set idea of what I wanted to show people,” Tonsgard said after the event. “Ceramics has such a deep history and I don’t want to ignore that. I’m trying to be a contemporary craftsman who’s not stuck in history.”

Social movements become iconic through their protest art. The Black Power movement adopted the image of a fist clenched in rage; the Cuban Revolution popularized a Che Guevara insignia. As the Occupy Wall Street movement takes root in public spaces across the nation, observers and protestors on the Harvard campus this weekend share their thoughts about the development of a unifying emblem for this most recent social movement.
Liane Speroni, an Occupy supporter affiliated with the Harvard Extension School, said, “I came from Worchester [Massachusetts], where they have a city seal with a fist growing out of it. Maybe Occupy Harvard will try some variation of the Veritas emblem.”
Already, the official “Occupy Harvard” Tumblr page has adopted a crimson and white color scheme and is using a font similar to the one found on official university documents.
A poster created and distributed by “Occupy Wall Street” in September that depicted a ballerina dancing atop a statue of a bull has inspired the “Occupy Harvard” protestors, who created their own version involving a ballerina dancing on the John Harvard statue.
“[The ballerina poster was] inspired to some extent by what’s happening on Wall Street, but different cities use different symbols,” said Caroline Pearce, a Kennedy School graduate involved in coordinating Occupy Harvard.
Alex H. Auriema, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, views the Occupy Harvard movement “as a performance piece—an artful gesture in itself.” He added that “a lot of formations of the Occupy movement both in New York and Los Angeles had origins with art performance groups.”
According to Auriema, the Occupy protestors view activism and art as one and the same. However, he thought that the Occupy movement has not given rise to any iconic musicians: “A lot of major musicians have come out and supported the movement, but none have become Bob Dylan figures,” he said.
Like Auriema, Pearce does not see any clear musical leaders. “It’s reflective of how Occupy works,” she said. “It’s not a very centralized movement, but there is a lot of room for people to be creative.”
Malcolm S. Brown, a retired professor from Brooklyn College and supporter of Occupy Harvard, added that the movement’s creativity is due at least in part to its populist flavor: the protests have developed without a figurehead. “[Occupy protestors] don’t think of themselves as subject to the same command and control structures that govern most protests,” he said.
Aureima said that the populist, democratic quality that characterizes “Occupy” is also reflected in the current art world. “A lot of artists are playing with non-hierarchical structures and horizontality,” he said. “Artist groups have started free school universities and places for critical thought that don’t have any sort of traditional pedagogical structure.”
As Occupy protestors seek a place for dialogue, Auriema said artists are “reclaiming a creative common.” He sees a connection between the online music sampling culture, which values sharing and open-source content, and the collectivist organization of the Occupy movement.
Though the Occupy movements lack a unified artistic foundation at this time, Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 —who joined the revolutionary movement of César Chávez and the United Farm Workers in the 1960s—says this is not necessarily a problem. “Successful movements don’t ‘require’ cultural icons—they produce them,” wrote Ganz in an email. “So far ‘We’re the 99%’ has become a very powerful symbol of this movement, as has the idea of ‘occupy[ing]’.”
Yet, the very idea of occupying risks becoming a pop-culture catch phrase rather than a politically salient slogan. Musical artist Jay-Z, for example, is planning to sell shirts under his clothing label Rocawear that read “Occupy All Streets.”
“I’m very concerned,” Auriema said of Jay-Z’s design. “In today’s society, anything can be commodified … Levi’s ‘Go Forth’ campaign has commodified [a similar] revolutionary and anarchist aesthetic and put it into a whole new multimillion-dollar campaign that uses Beatnik poetry.
“[Commercialization is] a huge danger for the movement as it goes forward—it is obviously a contradiction to the principles of [Occupy],” Auriema continued. Only time will tell what lasting cultural mark will be left behind by the Occupy movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman lies pale and immobile, half-submerged in a flooded room. Thin light streams through the dark interior, which is a curtained box of a suburban house. The watery grave of Gregory Crewdson’s “Untitled (Ophelia),” a photograph from his 2001 book “Twilight,” disturbs the viewer with its morbidity and a corresponding lack of reaction from the surrounding environment.
I saw this photograph for the first time when I was 12 years old. A friend e-mailed me a link to Crewdson’s photography along with some exhortation, “This is unbelievable. Check it out.” It was four years before I read “Hamlet” and five years before I discovered more art about suburban life, in movies like “American Beauty” and “The Graduate.” Yet some element of Crewdson’s photography struck a chord in my mind at the time. An indefinite characteristic of his dark suburban macabre resonated with me, a girl who had lived in a city for her entire life and knew the suburbs through only her parent’s childhood memories.
I returned to the photograph years later for a final paper during my first semester at Harvard. Over the course of the assignment, which used photography to talk about film, I realized how art could take part in a larger academic discourse.
The paper I wrote was for Expos 20, similar in style to one I would have written in an English class. Yet across disciplines at Harvard, faculty members invoke and interpret art in their own methodological style. Using Crewdson’s photograph as a point of departure, I set out to investigate how various departments viewed art in terms of its meaning, value, and intention.
“OCEANIC FEELING”
Assistant Professor of History and of Social Studies Andrew J. Jewett’s small office in a corner of Robinson Hall is lined with books, but he readily admits that art is not among the various disciplines he’s studied. Bespectacled and enthusiastic, Jewett stares perplexedly the image I’ve pulled up on my laptop. Though he has no formal background in art history, Jewett has done research into the cultural objectification of the middle class, and agrees to give my project a shot.
For this history professor, placing the photograph chronologically and analyzing details are the foremost methods of art interpretation. “There is this sort of reflection on the ceiling, which is sort of weird,” he begins. “There’s a plant that is knocked over in the back there. Everything else is upright.”
“Oh gosh, what is she floating in?” he asks with surprise. “This is difficult.”
“Water,” I answer.
“Well,” he replies, “if I hadn’t known what [the photo] was called, I would have thought, well, it could be blood, it could be chocolate, all sorts of other things.”
Nailing down the substance of drowning wasn’t the only ambiguity Jewett noticed in the image. “It’s hard to identify the [time] period. It could be in a number of different times, in terms of the age of the furniture, and the wallpaper especially. There’s really nothing in it that’s particularly modern except, maybe, the book.” The coffee-table book does indeed have a glossy sheen reminiscent of drugstore mass-market copies, and it provides the only anchor in a temporal vacuum. Having spent his academic career studying the past, it makes sense that cultural artifacts immediately pop out to Jewett.
Focusing on another relic of the cultural past, Jewett recalls the extensive genre of suburban films that center on suburban dissatisfaction. “The first thought I had,” Jewett says, “was of that movie ‘Far From Heaven’ … it’s got all these impossible things going around and people being trapped, and that was what resonated with me when I saw the house, first, and then thought of that movie.”
Film history continues to form the background of Jewett’s interpretation. For every idea he recognizes in the photograph another film pops into his head. “For some reason I just keep thinking of trains and trains of movies. It’s an entire genre, the sort of miserable suburbs movies.” Then he touches on something oddly appropriate, given the photograph’s watery theme. “There’s always the undercurrent of boundlessness—I think of a kind of oceanic feeling that, in some ways, is a positive—but in other ways is soporific … a life of valium, just self-sedation.” In grounding his interpretation with the history of mass culture he knows so well, it comes as no surprise that film anchors Jewett’s analysis.
Describing another movie about the suburbs in the 1950s, he recalls being left with an image of “a stultifying, repressive world.” He transfers this lasting impression to the world Crewdson created—but “Untitled (Ophelia)” is “more than stultifying,” he says. “This is deathly. Fatal.” Jewett imagines the suburbs of Crewdson’s world as malicious; symbolically or fictionally, it has broken down the last defenses of one unlucky inhabitant.
DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES
“The first thing I think about is depression,” says Chaitanya Lakkimsetti, an enthusiastic young College Fellow in Women and Gender Studies (WGS) who teaches classes on topics ranging from the sex industry to gender politics. As an educator in WGS with a Ph.D. in sociology, Lakkimsetti’s interpretation focuses on feminist theory and psychology. “I think about Betty Friedan’s work from ‘The Feminine Mystique’ and the suburban housewife’s life,” she says. “I’m also thinking about how grotesque [the woman in the picture] is, and I’m not sure how to interpret that. If her grotesqueness is a way to represent depression, it’s almost as if she’s submerging in domesticity. She’s consumed by this ideal suburban life, a psychologically depressing space to be.”
Lakkimsetti heavily draws on Freidan’s research into suburban housewives from the 1960s, using images and ideas from Freidan’s study to explore emotions and background knowledge in the photograph. She imagines that Crewdson’s Ophelia exists in the unfulfilling world of housewives that Friedan examined. “I think it’s morning [in the photograph],” Lakkimsetti says, “and she is in her house after sending her husband and her kids away. That seems to me what I see in this—this whole idea of this idealized feminine domesticity.” Theory is the primary organizing force in this response, as Friedan’s study creates the lens through which Lakkimsetti views Crewdson’s morbid scene.
The suburban housewives are supposed to be happy to have this suburban home and a middle class lifestyle and a husband and a child,” she says. “As Betty Friedan says, the ‘problem without a name’ is that women are supposed to feel good about [their lives] but are not feeling fulfilled. They go to psychiatrists and therapy, but therapists … they’ll never acknowledge the women’s feelings of depression or lack of identity. This is what the picture presents for me.” A variety of disciplines coalesce in Lakkimsetti’s interpretation, which fits the interdisciplinary approach of her department.
The woman’s death in the photograph symbolizes the inner struggle of the housewife, Lakkimsetti says, in her attempt to overcome the oppressive expectations engendered by her role in society. “A certain idealized domesticity does [this] to a middle-class housewife.”
SHAM CEILING
For philosophy graduate student Aleksy I.V. Tarasenko-Struc, it is the synthesis of various details in the photograph that merit consideration. Taking advantage of the last warm days of the year, he is conducting office hours under a fiery red tree in the Yard when I approach him. He admits to me outright that there’s no real philosophical connection he can draw between this photograph and his studies, but he is intrigued nonetheless.
“[The photograph] seems to be about the kind of dazed paralysis that you might think is a piece of this kind of lifestyle,” he muses. “I sort of like how the figure is ... tacked on as an afterthought onto the rest of the image.” What lifestyle is he referring to—just a domestic one? Instead of specifying a time period or a cultural marker like suburbia, Tarasenko-Struc first makes a claim about the aura of the photograph, finding a unifying theme into which Ophelia is projected.
Our conversation reveals stranger elements to the picture that I had overlooked. “I like how the wall kind of gives way to this kind of patch of color,” Aleksy says, pointing at the amorphous ceiling.
“The ceiling reflects the water,” I suggest. “It doesn’t look like a real ceiling.”
He nods. “It looks like it’s taken from a watercolor painting. I like that. It makes this look like a diorama—it kind of no longer looks like a real home once you notice that. I like how it’s cut into three distinct parts—here’s the ceiling, there’s the home part, and there’s pool of water.”
“It’s kind of like a landscape,” I say. “A landscape inside a diorama.” This confusion of settings is key to the mystery of the photograph, which I realize is one of the elements that drew me to the picture to begin with. Its compelling to think about which elements remove the image from the real world and imbue it with a dreamlike sorrow.
OVERCOOKED STAGING
Art interpretation within the English department offered a completely different approach. Some faculty searched for meaning in terms of composition or theory, while others latched directly onto the Shakespearean reference and built their analysis of the photograph around their grounding in literature.
“This is a riff on [John Everett] Millais’ Ophelia,” writes Ernest Bernbaum Professor of literature Daniel Albright in an e-mail, referring to the English painter’s famous 1852 image of the doomed character. In his analysis, Albright focuses in on the formal elements of the photograph and draws meaning from the basic composition. “This Ophelia seems about to fall through the shiny reflective floor,” Albright offers, “as if the surface tension of our commonplace lives were so weak that we were all in danger of drowning if we relaxed our vigilance.”
In “Hamlet,” the majority of the action is contained within the increasingly tension-filled walls of a castle, Professor of English Gordon Teskey reminded me in an e-mail. Yet Ophelia’s death occurs outdoors—Ophelia sings songs and weaves flowers into her hair until her demise. Her death, immersed in the natural world, stands in contrast to the rest of the play, which divorces itself from nature through its ubiquitous indoor setting.
“In ‘Hamlet,’” Teskey writes, “the drowning of Ophelia is a catastrophe that precedes and is necessary to the catastrophe of the whole play. But Ophelia’s catastrophe is disconcertingly reported by Queen Gertrude in exceptionally lyrical, beautiful language. The scene that is painted in this language of Gertrude’s is outdoors, where a willow tree hangs over a stream.” Focusing on language in his interpretation, Teskey draws out the differences between the deaths of the two versions of Ophelia—the Shakespearean nature-death, and the Crewdson death, which is as unnatural as a death can be.
Not all English professors, however, were as impressed by Crewdson’s reworking of a classic image. For Visiting Professor of English Henri Cole, the crudeness of the death was inauthentic. “It seems kind of kitschy,” he writes in an e-mail. “[It is] stagey and directive—why not a collie, instead of a woman in a slip?—and overcooked, like meat.”
Shirley Carter Burden Professor of Photography Robin E. Kelsey also criticized the photograph for being overly theatrical. “What cultural work might this pastiche of pre-Raphaelitism and cinematic fantasy be doing?” he asked in an e-mail. “Is it staging the very unconsciousness that it requires to be taken seriously as art? I have my doubts.”
DEATH AND EUPHORIA
Visual and Environmental Studies Visiting Lecturer David W. Hilliard studied with and worked alongside Crewdson at Yale University. Hilliard talks about the childhood influences that led to Crewdson’s fascination with suburbia. “I don’t think I can be as objective as some people,” he says about the photograph, “because I know so much about the process. When I look at the photograph, I immediately think about what I know about him. His father was a psychotherapist, and he’d meet people in his home office. Gregory would listen through the door and floorboards as kid, and he picked up on some strange things. His work is the analysis of what he heard through walls, as well as his love of film, fiction, and art. The image is a distillation.” There is the difference between fact and conjecture in the biography Hilliard provides and the intelligent analysis offered by other Harvard professors.
“When I look at the couch in the photo, it looks like a therapist’s couch,” Hilliard says, guessing that Crewdson took this childhood image he associated with his father’s practice and transplanted it into his probing photograph. “The suburban living room also is reminiscent of the work of Steven Spielberg with his focus on twilight stuff,” he says. “Crewdson consistently employs ‘twilight’ as a narrative tool in his works … this light often acts as metaphor for passage, loss, fear, obscurity, and wonder.” Hilliard’s focus on the effect of light makes sense, coming from his own background in photography. Yet it also harkens to the philosophical perspective I heard from Aleksy, where the effect of the water’s reflection and framing were essential to the piece’s underlying meaning.
While Cole and Kelsey criticized Crewdson’s work for being derivative and overly theatrical, Hilliard suggests that the conceptual elements that motivate these criticisms are the key to understanding Crewdson’s work. In a sense, his work is intentionally overdone. “He loves the production [process] so much. These elaborate sets would be built. He loves hiring a set crew, actors, and assistants. An incredible cast of characters comes together for one photograph, which is really just a still from a film. In a way it’s strange. I think in some reviews he’s been criticized: where a film director would have a movie, he gets a slice. But that’s what he likes.”
“Photography, unlike a film, allows you to linger on just one thing,” Hilliard says. “Instead of a series of images, you get one image that you project the whole movie onto. Depending on your history or your perspective as viewer, you can look at and think of Shakespeare, Spielberg, domesticity, gender, or women’s issues … I like that they’re so open to interpretation yet so simple.” This summary of the photograph highlights its ultimate ambiguity. “Untitled (Ophelia)” can yield a vast array of interpretations, each one equally nuanced and important for reaching a multi-perspective understanding. The essential components shared by different sensibilities elucidate the most important parts of the picture—its commentary on suburbia, its filmic narrative.
Hilliard also teaches me something new about this photograph I love. To create the illusion of deep water, Crewdson cut off the legs of furniture and actually flooded the set only a few inches deep. “She’s drowning in nothing,” Hilliard says. “She is probably lying on the floor.” For its barrage of interpretive violence, the theatrical setup is more functional and simple than imagined.  “You don’t think about it at first, but she’s drowning psychologically, not physically. She looks like she could be alive. It’s death and euphoria at the same time.”

Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Allen J. MacLeod ’14
Produced by Sara Kantor ’14
How do aesthetics relate to identity? “The Shape of Things”, written by Neil LaBute, aims to decipher this obscure and long-prodded question. This Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production, directed by Allen J. MacLeod ’14, takes a sparse, character-focused look at such unsettled thematic questions through the lens of a rapidly disintegrating relationship.
Adam (Tony J. Sterle ’11) is a socially awkward, literature-loving student who has never been in a serious relationship. He catches Evelyn (Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12), a Master of Fine Arts graduate student, defacing a piece of artwork at the museum where he works, and due to that chance meeting the two start dating. When Adam starts changing on Evelyn’s request—first his hair, then his weight, then his nose—her motives, and their relationship, come into question.
By staging the play all in white, MacLeod locates the play’s dramatic center in its characters. “There are certain shows that are a spectacle. This is not one of them. This show is about the characters, their interactions, and their story,” says MacLeod. “I want the audience to shape their own vision of what’s happening on stage.”
The play toys with ideas about art and its motives as well as the subjectivity of relationships by breaking down the distinction between the two in a way that is disturbing yet ultimately satisfying. “This play is going to shock you because it’s something that could happen to anyone. You think something is so real and so right, but it isn’t,” says Leonie A. Oostrom ’15, who plays Jenny, Adam’s college friend. The play “makes you think twice about what is means to be in a relationship and look at yourself in the mirror,” says Rossi.
Although the play deals with intellectually heavy topics like the meaning of art and power dynamics, in the underbelly of it all is a “love story that is funny,” says Rossi. Like all LaBute’s best plays, “The Shape of Things” is fraught with black humor, capable of making the worst of situations relatable and humorous. “The show is very relevant to the people here,” says MacLeod. “It has a lot to do with self-image and what people are willing to do to fit in.”

“No plan. No money. No relevant experience.” That is all Robert Hammond and Joshua David started with in 1999, when they decided that the abandoned High Line railroad in New York had to be saved. On Tuesday, November 8, Hammond confessed this humble beginning at a talk he gave at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD). However, he claimed that the success of High Line Park can be attributed to his lack of a concrete plan.
“The process from imagining something to getting it done is very interesting, like how to finance it, but also just the architectural design,” said Jaclyn Sachs, a student at the GSD. Hammond took his audience through every stage of the enormous undertaking, starting with the history of the elevated railroad.
Built in 1934, the High Line transported loads of meat and other perishable food products from the Meatpacking District up Tenth Avenue to West 34th Street until it was abandoned in 1980. For the next 20 years, the High Line played host to a wide variety of New York native weeds and grasses, but little else. From the bottom, the High Line looks like an ugly overpass. One attendee at Hammond’s talk, GSD student Nick S. Hornig, said that he can remember living in New York in 1998, the year before city officials moved to demolish the High Line, and having to look at the gaunt structure. To those who lived in the neighborhood, the High Line was just a large, iron reminder that they did not live in a very nice area. To Hammond and David, however, the High Line was beautiful and had great potential—but neither had a clue what that potential could turn into.
The first thing the two “neighborhood nobodies”—as Hammond humorously referred to himself and his partner—did was to make a logo for their cause. “It gave us a feeling that we were more than we were,” Hammond said. The next step was to gain support for the project, which turned out to be the toughest part. Many residents wanted to build stores or apartments where the High Line currently stands, and it took a lot of lawyers and publicity before Hammond and David could even begin planning the future of the High Line. “You can stop anything with lawyers,” Hammond said.
“I gained more insight about the fundraising process and support gathering than I did about urban design,” Molly K. Cooney-Mesker, a student of Urban Planning at Tufts University, said of the talk. Hammond did talk a lot about mustering enthusiasm and ideas from New York City residents, public think tanks, and professional architects. He and David organized an international design competition during which they received designs for theme parks, prisons, roller coasters, and even a mile-long lap pool. For Hammond, the wide range of assistance and advice they received were a direct—and beneficial—consequence of his lack of experience or cohesive vision for the High Line.
Ultimately, Hammond and David decided that what was unique about the High Line was its historic wildness, and it is this aspect that the Park preserves so beautifully. There are simple stone planks that jut out unevenly along the path, overgrown grasses, and benches rising right out of the old railway tracks. Visitors flock to the park for that bit of green, a bird’s-eye glimpse of Tenth Avenue late at night, or the opportunity to observe fellow New Yorkers lounging and strolling. “I realized right after we opened it that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line … New Yorkers don’t hold hands. We just don’t do that outside,” Hammond said in a Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) talk earlier this year.
“To come back 10 years later to this whole transformation is really amazing. Just the ripple effect it’s had on the community,” said Hornig. Today, there are approximately 40 new construction sites along the High Line, and local businesses are only getting more customers. Even the rent on surrounding apartments is increasing significantly, though the park only opened in 2009.
Now, almost 13 years after Hammond and David met to save the historic wasteland, the High Line attracts nearly 150,000 New Yorkers every week to its meandering pathways and art installations. The “neighborhood nobody” with “no plans, no money, and no relevant experience,” left his audience with an encouraging message: Hammond hopes that what he and David have done with the High Line will inspire other regular people to get out there and do something permanent and good for their communities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A blind, beaked insect surges through the soil upward in search of his grandfather. A young boy desperately searches for the secret to making cotton candy out of thin air. A dog, craving attention from his owner, suffers from his master’s psychological deterioration. Can Xue masterfully juxtaposes these situations in her complex and descriptive short story collection, “Vertical Motion.”
Can Xue is a self-proclaimed “soul writer.” Her work is a portal that “focuses on the human soul, not on the outside superficial world,” Xue said in an interview with the website ChinaCulture.org. Her tales are impressionistic and surreal, her language commanding and her plots rife with striking and bizarre images. In “Vertical Motion,” translated by Karen Gernant and Chen Zeping, Xue adds to her already impressive oeuvre, and in doing so once again demonstrates her ingenuity and her firm grasp of literary craft.
The stories are initially perplexing: they are infused with emotion, but filled with plot holes. The main focus of each story seems not to be the logical progression of a narrative arc, but rather the development of the setting and characters. Each story feels unfinished, building up to a resolution that never comes. While each tale fantastically delves into the psyches of its characters, and despite Xue’s trenchant descriptions, the stories become frustratingly confusing and conclude unsatisfactorily. In the end, Xue’s tableaux, though beautifully developed, never reach their full potential and leave us yearning for more.
The greatest strength in Xue’s writing lies in her ability to create truly captivating magical realist descriptions. In “An Affectionate Companion’s Jottings,” the narrator, a dog, describes his owner with his sharpened canine senses: “I can hear all his pores growling, and his eyes are flashing a fluorescent green.” Xue’s creativity with descriptive language is as innovative as that of the American writers Ray Bradbury and John Steinbeck; her experiments with synesthesia result in strikingly detailed backgrounds for her insubstantial plots. But her creativity does not end with her colorful language—another  innovation is her inclusion of uncommon points of view. For example, the first story in her collection, the eponymous “Vertical Motion,” is told from the perspective of the aforementioned insect burrowing deep underground. “An Affectionate Companion’s Jottings” is told from a dog’s point of view. In “Moonlight Dance,” the narrator remains an ambiguous, almost omniscient being until Xue reveals that he is (or rather, might be) the same wormlike creature from the very first story. Xue’s experimental style means that there is no telling how she may begin her next story—it seems like anything goes.
But despite the sophisticated concepts of her stories, the language is simplistic, almost childlike. There is little variety in her lexicon; additionally, the redundant sentence structure quickly becomes tedious. Sentences are short, and pronouns are excessive. Readers might find themselves quickly skimming through a paragraph whose content merits close scrutiny simply because there is nothing compelling about the language to keep them reading. Though the translation may simply not capture the complexity of the stories in Mandarin, it is undeniable the language in this translation of Xue’s collection is merely adequate.
Additionally, rampant plot holes seem to permeate the book. The narrator often introduces bizarre twists in the middle of a story. In “Cotton Candy,” for example, a previously innocent and calm child “seized hold of [a small child]” and ordered her to “… shake out one [piece of cotton candy] … and give it to me!” This unforeseen act of violence is never explained, and remains incongruous with the behavior of a character who had previously seemed kind and generous. “The Brilliant Purple China Rose” features another awkward scene: after Mei gets lost in a city and finds her husband Jin after desperately searching for the way back, she neither embraces nor thanks her husband, but instead asks an entirely irrelevant question: “What kind of fish are these?” Moments like these jar and frustrate. While a few inconsistencies may have been marginally excusable, the entire book is riddled with these strange scenes.
Xue’s take on magical realism is irrefutably unique; her style is reminiscent of Gabriel García Márquez, but reimagines his plot-centered fantasies by focusing more exclusively on description. Unfortunately, her anthology “Vertical Motion” neglects the fiction writer’s imperative to offer a solid conclusion. Like a surrealist painting, “Vertical Motion” is nonsensical yet vibrant. While it is able to command attention in the beginning with its otherworldly descriptions, the lack of coherent plotlines and sophisticated language ultimately undermine its ability to captivate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The physical movements of chimpanzees and their researchers are the last place where you would expect to find a haunting exploration of humanity itself.
In “CryHurtFood,” a tense and moving new play written and directed by Daniel J. Giles ’13, actors skillfully deconstruct the boundaries between human and ape through expressive modern dance.  The play traces the life of Lucy (Mariel N. Pettee ’14), a chimpanzee, as she is shunted from a failed research initiative to an inhumane rehabilitation center and from there to a jungle island filled with wild chimpanzees and Janis (Margaret C. Kerr ’13), the last human researcher. Through all these locales, the play tracks the evolution of Lucy’s identity as she is manipulated by a series of scientists.
The cast is composed of only six actors, but their roles vary unpredictably along the entire spectrum between chimpanzee and human. A calm researcher in one moment is a thoroughly chilling, deranged chimpanzee in the next; a balloon twisting circus chimpanzee, silent in life, can offer lengthy verbal advice and narration from beyond the grave. Animal identity is fluid in the play, and humanity even more so.  Both come and go unannounced,  in a seamless and seemingly effortless performance by the entire cast.
In the chaos of a crumbling marriage in the wake of a baby’s death, researchers Maurice (Ben J. Lorenz ‘14) and Jane (Georgina B. Parfitt ‘13) perform an ‘experiment’ and attempt to raise chimpanzee Lucy as a human child. Not one of the three scientists involved in the process of raising Lucy can decide on a measure by which to judge the success of the experiment. Is a chimpanzee more human if it is totally obedient? If it can brew tea? If it can tell a lie?
No one criterion emerges from the milieu of opinions, but a color-coded wardrobe helpfully illustrates the divides.  Researchers interested in humanity as mirrors of themselves wear vivid combinations of colors, like a hastily fixed rainbow-striped tie; researchers interested in controllable results wear professional clothing in muted colors. Chimpanzees similarly wear clothing to reflect their personalities, from a tie-dye leotard to business casual.  While costuming coordination can seem heavy-handed, the stark division of color is helpful and perhaps necessary in a play ridden with shifting identites and opinions.
The actors’ finest moments are almost wholly physical rather than verbal. Pettee, Sam B. Clark ’15,  and Kathleen S. O’Beirne ’15, who all play chimpanzees at some point in the production, gracefully and convincingly make the species switch—complete with gut-wrenching screeching. At one point Clark portrays a destructive, neurotic chimpanzee, throws large objects, and leaps several feet high in the air, all while screaming at the top of his lungs. His performance in this scene was deeply disturbing, especially after a first act filled with docile, fairly happy chimpanzees in human captivity.
Modern dance scenes choreographed by Pettee periodically arise between dialogues.  These interludes serve to frighten, thrill, and connect audiences with the internal pain and suffering of the characters.  Part of the play involves a trip downstairs to a dance studio for a more expansive dance and motion scene. Strobe lights flash, chimpanzee-actors scream, and tables flip—all less than two feet from the audience.  The uninhibited movement and force in this production, especially in the confined setting of the Loeb Experimental Theater, convey the intense emotions associated with a struggle to find humanity better than any of the dialogue.
In one particularly poignant scene, Janis struggles to lift chimpanzee Lucy from a knuckled stance to mirror her own bipedal posture. Lucy cannot stand upright without the support of Janis, and both collapse to the ground several times. In the intimate space of the Loeb Ex, the thuds that the actors make as they slam into the stage, over and over and over again, are a nervewracking and profound physical rendering of the play’s central themes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We rarely experience a newsworthy event firsthand; rather, we encounter and consume it through breaking news reports, caps-locked headlines, montages of video clips, grim reporters, and emotional interviews. As we have seen, perhaps nothing provokes such instantaneous spectacle as surely as terrorism. It is this relationship between terror and spectacle that the exhibition “The Uncanny Familiar – Images of Terror” explores. The exhibition, whose opening corresponded with the 10-year anniversary of 9/11, is currently on view at C/O Berlin.
Such an exhibition must be careful of two obvious potential pitfalls. First, it risks becoming a mere extension of the very spectacle culture it purports to critique. Second, by representing terrorism in a contemporary art space, it risks aestheticizing and fetishizing these images of terror. “The Uncanny Familiar” is guilty of both, but not disastrously so. Ultimately the exhibition’s inconsistencies grant it great variety, which in turn allows for more nuanced and critical conversation.
The exhibition begins with the Munich Olympics and continues on through car bombing, hostage taking, and plane hijacking, before ending with 9/11 on the second floor. The central theme—how Terror proliferates within contemporary society—is better addressed by the program text than by most of the exhibition. Most of the works are dry, academic, and anemic. Images of chaos and debris are shown alongside polished advertisements and a montage of movie clips featuring the Twin Towers. The wall text spews out rhetorical questions: What is real and what is fiction? How do these images enter our collective unconsciousness? Is there a norm for how these subjects are depicted and how we then see them? The problem with these questions is not that they shouldn’t be asked, but that they are utterly generic; they could be asked of any exhibition of photography. For “The Uncanny Familiar” in particular, to be generic is not only to deny the charged tenor of the topic, but also to avoid acknowledging that the exhibition itself runs the risk of enabling this phenomenon of spectacular terror.
Though the medium of video would seem to be most obviously implicated in the perpetuation of this spectacle, it is also the only medium in which this exhibition adequately confronts the issue. Johan Grimonprez’s “Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y” (1997) intercuts animation, commercials, instructional video snippets, and movie clips with chronologically arranged news footage, suggesting connections between commercialism and sensationalism, the culture industry and mass media, film and spectacle, and spectacle and terror. The narrator speaks only two or three sentences at a time, encouraging even the most distracted viewer to consider his words. He conjectures that now we conceive of and live our lives as if for a film, that violence is the only act society takes seriously, that history is what we hear on the news.
Whereas “Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y” relies on lyricism, wittiness, and clever film editing to critique our society as enabling terror, Robert Boyd’s “Xanadu” (2006) does not so much criticize this conflation of terror and spectacle as exemplify and amplify it. Concentration camp corpses flop into mass graves, militias march, the Manson Family struts, bodies shudder at the force of bullets, religious fanatics rave, people plunge from the Twin Towers, and choreographed masses in the USSR, America, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China parade to disco beats across three screens in a full-room installation complete with disco ball. The manic montage sprints to an apocalyptic end, before Olivia Newton-John and Britney Spears start up again.
Boyd is critical, pointing out the absurdity inherent in our culture and spinning it to its grotesque extreme, but I wonder if such a position is productive. Can deliberate provocation do more than strengthen the culture of spectacle and up the ante for what we can already, staggeringly, tolerate? Can spectacle be used to overwhelm itself?
Fiorenza Menini’s “Untitled” (2001) represents the Twin Towers immediately after their fall, shrouded in dust and smoke. The camera hardly moves. The 28-minute video is devoid of sound, people, or digital manipulation. Our view of the spectacle is obscured by the event itself. It is harder to sit through than either “Xanadu” or “Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y;” by comparison, it is relentlessly boring. Music and shrill voices call from other videos in the exhibition. I got up before I forced myself to sit back down, alone in the empty room. “Untitled” writes us into the ghastly roles we fulfill daily, roles in the horrid inescapable system in which we are both victims and perpetrators. To leave “Untitled,” I decided, was to admit my dependence on spectacle. To stay was to confirm my role as a spectator.
“Conclusion: not every fact should be exploited from the spectator’s point of view. There are facts that cannot be viewed through binoculars,” wrote Osip Brik about film in 1925. The example he used was a man hitting another man.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the late 1990s, a French woman called Denise Epstein decided to investigate the contents of a suitcase that had gathered dust in her apartment for some 50 years. To her surprise, she discovered the unpublished manuscript of a novel her mother—the forgotten novelist Irène Némirovsky, wildly successful in France between the two world wars—had not been able to polish before her deportation to Auschwitz in the summer of 1942. Shortly thereafter, Epstein saw to it that “Suite Française,” which contains only two of its intended five parts, was published in France, where it appeared in 2004 to tremendous acclaim. Two years later, Némirovsky’s long-lost novel was released in the United States, where it became an overnight sensation, spent over 30 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, and inspired Universal Studios to purchase the rights for a film adaptation.
After “Suite Française” became such a staggering success in both France and the United States and Irène Némirovsky, a posthumous celebrity, was inducted into the pantheon of Holocaust literary martyrs, her publishers naturally began to reissue her earlier novels that had been published in her lifetime. Many of these, however, were not as well received as “Suite Française” had been: they are pithier, more ironic, and even polemical. What is more, these novels—especially her first, “David Golder,” published in 1929—suggest an understanding of Judaism a bit too uncomfortable for modern readers. After all, Némirovsky is often more than unkind to her Jewish characters: she belittles them, she marginalizes them, and, in her caustic employment of basic physical caricature, she treats them as fundamentally other.
This tendency has led readers to ponder the enigmas and contradictions of her life. Indeed, was Irène Némirovsky, herself a Jewish victim of the Shoah, also an anti-Semite?
On both sides of the Atlantic, critics have rushed to answer the question in both the affirmative and the negative. Ruth Franklin, for instance, writing in The New Republic, called Némirovsky “the very definition of a self-hating Jew” who “owed her success in France entre deux guerres in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of reaction, to the fascist right.” On the other side of the coin, in a recent biography of Némirovsky largely written to apologize for her, Patrick Lienhardt and Olivier Philipponat conclude their segment on her first novel with the following: “Had David Golder been written in 2009 by Bernard Maddoff’s daughter, who would dream of accusing her of anti-Semitic views?”
For the most part, the literature and commentary on Némirovsky that have appeared since 2004 attempts either to substantiate or dismiss the charges of anti-Semitism leveled against the woman whose work, it seems, has become a veritable battleground for the passionate conflicts of literary politics. One book, however, has the potential to shift the tone of the debate over Némirovsky from a conceivably eternal dispute over her alleged anti-Semitism to a reasoned interpretation of the woman and the writer herself.
This, in my mind, is “The Mirador,” the beautiful, poetic, imagined autobiography of Némirovsky by none other than her youngest daughter, Élisabeth Gille. Originally published in France in 1992, Le Mirador is now available in English for the first time, thanks to a supple, graceful translation from Marina Harss.
As a “dreamed memory” of mother by daughter, the autobiography is perhaps—as an inhabitation and recreation of the subject’s mind—the same sort of recollection Némirovsky would have written had she survived the war. Although, of course, “The Mirador” carries with it all the emotional weight of a daughter’s grieving monument to her mother, it also makes no effort to accuse or to apologize for Némirovsky’s fraught relationship with her Jewishness, a subject of which Gille is not only aware but one that she bravely confronts head-on.
Consider, for instance, a scene from a 1933 dinner party hosted in Némirovsky’s sumptuous apartment in the tony Seventh Arrondissement. Writing in her mother’s voice, Gille recreates a tense conversation that occurs over coffee at the end of the meal, in which the American psychiatrist Alfred Adler condemns an editorial’s suggestion that the French government create concentration camps for Jewish and foreign refugees. However, the members of the Parisian haut-bourgeoisie present—including the writer and philosopher Emmanuel Berl—do not necessarily agree. Like Némirovsky herself, they maintain a distinction between assimilated, upper class French Jews and the impoverished, traditional Eastern European Jews that poured into France en masse after the 1880s (the same group, it should be said, that Némirovsky ridicules in her early novels).
Gille’s imagination of her mother, however, does not avoid prejudices and delusions: “I must admit that I shared Berl’s opinion,” her character of Némirovsky writes. “I did not take measure of his blindness or my own until 1940 […] At the time, we had completely forgotten that we were Israelites.”
There is also, of course, much to be made of Némirovsky’s controversial conversion to Catholicism in 1939, and Gille’s rendition is perhaps the crowning achievement of “The Mirador.” “I decided to be baptized,” Némirovsky tells us with a remarkable degree of honest finality. “Did I do so out of conviction or opportunism? Today I can no longer say which it was.” Going even further, the voice of Irène explains that “it was because I wanted to close the remaining gap between myself and the rationality of my choice.”
In that sense, Gille’s imagination portrays the conversion an act of self-definition, an attempt to assert a kind of individual agency against the various labels an unwelcoming French society forced upon her mother as a Russian immigrant, a woman writer, and, finally, as a Jew. “This was the past I wanted to break away from by being baptized,” Irène reflects, “but as we can see, it has stuck with me to this day.”
Indeed it has. What makes this particular moment in “The Mirador” so poignant and so powerful is that it casts the current debate over Némirovsky’s identity in a similar light as the one that occurred toward the end of her own lifetime. Just as during the Nazi Occupation of France she was marked a “Jew”—a label she did not wish to wear and a category from which she could never manage to escape—she is today often marked as an “anti-Semite,” a label just as deterministic. In neither discussion is she taken on her own terms, and nowhere is she allowed to speak for herself. Nowhere, that is, except for “The Mirador,” which affords Irène Némirovsky the voice she was denied in her own lifetime and also, it seems, in our own.
Regardless of how long the debate over Némirovsky’s identity continues, Gille’s “autobiography” of her mother—and Harss’s new translation—accomplishes the remarkable feat of establishing Némirovsky’s voice—even in this imagined form—as an important participant in that discussion.
In a sense, through “The Mirador,” Irène Némirovsky has spoken at long last. Let us hope that the reading public pauses to listen.

Jonathan Schakel is an organist, harpsichordist, and pianist, and serves as the director of music for Westminster Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, Va. A graduate of the Longy School of Music, he has given organ recitals all over America as well as in Germany.
On Thursday, Schakel returned to Cambridge to give a midday organ recital featuring Johann Sebastian Bach, Dieterich Buxtehude, and others at Harvard’s Adolphus Busch Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: To start off, what was the organ like in Busch Hall?
Jonathan Schakel: The organ really just sounds fantastic. It’s a lot of fun to play, and to me, it’s not very hard to play. When I come down to it and pull out any of the [organ] stops, everything sounds great. I’d never been to Busch Hall either, and it’s just a fabulous space.
THC: What is it specifically about the organ that makes it unique among symphonic instruments?
JS: I think it’s unique that there are so many different sounds at one performer’s disposal. Instruments can always vary the sounds a little bit—you know, a violin can put on a mute, and trumpets have different mutes, and they can change sounds a little bit. But an organ just has such a wide range of timbres. I think that’s the organ’s real strength when you compare it to other instruments. As one performer, you can play the complete piece in the sense that you can do polyphonic music with four parts. If you have strings, you need at least four different performers.
THC: Are those distinctive qualities of the organ the things that have drawn you to the instrument, or are there other things you find appealing as well?
JS: I think that an instrument just has to suit your personality. I’m not entirely sure what about the organ suits mine … You have to control all the different parts and keep everything straight, and on top of that … you’re changing stops during [the performance] … So I think in a way it’s a lot more cerebral than other instruments. And maybe that’s part of what appeals to me. I think also, for me, it’s the sort of music that’s written for [the organ]. When I was studying the piano, I thought you have to play Chopin and you have to play Beethoven, and that was fine, but I wasn’t really in love with it. And I think with the organ—especially with Bach and the early composers—there’s just so much fantastic music that’s written for it.
THC: You mentioned some of the composers that traditionally write for organ. What parts of the organ repertoire do you generally like performing the most?
JS: I really love the Baroque music and that early music, so I play a lot of that. But I’ve also enjoyed playing some of the modern stuff, the early 20th-century composers.
THC: What are a few specific aspects that you really enjoy about those areas of the repertoire?
JS: I guess in the Baroque music I really love how the polyphony is combined in these different ways—it’s music that’s like speaking. There’s this sort of language to it that you can articulate through how you play. It sort of communicates in its own way, and I really love that part of it. The modern stuff is wonderful—like Duruflé, Vierne, those composers. The music is just really wonderful because of the sound of it, the timbres, especially when you have a big organ in a big space. It’s really more music of timbre and sound, and that’s something I enjoy.
THC: To wrap things up, how’s your time at Harvard been? Is this your first time coming here?
JS: I did my master’s degree at Longy, just down the road. So I’ve been to Harvard before, and I’ve used the music library. It’s a great library, and it’s a great university. It’s been a lot of fun to come back for me. I haven’t played the organ here, so that was a big treat for me. It was great to come back to my old graduate school and to see everything again.

James Levine’s untimely resignation as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) has been mourned by many. But as the season progresses, the BSO has proved again and again that it can bring out the hidden boon in what may have been a crippling incident for lesser groups. The vacancy in the conductor position has allowed the BSO to enlist the help of some of the best musicians in the world. On November 10, Korean conductor Myung-Whun Chung and pianist Garrick Ohlsson joined forces with the BSO in an impeccable performance of works by Carl Maria von Weber, Samuel Barber, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The ensemble’s trademark explosive power with Maestro Chung’s restrained, almost minimalistic conducting was simply magical.
Chung had the audience members on the edge of their seats from the very beginning. The program began with the Overture to Weber’s opera “Der Freischütz,” which is about a marksman who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for unfaltering aim. Its scoring in the first few bars is slow and dramatic enough, yet Chung slowed it down even more than is done in classic interpretations—by conductors like Carlos Kleiber and Wilhelm Furtwängler—to amazing effect: every orchestral nuance was magnified by the deliberate tempo.
The BSO was with Chung all the way, responding immediately to his every measured gesture. Chung allowed the orchestra the rare opportunity to show off its dynamic mastery by paying special attention to the decrescendos rather than the crescendos. However, when the music called for fortissimos Chung and the BSO were right there as well, with Chung effortlessly abandoning his earlier restrained space of motion in favor of large, theatrical movements. Contrasted with the stillness of other parts, these phrases seemed all the more passionate and excited. They hit the mark with this piece—as they did with the remaining works of the night.
Ohlsson, a BSO favorite—already having performed concertos by 12 different composers with the group—was more than up to the challenge of taking the stage after such a magnetic first piece. The rapport between the BSO and Ohlsson was particularly apt for Barber’s Piano Concerto. Unlike in traditional concertos, which feature a definite, almost antagonistic tension between soloist and orchestra, in this piece the pianist has a more symbiotic relationship with the orchestra. Motifs were passed between piano and orchestra fluidly, one mirroring the other. Though this kind of style puts a soloist in a precarious position, Ohlsson impressed nonetheless. He projected large chords with seemingly effortless strength. One moment his playing was percussive, but the next it was soaring and melodic.
The winds and brass were in top shape throughout. The brass provided the rhythmic support before the cadenza in the first movement with unity and precision and cleared the sonic palette for Ohlsson. The trio of flute, oboe, and harp in the beginning of second movement featured just the right amount of vibrato from the winds. None of the erratic tuning that seems to plague the trombones and trumpets of the BSO during fortissimos on other occasions was to be found in that evening’s performance.
This contributed in large part to the brilliance of the ensemble’s interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s oft-performed Symphony no. 6 in B minor “Pathétique.” Every wind soloist brought integrity to his solo line; the bassoon solo of the introduction was especially notable in this regard.
As in the Weber, Chung took ample advantage of silence between phrases in this piece. Those who were in Symphony Hall that night will probably remember the final bars of the Symphony for a very long time. Following the descending theme by the cellos and basses and the final notes, Chung held his left hand over the orchestra—and at that moment he was presiding over not only the BSO but also the whole of Symphony Hall. All was obediently silent in anticipation for a good 30 seconds after the end of the piece. Only when Chung lowered his hands to his side did the audience explode into much-deserved applause.

Film is in a constant state of transformation. As the medium evolves, the interest in creating film has witnessed a surge in popularity as well. With the birth of the first major film festival in Venice in 1932, film festivals of varying missions and causes have cropped up throughout the world and have continued to attract a growing number of submissions and audiences every year.
One such film festival is the Boston Asian American Film Festival (BAAFF). This weekend witnessed BAAFF’s third run with a premiere at Harvard Square’s Brattle Theatre. BAAFF came together with the help of nearly 20 community-based organizations in the greater Boston area, though it was started by the Asian American Resource Workshop, an organization that seeks to document the diverse histories, experiences, and social conditions of Asian-Pacific-Americans.
“I often get the response, ‘We have one of those?’” said BAAFF Co-Director Yvonne Ng, in regard to the presence of the Boston Asian American Film Festival. “This is the first year where we’re doing year-long programming [for the film festival],” she says, expressing hope that the film festival will continue to grow and become an annual event. “We have the ‘Short Waves’ competition coming up in the spring, too, as another resource for Asian-American filmmakers, and the winner of ‘Short Waves’ will have their short featured in next year’s Boston Asian American Film Festival.”
A prolific actor who has played over 500 roles during his 57-year-long career, James Hong is in Boston for his first extended stay to work on “R.I.P.D.,” an upcoming film that will also feature Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges. This past Friday, Hong visited BAAFF to participate in a question and answer–format discussion moderated by Al Young, a copy editor on the Night News Desk of the Boston Globe. Hong shared insight regarding his own experiences in Hollywood.
“The man we have today has been called the man of 1,000 faces,” Young said at the start of the discussion. “There are 18 pages on Mr. Hong’s films and credits [on the Internet Movie Database] … but unlike Cheers, the little bar across the street, not everyone knows his name.”
Hong discussed his journey from Hong Kong to California, where he frequented bars and delivered stand-up comedy performances before he got his first break on the television show “You Bet Your Life” for his impeccable impersonation of Groucho Marx. Riddled with humorous comments and several demonstrations of some of his best-known roles—such as Mr. Ping, the adoptive father of protagonist Po in “Kung Fu Panda”—Hong’s responses also carried a sobering tone. Of his work in the French film “L’Idole (The Idol),” Hong said, “Why is it that in the U.S., an Asian man never gets to be the leading man? Here I am in Paris and I am able to be a leading man. [But in the U.S.,] even after 57 years of being rescued by the white hero, things haven’t really changed. I want all of you to make your own films and turn things around. I don’t see too many activities in terms of filmmaking here in Boston. If you have talent, go after it!”
When asked what roles remain on his bucket list after nearly 60 years of active work in the entertainment industry, Hong said, “Well, obviously I’d like to do another 100 roles. Maybe I can if I keep eating my herbs.” After a short pause while the audience laughed, he continued, “I’m 82 and a half [years old,] and I’m still doing this. I’d like to play a brilliant scientist, a Nobel Prize Peace winner, a father running a family, and the head of a corporation. In ‘Blade Runner,’ I was just an eyeball maker! I think we [Asian-Americans] should play leading roles, and I’d like to get into it.”
In keeping with the views presented by Hong, Lily Chan, a member of the BAAFF planning committee, remarked that the mission of BAAFF was to help empower Asian-Americans through film by providing an opportunity to showcase Asian-American experiences. “Asian-Americans haven’t really completely made it into the mainstream yet. BAAFF helps to support the [Asian-American] artists who want to take that next step.”
As film technology evolves, so to have the role and place of film in society. Film festivals have branched out to serve as a powerful tool to connect members across multiple generations and foster greater community bonds. BAAFF Co-Director Susan Chinsen closed the night with the words, “We want to encourage all of you to keep empowering our community.”

Adam Gopnik has bad news for multi-taskers.
“You cannot cook and think at the same time,” the New Yorker contributor said during a book talk at the Brattle Theatre on Thursday. “Cooking always takes the place of thought.” According to Gopnik, cooking has become Western society’s involuntary form of Zen meditation, and the process of cooking food has become just as socially important as the rituals that take place at the dinner table.
In his new book, “The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food,” Gopnik conducts a search for culinary meaning that begins in 19th-century France and makes its way to the modern American dinner table. During his talk, he explained how the structure of his book reflects that of a contemporary meal: the introductory material is his appetizer; his in-depth explorations of taste and the symbolism of food are his main course; his final anecdotes and conclusion are the dessert.
Gopnik, reading passages from “The Table Comes First,” also discussed how food writing has evolved. Explaining, he noted three different ways food appears in writing. The first, more antiquated form, uses food as punctuation in a narrative, nothing more than evidence that characters are indeed human and require nutrition. Eventually, authors began to use food to betray information about the characters eating the meal. More recently, writers have indulged in lavish descriptions of artfully prepared meals, engineered for aesthetic enjoyment. The growing popularity of the third tactic, Gopnik argued, is a result of society’s heightened fixation on food, or, as he calls it, “gastronomia.”
“Food is an increasingly obsessive subject with all of us,” he said. It is also a loaded topic, for it tells us not only about the personal tastes of the cook and diner, but about their ethics. “Every mouth taste inevitably becomes a moral taste. We have to ethicize. All of our food becomes a lesson, a parable,” Gopnik said.
Many of these reflections appear in Gopnik’s imaginary correspondence with Elizabeth Pennell, a 19th-century art and food critic for the “Pall Mall Gazette.” Gopnik read one such letter about his attempts to recreate famous literary meals, including the eponymous dish in Günter Grass’s “The Flounder.” As he continued to translate fictional dishes into tangible meals for his family, he realized that recipes, read and prepared differently by different people, are comparable to poetry and are capable of becoming characters themselves.
Gopnik also took questions from the audience, discussing emerging gastronomic methods, the appearance of the “food scene” in 19th century Paris, and the  abbreviation ‘LOL.’ Having lived in Paris for five years, Gopnik remains attached to France and its cuisine, though he believes that American culinary culture is better suited to adaptation and evolution.
His quips about topics from FOX News to pet care and child-raising did not go unappreciated by the audience. “He was funny. Funnier than the majority of writers for The New Yorker,” audience member Katherine A. Brown joked. Brown agreed with many of Gopnik’s arguments about the differences between American and European food culture. “That’s what he touched on a lot: that food is the culture [in Europe], but with our fast-paced society, it’s not like that,” Brown said. “We sit in restaurants, we get things done, and we leave. We don’t enjoy the food that we’re eating.”
Gopnik’s talk may have changed this, at least for the members of the audience. According to him, food and eating practices can reveal insights about our changing society. And more importantly, they tell us about ourselves.

On a Tuesday afternoon several years in the future, Noone U. Noh ’18 momentarily regretted his decision to enroll in three classes.
He had the entire day free (after all, he doesn’t have class on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Fridays) and was looking for someone to go to the American wing of the Museum of Fine Arts with him.
“No one had time,” he said. “One of my friends was crashing on Adderall because she had a take-home midterm, and another takes six classes and actually laughed in my face when I asked him.”
So Noh went alone—a seemingly dismal prospect that turned into an “amazing” afternoon when he met a group of Boston University students who were on a class field trip to the museum, one of whom he exchanged numbers with.
“Most of my friends will complain that no one at Harvard ever goes on dates, that everyone just hooks up. Maybe that’s because in general people don’t do much for fun other than go to parties.” He laughed. “My Tuesday date with myself turned into a date with a girl who seems way cooler than me—not a bad deal.”
Noh reports that taking three classes has also led to many remarkable academic experiences in those courses. Last week, Noh was working on a paper on “The Education of Henry Adams” for an early twentieth-century American literature class he is taking. In lecture (which, he noted somewhat pointedly, he was “able to attend every time, unlike the rest of my classmates”), the professor described the book as having “changed his life.”
“The boy sitting next to me in class, who’s an editor on the Crimson, wrote down ‘life-changing’ in his notes. Hopefully when he reads the Wikipedia summary, it has the same effect.”
In the same class, Noh came across William James’ description of “exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess success” as “our national disease,” which leads to a “moral flabbiness.”
“That applies really well to Harvard, too, I think,” he said. “I really believe that education can make you a better person, but worshipping academic success qua success doesn’t seem like the way to do that.”
Noh acknowledges downsides to his decision to take three classes. “There are many, many courses I wish I could take and things I wish I could learn about. Deciding to take only three classes meant giving things up, but I wanted to see what I could gain by giving things up. Admittedly, this isn’t a very ‘Harvard’ way of thinking about the world. But I’ve found it a really rewarding experiment.”
A growing body of education theory and sociological research supports what Noh claims by intuition: by stepping back, paring down, and focusing effort, students can become happier and more engaged in what they do. But few students internalize that advice to the point that they change their lifestyles. Part of the reason may not have to do with conscious choice: Experiments by researchers at University of North Carolina and Duke have shown that young people are significantly less realistic about over-committing time than money, for instance, even when they claim to consider carefully their options.
To Noh, the problem, at least at Harvard, has more to do with a culture of competitiveness, which emphasizes indicators of merit (which can be compared and judged) over intimations of deeper meaning (which are purely personal pleasures). The hero of this culture is the ambitious academic jerk, the student who wants his friends to know that he works harder and stresses more than any of them.
Aside from students who are completing their degrees on an expedited track for financial reasons, “taking as many classes as you can handle is one manifestation of this attitude,” he noted. “Obviously, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with taking six classes. The bigger dilemma is whether making a decision like that means that having taken six classes—or, frankly, three—should define who you are Harvard. Where else would taking six classes in and of itself be an academic achievement? An academic achievement is having a paper published or contributing significantly to a body of scientific knowledge.
“Without wanting to sound too gushy,” Noh said, “I’ve just come to realize that life isn’t boring, that there are always an infinite number of new ways to engage. ‘Exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess success’ is one way, for sure. And I suppose someone has to valorize those people, because I know that what worshipping success means is that you end up mostly just feeling failure. But if you actually do your reading—or even if you just push yourself to try to look at life through the broadest lens possible—I think you see that there are plenty of other altars to pray at, and plenty of other, higher gods to spend your life following.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday night, Occupy Harvard Yard—a local extension of the Occupy movement—set up camp in Harvard Yard, occupying the campus quite literally. Harvard and Cambridge police responded in kind. Around midnight on Wednesday, the entire Yard was closed off to any entrants, leaving a group of protesters circled outside the Widener Library entrance, sandwiched between a locked gate and a horde of police and onlookers. Since then, students and a handful of non-Harvard affiliates who did manage to get in have camped out in the Yard, enduring cold nights and the ire of many on campus. Meanwhile, the Yard remains closed to anyone without Harvard identification, so long as there remains the threat of larger or more unstable protest. Occupy Harvard participants declare that they will not move until the University begins to meet their goals, including that the Yard be reopened to the general public as soon as the sit-in ends.
In a bitterly ironic twist on the protesters' slogan of “taking back Harvard for the 99 percent,” their actions have truly closed off Harvard’s campus to all but a select few. Over the weekend especially, the Yard felt eerily quiet and lacking in the conviviality that typifies public enjoyment of the University’s campus. Harvard’s response to Occupy has emphasized that Harvard Yard is not a public space; non-affiliates are welcome only on account of Harvard’s own goodwill. Unlike in Dewey Square, where protesters have clamored for the right to stay in a Boston park, there is no public right of access to a university campus. When administrators considered the prospect of a demonstration engulfing Harvard Yard at nighttime and a large group of total strangers moving in for the foreseeable future, they rightly responded by doing everything possible to stop this from happening.
To be clear, Occupy Harvard has not demonstrated any sign of violence, and, in this respect, it resembles much of Occupy Boston. But this is not true of Occupy protests in other parts of the country, and in other parts of the world. While many, many Occupiers are law-abiding students, many are also anarchists. Many protesters could be anything. Ninety-nine percent of them might never consider committing a crime, but it only takes one to start causing serious problems. At other protests, police have done concerted work to keep protests away from potential targets or sensitive points. It is not hard to imagine how the symbolism of Harvard University, so cynically evoked in Occupy’s own message against the institution, might provoke physical violence against its buildings or people. Harvard Yard is also a dormitory for over 2,000 freshmen: Harvard does have a duty to ensure their safety, and consider all potential liabilities when faced with this kind of threat.
The Yard’s closing underlines this situation’s reality; in practice, Occupy Harvard has so far hurt everyone and done much to turn potential supporters away from the movement and its stated goals. It has isolated the community of Cambridge and its flood of daily tourists from Harvard’s campus and thus produced exactly the division between town and gown that it purports to want to fight.
While Occupy’s slogans are designed to appeal to a wide cross-section of the population, this particular brand of the movement is far too polarizing and totalizing. Regardless of the optics of their propaganda, it is not fair to label Harvard as an institution in the clenches of the one percent. Given its vast financial aid program—which ranks as among the most generous in the country—it is incorrect to say that Harvard reserves its spots for the children of the nation’s highest earners. In this case especially, a distinct attraction to take part in Occupy Harvard must exist exclusively for young people who do in fact belong to one percent families. The perception that Harvard fills its dorms only with rich kids, or at least the solidly middle-class, is an easier mistake to make when one originates from this very group.
Beyond the rhetoric of “taking back Harvard for the 99 percent,” Occupy does bring substantive demands to the table, something we have in the past faulted the wider Occupy movement for lacking. In order for the tent city to move elsewhere, Occupy Harvard has demanded redress of a few basic grievances, including Harvard Management Company's de-investment from HEI Hotels and Resorts and Emergent Asset Management, as well as the reopening of the Yard from the present closure for which they themselves are responsible. Other goals include improvements in labor rights at Harvard, and outside of their immediate “tent city demands,” a reworking of some aspects of undergraduate education.
However, by bringing rhetoric that is resonant with wider complaints about the excesses of capitalism and inequality in America to specific and very different issues like the quality of teaching at Harvard, Occupy Harvard blends together a pungent mixture of local and universal aims that do not complement each other well. Indeed, the attempt to integrate a student protests with a nationwide phenomenon of demonstration and collective anger seems mistaken. A protest against labor rights or class quality should either be a Harvard-centric effort, or instead Occupy should take place off-campus. Since Occupy is now installed in the Yard, we hope the tents and their occupiers move to a public space, both for the good of our community and the future of Occupy Harvard itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the campers in Harvard Yard are fond of reminding us, the top one percent of American households earn 24 percent of national income. The same one percent has seen three-fifths of total income growth from 1979 to 2007. Although these numbers may be disturbing, we should keep in mind that the vast majority of Americans, save a small percentage at the bottom, live very comfortably by global standards. Even among the 46 million citizens below the federal poverty line in 2009, less than a fifth reported being hungry at any time during the previous year, and only four percent were temporarily homeless. The vast majority of “poor” households had modern amenities including air conditioning, microwaves, cars, and cable or satellite TV.
Nevertheless, a non-negligible number of Americans live in genuine poverty, and improving middle class living standards can only be a good thing. The method of helping the “99 percent” that seems to get the most press coverage is a government that acts like Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor through redistributive taxation. While a progressive tax code is a valuable tool, it has the side effect of discouraging work and risk taking among the most productive citizens. As progressive as the federal tax code already is, and as slowly as the economy is growing, any quest to raise living standards across the board should begin with reforms that are less likely to deter economic growth.
Before making the top one percent pay even more than the 38 percent of federal individual income tax revenues that they already contribute, the government could start by eliminating or reforming programs that redistribute from the poor to the rich. Take public lotteries, which state governments operate as monopolies to raise additional revenue. Thanks in part to advertising in low-income areas, the poor spend a much greater proportion of their income playing the lottery than the rich, and some evidence suggests they actually spend more as a dollar amount. Rather than encouraging the poor to waste their hard-earned money playing the lottery, states should raise revenue through equitable channels and create incentives for the poor to save.
A more significant deterrent to saving by the poor is Social Security, which will need to be reformed in the coming years to ensure long-term solvency. Despite its progressive benefit schedule, Social Security taxes low-income citizens most heavily relative to the benefits they receive. Since poorer citizens tend to start working earlier and die at a younger age than the wealthy, they spend more years paying taxes and fewer years collecting retiree benefits. Rather than raising taxes or the retirement age, Congress can correct this imbalance and improve the program’s solvency by simply cutting benefits for the wealthy.
The most obvious way to help the 99 percent is by improving their earning potential, which might include enhancing the physical health of the 16 percent of Americans who lack health insurance. While the constitutionality and fiscal sustainability of last year’s Affordable Care Act remains an open question, the law stands a good chance of helping more Americans become gainfully employed. Another possibility is to narrow the socioeconomic achievement gap in primary and secondary education, which remains stubbornly large ten years after the No Child Left Behind Act.  The law has had modest success in boosting test scores, but more stringent standards for failing schools as well as mandatory remedial instruction for underperforming students could accelerate achievement growth, particularly for low-income students.
In addition to human capital, the 99 percent would benefit from more investment in physical capital, which requires an increase in the saving rate. While national saving has recovered since the current economic downturn began, it reached one percent of gross national income in 2004, the lowest level in 50 years. More income saved means lower interest rates, which enhances the economy’s productive capacity by encouraging capital formation and thereby stimulates demand for workers. The first step in raising national saving is reining in the federal budget deficit, though revenue-neutral reforms to certain aspects of the tax code, particularly the capital gains tax, could encourage private saving.
Like redistributive taxation, these ideas would improve living standards for the poor and middle class. The difference is that they would not retard economic growth, and improvements in human and physical capital are sure to accelerate growth. In a lagging economy like this one, any policy that counteracts growth should be a last resort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This editorial represents the views of 10 student leaders, including presidents of the South Asian Association, Asian American Association, Harvard Democrats, Chinese Students Association, Institute of Politics, Black Students Association, the Student Ambassador of the Committeee on Ethnic Studies, and two Undergraduate Council representatives. When we read yesterday’s Crimson staff editorial, which called for “a drastic reorganization of the UC and a scaling back of the mission and responsibilities of the group,” we were struck by the discrepancy between their description of the Undergraduate Council and the UC we know. We were also surprised by the Crimson staff’s position that the UC should be abolished besides the Finance Committee. There are many criticisms in the editorial that members of the student body and the Crimson staff can most likely agree upon: The UC must become more accountable, more transparent and more diligent in its work.  However, instead of characterizing the undergraduate council as “impotent” and “neither effective nor irreplaceable”, we posit that students should approach the UC constructively, to more effectively empower the UC and ourselves.
The Crimson’s editorial makes several claims, the most prominent being that “our governing body cannot achieve substantial change,” and that the Undergraduate Council “gives students the appearance of having a say with the administration.” The Crimson’s conclusion, therefore, is that the Undergraduate Council, aside from the Finance Committee, be abolished. Such a conclusion, however, represents a step backward from student involvement and engagement with the University’s policy processes.  The UC represents the elected voice of the Harvard undergraduate population, and as such it has the ability to engage with top administrators with a unique credibility and mandate to advocate.
The Undergraduate Council has worked hard to improve the undergraduate experience in a number of ways. Lamont only became a 24-hour library in 2005 after the UC’s “strong push.” In 2004, a strong advocacy effort from the UC led to the installation of the Blue Light emergency response system throughout campus. In 2010, the UC addressed Harvard’s chaotic, decentralized room reservation system in a centralized website for student groups. This year, UC President Senan Ebrahim and Vice President Bonnie Cao fulfilled a campaign pledge by creating the Social Programming Task Force, which recently brought together some 30 student groups at Diversitas. To address freshman social life, the Council created the Freshman Class Council which will soon begin to operate as a “HoCo” for the Class of 2015. The Council also debuted its new UC Restaurants discount initiative, which the Crimson praised just last week as a “bread-and-butter” accomplishment, and succeeded in convincing Harvard Shuttles to begin operating on Holidays.
But perhaps most importantly, this Council has led the charge for a true student voice at the upper levels of the administration with the proposal for a “Forum for Change,” which just one week ago the Crimson praised as a “a great way” to achieve the goal of “[seeking] student opinion in a systematic way.” For student leaders and UC members alike, “the extreme ease” with which the administration sometimes ignores our recommendations, and our lack of “any actual influence” on key University decisions, such as those concerning budget cuts, remain a cause of concern. However, we hope that students, the Crimson, and the UC can work together to ensure a consistent student voice in University decision making. Such an effort can only succeed when undergraduates unite, rather than working against one another and discounting the advocacy efforts of their elected leaders.
Ironically, Monday’s editorial concludes with a powerful negation of the UC’s role in advocacy, contending that students “are more than capable of stepping up and fixing [problems] outside of the UC system,” citing the successful campaign to switch to cage-free eggs in dining halls as specific evidence for this assertion. Harvard students are, of course, more than capable of advocating for causes in which they believe. But according to Marina N. Bolotnikova ’14, the coordinator of the cage-free movement, this policy change was “in large part due to the UC's official endorsement of the cage-free eggs campaign and UC President Senan Ebrahim's personal engagement with the campaign,” adding that  “disbanding the UC and effectively eliminating our most prominent channel of communication is not the solution.”
Addressing long-term problems such as social space on campus is not easy. UC members dedicate many hours every week painstakingly working through Harvard’s labyrinthine bureaucracy in order to address campus concerns. Instead of casually dismissing the issues of social space and student-faculty interaction as a “stagnant annual refrain,” the Crimson staff should recognize the UC’s role as an organizing force in driving these key student life concerns to the forefront of campus discourse. Regardless of the perceived merits or shortcomings of any of this year’s presidential tickets, the integrity of the Harvard Undergraduate Council as an institution of student expression should not be dismissed so carelessly. Individuals have criticized the Undergraduate Council before, and will do so again in the future. Such criticisms can be helpful in some cases, but the best way to take part in this dialogue is to participate actively in the process. The Undergraduate Council, ultimately, is shaped by our votes and represents our interests.  Students should unite with the UC and embrace it as a forum for expression of student advocacy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though this year’s Thanksgiving break—extended to include Wednesday—is the longest in recent memory, College administrators say that last fall they unsuccessfully attempted to lengthen the break to a full week.
A year ago, the Office of Undergraduate Education submitted a proposal to then-Provost Steven E. Hyman seeking to extend the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ traditional two-day Thanksgiving break to include Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
The proposal was made “in response to student requests and the sense on the part of the College and FAS administrations that a fall break would serve students and faculty well,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said.
But Hyman denied the College’s request, agreeing only to cancel classes on Wednesday because “the late fall schedule was already too compressed ... to make up for three additional missed days,” University spokesman John D. Longbrake said in an emailed statement.
According to Hammonds, the request was also denied on the grounds that the University-wide common calendar, which was implemented in fall 2009, would be “undermined by allowing the FAS to have such a break when it was clear that the other Schools would not do likewise.”
Harvard students have long looked at Yale’s calendar as a model for a week-long Thanksgiving break, but this year Harvard students will once again return from the Harvard-Yale football game to classes while their Yale counterparts will head home for the holiday.
“We go to Harvard-Yale, we party—it’s hard to get your mind back on school for just two days,” John Henry F. Hinkel ’12 said.
While Hinkel plans to fly home to Atlanta, Ga. on Tuesday night, he said that many of his friends plan to skip class.
College administrators said they have no plans to renew the request to extend the break.
Although Wednesday will now serve as an additional travel day, many students say they still intend to skip class next Monday and Tuesday to get an early start on the holiday.
James S. Klein ’13, who will be skipping one class to fly home to Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, said he “definitely” wishes the Provost had approved the College’s proposal.
“I don’t think a lot of kids go to their classes on Monday and Tuesday,” Klein added.
Physics professor Irwin I. Shapiro—who said he already thinks the three week period separating Thanksgiving break and Christmas vacation is “a bit slim”—said he would be in favor of a week-long Thanksgiving break only if the class days were made up at the end of the fall semester.
But Annemarie E. Ryu ’13, who is planning to fly back home to Minnesota after she attends all her classes on Tuesday, said she would be wary of the consequences of an extended Thanksgiving break on a time-crunched semester.
“The fall semester is already really compressed,” she said. “If you have a whole week off, deadlines could get moved back and limit time even more.”
Psychology professor Steven Pinker echoed Ryu’s sentiment, saying he thinks an extended Thanksgiving break would be “disruptive” even if the lost class days in November were made up at the end of the summer.
“I’d hate to see the semester extended still earlier into the summer to compensate for the missing class,” Pinker wrote in an emailed statement. “It’s bad enough that Harvard changed its calendar to rob us of those wonderful weeks of New England summer in exchange for those awful weeks of December winter!”

The wait staff of the Harvard Club of Boston is suing their employer for violating the Massachusetts “Tip Law,” alleging that the club management charged service charges which management then failed to distribute to workers.
According to the complaint filed by the workers, club management instructed members not to tip the wait staff, leading members to believe instead that the “service charges” attached to bills were charged “in lieu” of a gratuity and would be delivered to workers. The plaintiffs are asking for compensation as well as a policy change that would ensure that this kind of “deception” does not happen again.
The Harvard Club of Boston is a private business open to Harvard graduates as well as graduates of “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website. The club is not associated with Harvard University.
The suit comes as the club and its wait staff are in contract negotiations.  The club was recently cited by the local chapter of the National Labor Relations Board for violating labor codes by providing an “unreasonable delay in providing information during bargaining.” Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union which represents Harvard Club of Boston wait staff and Harvard dining hall workers, called the practice of pocketing money meant for wait staff employees “despicable.”
“Not only are they bargaining in bad faith, now they are tricking their members and stealing tip money from their workers,” Lang said. “It’s infuriating—they are the most dishonorable employer I have ever dealt with.”
Lang said that the issue was called to his attention when a union member brought in a memo advertising the club to clients and non-members. He said that the Local 26 staff noticed the pamphlet advertised the surcharge at the end of meals as a substitute for a gratuity, despite the fact that workers were not receiving any tip money.
“I suspect that this has been going on for decades,” Lang said.  “And what’s really upsetting is that it could have continued if we hadn’t happened to run across it.”
The Harvard Club could not be reached for comment.One students said he regretted the nominal association between the club and the University.
“The Harvard elite are having these fancy meals and wonderful events, and meanwhile the workers are really suffering,” said William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement. “It’s disturbing that this is a club that I could potentially join.”
Lang urged Harvard Club members to take a closer look at their labor practices and to fight for justice on behalf of the wait-staff employees.
“If I were a Harvard Club member, I would be asking some hard questions,” he said. “I would be asking for more information about the negotiations and I would be demanding more equality for the custodial staff.”

With Wednesday's deadline for sophomore concentration declarations imminent, Harvard’s Statistics Department looks to continue an escalation that has seen the concentration expand from 5 to 50 concentrators since 2005.
Joseph K. Blitzstein, co-director of undergraduate studies for the statistics department, attributes the growth trends to factors outside and within Harvard.
“Nationally there’s just more and more data out there and more and more large complicated data sets that people don’t know what to do with,” he said.
On a smaller scale, the statistics department has made a particular effort to dissipate the common perception that statistics is an inaccessible and “recipe-oriented” field of study, according to David P. Harrington, co-director of undergraduate studies with Blitzstein.
“When you get into college and you hear about statistics, if you haven’t been previously exposed to the subject, you might think ‘Well, what the hell is this and how can it help me?’” said Tirthankar Dasgupta, co-director of graduate studies.
The department frequently hosts lunches and information sessions to talk about statistics’ diverse real-life applications—from rethinking the prediction of risk after the financial crisis to forming probabilistic arguments regarding prostate cancer screening.
“We know about economics. We know about finance.  But it may not be as obvious how important a role statistics plays in the social sciences, the physical sciences, and other fields,” said Dasgupta. “It really allows you to make better inferences–that’s what we try to emphasize.”
Concentrators can opt to follow one of three tracks—finance, computational biology, or general statistics.Blitzstein said he thinks the skills acquired in statistics classes offer advantages in the job search.
“It helps students to stand out a little bit more,” he said. “They love asking [about] probability on the job interview.”
Blitzstein expects around 20 sophomores, a similar number as last fall, to declare statistics this year.
“Some students from other concentrations feel very, very anonymous,” he said. “This department, since it’s smaller, it feels much more like a community.”
Concentrators can study and socialize in a statistics lounge space on the seventh floor of the Science Center and are frequently provided free food at events. The department even heeded student advice and spent part of a $25,000 Dean’s Prize for Innovations in Graduate Education on a massage chair.
“The faculty is extremely accessible. You can ask them about setting up a meeting and they’ll email you back within minutes,” said concentrator Rebecca S. Goldstein ’13.
Alice Xiang ’13, who was originally considering concentrating in applied mathematics, says that the intimacy of the department was one factor that drew her to statistics instead.
“A group of us who have taken [Statistics] 110 went out to eat Chinese food with Joe [Blitzstein],” she said. “You don’t get as many little things like that in other departments.”
But professors fear that the personal quality that has attracted so many might disappear if students continue to flock to the concentration at the current rate.
The number of students in Statistics 110, one of two required classes for the concentration, has tripled in the last five years—despite Blitzstein’s assurance that he has not made the class any easier.
The department plans to hire at least one new faculty member by next fall to accommodate growth.
“Big is not bad,” said Harrington, “but past concentrators have really stressed the fact that they liked working in smaller groups where you actually got to meet and work with the faculty.”

“The birthers think that Obama was born in Kenya, but I think he was born on Easter Island,” joked political cartoonist Kevin P. Kallaugher ’77 while deftly sketching a caricature. He stepped aside from his drawing pad to reveal a comically exaggerated but unmistakable portrait of President Barack Obama, with a huge forehead and jutting jaw.
Kallaugher, an editorial cartoonist for The Economist whose work has been published in newspapers and magazines worldwide, gave a presentation last night at Kirkland House as part of the “Conversations with Kirkland” lecture series. The event, which drew about 30 attendees, focused on the role of political cartooning and satire in modern media.
Kallaugher’s friend and fellow former Kirkland House resident Frederick W. Mayer ’78, a Duke University political science professor, moderated the event.
“As a cartoonist, my job is to be a professional six-year-old,” Kallaugher said.“I find what’s important in the world and then add a twist of humor.”
He demonstrated this principle in a selection of his most successful cartoons, some from the Cold War era and some very recent.
One cartoon published in October depicted the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination as birds. Rick Perry, for example, was represented as a “Texas Strutting Prickly Snark: Agressive and right-winged. Has tendency to put claws in beak.”
The talk highlighted some of Kallaugher’s ink-and-paper work but also emphasized the rapidly changing technology that today’s cartoonists employ.
“The world of cartoons is dying, just as print media everywhere is dying,” Kallaugher said. “But the digital world offers many new opportunities.”
He showed clips made with the cutting-edge motion capture sensors that he uses to animate computerized models of politicians. Then he contrasted that work with a piece of animation he did in 1986. “Back then, it took me over 700 drawings to animate 30 seconds. Now, it’s much easier to keep up with a political landscape that changes in the blink of an eye,” he said.
At Harvard, Kallaugher produced a 13-minute animated film for his senior thesis and drew cartoons for The Crimson.
Kallaugher touched upon the serious role that seemingly frivolous cartoons can play in public discourse. “You can measure the maturity of a democracy by how much satire it can endure,” he said.
Audience members said they were impressed by the level of artistic workmanship that Kallaugher’s profession requires.
“I’ve always known cartooning is a lot of work,” Herbert “Whitt” W. Virgin-Downey ’12 said, “but it’s interesting to see just how nuanced it really is.”

Research published earlier this week in the New England Journal of Medicine presents data showing that the anti-clotting drug rivaroxaban may change the future of post-heart attack treatment. The study was conducted by Harvard cardiologists Dr. C. Michael Gibson and Dr. Jessica Mega who both work at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
The results showed that patients who took rivaroxaban each day after their heart attack not only had a lower risk of experiencing another one later on but also had a reduced risk of cardiovascular death compared to patients who took placebos.
A major contributing factor of later heart attacks is the accumulation of the enzyme thrombin.
“This is a chronic problem,” said co-author Gibson. “What we did was block the creation of that enzyme with an anti-thrombin drug.”
By preventing the accumulation of thrombin, rivaroxaban reduces the risk of experiencing another heart attack and, in an unprecedented occurrence in anti-clotting drug studies, reduces the risk of dying due to cardiovascular complications by thirty-eight percent.
“This is a major breakthrough,” said Gibson. “We have been working on this for many years now, and we think we have found something that will really change practice.”
However, the study did not yield only positive news.
“There is always a risk,” said Mega. “It is a double-edged sword, as there was also an increased risk of bleeding.”
Bleeding was observed in the brain and other areas of the body. Even though there were a number of serious cases of bleeding, the study’s conclusion was that most instances were not life threatening.
Rivaroxaban still awaits an approval decision by the Food and Drug Administration in order to treat post-heart attack patients in regular clinical practice. The drug has already been approved under the trade name Xarelto to treat both blood clots in the legs (deep venous thrombosis) and to prevent clots related to atrial fibrillation. However, approval for the heart attack indication hinges on assessment of benefit versus risk, primarily bleeding.
As to whether or not the drug will be approved with a cardiovascular indication, Mega is both optimistic and realistic.
“It’s always hard to say,” said Mega. “It was exciting to be a part of such clinical work, but you can never really make predictions about what gets approved or not.”
Dr. Sandeep Khosla, chief of cardiology at Mount Sinai Hospital Center in Chicago, Ill., has positive expectations for rivaroxaban.
“I am excited about the drug,” he said. “It can be taken orally as opposed to the more common injection method. I think this will be good for patients down the road.”

Professor John G. Palfrey '94 is leaving Harvard Law School to take the position of Head of School at Phillips Academy Andover, according to announcements from both schools. Palfrey’s areas of research include Internet law, intellectual property, and international law.
Palfrey is leaving the Law School 11 years after graduating from the Law School in 2001. From 2002 to 2008, Palfrey served as executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He was appointed to the faculty in 2003, and was appointed director of the Law School’s library system in 2008.
Leading Phillips Academy will bring Palfrey intimately closer to the digital age generation he tracked in academia, according to Professor Charles R. Nesson ’60.
In 2008, Palfrey served as chair of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force, which focused on child safety in the wake of expanding technology and the internet. He has also testified before Congress on child safety in the digital age. Palfrey, along with Berkman Center Executive Director Urs Gasser, published “Born Digital: Understanding the First Generation of Digital Natives,” which reflected on the first generation to grow up amid technology that characterizes the 21st century.
“From the very beginning, his focus has been on how kids learn,” Nesson said. He added that this new position would provide Palfrey with a new perspective on years of research.
“I’m sure it will infuse his work and he will learn something new coming out of it,” Nesson said.
In addition to his research about children and technology, colleagues have praised Palfrey for his transformative leadership and scholarship both at the Law School and the Berkman Center.
“John has been essential to the life of the Berkman Center,” Gasser wrote in an email statement. “His intelligence, knowledge, diplomacy, and friendship have inspired all of us.”
Palfrey will replace Head of School Barbara L. Chase at Andover. An e-mail sent to Phillips Academy students and alumni welcomed Palfrey—a graduate of Exeter Academy—to the Andover community, noting that he would be only the second Exeter graduate to lead Phillips Academy.
“John’s values align remarkably well with those of Andover, most particularly our core value of non sibi,” the e-mail read. “John is instinctively collegial and has a collaborative leadership style.”

For high school seniors completing the Common Application, the new 500-word limit on the personal statement can feel constraining and anxiety-provoking.
“Some students take it very literally,” said Amy Sack, president of admissions consulting company Admissions Accomplished. “If they’re at 501 they become crazy.”
But Harvard’s stance on the word limit should give concerned students cause to relax.
“I think in our situation if people happen to go over 500 words, that’s fine with us,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson. “And if they want to use our supplement and send almost anything they can imagine, we’re happy to read that too ... It’s really not an issue for us.”
Though the Common Application instructs students not to submit essays that are longer than 500 words, the online tool does not limit them from doing so.
“If a student uploaded a 500,000-word essay, there’s nothing we could do,” Rob Killion, executive director of Common Application told the New York Times. “However, we do ask that all students follow the same rules their peers are following.”
Harvard’s supplement encourages students with exceptional talents to submit extra materials such as copies of art work, music recordings, and academic papers. The Admissions Office will forward this supplementary material to members of the faculty if the applicant is being seriously considered, according to Fitzsimmons.
Views on the word limit vary among admissions counselors, according to Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at college counseling firm IvySelect.
“I counsel [students] to keep it in one page,” said Sack. “The computer can count characters. An admissions officer is not going to count your words but does not want to read on forever.”
Goran agreed with this sentiment.
“The point is that they’re not counting but they certainly are going to have a sense of when you’re going way over,” said Goran, who said that his students rarely complete drafts of their essays that are under 500 words.
“They’re not purposefully trying to write over the limit, but I think that going slightly beyond 500 adds texture,” said Goran. “I wish they would give some more latitude there for students to write more.”
Yale Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jeffrey Brenzel told the New York Times that he would continue reading long essays, but that “if they go over the limit, the stakes go up.”
Asked whether his office continues to read excessively long essays, Fitzsimmons grinned and nodded.“We will keep reading,” he said. “We will. We do.”

Rainn Wilson, the actor who plays the awkward salesman Dwight Schrute on NBC’s The Office, urged more than 100 students on Monday to push for freedom of education in Iran.
Wilson was one of three panelists for  an event hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education that promoted the campaign “Education Under Fire” and included a screening of the documentary also entitled “Education Under Fire.” The film recounts the May 2011 attacks by Iranian authorities on students and faculty of the Baha’i Institute for Higher Education.
BIHE is a grassroots university founded in 1987 to provide higher education for members of the Baha’i community, who are denied access to Iranian universities.
Wilson, a follower of the Baha’i faith and a human rights activist, said that he is promoting the film because he believes humanity’s highest calling is that of service.
“One way [to serve] is to entertain and make people laugh by making an idiot of myself,” Wilson said. “Another way is to bring attention to causes and issues where people are suffering.”
The campaign to end the Iranian government’s persecution comes almost two months after Nobel laureates Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and Jose Ramos-Horta, president of East Timor, wrote an open letter in the Huffington Post calling for the international academic community to aid those of the Baha’i faith in Iran who are either being imprisoned or being denied access to higher education.
“Freedom of education and freedom of information are integral to freedom of thought,” the letter reads.
Since the 1980s, BIHE has cautiously provided higher education in the living rooms and kitchens of Baha’i professors, according to the letter.
Wilson said that when he realized the Iranian government was denying education, his eyes were opened.
“Don’t take education for granted, education is a human right,” Wilson said. “It is a spiritual quality, it develops your heart and your soul,” he added.
Director Jeff Kaufman explained that the Baha’i religion—a faith that promotes the unity of all religions and mankind—is a threat to the Iranian regime because it challenges the government’s authority.
Wilson explained why Baha’i students applying for universities in Iran may not want to hide their faith to obtain an education.
“If I had to check Swedish instead of Norwegian, I wouldn’t care,” Wilson said. “But when you talk about your faith ... it’s a colossal lie to check something else.”
Kaufman, who directed the documentary, said, “I know people who have been in prison and have been tortured, and I think about their resilient spirit that refuses to be crushed.”
All three panelists urged students and faculty to take action by spreading awareness of the issue, urging university administrations to accept school credit from the BIHE, and promoting “Education Under Fire” events through social media.
“I’m a world citizen and I’m all for advocating for those who need help to achieve education and human rights,” Wilson said. “We’re all part of one human family.”

The Palestinian protest movement was framed within the context of the Arab Spring and the global Occupy movement at a Kennedy School discussion Monday night titled “Boycott from Within: American and Israeli Voices Against Apartheid.”
The event featured two speakers: Jeff Pickert, an American activist currently living in the West Bank, and Dalit Baum, an Israeli academic and activist.
“This is a really exciting time,” said Pickert. “As Americans, we’re finally getting involved with this global discussion.”
Pickert described “waves” of intensity within the history of Palestinian activism, suggesting that a recent lull may soon end with a re-energizing of the activist movement. “Right now in Palestine people are tired, but not asleep,” he said.
The audience, a mix of students, teachers, and activists  from within the Harvard community and beyond continued to debate long after the talk ended.
“Baum was fantastic,” said Leah C. Vincent, a master’s student at Lesley University. “She was articulate and composed, which you need to be to answer questions in this context.”
But not surprisingly for a discussion on the regional conflict, opinions differed among audience members.
Yoav B. G. Schaefer ’15 said the talk did not sufficiently recognize the complexity of the situation.
“Everything that tries to make (the conflict) black and white is a disservice to peace,” he said.
Jonah C. Steinberg, director of Harvard Hillel, said the talk did not make clear enough its “final causes.”
But he expressed support for attending these types of events.
“I think it’s important for people in general, and Jews in particular, to participate actively in discourse and learn as much as possible in order to figure out for themselves what they hope to happen and act accordingly.”

Custodial workers have threatened to strike if they cannot reach an agreement with the University by 12 a.m. Wednesday morning, when the custodial contract expires. Their threat to strike was followed by a rally around the outside of Harvard Yard on Saturday afternoon, during which custodians and union members chanted and held up signs with such slogans as “Justice for Janitors” and “Yes We Can”.
Custodians and the University enter their final negotiation session on Tuesday, after over a month of contract discussions.
Among the demands of custodians are better health care benefits, total compensation parity between direct employees and contractors, manageable workloads, and more full-time jobs.
Custodians and union leaders said that they hope that an agreement is reached, but are fully prepared to strike to force the University to consider their demands.
“We want to have a contract, but we’re not afraid to strike,” said Nancy Diaz, a Harvard custodian and union organizer.
She stressed that workers will not accept anything less than a “fair” contract.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin, pointed out that Harvard custodial contracts are substantially more generous than the industry standard.
“The custodians have seen a 36 percent increase in their hourly wages since 2005, and the University’s already pays more to cover their healthcare benefits than many other institutions,” Galvin wrote in an email statement.
Galvin also noted the broad coverage of the University’s healthcare plan.
“The University [also] grants eligibility for health care coverage to custodians who work as few as 16 hours per week,” Galvin said.
According to Diaz, one of the primary issues the contract needs to address is the excessive workload of custodians, who feel that they are given more work than they can complete without skipping breaks and lunches.
“We need to be able to get all our work done and see our families,” Diaz said. “We want justice. The workers are strong and we are not going to give up.”
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union which represents Harvard custodians, said that another major sticking point in the negotiations is benefits for contracted custodians, such as those hired through private contractors like the Facilities Maintenance Operations.
“Currently, contracted employees do not enjoy the same benefits as direct employees,” Langley said.  “But we want parity for the workers.  We believe there should be no second class citizens at Harvard.”
Specifically, union leaders are seeking contractor access to a tuition assistance program and childcare—perks that direct employees currently enjoy.
Currently, contract workers enjoy the same “core benefits” as direct Harvard employees—including basic health care, wages, and paid time-off—under the Wage and Benefit Parity Policy, instituted by the University in 2002. The University also provides all custodians with access to the University’s Bridge to Learning program and its Literacy Program.

Harvard’s labor relations have been a centerpiece of the Occupy Harvard campaign since the protest kicked off last week, and union heads and employees have welcomed the movement’s support as the clock ticks down on the University’s custodial contract.
“The students are always supporting us, but never like now,” Harvard Business School custodian Wanda Rosario said. “It’s excellent. It’s support that we need.”
In the past week, Occupy Harvard students have touted signs advocating for better wages and protesting disparities between the lowest and highest paid Harvard employees.
This support comes at a crucial moment in University labor relations as custodial workers’ contract expires at 12 a.m. Wednesday morning. After more than a month of contract negotiations, custodians have threatened to strike after their final negotiation session on Tuesday if the University does not satisfactorily meet their demands.
But beyond supporting workers’ rights on campus, workers and union leaders say the movement represents a broader directive from the students for Harvard to become a more socially responsible organization.
Wayne M. Langley—director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodians—said that the University has lost sight of its mission to serve the public, a mission that the Occupy Harvard movement is throwing back into the spotlight.
“They’re representing the social conscience of the University which has kind of withered away a bit,” Langley said. “Their issues are broader than our contract—they’re concerned about the overall direction and commitment of the public mission and the social contract that the University has with the general public.”
Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents Harvard dining hall workers, said that good labor relations are important, but added that Harvard should invest in companies that engage in responsible labor practices.
“We think Harvard has a lot of money to spend investing, and we want the companies they’re investing in to practice sustainable labor practices as well,” Lang said.
He singled out Harvard’s investment in hotel management company HEI as particularly troubling, saying the company has been cited for several labor complaints in the past and has a “poor track record” with regard to labor practices.
Ultimately, Lang said he sees this as an “opportunity for growth” for Harvard.
“I think what the Harvard students are doing is a statement, and I hope the University listens and does the right thing,” he said.
Student organizers said that University labor issues are central concerns of the Occupy Harvard campaign.
“We focused on bringing Occupy to campus in order to address some of the issues specific to Harvard,” said William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement and an Occupy Harvard student organizer. “I see the custodians fight and the sustainable and responsible investing fight as a very important part of what Occupy is fighting for if not all of it.”
Whitham said that Harvard’s Occupy movement was a natural extension of the work of many progressive initiatives on campus, including SLAM’s campaign for fair working conditions.
“This is actually Harvard students who know about these labor campaigns and who know about Harvard,” Whitham said. “No one came from Occupy to organize us—we organized ourselves in order to address these issues on campus.”

A collaboration between researchers at Harvard Medical School and Children’s Hospital Boston studying an infectious outbreak in cystic fibrosis patients has yielded important new information regarding how an infection spreads and how antibiotic resistance develops.
The scientists, using DNA sequencing technology, were able to retrace the evolution of specific bacteria and identify 17 adaptive genes that increase bacterial survival.
Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs, thereby facilitating bacterial infection. In the 1990s, a rare strain of bacteria later named Burkholderia dolosa infected a closed group of 39 cystic fibrosis patients at Children’s Hospital Boston. The clinic had the foresight to collect 112 samples of bacteria from 14 of these infected people. Roy Kishony, professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School, had the original idea to use the data to study the spread of infections.
Jean-Baptiste Michel, Kishony’s former graduate student and now a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, and Tami D. Lieberman, a research assistant and graduate student in systems biology, co-wrote the paper with Kishony that appeared in Nature Genetics.
“Once we had this wealth of data, we tried to understand and use that data to interpret how the epidemic spread and what genes were in selection,” Lieberman said.
Whole genome sequencing allows scientists to study how one strain of bacteria evolved over time in multiple infected patients during the outbreak. This research successfully sequenced the genomes and mapped their changes to identify genes that faced the greatest selective pressure, or how the bacteria evolved when challenged by both human defenses and medical treatment.
The team’s findings could help better define a pathogen’s strengths and weaknesses or potential targets for new therapies. Their innovative methodology can also be applied to other epidemics such as E. coli infections.
Kishony said that this large scale study “was only possible due to the close collaboration among the best people from the clinical side and  basic research, bringing in backgrounds in mathematics, physics, and biology.”

Last month, Boston Celtic Rajon Rondo made a special visit to Lavietes Pavilion (where former Celtics video coordinator Brian Adams now works as a Harvard men's basketball assistant coach).
This Saturday, Rondo will be returning to the Crimson's campus—and he'll be bringing along some friends. According to the Boston Globe, the former Kentucky star will be joined by teammate Paul Pierce, Kevin Durant, and Jeremy Lin '10 in the first-ever Boston Charity Classic Saturday at 6 p.m. at Lavietes Pavilion.
Proceeds will go towards local Boston charities for providing meals this holiday season.
The matchup continues a recent trend of NBA stars—who reportedly began seeking to decertify their union today—taking part in charity exhibition games, including one held at Penn's Palestra in late September. But student attendance at the latest example may be low, given that many will be traveling to New Haven, Conn., for The Game this weekend.

This was why Josue Ortiz had come back. This made everything worth it.
Having already graduated, the fifth-year senior defensive tackle did not have to return to Cambridge this fall. Coming off a junior season in which he was named first-team All-Ivy and a third-team All-American, Ortiz easily could have felt satisfied with his Crimson career, taken his economics degree, and moved on to the real world.
But there was something burning inside him, pulling him back to Harvard like a magnet.
Ortiz wanted to win another championship.
It had been three years since the senior last won an Ivy League title. That was back in 2008, when Ortiz appeared in only three games and didn’t make much of a contribution to the championship-winning team.
At that point, things just weren’t working out for the defensive tackle, who seriously considered quitting football during spring practices in 2009. But an end-of-year meeting with Harvard coach Tim Murphy motivated Ortiz to keep his collegiate career going. It was a decision that has certainly turned out to be the right one.
Ortiz stayed in Cambridge over the summer of 2009 to work out with the team, during which time he added 15 pounds. His play on the field the following fall reflected his hard work in the offseason, as the junior finished with 35 tackles, two sacks, and was named to the all-Ivy second team.
Then last year, Ortiz broke out and became a star, tallying 7.5 sacks and 15 tackles for loss—good for first and second in the league, respectively.
Though the individual accolades came quickly for Ortiz, the defensive tackle’s biggest goal—winning an Ivy title—was thwarted by the Penn Quakers in the penultimate contests of both 2009 and 2010.
But on Saturday, the Crimson finally ended that streak, with Ortiz playing a starring role. Despite being double-teamed constantly, the senior’s 10 tackles, two sacks, forced fumble, and fumble recovery were vital to a 37-20 Harvard victory that clinched the program’s 14th Ivy League title.
“You put all the work in, and this makes it worthwhile,” said Ortiz, who won the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week award for his performance. “This is the pinnacle; this is what you always want to do as a Harvard football player.”
The defensive tackle set the tone early on that this year’s game against Penn would be different than that of the previous two seasons.
On the Quakers’ first play from scrimmage, Ortiz beat his man and sacked Penn quarterback Billy Ragone for a four-yard loss. Two plays later, Ortiz picked up a QB hurry on 3rd-and-14, forcing Ragone to run out of bounds and the Quakers to punt.
On Penn’s next drive, Ortiz again chased down Ragone on third-and-long, but this time finished him off for his second sack of the contest and his Ivy League-leading ninth sack of the year.
“It makes it a lot easier for the guys playing the back end when we have a guy like him rushing the QB and disrupting the offense,” senior cornerback Brian Owusu said.
Early in the second quarter, after Penn running back Jeff Jack was stuffed at the Quaker 24, Ortiz ripped at the ball and forced Jack to lose it. He then recovered the ensuing fumble by himself, giving Harvard great field position that it took advantage of with a touchdown pass on its next play.
“This past game against Penn just showed how dominant of a player he can be,” Owusu said. “He always gets to the ball. He’s just been a tremendous leader for us, he’s one of the guys the D-line looks up to, and he’s one of the best players—if not the best player—in the Ivy League.”
Throughout the rest of the contest, Ortiz’s penetration also played a major role in helping the Crimson limit the Quakers to just 24 yards rushing on the afternoon.
“The line of scrimmage was strictly won by their kids,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “We struggled more than any time this year to run the football. We became one-dimensional.”
Ortiz has been making teams one-dimensional all season long, anchoring a Crimson defensive line that is widely considered the best in the league and leads the Ancient Eight in run defense.
“It’s his focus and his work ethic [that are most impressive]­,” said captain Alex Gedeon of Ortiz, who can bench 450 pounds.
But things came close to not ending up this way. The senior remains thankful for the coaches who pushed him to come back after his sophomore season, and who have since helped him fulfill his vast potential.
“God hasn’t blessed me with a lot of the things a prototypical three-technique tackle has,” Ortiz said. “I’m not 290 pounds, but what I have been blessed with, I feel like the coaches have been able to squeeze out.”
Saving his best performance for the biggest game of the year is something Ortiz has become accustomed to, as the tackle has racked up 18 tackles in Harvard’s past two wins in The Game. Last year, he had 1.5 sacks, forced a fumble, and blocked a key punt in Harvard’s 28-21 victory.
With four wins in four tries over Yale during the course of his career, Ortiz has no plans of falling short in his final collegiate game on Saturday.
“You just get so involved in [the rivalry] that you can’t lose to Yale,” Ortiz said. “You will do whatever it takes.”
One thing’s for sure: the Bulldog offensive line was certainly not hoping to hear that this week.

Those looking to find the top lightweight rowers in the country might want to peruse Harvard’s 2011 roster.
Sophomore Andrew Campbell, recently named the 2011 USRowing Man of the Year, and former team captain Will Newell ’11 combined to win the two lightweight men’s events at this past weekend’s USRowing East Coast Fall Speed Order.
Campbell took first place in the lightweight single event, while Newell won the lightweight pair while rowing with Jimmy Sopko.
“It was not a national selection [for me],” Campbell said. “It was an opportunity to figure out where I stood relative to the rest of the field. ... This weekend was a good step forward in the process of trying to make the 2012 Olympic team. We have a long way to go, but this is a good step.”
For all competitors, the weekend began with a 6k on Saturday, with the fastest ergers earning the privilege of starting Sunday’s races first.
Newell paced the entire lightweight field with a 19:38 on the 6k piece.
“Between 19:30 and 19:40 is Olympic standard,” Campbell said.
While Campbell did not win the event, he did manage to make a personal jump and finished third among lightweight scullers.
“It’s been quite a while since he tested,” said Charley Butt, who is coaching both the Crimson lightweights and the Olympic double. “He’s a minute faster, which is an enormous jump.”
“It was exciting to be in a room with a bunch of other highly motivated and fast athletes,” Campbell added. “There was an electric atmosphere to that event.”
Campbell was erging next to training partners Austin Meyer ’12-’13 and Will Daly, who graduated from Boston University in 2006.
Campbell’s 6k put him third in the starting order, behind Daly and Greg Ruckman ‘96, who had the fastest erg among scullers. Meyer started fifth.
“It was difficult coming back from such a difficult and long erg piece,” Campbell said. “I was pleased and especially against such strong competition that has the mental tenacity [to race back-to-back].”
Campbell won the single event by over 10 seconds, and only heavyweight winner Michael Sevigny posted a faster time in the single, though Butt noted that variable conditions make it hard to compare times from separate events.
Daly took second, Ruckman took third, and Meyer took fifth.
“I was happy to see training partners Will Daly and Austin Meyer finish in the top five,” Campbell said. “It was nice for Will, Austin, and I to do the erg next to each other. We started close to each other [on the water]. We used the relationship we’ve established in practice.”
The race capped what has been an outstanding year for the sophomore. Campbell took bronze at U23 Worlds, fourth at the senior world championships, and second in the Head of the Charles championship double event, in which Meyer served as his partner. Campbell will be honored for his accomplishments at the New York Athletic Club in New York City at the inaugural Golden Oars Awards dinner and at the USRowing convention in Hartford, Conn.
While Campbell has been the most recognizable name, he has not been the only Crimson rower making headlines. In addition to his strong performances on the erg and water this past weekend, Newell also stroked the USRowing eight to a win at the Head of the Charles in the lightweight eight event.
He and Sopko, meanwhile, won by a much smaller margin than Campbell did. The duo edged out second-place finishers Nick Lacava and Anthony Fahden by .27 seconds.
Despite his strong result, Newell noted in a text message that he felt he had “a lot of work left to do.”
In other events at the Speed Orders, Esther Lofgren ’07-’09 and Caryn Davies ’04-’05 took fifth and eighth, respectively, in the women’s pair. Lofgren, who has won the World Championships in the eight the past two years, raced in the pair with Penn grad Susan Francia. Davies, a gold medalist in Beijing and silver medalist in Athens, raced with Meghan Musnicki, an alumna of St. Lawrence.
Olivia Coffey ‘11 and Laura Larsen-Strecker ‘08 took 14th and 24th, respectively, in the women’s single, while Nick Baker ’07 took 15th in the single. All three rowers served as captains during their times in Cambridge.

The Harvard sailing team wrapped up its fall season this past weekend by taking on the best of the east coast.
In the sole weekend of postseason competition, the co-ed squad competed against 17 other schools in the Atlantic Coast Championships.
The Crimson co-hosted the event with nearby MIT on the Charles River Basin during a weekend with weather conditions near-perfect for sailing. The breeze was exceptional on Saturday, with winds blowing from eight to 17 knots. Even though the second day of competition saw a little less wind, the sailors still enjoyed decent gusts while on the water.
Co-captain Brendan Kopp skippered with sophomore Sarah Pierson and freshman Brian Drumm, who split the crew duties for Harvard’s A-division squad. The trio took second place in a highly-contested A-division with a score of 123 points, only three points behind Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
The Hobart and William Smith unit of seniors Samuel Blouin and Chris Klevan and junior Catherine Pelo captured a victory in the very last race of the regatta, enough to propel the Statesmen just past the Crimson into first place.
“At times, it was frustrating,” Kopp said. “We had the lead for the vast majority of the regatta, and only lost on the last race.”
The B-division squad—which featured senior Emily Lambert and freshmen Michael Drumm and Gram Slattery at skipper—did not fare as well as its A-division counterpart, finishing 13th out of the field of 18 with a score of 208 points.
“It was a little frustrating for Emily and me,” Jumper said. “We are probably one of—if not the—smallest combinations of people in terms of size. There were some good moments. The conditions were a little bit difficult, but we did the best we could.”
The A-division team recorded three victories and nine finishes in the top five, while the B-division team recorded five top-10 finishes.
“It was pretty tough because it was the most competitive regatta all season,” Kopp said. “There’s a slimmer margin for error because if you make a mistake, you will be punished for it much more.”
Harvard placed 11th in the overall standings with its total of 331 points, trailing the 10th place Georgetown Hoyas by 10.
Roger Williams University took home the victory overall in the fall Atlantic Coast Championships with a score of 221 points. Ivy League rivals Dartmouth and Brown finished just behind in the combined standings with 264 and 276 points, respectively.
“It was nice being the host, other than the fact we had to wake up early and set up the boats for everyone,” Kopp said. “We’re used to sailing at Harvard and we get to sail our own boats, so there is definitely some form of home court advantage there.”
“We are pretty happy with [the result],” Jumper added. “[That was] definitely one of, if not the, most competitive regattas we will end up sailing all year. So it was a great opportunity to sail with [some of the] best teams in the country.”
With the finish, the Crimson has completed its fall season. The results from November are a microcosm of Harvard’s year. The season was highlighted by one regatta crown—won at the Hood Trophy hosted by Tufts on the weekend of September 24-25—and a pair of second-place finishes during the season’s opening week at Yale and at the Erwin Schell Trophy Regatta.
The team has experienced a combination of highs and lows heading into the all-important spring season. The fall season consists mainly of fleet racing, much different from the predominant teamracing format of the spring. The success of the Crimson’s fall does not guarantee the same for the spring, but the members of the Harvard sailing team find themselves already looking forward to returning to competition once the waters thaw out.
“In terms of Emily and I, we have been together since our freshman spring, [so the biggest challenge will be] perfecting our boat handling,” Jumper said. “The spring season has a lot of team racing, so we are excited to go into the last couple of months. We are going to work as hard as we can, have fun with it, and hopefully bring back some good results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outsaide of the labs and law offices of the world.
After falling to the Jets last Sunday, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and the Buffalo Bills dropped their second straight, this week being defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 44-7. The 37-point loss was the Bills’ largest margin of defeat of the season.
Fitzpatrick, who went 20-31, threw for a season-low 146 yards and was intercepted a season-high three times. The Bills’ sole touchdown was a three-yard pass from Fitzpatrick to wide receiver David Nelson in the second quarter. Buffalo trailed 28-7 at halftime, even though all three of Fitzpatrick’s interceptions came in the second half.
Buffalo, now 5-4, dropped back a game in the AFC East as the New England Patriots defeated the Jets on Sunday night. Coming off one of his worst performances of the season, Fitzpatrick and the Bills will travel to Miami next Sunday to take on the Dolphins.
But things weren't all bad for Crimson alums on Sunday.
In Seattle, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Seahawks, 22-17. Center Matt Birk ’98, who had missed practice last Wednesday, was active as the Ravens only rushed 12 times for a total of 75 yards. The loss drops the Ravens to 6-3, now half a game behind the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC North.
And in San Diego, Raiders defensive tackle Desmond Bryant ‘09 had his first sack of the season as he helped Oakland beat the Chargers. The Raiders collected six sacks on the game and took sole posession of first place in the AFC West with the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—Through 20 minutes of action, the Harvard men’s basketball and Holy Cross are tied, 34-34.
Our live blog can be found here.
Junior Kyle Casey (11 points) led the Crimson to a 20-19 advantage midway through the first half. But thanks to a number of Harvard mishaps on the glass and defensive end, Holy Cross went on a 9-4 run to grab a 28-24 lead with 5:19 to play in the half.
Freshman forward Steve Moundou-Missi and junior point guard Brandyn Curry led the Crimson on a 10-4 run to close the half.
Casey, who leads all scorers with 11 points on six shots, went down late in the first half after appearing to be poked in the eye.
The Crusaders have been led by do-it-all wing R.J. Evans, who has eight points on eight shots. But Holy Cross has done most of its damage on the glass, outrebounding the Crimson, 14-11.
Check back after the game for a full recap.

If you have heard the trumpeting, raucous call of a vuvuzelas on campus, you have likely heard the product of last year's Silence Yale campaign. Attendants of the Game this weekend might expect a similar earache to the one vuvuzelas bring; this year, the group is selling limited-edition Harvard-Yale thundersticks.
The campaign, organized by Eric M. Cervini '14 and Johnathon H. Davis '14, began as a way to combine the lingering enthusiasm for last summer's World Cup with the excitement of the Game, according to Davis.
Last fall, the group sold over 500 vuvuzelas, Cervini said. The noisemakers were banned on the day of the Game, however, and individuals were prohibited from bringing them into the stadium.
The pair does not anticipate a similar outcome for these particular noisemakers.
"Since the thundersticks are inflatable, it will be less of an issue with people bringing them into places," Davis said.
Thundersticks not connected with this campaign will be handed out for free at the upcoming Harvard-Yale pep rally. The thundersticks sold by the campaign, however, may end up as collector's items.
"Last year, the Harvard Archives contacted us, and they actually purchased a vuvuzelas and put it in a permanent collection," Cervini said.
Either way, the Game promises to be especially noisy.

How long does it take to develop an idea, launch a website, and host the first online event? Just one weekend for the team that created Townhall 140, a video and Twitter based platform that allows users to go face-to-face with leaders on political issues."The fundamental problem that we're trying to address is that it's really hard to communicate with our government even though social media has given us the potential to bring us closer than we've ever been before. The general concept I was trying to address is that democracy shouldn't be so hard with the technology that we have," said Monica S. Liu '12, one of the creators the site.
Townhall 140 uses a Twitter feed on one side of the page, where users vote up or down on certain issues that they care about. Users get 140 characters initially and then the most voted-up tweets get a chance to live video chat with the designated leader.
Townhall 140 began its development last Friday night, as part of the Harvard iLab's "Startup Scramble." Over a hundred students and local entrepreneurs pitched ideas. Liu pitched her idea "Gov 140," which grew into Townhall 140 through input from team members who included people from the Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, Harvard School of Education, as well as other Harvard College students. The video platform was made available by the designer and developer for Tokbox, Jonathan Mumm.
On Nov. 13 the site held its first live video chat, or "virtual town hall," hosting Trey Grayson, the director of the Institute of Politics, to talk about Occupy Harvard. Although the team believed the event was a success, Townhall 140 has bigger plans for their project.
"We're trying to see how we can move the product forward and how to expand into other areas,"  said Peter N. Hadar '13, who was formerly affiliated with the project. "Getting more leaders and possibly improving our version of the product. In the coming weeks, we're hoping to make the site more visible and get more users."
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: November 16, 2011
The Nov. 15 post "Townhall 140: Bringing Twitter and Politics Together" misidentified Peter N. Hadar '13's position within Townhall 140. He is, in fact, currently unaffiliated with the project.

This past Sunday in Currier House, Crimson editors Vivian B. Ling '14 and Nikki M. Iacopetti '14's dreary return to organic chemistry and Hegel analysis was further procrastinated by the sight of a hawk perched on a railing in Currier courtyard. Upon inspection of the magnificent bird, Iacopetti also spotted an unfortunate bunny who obviously hadn't put "not get eaten by a hawk" at the top of its wish list on 11/11.
