After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final game of the regular season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team recorded its 11th sweep of the year and locked up the three seed in the EIVA postseason tournament.
The Crimson (17-7, 10-4 EIVA) traveled to Sacred Heart on Saturday afternoon to face the Pioneers (4-19, 2-12).  Coming into the weekend, the third and fourth seeds were still up for grabs in the EIVA Championship tournament. With the fourth seed having to play the 14th best team in the nation—Penn State—the difference between placing third or fourth was made even starker.
Harvard needed a win and a Princeton loss to guarantee the three seed, and the team got just that with Harvard’s 3-0 victory over Sacred Heart and George Mason’s 3-0 win over the Tigers.
“I think we looked at it as just another game this season that we could win and win in three,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “It didn’t matter where George Mason or Penn State was and who they were playing because we just knew we needed to go out and get the win.”
The third set was back-and-fourth the entire way, with the teams trading points until it was 13-all. The Crimson used kills by Madden and sophomore outside hitter DJ White to take a 16-13 lead, but the Pioneers battled back to take a 23-22 advantage. However, back-to-back kills by White and Madden followed by an attack error by Sacred Heart gave Harvard the three-set victory.
The Crimson had a strong game on both ends of the floor, posting a .432 hitting percentage while limiting the Pioneers to .111 in the same category. The .432 hitting percentage for Harvard’s offense is the team’s fourth best mark on the season.
Early in the first set, the Crimson fell behind, 14-9. After battling back to within two, Harvard used a 7-0 run with Madden serving to take a commanding 23-18 lead. The 7-0 run was fueled by five hitting errors by Sacred Heart to go along with an ace for Madden and a kill by freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens.
Madden led the Harvard offense on the afternoon with a team-high 11 kills and a .550 hitting percentage.  The junior opposite hitter was not limited to the offensive side of the stat sheet though. He also led the team in digs, with seven. Clemens recorded seven kills on just 12 attacks with no attack errors for a stellar .583 hitting percentage to go along with five digs and one ace.
Junior outside hitter Brad Borsay and junior setter Jason Kinney kept the Pioneers in the game with their offense, tallying 10 and nine kills, respectively, while adding five digs apiece.
To start the second set, the Crimson jumped out to an early 5-1 advantage, a lead it would not relinquish in the frame.  Sacred Heart would later cut the deficit to two, 10-8, but two more runs by Harvard pushed the visiting squad’s lead to 23-15. A block by sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick and an attack error by the Pioneers gave the Crimson the second set, 25-16.
Zimmick led the strong defensive effort for the Crimson with a team-high six blocks. Co-captain and setter Rob Lothman added four blocks of his own to go along with his 29 assists.
“Two things really stood out to me about Saturday’s game that we did really well—blocking and serving,” Lothman said. “Caleb was doing a great job getting to a lot of balls and not only getting some blocks, but also forcing [Sacred Heart] to make errors while trying to hit around him. On the serving side, we had as many aces as serving errors which is pretty tough to do in this league.”
Saturday’s win marks only the second time all season that Harvard has achieved an ace-to-error ratio of at least one. White led the strong serving night for the Crimson with a team-high three aces. The sophomore also tallied nine kills and five digs for a strong all-around performance on the afternoon.
Saturday’s win over the Pioneers in its regular season finale sets up a rematch of last year’s EIVA semifinals as Harvard will face George Mason in the first round of the postseason tournament for the second year in a row.
“Having consistent winning seasons two years in a row is a really good sign that this program in on the rise,” Lothman said. “I think we are here to stay as one of the top two or three teams in our conference and that we are going to [make it to the postseason] year-in and year-out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second day in a row, the Harvard baseball team took the first game of a doubleheader but could not finish the deal in the rubber match.
Playing against Brown (5-28, 3-13 Ivy) in a doubleheader in Providence, R.I., the Crimson (10-26, 7-9) took advantage of a seventh-inning comeback in game one and a pair of runs in the tenth inning to capture the first game, 4-2.
But the Harvard offense could not get going in the fourth game of the weekend, and Brown was able to salvage the split, winning by the same margin as its defeat in the first contest.
The split leaves the Crimson four games behind leader Dartmouth (26-7, 11-5) in the Red Rolfe Division heading into the showdown between the two teams in the final series of play next weekend.
“This team never gets down,” co-captain Rob Wineski said. “That’s just our nature; that’s our personality. Good things always can happen to us. We don’t want to give up on anything, and we know some guys are going to come through at some point during the game to give us a chance to win.”
BROWN 4, HARVARD 2
In the second game of the day, the Crimson got the scoring started early but could not sustain it. Although Harvard was held scoreless for seven straight innings, the team found itself with the potential winning run at the plate in the top of the ninth, but ultimately it could not convert.
Sophomore Lucas Whitehill earned the win for the Bears, going eight strong innings while only allowing four hits. Junior pitcher Baron Davis battled into the eighth inning for the Crimson, but ended up surrendering three earned runs and was credited with the loss.
Harvard got the scoring started in the top half of the first when a double from sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel brought in sophomore infielder Matt Timoney. Kregel was the only member of the Crimson to have multiple hits in the game.
Brown managed to even the score in the bottom of the first after an error brought home a run.
The score remained 1-1 for two more innings before the Bears tacked on a pair of runs in the bottom of the fourth on two hits, a wild pitch, and a stolen base.
After sophomore Wes Van Boom homered for Brown in the bottom of the eighth, Harvard entered the ninth down, 4-1. But the Crimson would not go away quietly, mounting a rally in its last at-bats of the day.
Harvard loaded the bases with one out, and Timoney was hit by a pitch to plate the team’s first run since the beginning of the game. But after a pitching change, Kregel bounced a ball to the third baseman, who stepped on the bag and threw the sophomore out at first to complete the double-play and end the game.
“We had the bases loaded, but it’s never the last inning that gets you, it’s the innings before,” Wineski said. “We were right there.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 2
Finding itself down two runs entering the final inning of a seven-inning game and not having threatened in the first six frames, the Crimson took advantage of three errors from the Bears to score a pair of runs and force extra innings.
After Harvard tagged out the potential game-winning run at the plate in the bottom of the ninth, the team took the lead for good in the next inning. A bases-loaded single from Kregel plated the team’s third run of the game, and the fourth followed two batters later after sophomore infielder Nick Saathoff earned an RBI walk.
Sophomore pitcher Tanner Anderson went the distance on the mound, throwing 138 pitches in all ten innings without surrendering a single earned run on six hits.
“He’s a bulldog; he’s going to go out there and compete,” Kregel said. “For him to go out and go ten innings on the mound and in the second game play second base, that just shows a lot about the player he is in general. His mindset is such a competitive mindset, it’s just unbelievable.”
Brown scored its only runs of the game in the bottom of the third. With two outs and runners on second and third, an error in the Crimson infield allowed the batter to reach and both runners to score.
Neither team pushed across any additional runs until the top of the seventh, when Harvard tied the game without registering any hits. A walk and two errors allowed Saathoff to score the first run of the inning, and a third error a batter later brought home freshman infielder Mitch Klug to force extras.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One up and one down.
It’s been a consistent theme for the Harvard baseball team throughout its conference season, and that trend continued in Providence Saturday afternoon when the Crimson split its sixth consecutive Ivy doubleheader.
Harvard (10-26, 7-9 Ivy) recorded 18 hits in a 12-10 win over Brown (5-28, 3-13), but it could not find the same success at the plate in game two when a nine-run Bears first inning doomed the Crimson to a 14-2 loss.
BROWN 14, HARVARD 2
Brown jumped on Harvard starter Sean Poppen early as the rookie struggled with his control.
After walking leadoff hitter Jake Levine, Poppen surrendered singles to Tim McKeithan and Will Marcal and a double to Dan Massey to fall behind 2-0. A passed ball gave Brown another run, and following a strikeout, Wes Van Boom recorded an RBI single up the middle and Dan Kerr homered to left to make it 6-0 Bears.
After a strikeout of J.J. Franco, Poppen gave up three more runs as John Sheridan singled, Levine walked, McKeithan singled, and Marcal doubled to left.
The freshman starter lasted just one more inning, in which he gave up a Franco RBI single, and saw his ERA balloon to 6.10 on the year.
Against reliever Shaun Rubin, the Bears continued pouring it on with a Franco sacrifice fly in the fourth and a Van Boom three-run homer in the seventh to finish with 14 runs; coming into the day, its previous season-high had been six.
On the mound, Brown starter Dave St. Lawrence threw eight strong innings to earn his first win of the season. The lone Crimson runs came on a Sean O’Neill homer to right-center in the fifth—his first dinger of the year—and a Nick Saathoff RBI single to center in the eighth.
“Brown was the first team to score, so they had a lot of momentum,” sophomore Brandon Kregel said. “Especially with them getting nine runs in the bottom of the first—that’s really hard to battle back against.”
HARVARD 12, BROWN 10
In a high-scoring affair, Harvard put together a seven-run fourth and survived a last-gasp Brown rally to earn the victory.
Harvard went into the bottom of the seventh—the final inning—leading 12-6. Van Boom led off with a double and Kerr walked against Harvard co-captain Jordan Haviland.  Following a fielder’s choice, an RBI single, a two-run triple, and a sacrifice fly, the Bears were within two at 12-10.
But after a Marcal single to right brought the tying run to the plate, Haviland struck out Massey to shut the door.
“We did a few things we obviously need to improve on,” co-captain Robert Wineski said. “[But] we still came out with a win.”
That seventh inning was the fifth in which both teams scored during the contest.
The Crimson jumped out to a 2-0 advantage in the top of the first on RBI singles by sophomore Tanner Anderson and Wineski. In the bottom of the frame, Brown got one back on a Massey sacrifice fly.
Both teams scored once in the third, as Anderson crossed the plate on a wild pitch and Cody Slaughter had an RBI single to make it 3-2.
In the fourth, Harvard put seven runs on the board. Before the Bears’ Anthony Galan could record an out, a Jeff Hadjin double, Mike Martin single, Mitch Klug double, Kregel single, and Anderson single had plated three. After Saathoff grounded out, back-to-back hits by Wineski and freshman D.J. Link put the Crimson ahead, 8-2, and Harvard scored two more runs before the inning was up on a Hadjin infield hit and a Martin single to center.
“We had the momentum going into the inning, and one thing that we learned this year is to just keep the momentum when we have it,” Kregel said. “A lot of times you score like three runs in an inning and people become complacent, and I think in [the seventh] inning people just kept on wanting more, and that was pretty huge.”
A Levine RBI single in the bottom of the fourth and a Saathoff RBI double in the top of the fifth made it 11-3 before the Bears scored three more on a Massey two-run home run and Franco RBI single.
Saathoff homered for the second time this year in the top of the seventh to put the Crimson up six heading into the final frame.
Kregel, Anderson, and sophomore Mike Martin all finished with three hits for Harvard, while junior Sam Dodge earned the win despite allowing six runs in five innings.
“Dodge threw very well,” Kregel said. “It all just comes down to everyone trusting each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team’s weekend schedule may have been interrupted, but its momentum certainly wasn’t, as the team continued its roll by defeating rival Yale, 5-2, on Sunday in New Haven at the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center.
The No. 22 Crimson (17-4, 5-0 Ivy) has now won 12 straight matches and 10 straight Ancient Eight matchups dating to last season following the defeat of the No. 57 Bulldogs (17-6, 3-3 Ivy). And a weekend that began with a schedule shakeup ended with happy news: After Princeton lost to Columbia Sunday night, Harvard was assured at least a share of the Ivy League title for the second consecutive year.
On Sunday, Harvard maintained its dominance over the rest of the Ivy League as it continued its march towards a second consecutive outright conference title. The Crimson also took down the Bulldogs for the second time this season after scoring a 4-2 victory in February at the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championships in Ithaca.
This time, Harvard took it to Yale on its home courts.
The Crimson started off hot in doubles play, where its top tandem of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster, ranked 52nd in the nation, took an early break en route to winning the match, 8-5. After the second team of freshman Nicky Hu and senior co-captain Andy Nguyen also prevailed, the No. 3 match was suspended and Harvard clinched the doubles point for the 12th straight match.
In singles, the bottom three singles spots took care of business in short order to quickly eliminate any suspense and give the Crimson the match.
First, freshman Kelvin Lam took down the Bulldogs’ Kyle Dawson on the sixth court, 6-2, 6-1. Then, sophomore Alex Steinroeder, playing in the fourth spot on Sunday, handed Yale’s Martin Svenning his first home singles loss of the year, 6-2, 6-4.
Freshman Nicky Hu then won in straight sets over Zach Dean at No. 5 to push Harvard ahead 4-0 and clinch the match.
With the victory secured, the Crimson did not fare quite as well in the top slots in matches that concluded after the match was out of reach. Crimson head coach Dave Fish referred to the Bulldogs’ top three singles players as “outstanding.” Yale’s No. 1 and No. 2 players, seniors John Huang and Marc Powers, respectively, had both compiled 4-1 records in Ivy play before facing Harvard.
But on the second court, sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri won the first set 7-5 before Powers retired in the second set, marking Powers’ first home singles loss of the season and giving the Crimson a 5-0 advantage.
Andy Nguyen is 12-2 in fourth singles this season, but was playing at No. 3 on Sunday and lost in three sets.
Finally, at No. 1, Huang and Denis Nguyen played a tight match. Nguyen took the first set 6-4 and broke Huang’s serve twice early in the second, but Huang fought back and won the set and the deciding “super tiebreak” that was played in place of a third set. The loss provided the final 5-2 margin.
All things considered, Fish was very happy with the way his team took on the top of the Bulldogs’ lineup.
“I thought they did a great job,” he said. “Denis played terrific tennis, but just lost focus at the end. Andy also did a tremendous job. And Shaun really came out hitting it from the beginning, and put pressure on Powers that he wasn’t used to.”
The Crimson was originally scheduled to play Brown on Friday at home before making the trip to play Yale on Sunday, but because the citywide manhunt for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev put the campus on lockdown, the match had to be postponed and rescheduled for next Thursday.
“Our first thoughts when we knew the match was canceled were about the families affected,” Chaudhuri said. “We wanted to make sure our minds were in the right place. It definitely called for thought and reflection, and really puts things in perspective as far as how thankful we are for the opportunity to play tennis. At the same time, we had to keep working hard and preparing for Yale.”
Although the team knows it has a share of the Ivy title clinched, it will keep its focus on the matches ahead.
“Brown on Thursday, Dartmouth on Saturday,” Chaudhuri said. “We’re going to keep working and fine-tuning to get to where we want to be for the last Ivy matches. We’ve still got to do this a couple more times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews continued undefeated spring seasons over the weekend. The No. 2 heavyweights took two of four races against Princeton on Sunday to secure the Compton Cup while the No. 1 lightweights captured three out of four races against Navy on Saturday at home on the Charles River.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavyweights raced Princeton under calm conditions to win their seventh-straight Compton Cup title on Sunday morning.  The competition was originally scheduled for Saturday morning, but, due to Friday’s lockdown and the difficulties it posed for traveling, the matchup was postponed to Sunday.  MIT was expected to compete, but was ultimately unable to attend due to the schedule change.
“We had to wait 24 hours, but our heads were all in the right place,” said senior Justin Mundt, stroke of the second varsity boat.  “We were up and ready to race.”
The Crimson’s first varsity eight finished in 6:03.3, defeating the Tigers by a margin of 3.4 seconds.  In another close contest, Harvard’s second varsity boat fell to Princeton by 3.3 seconds.
“I thought it was a good row from our guys [Sunday] morning,” Mundt said. “It was a very strong crew from Princeton so credit to them for rowing a good race.  We didn’t get the rhythm we hoped to, but it was a solid row and we are looking forward to our next races.”
The Crimson’s first freshman boat defeated the Tigers by a considerable margin, completing the course in 6:26.4.  The third varsity race went to the Princeton crew, which finished in 6:35.3.
Harvard will race at home on the Charles River next weekend against Penn and Navy for the Adams cup.
“We expect some really good racing,” Mundt said. “Both crews usually come out really strong against us.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Harvard lightweights took three of four races on Saturday morning against Navy to secure their fifth straight Haines Cup victory.
The race came the morning after the Boston-area lockdown was lifted. Friday’s weigh-in was cancelled, and the crew did not know whether it was going to race until late Friday night. But the Crimson responded well to the uncertainty surrounding the competition.
“All of us are very scheduled about the way we make weight and it’s the same every time,” lightweight captain Erich Shultze said. “To have that in limbo and up in the air over the course of the day can be taxing on our guys… but, all our guys are tough mentally and were ready to go. They adapted really well to the situation.”
In addition, the Crimson faced difficult weather conditions on the Charles River on Saturday morning.
“The conditions were really rough which definitely played a part [in dictating the racing],” Shultze said. “I think all of our boats took longer than usual to find their rhythms. But, I think we are all very pleased with the way the race went.  It’s always tough to beat Navy, so we are definitely happy with the race results.”
In the first varsity race, Harvard pulled ahead in the second half of the course to finish in 6:44.3, defeating Navy by 10.5 seconds.  The second varsity race was also a close contest, with the Crimson completing the course in 6:41.6, 9.2 seconds ahead of the Midshipmen.
“It was really tight in both races to the 1,000-meter mark,” Schultze said. “Both races played out similarly in that in the third 500 we started to really find rhythm and pull away.  In the second varsity we had a really great sprint and were able to move away as the race progressed.”
The Harvard freshman boat also recorded a win in 6:44.9.  The third varsity race went to Navy, which defeated the Crimson by a margin of 12.6 seconds.
Harvard will face Yale and Princeton next weekend in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta, one of the most historic and challenging competitions of the season for the Crimson.
“It’s definitely going to be a fast race with a lot of good guys on the start line, so we are looking forward to it,” Schultze said.
