After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I am personally opposed to killing abortionists.  However, inasmuch as my personal opposition to this practice is rooted in a sectarian (Catholic) religious belief in the sanctity of human life, I am unwilling to impose it on others who may, as a matter of conscience, take a different view…. In short, I am moderately pro-choice.”
These words, penned by Princeton professor Robert P. George, might seem shocking and appalling if taken at face value.  However, this passage is actually a satirical indictment of the position that while abortion is wrong, we should not impose this moral conclusion on other people.  The position that Dr. George (a pro-life advocate and an outspoken opponent of violence) mocks is patently absurd—which is precisely his point.  Yet the “personally pro-life” stance is quite common: Politicians like Joe Biden and Rudy Giuliani agree with it.  Both their views and George’s satirical view show the same flawed logic.
Those who take the “personally opposed but pro-choice” position must confront the question: why are you “personally opposed” to abortion in the first place?  The obvious answer is that you have at least some notion that abortion is morally wrong.  Even if you don’t know precisely why, you know that there is something special about life before birth that deserves protection.  Even if you can’t articulate your reasoning—or even phrase it in this way—you intuit that a child in utero is in fact a person, with all the dignity and moral worth of any other person.  Indeed, the only answer to this question is that you believe that a child in the womb is a human being; otherwise, there is no reason to have any moral qualms about destroying one.
Though vague, these perceptions are exactly correct, with plenty of well-developed philosophical and scientific reasoning to support them. They are ideas not to be hidden out of shame or fear, but to be offered to the world and defended with pride.
How should these moral conclusions affect abortion law?  Those who take the “personally opposed but pro-choice” position propose that they should have no impact at all.  They contend that the decision to have an abortion should only be made by the individual, and that government should not try to “legislate morality.”  However, this view carries implications with which no one is comfortable.  Under the “personally opposed” logic, Dr. George’s satirical jab at the pro-choice movement becomes a completely legitimate position.  Both are based on respecting a person’s purported right to perform grave moral evils that harm other people.
When applied to other issues this logic is quite obviously untenable.  It suggests that we should respect the right of thieves to steal things or the right of arsonists to burn down buildings if they so choose.  In fact, the “personally opposed” reasoning would not even permit the abolition of slavery.  Perhaps, the reasoning would go, we could take action to reduce the number of plantation owners who feel the need to exploit slave labor.  However, we should stop short of banning slavery outright, out of respect for the rights of conscience of those who make the choice to own other people.
The error of the “personally opposed but pro-choice” position lies in a fundamental misconception of the law itself.  Although the proper scope of government is a matter of considerable debate, most people can agree that one of the most basic roles of government is to protect human rights and dignity.  However, the only way the government can offer such protection is by rendering moral judgments and acting upon them.  This could mean making a conclusion about the morality of theft, arson, or slavery, or about the moral value of a life in the womb.  In any case, the idea of refraining from acting on such moral judgments makes little sense; indeed, it undermines the concept of the rule of the law itself.
Those who believe in the right to life of the unborn and those who do not can have a legitimate debate over the nature of personhood; however, those who are “personally opposed but pro-choice” simply have no rational basis for their position.  If abortion is wrong (and thus something that should be opposed) it is because it is the unjust taking of the life of its unborn victims.  But if that is so, then potential victims have a right to life, which a government is bound to protect.  When it comes to protecting innocent human life from deliberate destruction, no one should ask, “Are we justified in preventing this?”  Rather, anyone who is “personally opposed” to abortion has but one place in this debate: standing in support of the pro-life cause, affirming the intrinsic value and dignity of all human life.

Perhaps no catchphrase is as important in understanding how liberal policy wonks think as, “Programs for the poor are poor programs.” The central insight is simple. We live in a democracy. Programs that benefit a large group of people, and especially a large, politically active, group of people, are less likely to be cut than ones that only benefit a smaller group of people, especially if that group is less politically involved. Those living under the poverty line make up a far bigger group than they should—15.1 percent of the population at last counting—but that’s far from enough to form a durable base of support for spending programs, especially when poor people are less likely to vote or otherwise participate in the political process.
One can think of numerous examples of this principle playing out. Programs that directly target poor people—Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, and so forth—tend to be the first to get cut when states or the federal government want to tighten their belts. By contrast, large programs which help the poor the most but also give substantial aid to the middle class—Social Security and Medicare are the best examples—are politically untouchable most of the time. The implication for liberals is clear. It may not make sense, as a matter of justice, for the government to be using the regressive Social Security payroll tax to send money to a retiree with millions in savings,but if doing so preserves the program for those who truly need it, it is a fair trade.
But a funny thing has happened this year. Suddenly, big, universal entitlement programs aren’t safe. The change started in 2010, when President Obama signed health care reform into law. That proposal finances large health insurance subsidies, mostly for low-income people, in part by cutting Medicare spending. But the trend intensified after the midterms, when it became clear that Republicans were going to demand big cuts in government spending. And because Social Security and Medicare make up over a third of the annual federal budget—and Medicare will make up more as health care spending continues to rise—big cuts mean cuts to them.
The Obama administration showed a remarkable willingness to entertain entitlement cuts, even offering to increase the retirement age for Medicare during the debt limit talks this past summer. That measure, one of the more regressive possible ways to cut the program, thankfully did not make it into the final deal, but what did is still illustrative. Now that the supercommittee has failed, a two percent across-the-board cut in Medicare payments to doctors is set to take effect. By comparison, the traditional whipping boys of the budget process—food stamps, Medicaid, and other programs targeted at the poor—are exempted from cuts. It’s clear that even universal programs are now vulnerable.
If universal programs aren’t safe anymore, what is? The answer, perplexingly, is spending that happens to occur through the tax code. The government has hundreds of billions of dollars a year of expenses that take the form of personal income tax deductions. Much of this spending is ill-advised: the mortgage interest deduction is regressive and helped fuel the housing bubble, the charitable deduction almost exclusively helps the rich, and the health insurance deduction has made it harder for people to move between jobs by making them depend on their employers for health insurance.
But because the spending happens to be implemented in the tax code, no Republican will dare cut it. In recent “supercommittee” negotiations, the most Republicans would concede on taxes is a reversal of the deduction for owners of corporate jets; anything more popular than that was untouchable when not combined with big cuts for the rich. What’s more, America’s most successful anti-poverty program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, is a tax measure whose invulnerability to cuts defies the “programs for the poor are poor programs” maxim, as political scientist Christopher Howard has noted.
This is not to say that Republicans will initially support expanding the welfare state through the tax code (though daring them to vote against tax breaks could be fun). But it does suggest that putting welfare spending in the tax code is the way to make it politically durable. The simplest way would be to enact a negative income tax, under which all Americans would be given a lump sum and then taxed progressively, such that the rich have to pay this amount back and then some. This would simplify welfare programs as well as make them less paternalistic by giving the poor more freedom to spend on what they like instead of prescribed goods like housing or food.
I’m not optimistic that major progressive initiatives like this will be implemented anytime soon. But when they are, they should be built to last. In the current political climate, “built to last” means “built into the tax code.”

On Monday, musician Lionel Richie was awarded the 2011 Harvard Foundation Peter J. Gomes award for his humanitarian work. Richie’s humanitarian achievements, including co-authoring a song to benefit earthquake victims in Haiti and hunger victims in Africa as well as advocating for breast cancer research, are laudable and deserving of recognition. Though Richie was certainly a worthy recipient of the Peter J. Gomes award, we nonetheless encourage Harvard organizations to honor non-celebrities, finding people who devote their entire lives to the betterment of society in order to acknowledge the unacknowledged and to more objectively select from among a multitude of deserving award recipients.
Harvard and Harvard-affiliated institutions very often grant awards to celebrities: for instance, Hasty Pudding Theatricals annually gives two outstanding entertainers the titles Man and Woman of the Year, and the Harvard Foundation names a performer that has demonstrated artistic and humanitarian excellence the Artist of the Year every spring.
There are certainly excellent reasons to grant awards to celebrities: because of their tremendous influence and visibility they are in an excellent position to use their platform to inspire others to perform acts of goodwill. Additionally, hosting celebrities on Harvard’s campus is an honor that is exciting to all members of the Harvard community and that contributes to our influence as an institution.
Nonetheless, celebrities should not make up the bulk of award recipients. Pop stars receive an enormous amount of recognition and influence as members of the American elite and Harvard, as an academic institution that serves the public, bears no obligation to contribute to their fame. Instead Harvard bears the responsibility of recognizing and rewarding those who have contributed to the public good to the greatest extent, regardless of the level of fame that they have achieved. An award from a prestigious institution like Harvard would benefit a recipient who has not achieved fame much more than it would a celebrity by significantly enhancing their public visibility and influence.
To this end, we encourage Harvard and its organizations to bestow awards on people other than celebrities whenever possible and to consider creating additional awards that do not preclude non-celebrities from recognition. It is rare for celebrities to contribute to humanitarian causes via any means other than their financial and personal support, and while this is extremely important to the survival of humanitarian work, there are many ways to contribute even more meaningfully to society without the financial resources of celebrities. For instance, donating money to an organization or activist movement is certainly not equivalent to being the visionary behind that movement and devoting one’s life to it. Harvard would do well to recognize such humanitarian leaders, whose work far outweighs the necessary but ultimately fungible contributions of wealthy donors.
There is much to be said for honoring the generous contributions of celebrities to causes that do not bear any immediate relevance to their careers. However, it is worth noting that Harvard, as a prominent university, a taxpayer-funded nonprofit, and an institution that urges its students to “serve better thy country and thy kind,” should seek to reward first and foremost those who have most faithfully exhibited its values.

Every week is Europe’s most important week yet of the Euro crisis and this week is no different. Half-hearted or weak measures continue to fail to stem what looks increasingly likely to result in the worst financial and economic crisis the world has experienced since the Great Depression and years of economic disaster that might make the 2008 financial crisis look like a warm-up.
In the context of this impending doom, it is imperative that United States lawmakers and policymakers take action over the next month to keep the American economy strong enough to survive a large fall in European economic activity. Europe is a vital market for American goods, accounting for 20 percent of all exports, and the largest risk to our economy might be a credit crunch created by the collapse of the European financial system, as Europe is already in the midst of a practical credit freeze and our financial systems are unalterably linked.
The United States vitally needs a firewall against the ever more likely European disaster and lawmakers from both parties are coalescing around an extension of the payroll tax cuts and unemployment insurance, both of which are absolutely essential to provide some strength to the economy.
The payroll tax cut is an employment-focused demand-side incentive that puts money back in the hands of workers. At a time of strained budgets, this money often goes back into the economy in the form of essential spending. Over the last year, the tax cut decreased the employer Social Security contribution on the paycheck from a rate of 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent on the first $106,800 of salary, and Democrats have proposed lowering it further to 3.1 percent. Lowering the employee payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent “would increase GDP by 0.5 percent more than keeping the tax at its current rate,” according to Moody’s Analytics. Arguments that it takes money away from Social Security are unfounded; this is merely an accounting identity, but the government can and does move money from other accounts to ensure Social Security is solvent in event of a payroll tax cut.
As crucial to the economy and the welfare of everyday Americans as the payroll tax cut is the extension of unemployment insurance. Unemployment benefits provide much needed help to those without jobs and given our country’s weak safety net it’s often the only thing keeping many American families from abject poverty. Right now, Congress has allowed up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefits, but if Congress doesn’t act to extend benefits, the maximum length of unemployment benefits will drop to six months and 2.1 million people will lose their benefits by February, resulting in immense suffering for the least fortunate. Those who worry about the benefit extension creating less of an incentive to find a new job clearly have no idea what it is like to be unemployed; benefits are far too small to live with even a modicum of comfort and by no means is living on unemployment insurance a pleasant way to support a family or lead a life.
Not only do these benefits provide urgent help to those most in need, but they are absolutely vital to the strength of the economy. The unemployed are the least likely to have discretionary income, but also the most likely to need it for their daily lives. As a result, money they receive through unemployment benefits is almost entirely spent on food, housing, and necessities, making it one of the most effective methods of stimulus available to the government.
Much of the current debate in Congress is taking place over how to pay for these benefits. Democrats have proposed a millionaire’s tax while Republicans have proposed a federal hiring freeze. The Democratic proposal is reasonable but should ideally be part of a larger progressive overhaul of the tax code. The Republican proposal would be completely counter-productive to the goal of creating jobs and might even make the federal government function more expensively.
Ideally, Congress should not pay for these measures at all and instead engage in deficit spending. Treasury rates have never been lower, and investors will literally pay us to borrow from them. During a time of weak aggregate demand it makes sense for governments to engage in deficit spending to bolster demand. This was true in the Great Depression, true in 2009, and for better or worse, given the fragile state of our economy, still true now.
Mark Zandi of Moody’s has estimated that failing to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits would result in approximately a one percent loss in GDP growth which would exact an enormous human toll on everyday Americans and compound the problems sure to be created by the European situation and decreasing Asian demand. Congress absolutely must not go home to celebrate Christmas without helping struggling workers and the unemployed, many of whom are in for a very rough winter if these provisions are not extended.

Students who were exposed to ultraviolet radiation in a lab for Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” last week can expect temporary burning, irritation, and minor vision loss, but no lasting harmful effects, according to a Harvard Medical School ophthalmologist.
Justin M. Kanoff, director of the Eye Trauma Service for the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, said that most students who were injured in the accident suffered only from a “corneal burn,” an acute injury to the front-most part of the eye.
At least five LPSA students were sent to Massachusetts Eye and Ear later that day due to eye injuries.
According to Kanoff, when the cornea is exposed to UV light in high doses, some corneal cells die and are sloughed off, causing the painful irritation reported by some LPSA students.
Normally, corneal burns have no long-term effects on the eye, but rather heal in a matter of days through treatment with topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatory eye drops, he said.
“Most people who have surface damage [to the eye] heal without problems,” said Kanoff, who had access to patient’s records from the incident.
Citing patient privacy concerns, Kanoff could neither confirm nor deny whether some students had experienced burning in deeper structures of the eye, such as the retina, the light-sensitive organ that connects directly to the optic nerve.
“Exposure to UV light can cause injuries throughout the eye,” Kanoff said. “The front of the eye becomes very irritated. Luckily, not a lot of [the radiation] gets to the back of the eye.”
He said that suffering from retinal burns could cause phototoxicity—irritation caused by light exposure—that “may not heal.” He added that injuries to the retina can cause problems with visual acuity, meaning the visual field becomes blurry and straight lines appear wavy, or can cause scotomas—patches of blindness in the visual field. These effects could be permanently debilitating.
Kanoff said that eye injuries from radiation exposure are fairly uncommon because most people exposed to UV light wear protective goggles.
Students in LPSA were completing the course’s final lab, which included viewing DNA strands using a blue light transilluminator, a device that emits UV light.
The student’s lab instructions did not include directions to use goggles for this part of the experiment, and it remains unclear as to whether students were verbally instructed to do so by the teaching fellows present.
Harvard has since launched a formal review of the incident.

Although it fell on the first day of fall reading period, the Office of Career Services’ annual Summer Opportunities Fair this Monday drew hoards of students who shifted their focus away from papers and study guides to summer internship options.
Student attendees roamed between tables representing Harvard affiliate programs in the Radcliffe Gym and company representatives offering summer employment opportunities at the Gutman Conference Center.
Employers represented at the fair included Microsoft, Oliver Wyman, and Abercrombie & Fitch. New additions to the fair’s line-up included Bloomingdale’s and the White House’s Office of the Chief Information Officer.
Ge Zhang ’13, an Economics concentrator, said that he was mainly interested in the participating consulting firms.
“It was great,” Zhang said, noting he  enjoyed the chance to connect with representatives from firms, such as Boston-based consulting giant Bain & Company.
While there was a wide range of employers and programs represented at the fair, freshmen noted their disappointment at the limited set of opportunities geared towards them.
“It was a little underwhelming from a freshman point of view,” Kevin Hu ’15 said.
But Jodi S. Balfe ’15 said that she had enjoyed the fair, even as a freshman.
“It was good to see that a lot of companies were looking for people with quantitative skills,” Balfe, who may concentrate in an applied science, said. “It was good to get a feel for what they were looking for.”
According to Deborah Carroll, Associate Director of Employer Relations and Operations, OCS made deliberate efforts to indicate which programs offered opportunities for freshmen in handouts distributed at the fair.
One of the employers looking for freshmen, Genevieve C. Chawluk, from the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University, said the program was looking for students of all majors who wanted to work with kids.
William J. Rice, representing venture capital firm Cue Ball, said he was particularly impressed by those students who had sought the firm out.
“Quite a few people took the time to research our firm,” Rice said. “I saw some good, sharp young students.”

Erez Lieberman-Aiden, a fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, has won the GE & Science Prize for Young Scientists for his dissertation research developing a new method of determining the three-dimensional structure of nuclear DNA.
As the grand-prize winner, Lieberman-Aiden will receive a $25,000 award in a ceremony in Stockholm on Friday. The prize, supported by GE Healthcare and the journal “Science,” recognizes graduate student research in molecular biology.
“Zoom!”—the essay Lieberman-Aiden submitted to the competition describing how the human genome is folded—was also published in the Dec. 2 issue of  “Science.”
Lieberman-Aiden explained that his work provides an answer to the question of how the human genome, which is capable of stretching to a length of two meters, can be packed into the nucleus of a cell several times thinner than a human hair.
As a student in Eric Lander’s lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lieberman-Aiden and collaborator Nynke van Berkum approached the problem by discovering which portions of the genome were in physical contact with each other.
“[We sought to find] which [pieces of the genome] are spatially adjacent or tend to be spatially adjacent,” he said. “By mapping those long range contacts which are parts of the genome that are far apart along the linear contour—but actually tend to be nearby in 3-D—we are able to find out a lot of structural information about how each genome is folded out.”
Lieberman-Aiden received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University before acquiring a Ph.D. from Harvard and MIT.
He first became curious about the inner workings of the cell while at Princeton, when physics professor Robert H. Austin broached the challenges that arise as a researcher.
“[Austin] was talking about how in biology everything was very, very difficult because you never observed directly what was going on, you always had to kind of indirectly reconstruct what must have just happened,” Lieberman-Aiden said.
He said that the idea of the uncertainty that surrounds the inner workings of a cell resonated with him and prompted his further research.
“What I realized from all this,” he said, “is that if I could pick through these problems about what is going on in cells, and somehow translate them in the language of DNA sequencing, we would be able to figure out a great deal.”
Despite his research, Lieberman-Aiden explained that many questions about DNA structure remain.
“There is still a lot of room for developing better understandings in cell biology,” he said.
Lieberman-Aiden said that he is most appreciative of the relationships and experiences that he has gained by working with his fellow researchers.
“It has been a long collaboration with really fantastic people, like my adviser Eric, Andreas Gnirke, who served as a mentor, and my principal collaborator, Nynke van Berkum,” he said. “And I think it is great to come out of the other end and realize that we made a contribution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William C. Hsiao is not an imposing man. He stands barely five feet eight inches tall and at age 75 affects an air of unpretentious expertise. He speaks slowly, in accented English—a remainder of his immigrant childhood—that expresses his ideas simply and logically, point by point.
Despite his approachability and clarity, the points that Hsiao, an economics professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has chosen to study and argue are neither simple nor without controversy. Their ramifications stretch around the world, directly impacting millions of lives.
Hsiao is the world’s leading expert on single-payer health care systems. His economic expertise, accumulated through years of research and work in the private and public sectors, is much sought after by governments across the globe. To date, Hsiao has worked with nearly a dozen different countries, analyzing and implementing single-payer universal health care systems from places like Taiwan to South Africa.
“If I was a country or a state and I wanted to set up a public health care system, he’s the guy I would call,” said Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and politics at the School of Public Health. “He’s just one of the best in the world.”
The current economic climate and demographic shifts around the globe have pushed Hsiao’s work to the forefront of international health policy. With governments around the world seeking to cut public expenditures and deal with growing and aging populations, the question of how to contain health care costs has become the topic of conversation in just about every capital. One way to approach that two-pronged crisis is to put in place a single-payer health care system, which provides health care to all citizens through a single, publicly-financed insurance fund with uniform coverage and rates.
Nearly two years after Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the prospect of putting in place a single-payer system in the United States is all but dead. Consequently, states have begun to take reform into their own hands.
In the spring of 2010, legislators in Vermont began laying the groundwork for a single-payer system and asked Hsiao to study possible health care reform options for the state. Hsiao’s analysis—part of the Program in Health Care Financing he directs at the School of Public Health—became the basis for House Bill 202, which made Vermont the first state to enact a single-payer health system when it was signed into law in the spring of 2011.
Hsiao’s work in Vermont is making some advocates of health care reform—and specifically of a single-payer model—hopeful that the reform effort in that state could serve as a model for other states, advancing an effort on the state level that faces little to no prospect of success on Capitol Hill.
THE TECHNOCRAT
Hsiao styles himself as a non-ideological technocrat. He isn’t out to prove the ideological superiority of a market-based model or a socialist system—he’s simply out to put in place the best, most efficient health care system possible. And that’s what makes his effort in Vermont so attractive for many health care reformers. While there is significant debate over exactly what such a system looks like, Hsiao’s research seeks to place itself above the ideological controversies of the health care reform debate.
Hsiao’s impact on the world of health care is unique. He is not a politician or a political advocate. Nor is his background primarily in health studies. Rather, Hsiao is trained as an actuary and political economist. Accordingly, his approach to health systems is economic—not moralistic—and largely apolitical.
As Hsiao explains it, his work is based on two fundamental economic dilemmas facing health systems: lack of universal coverage and the rapidly escalating cost of care. The first of these problems is easily fixed but only increases cost. The second is more systemic and can only be resolved with complete systemic reform, Hsiao says.
Single-payer health care, Hsiao’s area of expertise, is one such approach to systemic reform. Though Hsiao is a proponent of this method, he is careful not to label himself as an advocate. He does not lobby or even advise legislation without an invitation to do so, preferring to let his analysis speak for itself.
“I’m trying to do impartial study based on evidence. I will advocate the research results I have produced into policy, but I would not make it a human-rights issue,” said Hsiao. “I just argue it delivers better results.”
Hsiao’s mixed background in economics as well as politics has earned him an atypical footing in the world of health care. Unlike most health policy experts who focus on one aspect of reform, Hsiao considers the whole picture: not only the economics of a health system, but also a country’s politics, history, and culture.
“It’s not a pure economic approach. I consider the political conditions and political forces and what those politics will allow you to do. There are potential constraints, and I am trying to optimize under those constraints,” Hsiao said.
Because those constraints vary country to country and state to state, so does Hsiao’s work and the reforms he proposes. Unlike many private health care consultants, Hsiao does not believe in a one-size-fits-all “cookie cutter” solution.
“The starting points in each country are different. The core that’s the same is that, for you to achieve universal coverage, the government has to play a large role in the financing,” Hsiao said.
In each of the countries Hsiao has worked in—from Colombia to Poland—the government has already sanctioned reform and is prepared to foot the bill for such a system, removing a significant hurdle in many countries wanting to reform. That Hsiao can then tailor a reform plan to that government is only a matter of expertise and analysis, not a matter of politics.
“He combines cutting-edge technical knowledge with a keen political sensitivity and practical experience on how to get things done,” said Michael R. Reich, a professor of international health policy at the School of Public Health.
Hsiao did not begin his career in health policy or economics. He immigrated to the United States from China as an adolescent when his father became an economic adviser to the Chinese Nationalist Party’s United Nations delegation.
After graduating from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1959 with a degree in physics and mathematics, Hsiao earned certification as an actuary, securing his first job at the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company. But a few years after he began there, Hsiao found the work unfulfilling, feeling he was doing little good for the world.
He responded with a sharp change of course into the public sector and his first foray into health policy. By 1970, Hsiao was chief actuary of the Social Security Administration and a major player in U.S. health care. He did not hold the position for long but consulted for the organization in the 1970s to help rescue it from insolvency.
Work in government satisfied Hsiao, but he felt underqualified to be dealing with health policy on such a large scale. So, still in his 30s, Hsiao changed course again, beginning studies at Harvard. He earned a master’s degree in public administration in 1972 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1982, accepting a position at the School of Public Health.
Hsiao began studying single-payer health care systems when Taiwan commissioned him to review their system in the late 1980s. Since then he has worked on five continents and almost a dozen countries, as well as consulting for organizations like the World Bank and the World Health Organization.
Hsiao is currently conducting a nationwide health care survey in China through collaboration with seven Chinese universities and the support of UNICEF. In addition, through a partnership with the World Bank, Hsiao and his team are undertaking an experimental health financing project in 100 communities in rural China affecting nearly two million people.
In early December, Hsiao will travel to Malaysia to begin a three-year study there with a team of professors and analysts.
But despite his highly visible work outside of the classroom, Hsiao has remained an active teacher throughout his career, teaching three courses at the School of Public Health this fall.
THE VERMONT EXPERIMENT
During the debate over the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the single-payer system was scrapped early on, and the reform effort shifted toward a bill that would significantly expand coverage without putting in place a federal single-payer option.
In the writing of the bill, the 2006 health care overhaul in Massachusetts, which also did not include a single-payer system, served as a model. Now, advocates for a single-payer system hope that Vermont can serve as a model during future efforts to reform the health care system on either the state or federal level. If so, Hsiao’s work will be on center stage.
Given the amount of gridlock and partisan rancor on Capitol Hill, Hsiao says that the only hope at widespread reform may be on the state level. Though reform in Vermont is still early in the implementation process, experts predict that if it succeeds, the state would likely become an example for other larger states to follow. California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Colorado have all approached Hsiao in recent months to solicit his help in possible reform efforts in their states.
“If Vermont is up and running and seems successful in the next five years, it could affect presidential agendas in 2016 and beyond,” Blendon said.
According to Hsiao, the problem is that while the Affordable Care act extended coverage to nearly all Americans, the inefficiencies latent in the system were left unchanged, allowing health care costs to continue to soar. The problem, he says, is a systemic one related to how Americans approach health services.
“Right now our whole structure is if you get sick I treat you and I get income. If you do not get sick, I don’t get paid. It’s not rocket science to see that is unsustainable,” Hsiao says.
In other words, doctors have an incentive to treat sick patients after the fact, rather than prevent sickness beforehand, a much less expensive approach.
“The mistake the United States made is that we poured so much money into health care and we postponed our reforms for so long, we’ve created very powerful stakeholders,” says Hsiao. “They are so invested, they make it so difficult, if not impossible, to reform the system.”
But if the health care overhaul in Vermont can show that it maintains the quality of care while at the same time reducing costs, advocates for a single-payer system hope that the state’s system can be implemented in other states or used like as a model for a federal overhaul akin to the way the Massachusetts system featured in the 2010 health care debate.
After it enters full operation in 2015, the Vermont law is estimated to save the state 25.3 percent annually compared to current health spending.
Critics of the law assert that the new system is likely to decrease the quality of care, lead to increased wait times, and reduce salaries in the health care industry, decreasing incentive for potential health care workers to enter the field.
But if Hsiao and his colleagues are able to present data after the law’s implementation that contradict these claims, the Vermont law could become a powerful counterargument to conservative claims against a single-payer system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many students report being evicted from Sunday’s Winter Formal co-hosted by five Houses at the House of Blues for allegedly appearing intoxicated, according to House Committee co-chairs and student emails over House lists.
The formal event—including Cabot, Currier, Dunster, Leverett, and Quincy Houses—sold out all 1,300 tickets within two hours, according to Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Ling Lin ’12.
But before 10 p.m. on Sunday evening, student complaints about unfair security constraints began to make their way over House email lists.
Lin—who helped run the event—said that some, but not all, of the complaints are valid.
“They fall in two buckets: legitimate complaints and non-legitimate complaints,” said Lin, also an associate design editor of The Crimson.
Some students under the age of 21 arrived intoxicated and possessed fake IDs, which Lin said was adequate grounds for getting kicked out.
“We assumed people wouldn’t try to break the law,” she said.
But others were kicked out of the formal without heavy intoxication.
“I do know some people who got kicked out who definitely weren’t consuming alcohol and were totally rational,” said Dunster House Committee Co-Chair Alissa N. Changala ’13, adding that others were “out of control” and were deservedly evicted from the event.
In one incident Lin referenced, two women were not admitted to formal for being “kinda clutzy in heels,” although the two had not consumed alcohol that evening.
“I don’t drink,” said one of the individuals, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue. “I’ve never had a drink at Harvard.” When she stepped out of line to adjust one of her shoes, a House of Blues bouncer approached, asked if she had been drinking, and examined her ID.
“It’s unfortunate that the House of Blues was so strict and that people may have been wrongfully kicked out, but I don’t think I’m in a position to say whether the House of Blues was right or wrong,” Changala said.
At least two students sent emails over Quincy’s email list demanding refunds for the night.
Lin plans to speak with the House of Blues on Wednesday to see if vouchers can be offered to the individuals who were evicted, but she firmly said that no cash refunds will be provided.
“I know that security was pretty strict at the dance and there were some complaints about that, but I think with the House of Blues’ liability issues it’s understandable,” Changala said.
Both Changala and Lin also noted the high proportion of formal attendees who were under 21, which meant the House of Blues had to be especially vigilant about underage drinking.
Despite the complaints, Lin said she was extraordinarily happy with how the formal went.
“Obviously people are going to talk about things that went wrong over things that went right,” Lin said.
The two expressed their satisfaction with the event and its popularity, and said that they hope that similar inter-House events will take place in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was debate on the Occupy Movements. There was a disagreement about the distinction between free speech and hate speech. And, yes, there were even trays of brownies with holiday-colored Hershey’s Kisses sprinkled on the side.
Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting—the last of the calendar year—had not one, but two impassioned discussions, forcing faculty members into the first vote on a motion in the past year.
SWAMY I’M NOT SWAMY
Facing a catalog that still featured controversial figure and Summer School instructor Subramanian Swamy, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was forced into a vote on whether to approve two courses taught by the Indian politician.
“This might be the first time we’ve ever voted on the Summer School catalog,” Professor of Comparative Religions and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck noted.
Following a lengthy discussion on an op-ed Swamy published in July—in which he advocated for the destruction of hundreds of mosques and the disenfranchisement of all non-Hindus—the faculty took a vote. University President Drew G. Faust called for an official count of the vote.
Clicking away on metal counters, three members scanned the room, as faculty kept their arms raised.
“It’s good cardiovascular exercise,” she joked as faculty waited with raised hands, drawing laughs following the previous tense discussion.
The amendment—the catalog without Swamy’s courses—ultimately passed.
FROM WALL STREET TO THE YARD, AND BACK
Susan R. Suleiman, interim chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures and one of almost 30 professors who signed a letter to Faust last week encouraging her to open the gates to the Yard, questioned the University’s response to Occupy Harvard.
“Is this about worrying we won’t get enough funds from people on Wall Street?” she asked, as several of her colleagues chuckled.
And Suleiman was not finished.
“As the president of this great university, you have a bully pulpit,” Suleiman told Faust, a statement that earned the enthusiastic applause of many present at the meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Potential legal action against the University by the families of students injured in a lab for Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” last week would likely involve proving the negligence of university employees, said professors at Harvard and Stanford Law Schools.
They added, however, that such action is unlikely because the students do not seem to have sustained lasting injury.
Several students suffered temporary eye injuries, including corneal burn, after looking into an ultraviolet light used to illuminate DNA samples during the LPSA lab. UV exposure might have been avoided had the students worn safety goggles and covered the UV transilluminator with a protective shield.
“You have an injury that is arguably due to the negligence of someone in the university,” said Keith N. Hylton ’82, a visiting law professor from Boston University. “The university could be held liable for the injury caused by that employee.”
Haeun Chang ’15, an LPSA student affected by UV exposure during her LPSA lab, said she did not hear her teaching fellow remind her and many of her classmates to wear their goggles.
“It was just a very chill atmosphere. People were putting on Christmas music, everybody was really looking forward to getting the lab done and over with quickly,” she said. “I suppose everyone was a bit lax.”
Although she admitted that not wearing goggles was probably her fault, she also expressed discomfort that the potential danger of the situation was, as far as she knew, not communicated by lab teaching fellows.
“I would have appreciated some notice that there was UV light and there was potential for danger in the lab,” said Chang. “I felt kind of blindsided that there was no warning—there was nothing in the instructions of the lab.”
According to Alison D. Morantz ’93, a Stanford Law School professor who focuses on workplace safety, a central question to consider in the case is “whether the university met its duty to the students in terms of properly training the professor and the research fellows.”
She added that the incident in LPSA is not a workplace safety issue because University employees were not injured. Instead, she said legal action against Harvard would most likely take the form of a tort claim, in which affected students and their families might argue that Harvard breached its duty to maintain the safety of students.
“One would have to show that a reasonable university [in Harvard’s position] would have taken additional measures” to ensure student safety, she said.
But while Hylton and Morantz agreed that last week’s incident could become a legal liability for Harvard, they added that there would likely be little financial gain from any legal action.
Proving negligence requires considerable resources, Morantz said, and since no students seem to have sustained permanent injuries, financial gain from the case would be very limited.
In addition, the case would be complicated if the students were also responsible for the injuries incurred. “If they received instructions and they didn’t put the goggles on, they could be guilty of negligence themselves,” said Hylton.
“That would lead to a reduction of damages for the students based on some assessment of their [responsibility],” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty members challenged University President Drew G. Faust on Harvard’s decision to lock the gates to the Yard in response to the Occupy Harvard movement at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Faculty members chose to remove two summer economics courses at the Summer School taught by Subramanian Swamy, a controversial Indian political figure. Over the summer, Swamy published an op-ed that advocated for the destruction of hundreds of Indian mosques and the disenfranchisement of non-Hindus in India.
Chief Information Officer for the University Anne H. Margulies concluded the meeting by updating faculty on the newly-created Harvard University Information Technology system and its future vision, which included greater collaboration with the library and further digital pedagogy.
OCCUPY HARVARD
In the first Faculty meeting since Harvard students pitched tents in the middle of the Yard, Faust affirmed Harvard’s obligation to safeguard its community while continuing an atmosphere of free speech.
“There is an effort to maintain two sets of values: the values of free expression that are at the core of a university and its identity and our responsibility for the safety of the Harvard community, especially the 1,400 freshmen living within the Yard and the Occupiers within the Yard,” Faust said.
In particular, Faust referenced the recent death of an Occupy protester at the University of North Texas and several crimes committed at Occupy Boston. According to Faust, the University, through securing the gates, had only excluded the dangerous elements of the movement while still maintaining the right to speak freely.
“There is a difference between the issue the movement is raising and the way the movement is expressed,” Faust said. “I have no interest in restricting access to the Yard for one day longer than necessary.”
Despite Faust’s argument, faculty members still expressed concerns of limiting free speech.
Susan R. Suleiman, interim chair of the Romance Languages and Literatures department, followed up on many of the issues raised in a letter that she and almost 30 other faculty members wrote to Faust calling for the reopening of the gates.
“What I’m concerned about is that this is really larger than us. This is a global movement,” Suleiman said. “Wouldn’t it be, in some way, consistent with our values and strategic in many other ways, to actually take a stand and say that inequalities in this country are terrible?”
But Faust maintained that the University must remain impartial on political issues.
“You all take positions, but a university does not take positions,” Faust said. “It engages and encourages every kind of speech.”
SUMMER SCHOOL TROUBLE
A subsequent vote for the approval of the 2012 Summer School course catalog, which faculty acknowledged would normally take no more than one minute, generated a heated debate when Comparative Religion Professor Diana L. Eck proposed an amendment to exclude Swamy’s Economics S-110 and Economics S-1316 from the catalog.
Swamy received significant criticism for an op-ed he wrote last summer in the Indian newspaper Daily News and Analysis, in which he called for the destruction of mosques, the disenfrachisement of non-Hindus in India who do not acknowledge Hindu ancestry, and a ban on conversion from Hinduism.
“Swamy’s op-ed clearly crosses the line by demonizing an entire religious community and calling for violence against their sacred places,” Eck said, adding that Harvard has a moral responsibility not to affiliate itself with anyone who expresses hatred towards a minority group. “There is a distinction between unpopular and unwelcome political views.”
Although Harvard chose to stand by Swamy in August in an effort to affirm its declared commitment to free speech, faculty members shot down his two courses, effectively removing him from Harvard’s teaching roster. Many faculty determined Swamy’s article was not a product of free speech—but of hate speech.
“[Swamy’s position on disenfranchisement] is like saying Jewish Americans and African Americans should not be allowed to vote unless they acknowledge the supremacy of white Anglo Saxon Protestants,” said History Professor Sugata Bose.
Dean of the Summer School Donald H. Pfister explained that courses included in the catalog are chosen by individual departments.
“I find [Swamy’s] position reprehensible, but on the other hand, it is our duty to support departments and their offerings,” he said.
Philosophy Department Chair Sean D. Kelly, who also serves as vice-chair of the Faculty Docket Committee, initially defended the unanimous decision of Harvard’s Faculty Council to keep Swamy on the teaching roster as an effort to preserve free speech at the school and kick the vote to the faculty-wide meeting.
Kelly ultimately voted—as did an overwhelming majority of faculty members—for the amendment to remove Swamy’s courses. The revised catalog was consequently approved.
“I was persuaded ... that the views expressed in Dr. Swamy’s op-ed piece amounted to incitement of violence instead of protected political speech,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.
HUIT CHUGS FORWARD
Launched this July as a newly integrated network of Harvard’s two major IT systems—FAS IT and University IT—Harvard University Information Technology has already upgraded Harvard’s iSites platform and expanded the FAS standing committee on IT.
“The students and faculty this year were served much more seamlessly by a single team,” Margulies said.
HUIT is poised to implement four new initiatives “devoted to fixing things that are broken while keeping the trains running on time,” she said.
On Wednesday, HUIT is launching a new student information system that will streamline the enrollment processes for students across the University. HUIT is also working on a common identity management system, collaborative efforts with the library system to increase web access to library resources, and the support of innovative teaching practices through the use of video, Margulies said.
In response to one question about difficulties experienced by faculty members during migration between email interfaces, Margulies said that HUIT is working with Google to address security issues.
“We’re hoping in the future we may be able to offer Gmail as an option for faculty,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In high school, Jonah Travis had two sayings that he would write on the bottoms of his basketball sneakers: “Relax” and “Go get it.”
Now, as a freshman forward on the No. 24 Harvard men’s basketball team, he is doing just that.
“The entire time I’ve been here, I’ve just told myself to keep calm and relax, because usually most of my mistakes happen when I get too hyped up since all my friends are here and there’s so many people watching,” Travis said. “I made a couple mistakes earlier, but then I just told myself to chill out and it’s really started to work for me after that.”
Indeed, things have started to work for Travis. On Sunday, the rookie grabbed 19 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, and two steals—all career-highs—against Seattle University. Travis achieved this in just 19 minutes of playing time, and his performance was instrumental in the day’s 80-70 Crimson victory.
“His performance at Seattle was outstanding,” junior guard Brandyn Curry said. “It’s something that we needed, especially at that time, with that type of game.”
Travis’s play helped Harvard grab a lead early. Midway through the first period, the Redhawks’ Prince Obasi hit 3-pointers on two consecutive possessions to cut the Crimson’s lead to five, and Travis responded with an and-1 layup.
Seattle was never able to fully recover, and the margin never dropped below seven after that point.
“He’s one of the hardest working players I’ve ever played with and he’s a complete beast, especially on the boards for his size. He just outworks everybody,” Curry said.
Though Travis received offers from several reputable colleges, including Cornell, Northwestern, and Boise State, he was the first of the squad’s six freshmen to commit to Harvard in August 2010. Travis signed on right before his senior year at De La Salle High School in Minneapolis, whose “longstanding basketball tradition and incredible alumni base” he says helped to provide him with a great high school basketball experience.
Minnesota is also the home state of Hopkins High School point guard Siyani Chambers, who has verbally committed to the Crimson and will join the team next fall.
“Harvard had offered in the spring of my junior year and was always the front runner from that point on,” Travis said. “There were a couple of other schools that offered that I wanted to take a look at and so I waited until all my options were on the table.
“The recruiting process is a lot of fun but it’s really tiring, and so I wanted to get it over with,” he continued. “I knew what the smart choice was, so it wasn’t too hard to make the decision.”
Travis’s teammates and Harvard coach Tommy Amaker are certainly happy he chose to join the program, especially after witnessing the rookie’s performance this past week. Aside from shooting 6-8 from the field and making 7 out of 9 foul shots against the Redhawks, the freshman also notched four points and cleared 2-of-3 shots from the floor in Thursday’s 55-48 Crimson win over Vermont.
“I was really, really pleased with Jonah this week,” Amaker said. “A double-double and getting rookie of the week in the Ivy League—he earned it. How he played yesterday is exactly who he is and why we recruited him. He’s tough, he has a great grit and grime about him in a very positive, complimentary way.”
Most freshmen might be intimidated about joining a team that did not graduate any seniors last May and therefore already has its positions filled.
But Travis has taken a positive outlook and is ready to make a name for himself.
“I’m dealing with it just fine,” Travis said. “The good thing about not having graduated seniors, is that last season, we had juniors as captains, and so coming in this year, Oliver [McNally] and Keith [Wright] already know their leadership role because they’ve already been through it. It’s great having such veteran leaders, you get to watch them and watch their process and just kind of imitate them as much as possible.”
Even with the pressure cranking up now that Harvard has extended its undefeated record to 8-0 and cracked the top 25 in both the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll and the Associated Press Top 25 poll, the freshman continues to heed his words, “Relax” and “Go get it,” and enjoy his time on the team.
“It’s crazy, the buzz around campus, everyone congratulating you, even the people working at the cafeteria, it’s a lot of fun to be apart of Harvard basketball,” Travis said. “Of course it also puts a big target on your back, but I think we’re willing to step up to the challenge and face it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a frantic attempt to save the game, University of New Hampshire senior forward Denise Beliveau intentionally fouled 86 percent free throw shooter Christine Clark at 0:22. The sophomore guard hit both free throws. After Beliveau committed a turnover, senior guard Berry Brogan hit two free throws of her own to seal the Harvard women’s basketball team’s (3-4) second win in a row. The Crimson escaped Durham, N.H. with a narrow 69-62 win on Tuesday night.
After jumping out to a 15-2 lead behind the team’s strong shot selection, offensive rebounding, and pestering defense. Despite struggling for large parts of the second half, Harvard maintained a lead for most of the game against the Wildcats (3-4) last night, surrendering its advantage for a mere minute and 32 seconds.
The squad shot 44 percent from the field and went 8-18 from 3-point range.
The Crimson owed much of its success was due to help from the bench, which outscored New Hampshire’s bench 19-12. Harvard also owned the advantage in second chance points by the same margin.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith credits her team’s mental toughness in pulling out the victory.
“I think it’s really hard to lose a 14-point lead in an away gym and then come out with the win,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought it took a lot of toughness and grit towards the end of the game to hang on to that one.”
Leading all Crimson scorers was junior forward Victoria Lippert who scored 17 points and went 7-10 from the field. Clark grabbed a game-high seven rebounds.
Brogan, Clark, and Lippert combined for 48 of the team’s 69 points.
“I think that’s who we’ve been all along,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Brogan, Clark, and Lippert] have pretty consistently scored in double figures for us. I’d like to have a little more balance in size; then again, we have some people who can score in the paint.”
It was a tale of two halves.
Harvard held the lead at the half 33-21, holding New Hampshire to 31 percent from the field and forcing nine turnovers.
“We started strong. We shot well. I liked our defense in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “And then for whatever reason in the second half—granted UNH played a little bit more physical—we just seemed to get tighter and tighter and make worse and worse decisions.”
The Crimson followed its dominant start with seven scoreless minutes. As a result, the Wildcats narrowed the margin to 15-9. But scores by juniors Emma Golen and Elle Hagedorn gave Harvard the double-digit lead it took to the break.
After an early half time-out, New Hampshire came roaring back. Junior guard Cari Reed, who finished with a career-high 32 points, brought the Wildcats to within 10 by sinking two consecutive 3-point attempts.
Brogan attributed Reed’s extraordinary performance to the Crimson’s defensive strategy. Reed scored eight 3-pointers, which was as many as she had scored that season up to that point.  It was also equal to total number of points scored off 3-pointers by Harvard’s team.
“We focused on their main two scorers,“ Brogan said. “[Reed] started hitting shots. We couldn’t quite get our hands up quick enough or get out of screens quick enough because we kept our focus on their two main players. [Next time] we need to work more toward a team focus.”
Two more Reed 3-pointers were instrumental in a 16-3 run to put New Hampshire up by one. The lead would be short-lived, though, as Lippert made a pair of clutch jump shots—first to put Harvard back on top and then to put the game out of reach for the home side.
“I think we needed to turn the ball over less,” Delaney-Smith said. “When an opposing player scores 32 points on you, something is wrong there.”
With the win, the Crimson has emerged victorious in three of its last four and its two most recent games.
Harvard now turns its focus to the Best Buy Classic, which will take place on Friday and Saturday in Minneapolis, Minn.
“The Best Buy Classic coming up this weekend is a big opportunity for us,” Brogan said. “It should be a great, fun trip for our team and also a chance to play against a big-10 team. It will be an opportunity to showcase the talent that we really do have this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sophomore Andrew Campbell can now add oration to his many skills.
Back in his home state of Connecticut, the star lightweight rower delivered two speeches at the USRowing Annual Convention, which took place on Saturday, Dec. 3 in Hartford.
“Earlier in the day I had a meet and greet with junior rowers from the area and I ended up speaking for about an hour about my career and my advice towards junior rowers,” Campbell noted. “It was ironic because I’ve only really been out of rowing for like 15 months.”
Campbell’s panel, officially named “Junior Day: Meet and Greet 2011 USRowing Man of the Year Andrew Campbell,” was one of three which attendees had the option of attending. The other two speakers were Tom Terhaar, head coach of the U.S. Open Weight women’s national team, and Mike Teti, head coach of the University of California’s men’s rowing team. Terhaar’s speech was called “Training Plans and Ideas for Collegiate Programs,” while Teti’s talk was titled “Simple Approach to Having Fast Boats.”
After a break in the day, during which Campbell visited a convention on legos, he gave an acceptance speech for his Man of the Year Award, though his second address was much briefer.
The USRowing Man of the Year Award celebrated what has been an outstanding year on the water for Campbell. Just a year after he took bronze in the 2010 Junior World Championships in the lightweight single, Campbell took bronze in the U23 World Championships and fourth at the World Rowing Championships. His finishes in the Junior and U23 championships are the highest ever by a U.S. rower in the events.
At the Head of the Charles, Campbell took second in the Championship double event—which featured both lightweights and heavyweights—while rowing with fellow Crimson rower Austin Meyer, who is currently taking the year off from school to train with the national team. Most recently, Campbell won the lightweight single event at the USRowing Fall Speed Orders.
For Campbell, the highlight of the night was watching former coaches Yan and Olga Vengerovskiy receive the 2011 John J. Carlin Service Award.
“My high school coaches won an award for services to the sport,” Campbell noted. “It was cool to go up and thank them after they had been giving speeches. They are ... immigrants and coached in the Soviet Union and came over to the  U.S. with almost nothing and built themselves up into a rowing program that is one of the highest regarded sculling programs in the country. I’m very proud of them: true American Dream.”
Also speaking at the Convention was Harry Parker,  now in his 50th year as head coach of Harvard heavyweight crew. The coach was recently awarded USRowing’s Medal of Honor at the inaugural Golden Oars Dinner, held on Nov. 30 at the New York Athletic Club in New York, N.Y.
Parker gave a speech on making collegiate crews fast,  a topic in which he is extremely well versed. With Parker at the helm, the Crimson has won eight official national championships and eight more unofficial national championships.
2011 proved to be a particularly impressive year for Parker and the Harvard heavyweights.
Every single Crimson heavyweight eight finished the dual season undefeated, and Harvard took Eastern Sprints titles in the varsity eight, second varsity eight, and freshman eight. After securing its fourth-straight sweep over Yale, the Crimson took silver in both the 1V and 2V events at the IRA National Championships, while the freshman eight and open four both took bronze. Harvard finished second overall as a team, behind the University of Washington.
But the Crimson exacted revenge on the Huskies this fall when its 1V defeated Washington in the Championship Eight event at the Head of the Charles. Harvard won the event by defeating the second-place USRowing by almost six seconds and the third-place Huskies by 8.5 seconds. In the team’s final race of the fall, the Tail of the Charles, Crimson crews took first, second, and sixth.
The lightweight program has been similarly successful.
Harvard’s lightweight 1V finished the dual season unbeaten and won Eastern Sprints before falling just shy of an IRA national championship. The 2V went undefeated throughout, capping the year off with a Sprints win and an IRA win in the lightweight four event.
Will Newell ’11, the captain of that lightweight squad and the six seat of its 1V, recently won the lightweight pair event at the USRowing Fall Speed Orders.
Earlier this year, Malcolm Howard ’05 took bronze in the eight at the world championships, and he and Dave Wakulich ’11 were recently invited to Canada’s Olympic Training Camp.
These are just some of the outstanding individual and team performances have made it an impressive year. While the Crimson’s bar is already set high, Campbell’s barrier-breaking finishes in the lightweight single and the silver-medal-winning performances by the heayvweight and lightweight squads have made this a year to remember even in a place as historic as Newell Boathouse.
