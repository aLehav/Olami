After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a moment of pure exuberance when Japanese Breakfast closed their set Sunday afternoon with “Machinist,” the lead single off last year’s “Soft Sounds from Another Planet” and arguably the best song in their entire discography. During the 30-second saxophone solo outro, Michelle Zauner spun around and jumped on stage with a childlike enthusiasm, and her bandmates—of whom include the bassist from her previous band, Little Big League, one of her best friends, and no less, her husband—somehow all managed to match her same energy and bliss. It was an incredible climax to perhaps the most animated and joyful set of the entire festival.
In actuality, most of the songs on “Soft Sounds” and 2016’s “Psychopomp” aren’t really the type one might describe as animated. Listening to them through headphones is often a dark, visceral experience—take, for example, the anxiety-ridden “Heft” or the harrowing “The Body Is a Blade,” the latter of which repurposes an old demo from Zauner’s Bandcamp called “My Mommy is Sick.” Translating these recordings to energetic live experiences, then, could be a tricky undertaking. But Japanese Breakfast proved themselves more than up to the task. Each and every band member performed with vigor, throwing back their heads and dancing on stage, with Zauner at the helm of it all. Throughout the set, she animated her lyrics with expressive facials, bounded across the stage, and frequently ventured upstage to stand on and skip over the speaker sets. Somehow, she even succeeded in her attempt to make “The Woman That Loves You” sound anthemic, as she beat her chest in time to the drumbeat throughout each iteration of the chorus. She and her band also chose to forego any and all ballads from their catalog—and as lovely and poignant as “Till Death” and “This House” are, their decision proved shrewd: The result was one lively performance after the other—a 45-minute set that flew by before you knew it was over.
Equally uncanny was their ability to conjure a carefree, childlike joy, an impressive feat, no doubt, if for its emotional precision alone. Around midway through the set, when they burst into “Everybody Wants to Love You”—their most jubilant song by a long shot—the audience echoed Zauner unfailingly throughout the chorus, which consists only of the title line bellowed in a repeated back-and-forth. There was a beauty in how simple, yet exuberant and evocative the exchange was. A similar exchange took place during their luminous cover of The Cranberries’ “Dreams” later on, when the crowd sang along to the iconic 40-second outro—an ecstatic, pirouetting vocal line repeated again and again until the song’s resounding end. Throughout it all, Zauner matched the joy that the live renditions naturally evoked. As she made direct eye contact with and grinned out at members of the audience, it was hard not to share her elation.
Perhaps there were a couple of minor shortcomings about their performance—when the undulating synth line that glimmers halfway through the studio recording of “The Body is a Blade” was drowned by guitarwork a hair too loud; when the pristine transition between back-to-back tracks ‘In Heaven’ and ‘The Woman that Loves You” couldn’t achieve the same level of seamlessness live. But that’s all nitpicking: at the end of their set, it was difficult to walk away from the Japanese Breakfast set without an easy, nostalgia-tinged bliss, or at least the beginnings of a smile. Unsurprisingly, they delivered an impressive, exuberant experience—yet another one for the books.

“We’re trying not to waste the acid, we took it already,” groaned a group of tired festivalgoers behind me, after waiting over an hour to secure a spot with a decent view of the stage. To my left, two strangers—one a Chicago native, the other from Phoenix, Arizona—engaged in some hilariously awkward small talk: “So, where can I find the best… steak, in all of Chicago?” / “Did you say steak?” Meanwhile, across the massive crowd, a particularly impatient and riled-up fan screamed out at the top of his lungs: “Just let it happen!” Such was the atmosphere late Friday night at Pitchfork, when thousands of impatient Tame Impala fans gathered together to await the Australian psychedelic rock band take the mainstage and close the first day of the festival. In the end, the wait proved worthwhile—Tame Impala delivered a satisfying set, riding on continually stunning visuals and bursts of adrenaline spawned by their several bulletproof hits, if not on the steep devotion of their fans alone.
It would be remiss not to mention the unique visual aspect that Tame Impala brought to their set—it was perhaps the most captivating aspect of it all. Flanking the stage on either side were two giant monitors that, from beginning to end, flashed stunning kaleidoscopic images and bursting neon swirls of color. At the set’s best moments, they elevated Tame Impala’s performances of their most well-known hits into experiences that were flat-out otherworldly. Their live renditions of “Eventually,” and “Yes I’m Changing,” for example, could have easily held their own because of their popularity—but it was a spectacular thing to shut your eyes [FOR] one moment and soak in the audio, then open them and allow yourself to be bombarded with absolutely gorgeous, woozy psychedelic swirls that reflected the real-time soundscape around you. “There's a world out there, it's calling my name / …and it’s calling yours too,” the audience sang along during the latter—easily recalling lyrics from the now three-year-old “Currents” with an enthusiasm that seemed completely unphased by the passage of time.
The same devoted audience came to Tame Impala’s rescue set each time their set seemed to veer towards lackluster territory. While there were lulls here and there throughout the lesser known songs of their set, the enthusiasm was steadfast for the most part, and a particularly devoted cult carried the rest of the audience by shouting out the most esoteric lyrics with impressive precision. Even when audio-related technical difficulties threatened to take away from the immersive quality of some critical points in the set—for example, when the highly built-up drop in “Let It Happen” underwhelmed, or when the thundering opening moments from “Elephant” weren’t nearly as anthemic as they could’ve been—their fans were unfailingly devoted, effortlessly ad-libbing the missing synth lines or filling the quiet with rhythmic cheers. The energy never faltered.
It’s an interesting decision to have Tame Impala headline in 2018—years have passed since their last record release, and the only new material that’s come out since “Currents” has been a single, lukewarm collaboration with ZHU. It’s an easy get, obviously, but almost feels high-stakes—could their material, at this point, really still resonate with a crowd of thousands? Their set on Friday proved the answer was a resounding yes: Maybe fans walked away not quite taken on the full-on psychedelic odyssey they’re more than capable of conjuring. But at the very least, they left awestruck by Tame Impala’s undeniable staying power and influence.

The flood and rain imagery in Daniel Caesar’s lyrics felt biblical against gospel harmonies during his Panorama set on Friday. Because of the torrents that ultimately canceled the rest of the day’s acts, they also functioned as sighs of gratitude for a dry 45 minutes. Most strikingly, they provided metaphors to match the resigned sorrow that Caesar emitted from the stage as he walked the emotional line between chill and heart-on-sleeve.
Maybe he was channeling genuine feelings of heartache at this show, or maybe he has nailed the art of understated acting to a mesmerizing degree. In his recordings, he lends his voice (the most tender in contemporary R&B) to songs about love and longing. His live performance on Friday doubled the intensity of these depictions. He often sang with a faraway, upset look in his eyes and a rubato hesitancy, all of which was made convincing by its near imperceptibility. It felt like he was letting in the crowd on a personal, exquisitely-sung therapy session.
He was lucky to have performed at all. At around 3:25 p.m., the marbled sky over Randall’s Island Park began to spill freely. Fans waiting for Caesar pulled out ponchos and transformed into worried mounds of translucent plastic. Miraculously, the rain abruptly abated before the set, and the soaked mass screamed as Caesar, along with a temporary streak of sunlight, had just made his appearance. After Caesar’s set, the storm took center stage at 5 p.m. Panorama canceled the remainder of the day, including headliner The Weeknd, Migos, Father John Misty, and Yaeji. The artisan food stands shut down, drinkers hurried out of The Grove, and Bearcat—who was mixing beats at The Pavilion (Panorama’s DJ artist space)—cut her show short. Fans awaiting Dua Lipa continued to chant her name in front of the stage for several minutes, to no avail. Attendees shouted profanities about the festival as they splashed their way out.
Given the weather, it was fitting that Caesar’s set had kicked off with the bridge from “Freudian”, the last song from his debut album of the same name. “Send me kisses when it’s gray skies,” the backup trio began. In contrast from the stilted, soldierly march that this part brings to mind in the recorded track, the fifths and octaves performed live conjured the grandeur of light streaming through stained glass. It was a reminder of both the religious influence in Caesar’s work and the threat of the oncoming storm.
Impassioned instrumental crescendos bolstered Caesar’s vocals, particularly in “Neu Roses,” which had a full-on rock vibe at its climax. However, the set found its strongest moments when the drums and bass cleared, like the clouds, to let his falsetto stream through uninhibited. At these moments, his high notes had the kind of softness in which you can cocoon yourself before going to sleep at night. The instrumentation in “Hold Me Down” illuminated his voice particularly clearly, with only a gentle bass and gliding choral echo of his spoken lyrics accompanying his vocals.
His movements were slow and his presence still, and even his brief bounces into the downbeat felt careful. The visuals, too, were unshowy. He wore a black shirt and blue jeans and his dreadlocks bunched in pigtails. The screen behind him repeated a grainy, so-sunny-it's-washed-out video of everyday moments: a closeup of food on a dining table, beautiful cars, Caesar walking. This simplicity redirected the eye to the nuances in Caesar’s unsmiling demeanor.
And during “Best Part” and “Blessed,” as he smoothly navigated the dips and twirls of the melodies, his eyes looked truly sad. The lyric “You’re my sunshine in the rain when it’s pouring” in “Best Part” took on a new vividness in the context of the storm. He had opened his set with the end of his album, and now he closed with its beginning, “Get You.” Without prompting, the song’s opening lines swelled from the crowd: “Through drought and famine, natural disasters, my baby has been around for me.” The words were perfect for a congregation that had stuck it out through the flash flood warnings to show their appreciation for Caesar. He nodded approvingly, almost amusedly, at the crowd, and extended the microphone toward it. A rare smile hovered on his lips.
After the festival was evacuated, its patrons were straggling across the endless gray concrete of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge when a particularly loud rumble of thunder inspired a collective whoop. This cheer was just as excited as the one prompted by the sunlight before Caesar’s set. It was a welcome contrast from the gripes a few minutes prior. It seemed like an acknowledgment that rain, even at its most frustrating and destructive moments, can be a source of unity, creation, love—a sentiment that would make Caesar proud.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain—Because I spend so much time at home, I often forget how nearsighted I am and thus forget to put on glasses. That’s usually where I am — at home or the gym. Since I don’t have a job, I can never find money or reasons to do much else. Sometimes I’ll go to the beach — about a seven-minute walk from my house. But it’s not a very nice beach, and I hate being in the sun for that long.
That’s the rhythm of my life this time of year, centered around my group exercise classes. I’ve never been much of a jock, but the gym has air conditioning and memberships in Spain are pretty cheap.
It seems counterintuitive that I’d spend summer in Palma closed inside the gym. I love it here, I do. But for me it’s just home, in the same way that Pennsylvania or Florida or New York City is just home to you.
A lot of people are shocked when I tell them where I’m from, as if it’s too good to be true. An island in the Mediterranean. When you say it like that, it sounds like a place that no one is from, but that everyone goes to on vacation. That’s certainly the impression you can get in the summer.
I was planning to write this postcard about something else, since this topic could make me sound spoiled. I’d do another piece about the World Cup, or something about Spanish politics. As if I’d spent my summer musing about globalization or women’s issues.
This, instead, is the truth. I submitted so many online applications for jobs: everything from writing tourism pamphlets to waitressing. I walked around all the offices at the airport with ten copies of my resume in my bag.
The phone never rang. Here, they don’t hire teenagers for summer jobs. The youth unemployment rate is currently at 35 percent.
So, here I am, biding my time until the end of August..

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at Harvard dot the globe; wherever you’re from, you can find a reminder of home tucked in between Harvard’s brick and mortar. And for having a world-renowned education, the school does a decent job in trying to have diversity, in culling people together who have just the right shades of skin to match the ideas they want to promote in their brochures.
Yet, for a school that emphasizes a heavy-handed commitment to diversity, it fails to actually cater to these groups in any meaningful way.
Understandably, this may catch many by surprise. There are probably dozens of cultural groups on campus that spring to mind that preserve and highlight different cultures like insects in amber in the name of diversity. Educational opportunities such as African and African American Studies, East Asian Studies, and the burgeoning Ethnic Studies field still attempt to drag Harvard’s educational focus away from eurocentric curriculums and provide a more global perspective. All of these developments are great insofar that they offer certain groups their due space in both educational and social spheres on campus.
To some, this may come across as completely embodying the purportedly “diverse” experience of a Harvard education. But diversity isn’t captured by solely crystallizing these groups in their respective spaces. Diversity is not simply allowing for people who belong to these different cultures to participate in each of their own self-organized, self-perpetuated organizations. Rather, diversity requires a plethora of different people, perspectives, and cultural traditions to come together and engage in an exchange of ideas.
These groups and educational opportunities certainly serve their purpose and act as spaces for students to find familiar comfort in the difficult and sometimes foreign environment that Harvard can be. However, having groups like the Black Students Association or Fuerza Latina or the Asian American Women’s Association on campus hardly constitutes the lofty claim that Harvard is a diverse institution.
For diversity to exist, the University must not only support the existence of these student-run groups, but it must also nurture cross- and multi-cultural discussions on both an academic and social level. And especially in regards to the latter, there’s a huge solution that the University has been sidestepping for decades: the creation of a multicultural center. Having a space where students of multiple different backgrounds could come together and interact with one another and share their rich cultures would shatter the compartmentalization that may occur if these groups are simply left to their own devices. A multicultural center brings students together in a relaxed setting to engage in cultural exchanges that are the hallmarks of diversity.
But in the past, Harvard hasn’t always been receptive to creating these spaces or fostering conversations around a multicultural center. Calls for a center focusing on historically underrepresented people on campus were heard from students as early as 1973. In the 1980s, Harvard students submitted proposals for a “Third World Center”; its purpose was to serve the “legitimate needs, history, and culture” of students whose ethnicities belonged to one of many minority groups at the College. Advocates for the proposal submitted heavily researched support, underscoring the center’s importance through a number a different angles, namely its strong connection to affirmative action, the anti-apartheid movement, and a blatant lack of support for then-called “third world students”.
This proposal also mentioned the benefits of Third World Centers at peer universities such as Princeton and Brown to further bolster their reasoning to establish this center at Harvard. A 1995 proposal echoed this call with similar sentiments; yet, the University still met these proposals with little movement towards the creation of this center until very recently.
Now — 45 years after students recognized the need for a multicultural space on campus— Harvard is in the process of developing a center based off of the findings of its “Inclusion and Belonging” Task Force that more or less echoes the exact things that students have been writing about for decades. This building, carefully referred to by the University as a center of either “Identity, Politics, and Culture” or of “Inclusion and Belonging”, is purported to offer students “full membership to the Harvard community.”
Yet even dancing around the name of the proposed multicultural center and calling it anything other than a multicultural center misses the point. This haphazard attempt at sparking diversity by trying to refer to all students rather than honing in on the students it promises to make feel at home already embarks on this journey to “full membership” on shoddy groundwork.
The proposed center will not be a multicultural center if it fails to keep these historically marginalized cultures and communities at the core of its institutional purpose. An “Inclusion and Belonging” center, however nice and cuddly its title may be, it is not an adequate substitute for the necessary focus on multiculturalism that the University desperately needs in order to to make good on its commitment to diversity, and to make its most marginalized members feel welcomed.
I bought into “brochure” Harvard, and to a large degree, I still do. But in order to fully become what the University presents itself as in its advertisements, photos, and messages to the student body and others, it must truly begin to commit to diversity with a multicultural center (and not any other excuse for it).
