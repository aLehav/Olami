After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Karina Joiner has been busy during the offseason. Almost exactly one year ago at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, the then-freshman logged the best 60-meter hurdle time of her career by crossing the finish line in 8.64 seconds. The effort merited a first place finish.
At Saturday’s Beantown Challenge, Joiner again donned the gold medal in the race, but this time she also knocked .18 seconds off of her career best. The sophomore now holds the fifth fastest time in Ivy League history and third best in program history.
The rest of the squad had a field day at the team’s first indoor track meet of the season held at the Crimson’s Gordon Indoor Track. Harvard brought home 12 gold medals overall. The women’s team rounded out the evening in second place with 98 points, while the men finished third with 98.
Two-time first team All-American and junior co-captain Gabby Thomas made her presence known immediately in the competition. The phenom won both the 60-meter dash and the long jump. Leaning past the finish line 7.44 seconds after the gun in the 60-meter, Thomas finished just ahead of freshman teammate Olivia Okoli, the second place finisher with a time of 7.59 seconds.
Okoli wasn’t the only freshman to earn a medal. Freshman Lizzie Gummer and sophomores Maya Miklos, Micah Meekins and Joiner combined to dominate the 4x440-yard relay. The quartet finished in 3:54.70, over three seconds faster than the next closest competitors.
In the same race, the Crimson men matched the feat with a time off 3:17.28. Freshmen Rodney Agyare-May and Jovahn Williamson teamed up with junior co-captain Myles Marshall and senior Matt Hurst to claim the gold.
“I think the freshmen bring a lot of talent to the team and hopefully we will be contributors at Heps,” said freshman Abbe Goldstein, the top finisher for the women’s team in the cross country Heps. “I'm feeling optimistic about the season.”
Though the Crimson didn’t field any long distance runners Saturday, it didn’t need to. The team dominated the sprints.
In addition to Joiner’s performance in the 60-meter hurdles, Harvard swept the event. Co-captain Jay Hebert claimed gold on the men’s side in 8.05 seconds, supplementing Joiner’s performance for the women. The sophomore girl was also tailed closely by classmate Livia Gauntlett who finished second.
Prior to their gold 4x440-meter relay, both Miklos and Meekins earned their own, individual first place medals. In her first individual collegiate career win, Meekins sprinted past the 40 other competitors and to the top of the 200-meter dash podium. Milklos performed similarly, winning the 500-meter run in 1:15.47.
Two meets in, Miklos has dominated the mid-distance races, earning a total of four golds. In addition to her two first place performances this weekend—the 4x440 and 500-meter—she conquered the 600-meter and the 4x400-meter (along with Joiner, Meekins, and freshman Claire Hotchkin).
Miklos isn’t the only one on the Crimson’s roster showing up in the mid-distance runs. The men’s team placed five runners in the top seven spots of the 500-meter run at the Beantown Challenge. Marshall set the pace, finishing in 1:02.53, just ahead of Agyare-May and Hurst who finished second and third, respectively.
The men’s team dominated the 4x880-meter relay as well. The group of junior Gabe Montague, junior Nick Linder, freshman Ryan Thrush and sophomore Michael Kolor ascended to the top of the platform after a 7:49.16 race. Sophomore Ian West rounded out teams with gold in pole vault, leaping 4.95 meters.
Prior to the beginning of the Beantown Challenge, sophomore Anthony DeNitto grabbed first place in the Heptathlon at the Harvard Multi Meet. The medal was his first gold in the event.
The Beantown Challenge, the team’s first indoor track meet of the season, marks the beginning of a quest back to Indoor Ivy League Heps. For the women, it’s about continuing a legacy of Ancient Eight dominance that has produced five-year streak of Indoor Heps team championships. For the men, it’s about improving on last year’s sixth place performance.
“I feel really good about the men's team potential this season,” Marshall said. “We have a stellar freshman class that has already proved themselves at the BU opener, and they, combined with our high performing sophomore class, ought to lift the program to new heights.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the pool for its first meet of 2018 after a training trip in Hawaii, Harvard pitted itself against conference opponents Penn and Brown. After 16 events, the Crimson emerged with six first-place finishes and sent resounding ripples through the Ivy League, establishing its place in the upper echelons of the conference.
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (4-0, 4-0 Ivy) concluded the day in Providence, R.I. with victories over both Penn (4-5, 3-4) and Brown (3-3, 2-3) to maintain its perfect dual meet season. The Crimson bested the Quakers, 197-100. The contest against the Bears was closer, but Harvard again proved faster in the water, edging out Brown, 166-134. The team returned to dual meet action after Texas Swimming and UGA Invitationals in early December.
“I think during [our] training trip we had a lot of time to bond we each other,” junior Meagan Popp said. “I think that elevated our ability to be there for our teammates, be there behind the blocks, knowing what people needed before their races., and I think the team camaraderie was elevated at this meet compared to past meets just because we know each other so much better now.”
The Crimson especially dominated the diving events. In both one meter and three meter diving, the Harvard diving cohort of seniors Hannah Allchurch, Jing Leung, and Alisha Mah and junior Mikaela Thompson swept the top four places in one meter diving and the top three in three meter diving. Mah took the one meter diving with 293.70 points and Allchurch posted the best score in three meter diving with 318.83 points.
“We’re really good at cheering within our team,” Mah said, “and I think just being able to translate what we do in practice to what we did in the pool, that’s all we really needed. It wasn’t a hard transition because we’ve been doing this since the beginning of training trip. We’ve really been pushing ourselves, and it was nice to see that all show.”
Senior captain Kristina Li placed first overall in both the 100-yard and the 200-yard backstroke. In the 100-yard backstroke, Li outtouched teammate sophomore Mei Lynn Colby by a fraction of a second with a time of 56.47. In the 200-yard backstroke, Li edged out Brown sophomore Sarah Welch and touched the wall in 2:01.26.
The 200-yard medley relay began the meet on a high note for Harvard, as a unit of Colby, freshman Ingrid Wall, junior Brittany Usinger, and sophomore Miki Dahlke finished almost two seconds ahead of the rest of the field with a finish of 1:42.54.
In the 1000-yard freestyle, freshman Michelle Owens swam a 58.70 for her first 100 and a 59.57 for her last 100 en route to a first place finish in 10:14.19, a little over more than a second faster than Quakers junior Erin Kiely.
The Crimson displayed great depth throughout the meet, earning top places even when first place proved elusive. In the 500-yard freestyle, Owens and fellow freshman Kennidy Quist took second and third overall with times of 4:59.81 and 5:01.60 respectively, and junior Claire Pinson finished close behind in 5:02.66. In the 200-yard breaststroke, Popp and freshman Yegher finished second and third overall, and senior captain Geordie Enoch finished fifth.
“I’m improving on my mid-season times and just working on my race plans and … working on technique things that I really want to perfect before Ivies and HYP,” Popp said.
With a pivotal tri-meet with Princeton and Yale looming and the exciting Ivy League championships close behind, Harvard must remain as focused as ever.
“The way we tackle this is that we try to make every meet count, every event count, and especially meets like Ivies, it’s one meet at a time,” Mah said. “The nice thing about Ivies is that we’re all there and we’re all focused on each other, and that’s what we’re going to go off of, feeding off each other’s energy, really being focused within ourselves, and just have fun with it. Honestly, that’s the best part of it. It’s not necessarily the end result, it’s all about the process, and we’ve seen that process happen and seeing a season’s worth of work pay off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team’s meet against Penn on Saturday was business as usual for the Crimson.
Harvard has become accustomed to beating the Quakers, having only lost to Penn twice since the teams first faced each other, with Penn last recording a victory over the Crimson in 1971. Harvard has also gotten used to winning dual meets. The Crimson entered this weekend’s matchup with an undefeated record for the season, boasting a run of 15 consecutive victories in dual competition.
Saturday’s contest in Providence, R.I., did nothing to snap either of Harvard’s streaks. The Crimson (5-0, 4-0 Ivy) breezed past the Quakers (4-4, 2-4), 181-108, to maintain its perfect mark in dual meets and extend its run of wins against Penn to 47 straight.
“I think the results from today really help to build on the momentum that we've been creating over the entire break,” co-captain Luke Morgan-Scott said. “At this point, we've been successful at finding what it takes to perform and race well even while being broken down. There is definitely still work to do, but today was a positive sign.”
However, there were some unusual elements to the matchup. For one thing, the contest, which was held in Brown’s home pool, typically features both the Quakers and the Bears. Brown was notably absent from this year’s meet, though, after being suspended indefinitely in December over allegations of hazing.
The Bears’ nonattendance did not faze the Crimson, however. Harvard dominated both in the pool and on the boards, picking up 15 first-place results and sweeping the podium in six races. In addition, the Crimson took at least two of the top three spots in 15 of 16 events.
Much of the Crimson’s success could be attributed to some of the team’s less experienced members. Sophomore Daniel Chang continued his breakout season with a particularly strong meet, winning all four of his races. The Johnson City, Tenn., native opened the competition with a victory in the 200-yard medley relay along with fellow sophomore Dean Farris and seniors Steven Tan and Ed Kim, beating out Penn’s second-place lineup by less than half a second. Chang would also collect first-place finishes in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke events, before touching the wall first in exhibition in the 200-yard IM.
“I was really happy with my swims today,” Chang said. “We've been able to have some great training the last couple weeks, and it's really starting to show.”
Harvard also benefited from impressive performances from a contingent of its youngest members. Five freshmen picked up podium finishes against the Quakers. First-year Michael Zarian touched the wall second in the 200-yard butterfly, edging out third-place classmate Eric Whisenant by just over a second. Zarian also raced in the Crimson’s B lineup in the 200 medley relay, finishing in third along with junior Sebastian Lutz, senior Koya Osada, and graduated senior Paul O’Hara.
Not to be outdone, freshmen Mahlon Reihman and Levente Bathory collected the second and third-place spots in the 200-yard freestyle, with junior Brennan Novak taking top honors in the event. The pair of rookies also battled for finishes in an exhibition in the 400 freestyle relay. Reihman, along with Tan, Kim, and Farris, recorded the fastest time in the event, while Bathory joined up with Lutz, O’Hara, and sophomore Raphael Marcoux to touch the wall second.
“Our coach made it clear to us to us that we would be training through the meet, meaning that we would be swimming both tired and unrested,” Reihman said. “It’s exciting to see guys get up and continue to race fast at this point in the season while still being physically broken down.”
Finally, freshman Alex DeCaprio impressed on the boards, finishing in second place in the one-meter dive with a score of 285.98. Co-captain Bobby Ross won the event with 313.35 points. Ross would also record the highest score in the three-meter dive in an exhibition, earning 310.28 points, as senior David Pfeifer took second.
The strangest outcome of the day also came in an exhibition event. With the win already secured and Harvard’s points no longer counting, the Crimson nonetheless raced to win in the 200-yard IM. The result was a peculiar tie, with Chang taking first place, and the next two spots split between Harvard and Penn in a pair of exact ties. Both Zarian and Quakers junior Thomas Dillinger touched the wall in second with a time of 1:51.50, and half a second later, Penn junior Mark Andrew secured third place with a time of 1:52.02, as did Osada.
The technical podium sweep marked just one of several events in which the Crimson took all three of the top spots. In the second race of the day, the 1000-yard freestyle, junior Logan Houck touched the wall first, followed by sophomore Zack Snyder and senior Kent Haeffner in second and third, respectively. Houck picked up a second individual victory in the 500 freestyle, with Novak eight seconds back in silver medal position and Snyder rounding out the sweep in third.
Harvard also put in commanding performances in the shorter freestyle races, starting with the 50 free. Marcoux picked up a solo win in the event, edging out second-place Kim and third-best O’Hara. In the 100 free, Farris touched the wall first with a time of 43.87. Marcoux finished in second, while Kim completed the sweep, beating out the top Penn finisher by over a second.
The backstroke events saw much of the same, with Osada topping the 100 back and taking second in the 200-yard iteration. Junior Daniel Tran outpaced Osada by a second-and-a-half in the 200 back but ended up in third place behind Tan in the 100.
Tan would get an individual win of his own in the final non-exhibition race of the meet, the 100-yard butterfly. The senior’s mark of 47.72 seconds saw him finish ahead of Farris, who took second in the event.
With another victory to its name and its perfect mark maintained, the Crimson will turn its attention to the looming championship portion of the season.
“Remaining undefeated following our meet reaffirms our team goals, which are to finish the season without a loss and to claim the Ivy League title,” Reihman said. “Our next big challenge will come in three weeks with the HYP tri-meet. Our win streak certainly gives myself and the team confidence going into the next month, but everyone is aware of the work we still need to do.”
