After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alongside their seven Ivy League foes, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams toed the line on Saturday at the West Windsor Fields in Princeton, N.J. for the 2011 Heptagonal Championship meet. With most of the men’s usual top runners sitting out of the meet due to injury, the Crimson finished in seventh place with a total of 184 points. The Harvard women raced to a sixth place finish, scoring 129 points.
On the men’s side, junior Jakob Lindaas was the Crimson’s first runner to cross the finish line, covering the eight-kilometer course in 25:41 for 28th place. Sophomore Aaron Watanabe and junior Jeremy Gilmour turned in top-40 performances, finishing in 32nd and 39th place, respectively.
Meanwhile, veterans led the way for the Harvard women. Seniors Jeanne Mack and Kailyn Kuzmuk were the squad’s first two runners, finishing the six-kilometer course in 22:33 and 22:55, respectively. Mack was the top finisher among all Crimson, coming in 13th place out of 91 competitors.
Adverse weather conditions played a role in determining the finishing times at Saturday’s meet. A wintery mix fell throughout the men’s and women’s races, forcing the runners to battle a slippery course as well as temperatures that hovered around freezing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the clock neared zero and the Harvard women's soccer team remained in a 1-1 deadlock with visiting Dartmouth, overtime seemed almost inevitable. But with just 12 seconds remaining in regulation, sophomore midfielder Peyton Johnson took a free kick from 28 yards out and buried it in the top left corner of the net, delivering the Crimson a 2-1 victory on Senior Day Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The Big Green (3-11, 1-4 Ivy) opened up the scoring nine minutes into the game with a strike from center back Aurelia Solomon. From 25 yards out, Solomon picked out the top right corner and bent the ball past freshman goalkeeper Bethany Kanten.
It took until the end of the first half for the Crimson (11-4-1, 5-0-1) to respond. A cross from rookie Erika Garcia found co-captain Melanie Baskind in the box, and the senior kicked the ball far post past the diving Dartmouth goalkeeper.
Coming out of the break, Harvard dominated possession. Despite a couple of Big Green counter-attacks, the Crimson had several good looks on goal but could not convert until the final seconds of the match.
The win moves Harvard closer to its third Ivy League championship in four years. If Penn loses to Brown later this afternoon, the Crimson will capture its 10th title and an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a weekend of ups and downs for the Harvard women’s volleyball team (11-9, 4-6 Ivy), which earned a 3-1 victory over Penn (7-13, 3-7 Ivy) Friday night only to drop a 3-1 match against Princeton (15-7, 8-2 Ivy) on Saturday. Junior Taylor Docter had back-to-back stand-out performances, notching a career-high 18 kills and 15 digs on Friday and 14 kills, eight digs, and two blocks on Saturday.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
Coming off of a win over the Quakers the previous night, the Crimson looked to continue its weekend success. Its efforts fell short however, and Harvard was unable to overcome the Tiger’s offensive momentum, falling 25-23, 25-13, 17-25, and 25-16. Despite opening the match with a 3-0 lead in the first game, the Crimson could not hold onto its edge, giving up the lead at 15-14 to Princeton. The Tigers fought back to win the first set, but was able to take the second handily, following an early 9-3 jump ahead.
Harvard finally found success in the third game, garnering a 12-6 lead, from an ace from junior Beth Kinsella–back on the court after injury–and a block from sophomores Erin Cooney and Teresa Skelly. Co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer furthered the advantage, contributing a solo block and two aces that ended the set.
The momentum, however, went back to Princeton in the fourth and final set, allowing the Tigers to earn a 25-16 game win and 3-1 match victory.
HARVARD 3, PENN 1
The Crimson used its defensive prowess on Friday night to earn a win over league rival Penn. Co-captain Christine Wu spurred the team with her match-high 25 digs. Harvard defeated the Quakers 25-10, 26-24, 25-22, and 25-20—a tally that would be familiar in its match on Saturday.
The first two sets were dominated by the Crimson, whose only hiccup came late in the second frame when it had to fight for a 26-24 win, earned by a Doctor kill and Wu service ace. The third game saw a Penn comeback that resulted in its first set win, but Harvard took the control back to close the match in the fourth frame, with a 25-20 victory.
Though the weekend ended with a loss for the Crimson, the performances by Docter and Wu were stellar. The senior now has tallied 1,752 digs in her career and is only one dig shy of matching the record for third place in the Ivy League.
“We came out with a lot of energy ... against Penn and played so well as a team,” Wu said. “But in our match against Princeton we just lost that momentum ... and made too many errors at the wrong times."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its ads, UPS likes to ask, “What can brown do for you?”
Today at Lavietes Pavilion, it was Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker asking, “What can Brown do for my team?”
Amaker was joined by Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown for his annual coaching clinic, in which both led the Crimson through drills and gave coaching advice to the couple hundred in attendance.
“I was told a long time ago that one of the greatest gifts that anyone could give another person is knowledge or wisdom,” Amaker said. “And we have some really special people here today.”
After opening warmups, in which co-captain Oliver McNally led the guards and wings and co-captain Keith Wright led the big men, Amaker delivered his opening remarks and then guided the Crimson through a typical two-hour practice.
The squad ran drills that focused on transition defense, the fast break, free-throw shooting, and shot selection, among other things, while Amaker explained the importance of each.
Amaker emphasized the necessity of working together even during practice, saying that, “When teamwork is our destination, victory happens on the way.”
After a lunch break, Brown, the only coach in history to win both an NCAA national championship (with Kansas in 1988) and an NBA Championship (with the Detroit Pistons in 2004), spoke about his coaching technique and career.
“Coach [Dean] Smith is upset I’m here this week with a Duke guy,” the former UNC guard joked.
Nonetheless, Brown had high praise for the Crimson coach.
“I’ve been to a lot of these clinics,” Brown said. “One of the neatest things about this morning for me is you heard Tommy teaching ... I told Tommy when he was a young coach, and I tell all these guys, teach what you know best ... This is the best team game when its played the right way.”
Brown instructed the Crimson—which received two Top-25 votes in the preseason AP poll last week—on a number of plays, saying he believed in emphasizing basketball-specific skills instead of conditioning.  He continually pushed the Harvard players to go harder and faster, and did not shy away from constructive criticism.
The Hall of Famer also had powerful advice for the coaches in the crowd.
“Care about these kids,” Brown said. “Make it the top of your list every time they get in the gym that they’re going to respect the game, respect their teammates, play as hard as they can, and enjoy the experience.”
Brown also told stories about the challenges of coaching Allen Iverson, and he displayed how he created isolation for Iverson with McNally playing the role of the high-scoring guard.
Brown then concluded the event with a question-and-answer session.
“Coaching is a challenge, but I’ve never worked a day in my life,” Brown said. “Our responsibility is to make the game better, [and] that’s all that really matters.”

During its 375 years of existence, Harvard has seen thousands of people pass through its campus. Whether they are students, faculty, or staff, many have viewed Harvard as home and they all have a unique story to tell. As such, the University has launched Harvard Stories, a project which gives all members of the Harvard community the chance to share their stories about Harvard.
 
Harvard Stories started filming interviews with alumni, students, and faculty in February 2011. The videos feature a member of the Harvard community sharing a personal anecdote about the University, be it before, during or after their time spent here. 
 
Although the videos are brief (no more than a few minutes), they demonstrate the profound impact that Harvard can have on people. The stories recount experiences involving everything from discovering new styles of learning to witnessing a footnote. Many videos feature members of the recently graduated Class of 2011, so the stories are indeed relevant to the academic careers of current students.
 
New stories will be posted on the website each week and the project's website states that members of the Harvard community will be able to post their own videos by Commencement 2012. Have a story to tell? Potential story tellers can visit Harvard Stories' contact page to get involved.
