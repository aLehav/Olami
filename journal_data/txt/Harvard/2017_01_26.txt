After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a 1997 editorial criticizing campaign finance reform, billionaire Republican mega-donor Betsy DeVos argued that when she donates money to politicians, she expects “something in return.” When President Trump signed documents officially nominating her for Secretary of Education, Mrs. DeVos got just that. Because of her demonstrably superficial understanding of pressing issues in American education, it is hard not to see the DeVos nomination as a blatant payoff for years of conservative monetary activism. Furthermore, the unsound decision to nominate an unprepared apparatchik for one of the most consequential roles in American government is worrisome for the future of education at Harvard.
When asked in 2013 about her greatest success in education reform, DeVos cited Florida, claiming that state “has enjoyed the nation’s longest period of widespread educational choice.” Two things stand out. First, Florida was a curious selection, given that DeVos is a long-term Michigan resident, the former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and a hugely significant figure in that state’s battles over education reform. An actual look at the DeVos record should start in Detroit, where she was a significant player in the rollout of the nation’s largest urban network of charter schools. And second, Mrs. DeVos claims Florida as a success entirely because of “widespread educational choice,” not any actual improvement in student outcomes. This is wrong and dangerous. Success in education reform should be measured in the quality of education students receive, not the presence or absence of alternatives to traditional public schools.
It is this second issue, Mrs. DeVos’ cultish and dogmatic insistence on privileging “school choice” over actual results, which seems primarily responsible for the utter catastrophe of Michigan’s education system. The Detroit Free Press wrote this year that “In Detroit, parents of school-age children have plenty of choices  … What remains in short supply is quality.” It is difficult to dodge the frank conclusion, as one New York Times op-ed put it, that Detroit "is the biggest school reform disaster in the country.” After two decades of aggressive charter school rollout both in Detroit and the remainder of the state, Michigan still dramatically underperforms when compared to the remainder of the nation. More damningly, “about 70 percent of charter schools ranked in the bottom quarter of the state’s schools.” In the year 2013, the DeVos-backed Education Achievement Authority had 10,000 students, issued 6,000 short-term suspensions, and produced exactly one fourth grader who successfully passed the state math test. By diverting money, Detroit charters have “destabilized school district finances” and managed to harm even the surrounding public schools. Michigan State Board of Education President John Austin, himself a vocal charter supporter, called DeVos and her husband “principal agents” of the Michigan catastrophe.
Despite her mortifying record on primary education, Mrs. DeVos still could have soothed critics with a strong knowledge of the Department of Education, an understanding of issues surrounding secondary education, and a solid performance in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. She has thus far delivered none of these things.
DeVos’ naiveté on higher education is particularly troubling. When asked whether she supports the Obama administration’s 2011 Title IX guidance on sexual assault, the nominee dodged the question with risible inelegance: “Assault in any form is never OK, and I want to be very clear on that.” Under further questioning, DeVos was forced to admit that she had never managed a bank or loan program or even taken a Pell grant or student loan. She lacked any plan whatsoever to police waste, fraud, and abuse in publicly funded higher education, stuttering instead that she, “if confirmed, will certainly be very vigilant.” The nominee also indulged in some "alternative facts," falsely claiming that student debt had increased by “nearly 1,000 percent in the last eight years.” When asked about reducing college tuition she opined “there is nothing in life that’s truly free.” Wise words from a woman with a net worth of approximately $1.25 billion.
Mrs. DeVos will probably be confirmed, and not just because Republicans control the Senate. It's hard not to think that her family's more than $250,000 in donations to members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions won't play a role. The leadership of the Department of Education matters. Harvard students who receive federal aid through grants, loans, or work studies should be aware that the woman soon to be in charge of those programs is uninformed and inexperienced. The University community should prepare itself for dramatic changes to Title IX, financial aid, and the general government attitude toward higher education. Betsy DeVos has thus far displayed a poor record and a comprehensively inadequate knowledge base. Harvard students should prepare for the worst.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life recently established the "Collaboration and Innovation Grant", which will provide undergraduate organizations, individual student groups, academic departments, and Houses with up to $3,000 to host collaborative, College-wide events, so long as these events are free and open to all undergraduates. This follows a series of initiatives to shift the epicenter of undergraduate social life and challenge final clubs’ social hegemony. While Harvard is taking the right step to create more inclusive social spaces on campus, it must recognize that money is not the only barrier that students face when seeking to host events.
This recent initiative, however, is not purely reactionary; it also reflects the administration’s response to increasing student criticism over the lack of social spaces on campus. Last year, such debate prompted the Undergraduate Council to launch the “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” which provided $30,000 for events related to mental health, sexual assault and harassment, race relations, and social spaces. The UC should be commended for its trailblazing efforts to support more inclusive social spaces at the College, especially since the precedent it set may have helped pave the way for this new avenue of funding.
Nevertheless, if Harvard seeks to continue improving social life on campus, the College must go beyond just financial support. Many issues arise from the logistical process of organizing parties and the lack of physical spaces for social events on campus.
Harvard can tackle these problems by streamlining and expediting the party registration process across all Houses. While some Houses have improved their party registration process, thereby making their environments more conducive to social events, these efforts have not been not consistent. Currently, students must fill out extensive party registration forms that differ on a House-by-House basis, but some houses have managed to expedite the process through simple Google submission systems. Encouraging all Houses to adopt more efficient methods for party registration would allow every student to reap the benefits of streamlined event hosting.
Furthermore, Harvard can seek to fix its lack of physical social spaces by consulting students about future renovation projects. Students have already fought to transform existing rooms on campus into social spaces for events. While the College might currently be seeking to reduce the influence of the final clubs, it has yet to compete with their physical presence at the University. The renovations in buildings such as Quincy’s Stone Hall and Dunster House, for example, have yet to demonstrate the University’s dedication to improved social spaces. A large number of hallway doubles and singles rather than suites continue to decrease the amount of space for parties on campus, rooms that pale in comparison to the large mansions owned by final clubs. If Harvard is serious about fostering a social environment, their future House renovations should reflect this goal.
The College has taken a step in the right direction by facilitating students' social life. If Harvard aspires to continue creating a more vibrant undergraduate social scene in the future, however, administrators must consider providing resources other than money to support students' endeavors. Only then can Harvard foster a more lively and robust social environment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had a Russian grandmother once.
We met one day in the breakroom, despite having worked together for six months already. She was calmly reading a novel while I was furiously scribbling away, trying to cram all of my calculus homework into the thirty minute slot of serenity before returning back to work until midnight. The cyrillic characters on the cover of her book caught my eye, and I asked her feebly if she was reading "Anna Karenina" (the only Russian novel that came to mind). Her eyes were dark, but they smiled back at me.
In her broken English and my absolutely less-than-stellar Russian, we spoke for twenty minutes about her immigration to the United States during the Cold War and how she has been working for the company ever since it started. I sat in awe as she humbly shared her immense knowledge of the corporation and its inner workings.  Time slipped through our fingers and the clock struck. We packed up our things and returned to the real Bed Bath & Beyond―the sales floor―and were immediately flooded with a barrage of pre-Thanksgiving questions. I watched as customers turned in distaste away from her accent, turning towards me and asking “Excuse me, but can I get help from someone who actually speaks English?” I saw her smiling eyes turn black―wavering ever so slightly.
-----
I’ve stepped on glass before.
My cashier had been promoted to a bridal consultant, and I went to visit her on her first day in the new department. Her hands were shaking while dusting the silverware―she was physically rattled by the idea that her customers were wealthy, and that she, of all people, was expected to give them advice.  “Won’t they judge me for not knowing what rich people like?” I dismissed her worries as nonsense. She’s a hard worker and any customer should be able to see the work ethic behind her brandless clothes.
Just then, her first pair of newlywed customers came. She looked back to me for assurance and nervously approached them. Weeks of practice and training had served her well; her mastery of the products was admirable―yet apparently her knowledge was not enough.
The pair looked at her with disdain: “I think we’ve seen enough for today.”
She paused. “Well, um, let me know if you need anything else.”
She picked up the duster and resumed uneasily, walking away from the couple. Before she made it out of earshot, the couple chuckled, “Those kind of people should stick to cleaning.”
The vase she was handling fell to the floor and burst into a million iridescent pieces, the glass reflecting the white ceiling above.
-----
I had to ask for forgiveness today.
The outing seemed simple enough―walk out of the Harvard bubble and explore the sights in Boston to let go of responsibilities and live carefree for a few hours. It ought to be an easy task and I did exactly that. I felt happy with our cheerful outing, but some in the group did not feel the same.
Before reaching our table, the waiter was enjoying a conversation with another table in his native language, laughing. This unfortunately did not amuse my tablemates. They expressed their unhappiness with the service, citing prejudice and insisting fair treatment. “We’re Harvard students,” they reasoned sarcastically. “We shouldn’t be ignored.”
The waiter came by and served our dishes, his accent clear and pronounced as he repeated our orders back to us, wiping his hands on his navy apron. The rest of the lunch was tense―or maybe I was.  As we walked out of the restaurant, I passed by him and whispered “Lo siento.” Our eyes locked, and his head nodded knowingly. I wish I spoke louder, but instead I went away―back to my campus, my dorm, my new world, and he back to work.
How different it felt to be on the other side of the counter.
-----
Harvard is many things - it is a world of opportunity, the pearl in the preeminent oyster, the flower in the proverbial spring  - but it is not a world of color. It breeds elitism, a sense of entitlement that creeps into everyday language and almost tangibly takes hold of it. Here, I have come to learn and to grow, to hopefully become a better person in the end; however, this does not separate me from where I began. I cannot knowingly assimilate into this shade of crimson―this hue of hollow superiority and false grandeur―after I’ve seen the beauty of the spring.
Blue is the color of a clear sunny day, of warmth and promise of new beginnings; yet it is also the color of melancholy and cold, blisteringly unremorseful to those it leaves ravaged in its wake. I never really understood the power of blue until I truly understood what the color crimson was.
I am the same cashier that gave you the wrong change. I am the same manager that, upon sharing where I will be attending school, was met with disbelief: “Sure you did―now have a nice day at work.”  I am no better or worse than my past.
All the world tends to fall into a dichotomy according to Plato―and my experiences in retail tend to agree with this philosophy. The separation was tangible; retail workers and blue collar on one side, customers and white collar on the other. Before coming to Harvard, I saw this chasm between the two as a byproduct of society―yet I know now that this is accepting defeat.

UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 4:23 p.m.
Harvard Management Company will lay off approximately half of its 230-person staff by the end of the calendar year in the genesis of a five-year overhaul of the world’s largest university endowment.
In a message to Harvard affiliates Wednesday, N.P Narvekar—HMC’s newly-installed CEO—outlined his plan to revitalize the University’s underperforming investment arm, announcing that the company would move to eliminate its internally-managed hedge fund teams by the end of fiscal year 2017, among other reforms.
“We can no longer justify the organizational complexity and resources necessary to support the investing activities of these portfolios,” Narvekar wrote. “Therefore, we have made some important but very difficult decisions.”
Narvekar’s announcement comes as HMC attempts to improve its investment performance—which has lagged behind that of its peers in the last few years—and represents a monumental shift in the way the University invests its 35.7 billion endowment.
The University has historically employed a unique “hybrid” investment model, in which HMC retains a large internal staff in addition to hiring outside money managers. But in a stark shift, Narvekar has moved to abandon HMC’s investment model and instead mirror investment practices in place at many other universities.
Beyond laying off more than 100 employees, Narvekar will also direct HMC to approach a broader investment strategy. In his letter, he wrote that HMC will ease its strategy of “silo investing,” in which its employees specialize in various asset classes, and move to a more “generalist” model focusing efforts on overall endowment performance.
Narvekar, who formerly managed Columbia University’s endowment, was hired in September 2016 to succeed Stephen Blyth, who resigned in the summer after taking a medical leave of absence and has since returned to teaching.
He was expected to make significant changes to the way Harvard invests its endowment; University President Drew G. Faust said in September 2016 that the next endowment chief would reconsider the endowment’s investment strategies, and several experts recommended Harvard eliminate its idiosyncratic model.
But less than two months into his tenure as the chief executive at the top of Harvard’s endowment, Narvekar has quickly started to spur a radical change in Harvard’s investment strategy—a choice experts say will push HMC in the direction of more successful investment offices.
In the last few years at HMC, the need for change was, for some, palpable. In fiscal year 2016, HMC posted negative 2 percent returns on its investment—the lowest return rate since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. HMC missed several internal benchmarks, and then-interim CEO Robert A. Ettl attributed “execution” as a “key factor” in the poor performance.
Along with other financial flows, including the $1.7 billion allocated to the University’s annual operating budget, the endowment shrunk by nearly $2 billion. The losses, repeatedly characterized as “disappointing,” will constrain budgets across Harvard, according to University President Drew G. Faust.
Beyond its lackluster returns, the firm’s employees also privately criticized HMC’s workplace culture as “lazy, fat, and stupid” in a 2015 internal review conducted by McKinsey and Company, accusing their employer of setting artificially low benchmarks and overcompensating its executives.
As a result, many have questioned Harvard’s hybrid investment strategy in recent years. For experts in investment management like Charles A. Skorina, the leader of a financial executive search firm, Harvard’s “hybrid” investment model made sense in the 1990s, before the financial crisis in 2009 laid waste to conventional wisdom for investment management.
“It turns out Harvard couldn’t do any better than most of the hedge funds, so Narv has followed at Columbia a model that’s much closer to the Yale model,” Skorina said
Columbia, like Yale, employes external managers to handle its funds and maintains a relatively small in-house staff.
Though Columbia posted a modest -0.9 percent returns in fiscal year 2016, Yale—whose investment strategy some say Columbia has emulated—performed comparatively in a market that has lately been difficult for institutional investors. While HMC returned negative 2 percent on its portfolio in fiscal year 2016, Yale posted 3.4 percent, outpacing Harvard by more than 5 percentage points.
While Yale’s endowment remains smaller overall than Harvard’s—$25.4 billion against Harvard’s $35.7 billion—Yale’s returns have outpaced Harvard’s in eight out of the past ten years.
“Why would we manage stuff internally? We can’t compete with the best at Goldman and all these other firms,” Skorina said. “But we can identify great outside managers. That’s the Yale model, that’s what Narv has done for the last nine, ten years, and it’s perfectly reasonable to expect him to do the same thing here.”
According to Narvekar’s letter, HMC will switch over its direct real estate investments to external managers. The company will continue to internally manage its natural resources portfolio “at this time,”Narvekar wrote.
Towards the end of 2016, HMC said it would “refine,” or sell off, some of its natural resource holdings—a change that comes after the company hired a new head of the natural resources division and fell far short of internal benchmarks for the asset class in fiscal year 2016.
Still, Narvekar wrote, there is a possibility that Harvard may again employ more internal investment managers at some point down the line.
“Conceptually, there is no reason why a generalist team could not hire managers internally, based upon an assessment of their potential alpha generation,” Narvekar wrote. “While I don’t expect a large portion of the portfolio to be managed internally as a practical matter (and as a result of the challenges outlined above), nothing is out of bounds in the future.”
While over 100 HMC employees will lose their jobs this year, Narvekar has also hired four new executives: a new chief investment officer and three managing directors to oversee the implementation of Narvekar’s new policies.
Richard W. Slocum, who previously served as the chief investment officer of the Johnson company, will become HMC’s the first chief investment officer in March. Vir Dholabhai, Adam Goldstein, and Charlie Savaria will all join HMC as managing directors of the investment team.
“I have known these individuals both personally and professionally for the majority of my career and I value their insights and perspectives,” Narvekar wrote. “I am confident they will be a great addition to the talented and experienced investment team here at HMC.”
Narvekar also wrote that he intends to transition HMC’s strategy to a more “generalist” approach over the course of the next five years. The University’s investment arm will require all members of its team to carry responsibility for Harvard’s entire portfolio in an effort to refocus the company on “the performance of the overall endowment” rather than respective asset classes of HMC’s investment managers.
In his message, Narvekar wrote that “silo investing” results in both gaps in HMC’s portfolio and the unnecessary duplication of assets. He wrote that the model creates an “overemphasis on individual asset class benchmarks” and discourages collaboration.
William F. Jarvis, the executive director of the Commonfund Institute, said the change indicates a shift in “management philosophy” at HMC.
“If you have a company that is basically a bunch of silos, a bunch of individual departments, then it’s the job of someone else—senior management—to put that together into a successful portfolio,” Jarvis said.
The new model will make all of HMC’s portfolio managers responsible for the overall well-being of the endowment.
HMC will also reevaluate its executive compensation structures, which drew criticism from Harvard alumni in late 2016. In the new compensation structure, executive pay will be tied to the performance of the overall endowment rather than that of individual asset classes.
“Transitioning away from practices that have been engrained in HMC’s culture for decades will no doubt be challenging at times,” Narvekar wrote, concluding his letter. “But we must evolve to be successful, and we must withstand the associated growing pains to achieve our goals.”

UPDATED: January 26, 2016, at 2:06 a.m.
The College’s penalties for members of single-gender social organizations could be “revised or replaced” by a committee tasked with improving them—opening up the historic policy to faculty input after some professors criticized the way it was initially crafted.
The committee—comprised of faculty, students, and staff—will study “whether the policy can be improved, either by changing aspects of its existing structure or through some broader revision,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to Harvard students Wednesday. The committee will aim to control the “problematic impact” of single-gender social organizations on campus and will present its recommendations in the fall of 2017.
Slated to go into effect for the Class of 2021, the current policy bars members of single-gender social organizations, including fraternities, sororities, and final clubs, from receiving College endorsement for post-graduate fellowships and holding leadership positions in student organizations.
According to Khurana’s email, the committee will submit final recommendations to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and University President Drew G. Faust will grant final approval for the potentially-reworked policy.
Faust said in an interview Wednesday that she is open to any option that achieves what she said is a goal of “non-discrimination.”
“If there’s another one that gets us there that’s legal, that’s operational, that could be implemented—if there’s a better idea I welcome it,” Faust said.
Khurana’s announcement affords faculty—some of whom have been critical of both the sanctions and the perceived lack of faculty involvement in designing them—an opportunity to alter a policy Khurana and College administrators spent over a year crafting behind closed doors.
“The faculty play a critical role in our decision making and I really welcome their interest,” Khurana said in an interview Wednesday.
Faculty have debated the merits of the policy and the process of its creation for months. An intense debate within FAS over the College’s policy came to a head at a December Faculty meeting, when professors discussed a motion submitted by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 in opposition to the sanctions.
At those discussions, some professors charged that administrators had not allowed faculty to have input in the historic policy. Smith called the criticisms “categorically false” in a December interview. Others at December’s meeting—which ended abruptly, postponing any potential vote on Lewis’s motion until Feb. 7’s meeting—voiced support for the policy.
Faust said she had not expected professors to want to play such a role in the student life policy change and welcomes their input going forward.
“We didn’t anticipate this level of faculty interest when we started working on the policy last year,” Faust said in an interview. “We had sort of thought of it as a student life issue that came historically under the purview of the Dean [of the College].”
Khurana said Lewis’s motion and the surrounding debate among faculty members has shaped the campus debate about the sanctions.
“I think obviously the Lewis motion catalysed a conversation and discussion on campus, among students and faculty, about how best to address the challenges and the problems that the USGSO present to Harvard College and our commitment to creating an equitable and inclusive environment,” Khurana said in an interview.
Khurana said that Smith will determine the size of the committee, select members to serve on it, and receive its final recommendations early in the fall 2017 semester.
“We will also ensure that the Faculty has the opportunity to comment on the committee’s report before any recommendations are conveyed to President Faust,” Khurana wrote in his email to students.
Faust will be kept informed of the committee’s deliberations, and will hold approval of any policy the committee submits to her.
“I hope that, and trust that, during the process things that might concern me would be communicated during the process,” Faust said. “Ultimately, I want to be able to ensure that this policy is not going to get us sued instantly, is legal, is something that the governing boards feel is acceptable to implement.”
Khurana also added that the committee would look to peer institutions for alternative solutions they had tried that could help shape Harvard’s policy.
“As we’ve said many times that different institutions, higher education institutions, have approached the issue of single gender social organizations on their campus in different ways. I think it’s important that we always inform ourselves of the wide range of possibilities that exist,” Khurana said.
When formed, the faculty committee will work alongside a separate committee tasked with formulating an implementation plan for the current policy. That committee is currently working on a report recommending how to enforce the policy.
“I think for the new committee, they can build off the deep and careful work that [the implementation committee has] done,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said they plan to put forth several initiatives to connect student identity groups with College administrators during their first months in office.
In an interview Tuesday, Sachee and Khansarinia said they plan to attend monthly meetings with College administrators and undergraduate cultural groups to open dialogue about the needs of minority student populations.
Sachee said she and Khansarinia hope to make “sure that all student voices are heard on this campus,” and referenced the contentious political climate in the United States, where “too often some voices are sidelined.”
Sachee added the duo intends to keep a campaign promise to form an “identity coalition” of cultural group leaders to keep UC representatives informed on minority student concerns. According to Sachee and Khansarinia, this group will look to represent students of color, first generation students, and BGLTQ students, among others.
Khansarinia said they will work this semester to create freshmen “bridge programs” during Opening Days to ease students’ transitions from home to Harvard.
“The first step is feeling like you belong at Harvard, feeling that you’re not a visitor for four years here,” he said.
The two also said they want to focus on preventing sexual assault at the College after a UC election season that heard many plans to address the issue.
In a meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana following their election, Khansarinia said, the newly-elected pair outlined their sexual assault prevention plans, which include planning meetings between each UC representative and their respective House and Yard deans to discuss unique sexual assault prevention plans that best fit each space.
“We talked a lot about in the campaign how we don't necessarily think that one-size-fits-all or top-down solutions necessarily work for all these problems,” Khansarinia said.
The pair also said they plan to work with the College’s Consent Advocates & Relationship Educators to institute sexual assault prevention trainings for all undergraduates.
“One thing that we talked about in our meeting with Dean Khurana is making these conversations about sexual assault and sexual assault prevention inescapable,” Khansarinia said.
Khansarinia also said he and Sachee plan on working with the UC, professors, and students to make textbooks more affordable. One solution they propose involves taking money from the “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” a fund spearheaded by former UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and  Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, to subsidize textbook prices.
The “Grant for an Open Harvard” funds student ventures across four “compelling interests”: mental health, sexual assault prevention, race relations, and social spaces. Sachee also said the pair is considering working with the College’s financial aid office or creating a “buy-back exchange” to lower textbook prices.
After their first UC general meeting as Council President and Vice President—happening Sunday—Sachee and Khansarinia said they plan on sitting down with University President Drew G. Faust in coming weeks.

While many relished the last week of their winter vacation, 24 enthusiastic Humanities 10b: "A Humanities Colloquium: From Joyce to Homer”  students returned to campus a week early for a Wintersession course on James Joyce’s “Ulysses.”
The free and voluntary course—only open to those enrolled in Humanities 10— took students through the novel and allowed for discussion on its themes such as government censorship and Irish politics, according to English Ph.D. candidate Miles A.F. Osgood, the course’s creator and instructor.
Osgood said he chose “Ulysses” because of its complexity. All Humanities 10 students are required to read the book during their winter break, but are allowed to opt into the Wintersession course.
“I thought by going in a week early to talk about the book with other people who were excited about it, it would help me be set for next semester and take away more from the book than I would from just reading it for three weeks in class,” said Hillary Mclauchlin ’20, who took the course.
Osgood’s course was part of a series of Wintersession offerings, a set of weeklong workshops on topics ranging from computer science to clay printmaking.
Humanities 10 students who took the course said they enjoyed its size and subject matter.
“I would say the size was absolutely perfect. We had enough people that the views were fresh. At the same time, it was small enough that everyone could participate in the conversation,” Lauren D. Spohn ’20 said.
In total, 24 students attended throughout the week, a large  increase from the 10 that took the course last year when it was offered for the first time. The course had separate morning and afternoon sections, both taught by Osgood.
Students spent two or three hours per a day in class. According to Osgood, before coming to class students watched videotaped lectures, so the entire class period could be dedicated to discussion.
Thomas W. Burke ’20 said the class’s trip to Houghton Library, the home of Harvard’s rare books and manuscripts, was incredibly helpful in understanding “Ulysses.” Burke added that reading primary sources from James Joyce’s lifetime helped him understand the novel’s setting.
Osgood said their trip to Houghton Library may also help Humanities 10 students conduct research for a required paper on “Ulysses” due later this semester.
At the end of the week, students presented projects meant to engage creatively with the novel. Students’ projects ranged from a parody Twitter account to a chalk portrait of one of the book’s main characters.
“We had a blast doing the final project. It allowed us to engage with ‘Ulysses’ in a creative way causing us to understand it more,” Spohn said.
Osgood said he was pleased with the course’s size, although he may consider opening it to non-Humanities 10 students in the future.
“I really enjoyed easing back into school with one class. I would definitely consider doing another course next year,”  Mclauchlin said.

Harvard Management Company will lay off approximately half of its 230-person staff by the end of the calendar year in the genesis of a five-year overhaul of the world’s largest university endowment.
In a message to Harvard affiliates Wednesday, N.P Narvekar—HMC’s newly-installed CEO—outlined his plan to revitalize the University’s underperforming  investment arm, announcing that the company would move to eliminate its internally-managed hedge fund teams by the end of fiscal year 2017, among other reforms.
“We can no longer justify the organizational complexity and resources necessary to support the investing activities of these portfolios,” Narvekar wrote. “Therefore, we have made some important but very difficult decisions.”
Narvekar’s announcement comes as HMC attempts to improve its investment performance—which has lagged behind that of its peers in the last few years—and represents a monumental shift in the way the University invests its 35.7 billion endowment.
The University has historically employed a unique “hybrid” investment model,  in which HMC retains a large internal staff in addition to hiring outside money managers. But in a stark shift, Narvekar has moved to abandon HMC’s investment model and  instead mirror investment practices in place at many other universities.
Beyond laying off more than 100 employees, Narvekar will also direct HMC to approach a broader investment strategy. In his letter, he wrote that HMC will ease its strategy of “silo investing,” in which its employees specialize in various asset classes, and move to a more “generalist” model focusing efforts on overall endowment performance.
Narvekar, who formerly managed Columbia University’s endowment, was hired in September 2016 to succeed Stephen Blyth, who resigned in the summer after taking a medical leave of absence and has since returned to teaching.
He was expected to make significant changes to the way Harvard invests its endowment; University President Drew G. Faust said in September 2016 that the next endowment chief would reconsider the endowment’s investment strategies, and several experts recommended Harvard eliminate its idiosyncratic model.
But less than two months into his tenure as the chief executive at the top of Harvard’s endowment, Narvekar has quickly started to spur a radical change in Harvard’s investment strategy—a choice experts say will push HMC in the direction of more successful investment offices.
In the last few years at HMC, the need for change was, for some, palpable. In fiscal year 2016, HMC posted negative 2 percent returns on its investment—the lowest return rate since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. HMC missed several internal benchmarks, and then-interim CEO Robert A. Ettl attributed “execution” as a “key factor” in the poor performance.
Along with other financial flows, including the $1.7 billion allocated to the University’s annual operating budget, the endowment shrunk by nearly $2 billion. The losses, repeatedly characterized as “disappointing,” will constrain budgets across Harvard, according to University President Drew G. Faust.
Beyond its lackluster returns, the firm’s employees also privately criticized HMC’s workplace culture as “lazy, fat, and stupid” in a 2015 internal review conducted by McKinsey and Company, accusing their employer of setting artificially low benchmarks and overcompensating its executives.
As a result, many have questioned Harvard’s hybrid investment strategy in recent years. For experts in investment management like Charles A. Skorina, the leader of a financial executive search firm, Harvard’s “hybrid” investment model made sense in the 1990s, before the financial crisis in 2009 laid waste to conventional wisdom for investment management.
“It turns out Harvard couldn’t do any better than most of the hedge funds, so Narv has followed at Columbia a model that’s much closer to the Yale model,” Skorina said
Columbia, like Yale, employes external managers to handle its funds and maintains a relatively small in-house staff.
Though Columbia posted a modest -0.9 percent returns in fiscal year 2016, Yale—whose investment strategy some say Columbia has emulated—performed comparatively in a market that has lately been difficult for institutional investors. While HMC returned negative 2 percent on its portfolio in fiscal year 2016, Yale posted 3.4 percent, outpacing Harvard by more than 5 percentage points.
While Yale’s endowment remains smaller overall than Harvard’s—$25.4 billion against Harvard’s $35.7 billion—Yale’s returns have outpaced Harvard’s in eight out of the past ten years.
“Why would we manage stuff internally? We can’t compete with the best at Goldman and all these other firms,” Skorina said. “But we can identify great outside managers. That’s the Yale model, that’s what Narv has done for the last nine, ten years, and it’s perfectly reasonable to expect him to do the same thing here.”
According to Narvekar’s letter, HMC will switch over its direct real estate investments to external managers. The company will continue to internally manage its natural resources portfolio “at this time,”Narvekar wrote.
Towards the end of 2016, HMC said it would “refine,” or sell off, some of its natural resource holdings—a change that comes after the company hired a new head of the natural resources division and fell far short of internal benchmarks for the asset class in fiscal year 2016.
Still, Narvekar wrote, there is a possibility that Harvard may again employ more internal investment managers at some point down the line.
“Conceptually, there is no reason why a generalist team could not hire managers internally, based upon an assessment of their potential alpha generation,” Narvekar wrote. “While I don’t expect a large portion of the portfolio to be managed internally as a practical matter (and as a result of the challenges outlined above), nothing is out of bounds in the future.”
While over 100 HMC employees will lose their jobs this year, Narvekar has also hired four new executives: a new chief investment officer and three managing directors to oversee the implementation of Narvekar’s new policies.
Richard W. Slocum, who previously served as the chief investment officer of the Johnson company, will become HMC’s the first chief investment officer in March. Vir Dholabhai, Adam Goldstein, and Charlie Savaria will all join HMC as managing directors of the investment team.
“I have known these individuals both personally and professionally for the majority of my career and I value their insights and perspectives,” Narvekar wrote. “I am confident they will be a great addition to the talented and experienced investment team here at HMC.”
Narvekar also wrote that he intends to transition HMC’s strategy to a more “generalist” approach over the course of the next five years. The University’s investment arm will require all members of its team to carry responsibility for Harvard’s entire portfolio in an effort to refocus the company on “the performance of the overall endowment” rather than respective asset classes of HMC’s investment managers.
In his message, Narvekar wrote that “silo investing” results in both gaps in HMC’s portfolio and the unnecessary duplication of assets. He wrote that the model creates an “overemphasis on individual asset class benchmarks” and discourages collaboration.
William F. Jarvis, the executive director of the Commonfund Institute, said the change indicates a shift in “management philosophy” at HMC.
“If you have a company that is basically a bunch of silos, a bunch of individual departments, then it’s the job of someone else—senior management—to put that together into a successful portfolio,” Jarvis said.
The new model will make all of HMC’s portfolio managers responsible for the overall well-being of the endowment.
HMC will also reevaluate its executive compensation structures, which drew criticism from Harvard alumni in late 2016. In the new compensation structure, executive pay will be tied to the performance of the overall endowment rather than that of individual asset classes.
“Transitioning away from practices that have been engrained in HMC’s culture for decades will no doubt be challenging at times,” Narvekar wrote, concluding his letter. “But we must evolve to be successful, and we must withstand the associated growing pains to achieve our goals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 54 years selling newspapers and souvenirs out of a small shop in Harvard Square, the family-run Crimson Corner is set to close its doors by the end of the month, likely to be replaced by Washington, D.C.-based chain &pizza.
The Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal was scheduled to hear &pizza’s petition to obtain an operating permit at the body’s Jan. 12 meeting. However, &pizza requested to delay the hearing to the board’s March 9 meeting, according to Inspectional Services Department representatives Sean P. O’Grady and Maria Pacheco.
In the meantime, Crimson Corner must vacate its location at the intersection of Brattle St., JFK St., and Massachusetts Ave by the end of the month, as the business was unable to renew its monthly lease. According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the property owner and Crimson Corner had a standing "tenancy at will" agreement—an agreement where either party can terminate the property's lease at any time.
The property owner had given Crimson Corner owner Chris Kotelly thirty days’ notice to vacate the property by Jan. 31. Tory Row, a restaurant located next to Crimson Corner, shuttered in October and is set to also become part of &pizza’s storefront.
Kotelly, though, said that there may still be hope for Crimson Corner.
“The pizza place hasn’t gotten approval yet,” Kotelly said. “I know it was the date of March 9 for the Zoning Board of Appeals, and I think that’s probably the biggest hurdle for them. The question is, if [&pizza gets] shot down, can we go back to the owners or the building owner management company and say ‘hey, can we work on a deal and stay?’”
Jillson said she hopes Crimson Corner may be able to remain open until &pizza’s plans are approved and finalized.
“Now the interesting thing is that the incoming business has postponed or asked for a reschedule of their hearing until the middle of March,” Jillson said. "It would be certainly ideal if Chris could stay until the permitting is done and everything has been worked out, but these things are not always possible.”
Kotelly says that it will be physically difficult to leave the building by the end of January, and he will try to strike a deal with the building owners. Kotelly’s lawyer have been in contact with the property owner to discuss extending the lease while Kotelly looks for another location.
“It’s going to be hard for us to liquidate everything by January 31 anyway,” Kotelly said. “So legally, we’re not supposed to stay past that, but I don’t see how we can get everything out of here in time. And I think the owners kind of know that.”
Jillson has continued to work with Kotelly to find a new space to move to in the Square, but their efforts have so far been unsuccessful.
The two remain hopeful that perhaps they can find a new space, but emphasized that an adequate location in the Square is particularly hard to come across.
“He needs to be in a space that’s very convenient and very visible and that’s a bit of a trick because there are only so many corners that are in the heart of the Square, and those are certainly the best places for his type of business,” Jillson said.
“We’re sorry to see him go, he’s an important and valuable member of our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just weeks after University President Drew G. Faust launched the search for the next Dean of Harvard Law School, student groups at the school have started organizing to make themselves “an indispensable part of the process.”  
While Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 invited students to submit feedback through an email account during the search, some Law School students argue that they should be more formally included in the search process. In January, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow announced that she would step down at the end of the academic year and said that she expects the search will conclude by the time she returns to teaching full-time.
 The Law School’s student body president Nino Monea wrote a letter to Faust Jan. 18 requesting that Faust and Garber attend a student forum about the dean search, a student become a member of the committee leading the search, and that students help interview candidates for the position.
Monea said he was disappointed with the level of student involvement in the search Faust originally described.
“[Faust’s letter] did not outline any specific role for how students would be engaged. I think that’s unfortunate, especially since faculty were mentioned,” Monea said. “It’s not asking for much that we be given the same sort of courtesy.”
Kristin A. Turner, the president of the Black Law Students Association, shared Monea’s concerns about how the search will incorporate student voices.
“As much as we appreciate the gesture, I don’t know if that’s going to be wholly sufficient considering the magnitude of what the Harvard Law School dean search entails, and the climate that the next dean will be inheriting, in terms of the ongoing conversations we have about how to set a more progressive course into our bicentennial era,” Turner said.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson said in a statement that Faust and Garber want to hear student input, emphasizing their appreciation for the feedback they have received so far via email.
“The President’s office is working with the Law School to create opportunities for a diverse group of students to speak with the President or Provost to share their perspectives on the Law School and the deanship at this important time of transition for the school,” Jackson said.
In an emailed statement, Monea added that he has received a response to his letter, indicating that meeting about students concerns would take place.
In addition to Monea’s letter, Michele D. Hall, a fellow in the Law and Social Change program of study at the Law School, said she has begun working with a number of student groups to plan a forum where students can ask Faust questions and provide feedback on the search.
“None of the student that are in the Law School were here last time a new dean was hired, so we just wanted to have the opportunity both to be able to offer transparency to the process, but also to have the student voice included in the process,” Hall said.
Natalie D. Vernon, the president of the Women’s Law Association, said she she hopes the next dean continues to improve gender equity at the school and adapts the curriculum to the changing legal profession.
“I think these are all kind of tectonic shifts in the legal profession that we have to address in the Law School environment first and foremost,” Vernon said. “I think that’s going to be one of the biggest challenges for the incoming dean, but also one of the biggest opportunities to really put Harvard Law back in the forefront of legal education in the midst of this massively changing time period that we’re in.”
Last year, Law School student groups made a series of demands on Minow to improve the school’s treatment of minority students, including hiring more professors of color and creating an office dedicated to diversity and inclusion.
Student group leaders say that some of those same topics should be priorities for the new dean.
“Last year the Law School got a lot of press because we were involved in a lot of activism, but you know the issues that were raised last year by no means were just being put on the table last year, and by no means have they been muted or gone away, just because some of the activism has dissipated,” Turner said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 12:14 p.m.
After their program received a failing grade for student debt from the U.S. Department of Education, students at the Harvard American Repertory Theater Institute said they are concerned about their future finances, but recognize that careers in performing arts are often low-paying.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education released a list of hundreds of colleges and universities that failed to meet federal standards for student debt levels. While the Department of Education's investigation mainly targeted for-profit programs, Harvard’s A.R.T. Institute—a two-year acting, voice instruction, and dramaturgy graduate program—also came under fire for saddling its graduates with high levels of debt, putting the program at risk of losing federal financial aid.
Consequently, the A.R.T. Institute has frozen admissions until it can ensure that students will be able to receive federal financial aid, according to Scott Zigler, who directs the Institute.
Zigler defended the program and said that the A.R.T. Institute does not misrepresent the earning potential of its graduates.
“I think a lot of the for-profit schools have made promises like that that they haven’t been able to deliver on. We don’t make those promises,” Zigler said. “I don’t know that anyone coming out of acting school expects to be making a lot of money three, four, or even five years after.”
Some students currently enrolled at the A.R.T. Institute also said they recognize the difficult of earning a substantial salary as a professional actor..
“I didn’t enter the acting profession to become rich, but I also don’t want to be left with student loan balances that I will never be able to repay,” Shawn Jain, a first-year student at the Institute, wrote in an email.
Elizabeth Amos, another student at the A.R.T. Institute, said she decided to enroll in the program despite potentially low future earnings.
“I chose this program despite the expense because I believed it to be an investment in my future that would bring me great returns. And to be clear, I don’t expect those returns to be financial,” Amos wrote. “You cannot choose a career in the arts expecting to be wealthy.”
Still, Jain wrote that some students are concerned about the status of federal financial aid and the long-term implications of student debt.
“I'd like us to receive a commitment in writing from Harvard that students in the [A.R.T. Institute’s] class of 2018 will receive the funding we need to ensure that we graduate… I would gander that nearly all of my classmates in the Institute will graduate with a tremendous amount of debt,” Jain wrote.
Zigler said he does not expect to raise the A.R.T Institute graduates' earnings. Instead, he suggested that a longer-term solution for remaining eligible for federal financial aid would be to develop a Master of Fine Arts degree program at Harvard.
“There is not much the A.R.T. can to do address the earning side of the metric. There is not a lot that we can do that will make it easier to be successful as an actor in America,” Zigler said.
As for alleviating student debt, Zigler said the Institute hopes to use this time to address the overall cost of the program and find new funding sources to increase scholarships.
Zigler said the Institute also hopes to use the admissions freeze as an opportunity to evaluate the career resources the program offers its students.
“I think we probably can do better in terms of professional preparation. We want to give our students every leg up professionally.” Zigler said. “I think one thing that students are looking for is a sense of career longevity—not necessarily a lot of money.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 12:07 p.m. 
University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana attended the biweekly meeting of the Faculty Council Tuesday to discuss a committee that could revise a policy penalizing members of single social organizations.
Faust does not typically attend the meetings of the highest elected body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the Council met hours before Khurana announced that the policy could be “revised or replaced” after faculty input.
“President Faust came to the Faculty Council meeting and mentioned that this letter was going to go out,” Council member David L. Howell said. “She gave us a kind of general overview of what it would say.”
The policy—which bars members of the unrecognized single-gender organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups or receiving College endorsement for fellowships beginning with the Class of 2021—has been the subject of controversy among professors.
In letters, at Faculty meetings, and in written motions, some professors have argued over the course of months that administrators should have consulted them about the policy. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and 11 other professors crafted a motion  last year opposing the sanctions. Faculty were expecting to vote on the motion at the December Faculty meeting, but Faust adjourned the meeting at the regular end time, tabling the motion until 2017.
In an interview Wednesday, Faust said that debate among professors at the Faculty’s December meeting spurred the formation of the new committee, which will be comprised of faculty, staff and students.
“It also came out of two things: an awareness of the concerns about and engagement by the faculty and a recognition of how widespread that engagement was and the concerns that have been expressed. We heard those concerns,” Faust said.
Council member and physics professor Matthew D. Schwartz said that the committee was “uniformly supported” by professors on the Council.
“It’s an important issue and I think everyone on the Faculty agrees that it’s important and contentious enough that we need to have more deliberation,” Schwartz said
Amid concerns from faculty members about their input into the University decision-making and the policy, Faust has sought to work with professors. Some professors not on the Council also said the creation of the committee was an encouraging step.
“I am deeply grateful to Dean Khurana and Dean Smith for taking this courageous and welcome decision,” government professor Eric M. Nelson ’99 wrote in an email. Nelson has been a vocal critic of the policy and is one of 12 professors who crafted a motion opposing it.
“I was particularly pleased to read Dean Khurana’s assurance that the Faculty will be given the opportunity to comment on the new committee’s eventual report before it is submitted to President Faust,” Nelson wrote.
Suzanne P. Blier, a professor of art history and African and African American studies, said she believed greater faculty engagement due to the committee would serve multiple purposes for the administration.
“It could mean that one wants to get the Faculty actually thinking about it,” Blier said. “It could mean that one is looking for Faculty support for a decision that the administration has taken.”
The new announcement extends the debate over social club sanctions into the fall of 2017, when the committee is expected to give its recommendations.
“We take longer, we’re older, and we address things in a more formal way, so here we are,” Blier said.
The Faculty is scheduled to meet for its first meeting of the semester in University Hall during the afternoon of Feb. 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston winters are cruel—sardonic, slushy, and long. But here in Cambridge, Harvard sports teams are thriving.
The women’s basketball team can’t lose. Since Nov. 12, 2016, the Crimson has ripped off 14 straight victories, the second-longest streak in school history.
Harvard has won in Kansas, New York, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The women have shot to early leads, clawed from behind, and pulled out tug-of-war battles.
Rookies have made immediate impacts. Freshman guard Katie Benzan tops the team in points and assists, and freshman forward Jeannie Boehm is tied for the program lead in rebounds. But veterans provide the backbone, as three returning players average over nine points a contest.
Forget parkas and 30-degree dreariness. This women’s basketball program is Fourth-of-July, sweat-stains-on-the-T, the grill-is-on-fire hot.
And that’s only one team. Not to be outdone, men’s basketball has won nine of its last 10 games, including an 82-68 romp over Dartmouth last Saturday. The most touted recruiting class in school history has met many expectations, as two freshmen (guard Bryce Aiken and forward Seth Towns) lead Harvard in scoring.
Again, though, it’s the depth that stands out. Five players score at least eight points a game, and senior point guard Siyani Chambers marshals the attack. Talent runs deep.
The same holds for the track and field team, which has spent January threatening school records. Senior Jade Miller ran a 600-meter race in 1:20.53, better than anyone else in Crimson history, and sophomore Myles Marshal did the same over 800 meters. Sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomas is also nipping at historic times.
Then there is senior Nikki Okwelogu, who competed for Nigeria in last summer’s Olympics. A first-team All-American as a junior, she threw a shot put 17.32 meters at May’s Ivy League Championship. By comparison, the other nine best throwers to attend Harvard recorded career bests between 13.5 and 14.8 meters.
As it is on land, so it is in water: No one can keep up with Crimson swimmers. Neither the men’s nor the women’s swimming and diving team has dropped a meet all year. Recently, the men’s squad smacked Brown, 226-74—a defeat so lopsided that lifeguards probably should have intervened.
As gray as Boston winters can be, this January marks a golden era for many Harvard teams. And in this age of dominance, one program reigns as king—or rather queen—of them all.
The Crimson women’s squash team last suffered defeat more than two years ago. The date was Jan. 11, 2015. The final score was a nightmarishly close 5-4.
Since then, Harvard has won two national championships and seems poised to claim a third. This season, the team has entered five contests and taken all five.
On the weekend of Jan. 14, the Crimson confronted stiff tests again No. 2 Penn and No. 4 Princeton. The favorites passed without much difficulty, winning 7-2 and 8-1, respectively. More recently, on Jan. 21, Harvard visited Palo Alto, Calif. and ravaged No. 5 Stanford, 9-0.
The success of the 2016-2017 team feeds into a longer narrative of obliteration. Harvard has seized four of the last five national titles. One more this year will give the Crimson 17 overall, tied with Princeton for the most all time.
A perceptive historian might trace Harvard’s success back to a chance encounter on a New York City squash court several decades ago. It was in this setting that Khaled Sobhy met his future wife, Jodie Larson. And it was this couple that eventually produced Amanda and Sabrina Sobhy, two of the most talented players in school history.
Sabrina is the current No. 1 for the Crimson. Last year, as a freshman, she also held the team’s top spot and finished 10-2, earning a spot on the All-American first team.
Meanwhile, the elder Sobhy merely was a four-time national champion. In her decorated career, Amanda dropped a total of two games. Never did she lose a whole match. By the time she graduated in 2015, Amanda ranked No. 10 in the world.
It is important to recognize, though, that the Crimson relies on much more than Sobhy talent. Harvard cannot best an opponent unless five individuals win matches, and in recent years, many team members have proven capable. This season, for instance, 10 players remain undefeated after five contests.
As well as basketball players have shot, runners have sprinted, and swimmers have surged, nothing can match the dominance of the women’s squash team.
Want to debate the point? Win 16 national titles, and then let’s talk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League is won and lost on Friday and Saturday nights.
Harvard men’s basketball (10-5, 2-0 Ivy League) already has two conference wins under its belt with a sweep of travel-partner Dartmouth, but the real Ancient Eight grind begins on Friday in the first night of six weeks of back-to-back games on Fridays and Saturdays. For the Crimson, the back-to-back schedule kicks off against Cornell (5-12, 1-1) and Columbia (7-8, 1-1).
While other conferences play nearly any night of the week, the Ivy League schedule is restricted to non-school nights once conference play sets in. This exists as part of the Ivy League’s priority of having an equal balance of student and athlete. Other policies restrict the amount of rest time players must have following a road trip and the number of practices teams may have in the offseason, among other logistical rules.
This unique scheduling requires a different kind of planning for coaches and players—both in scouting opposing teams and in keeping players fresh for two consecutive nights of basketball. This is especially true for rookies, who aren’t used to the back-to-back nights. But when Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s squad steps on the court in Ithaca on Friday (and in New York City on Saturday) it will be prepared, even as one of the youngest squads in the country.
“We have really made the decision to try to develop our depth and use our bench and hopefully that can equate into having really good balance,” Amaker said. “Again, we’re a work in progress, but I really like the direction.”
Knowing that his team would have to tackle these back-to-backs when conference season came, Amaker planned a non-conference back-to-back against two local foes in Northeastern and Boston College to try and simulate what this experience would be like for his seven freshmen.
“That’s the kind of experience we’re going to make sure our guys are remembering,” Amaker said. “Just as importantly, because we were successful in that particular back to back. It wasn’t necessarily driving up five or six hours to Ithaca and then down to New York City, it was obviously right here, so it will be different in that regard.”
Harvard walked away from both of those games on the winning side of the equation, part of a five-game winning spurt prior to the winter break. A commonality between both of those games was the depth of the Harvard squad. While a rookie led the way in scoring in both wins against Northeastern and BC—Seth Towns and Chris Lewis, respectively—several players shouldered the scoring and defensive burdens in the games, allowing Amaker to consistently keep fresh legs on the floor.
“We have a pretty deep roster, so we use that to our advantage, and as a team I think we’ve been improving each and every game and every week so that’s something we pride ourselves on,” freshman guard Bryce Aiken said. “It’s next man up. We all have our roles and identity, we just have to follow our roles to get the win.”
While the Gentlemen C’s have been fairly consistent in who they are seeing production from—Matt Morgan and Robert Hatter for Cornell, Luke Petrasek, Nate Hickman, and Mike Smith for Columbia—the Crimson has been harder to predict.
The freshman core of Aiken, Lewis, Towns and Justin Bassey have all led the team in scoring on multiple occasions, with veteran players such as seniors co-captain Siyani Chambers and Zena Edosomwan along with sophomore Corey Johnson have also taken on the scoring burden.
“We have made a conscious effort to develop our depth,” Amaker said. “We have a lot of players, Cornell has a lot of players, Princeton has a lot of players, you just need to decide if your philosophy is to develop that as opposed to playing six seven or eight guys and play them 35 plus minutes.”
Throughout the season, Amaker has come to embrace his teams depth—Amaker regularly plays well over 10 of his 20 man squad and typically most don’t play over thirty minutes on a given night.
Amaker consistently seeks “bench and balance” from his team, making it challenging for opposing teams to hone in on one individual player or limiting the offense to one style of scoring. In the Crimson’s most recent game at home against Dartmouth, its two leading scorers—Towns and Edosomwan—came off the bench.
“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen that before, but here we are,” Amaker said. “It’s been a good rhythm for us.”
