After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We certainly hear about plenty of Harvard athletes making their mark on an international level, even a few on the Olympic stage—but at the Commonwealth Games? Not so much.
The Commonwealth Games, the Olympic equivalent for the members of the British Empire, will be held for the 19th time beginning this Sunday in Delhi, India, where Siddharth Suchde ’07 will be representing the host country.
Suchde was a top-tier squash player at Harvard from 2003-2007 and won the national championship his senior year. According to the Hindustan Times, “with his Harvard degree, hard body and steely nerves, 25-year-old Siddarth Suchde is India’s second highest-ranking player in squash, a game that puts immense strain on the joints and mind.”
Such elaborate praises for Suchde and other individual athletes have been just about the only positive news coming out of the Commonwealth Games so far.
Preparations for the event have been riddled with political and social scandals and various other mishaps.
Several athletes have withdrawn from the Games, with one Australian participant leaving after he found a snake in his bedroom in the athlete village. Other competitors have also withdrawn citing general safety concerns, and it looks like their worries weren’t too farfetched.
In the past week and a half, a footbridge to one of the main venues collapsed, a part of the roof over the weightlifting arena caved in, and two tourists were shot outside of Jama Masjid, one of Old Delhi’s largest attractions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hey, this ain’t the MLB, kid. We only have five balls,” said one of the Harvard club baseball team members when a fan caught a foul ball and wanted to keep it.
When Harvard decided to get rid of junior varsity sports programs and transform them into club programs due to budget cuts, the Harvard club baseball team had to take on a good deal of the financial burden. The guys lost their coaches and had to schedule practices and games themselves. The Undergraduate Council Finance Committee gives the club baseball team $2,000, but it’s not enough to cover all of the squad’s equipment.
But these setbacks have not stopped the club from succeeding and coming together as a team. Even though it’s not a varsity sport, the team takes the practices and games just as seriously. The men are 7-1 so far for the fall season. It may sound crazy for a baseball team to already be playing games this early in the school year, but the squad plays a full season in both the fall and the spring.
Yesterday, the club baseball team continued its winning trend, defeating Holy Cross at O’Donnell Field, 6-3, in seven innings. Junior pitcher Stefan Botarelli struck out the first three batters he faced, and senior outfielder Nick Purcell caught two fly balls in one inning. Botarelli then hit a triple and stole home on the next play. Junior catcher Adam Arthurs also stepped up to the plate and played a phenomenal game.
Two weeks ago, the squad traveled to Yale for a double-header, crushing the Bulldogs in both games. The team plays mostly a mix of other club and junior varsity teams around the area, including the University of New Hampshire and Maine.
Even though the fall season is almost over, the men have the spring season to look forward to. They hope to continue their success, showing off all of the hard work they have put into the season in front of a crowd of their friends.
“I’ll bring you oranges during halftime,” one of the fans yelled to Botarelli.
“We don’t even have a halftime,” he responded.
Maybe now that the guys have found success on the field, they can work on teaching some of the fans more about the basics of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, there just isn’t a whole lot to cheer about.
The luckless, winless Buffalo Bills were smashed, 38-14, by the visiting New York Jets, marking the Bills’ second loss in a row with Harvard alum Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 at the helm.
The Jets, keyed by the play of LaDanian Tomlinson, had a 31-point lead going into the final quarter. Things got so out of hand that New York could afford to bring in Mark Brunell, who was born during the height of the Nixon Administration and whose prime probably came in 1999.
While Fitzpatrick’s passing was not as awful as Buffalo’s defense, it certainly wasn’t pretty. Completing only 44.4 percent of his attempts, the former Crimson quarterback threw for only 128 yards and had a passer rating of 83.6.
The Bills did manage to score two touchdowns. After connecting with wide receiver David Nelson for a 37-yard gain, the former Ivy League Player of the Year found tight end David Martin in the back of the endzone for the touchdown.
In the fourth quarter, with the game out of reach, Fitzpatrick’s 13-yard pass to wide receiver Steve Johnson gave Buffalo another seven points.
While Fitzpatrick didn’t have much success in the air, he did some damage on the ground, running for 74 yards on just seven attempts. His rushing abilities date back to his Harvard days. During his stint as the quarterback for the Crimson, Fitzpatrick ran for 1,487 yards. In fact, his 6,271 total yards are the most of anyone to ever don a Harvard uniform.

The quick and  dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
Early Saturday morning, about a dozen New Haven police officers stormed into a downtown New Haven nightclub where Yale’s Morse-Ezra Stiles College “screw” was held. Five students were arrested, and one sophomore was apparently Tasered.
The Yale Daily News, which broke the story, has reported that students have accused the New Haven officers of police brutality. From the YDN’s coverage, it seems that officials from both Morse and Stiles colleges are in the process of investigating what happened to their students, and a New Haven city hall spokeswoman said that the city will investigate any complaints of police brutality. In the meantime, you can watch this video of the raid.
Earlier this week, Princeton’s Whig-Cliosophic Society sponsored a debate about the ethics of meat eating that ended with a 75-35 vote against eating meat on any ethical grounds. Bruce Friedrich, PETA’s vice president for policy and government affairs—the same guy who allegedly streaked at a 2001 meeting of George W. Bush and Queen Elizabeth II with the words “go vegan” painted on his body—was in full form. From the Daily Princetonian: “If you believe unnecessary waste is unethical, adding to global poverty is unethical and causing cruelty to animals is unethical ... in order to align your ethics with your actions you should be choosing a vegetarian diet,” Friedrich said.
ROTC has generated a surprising amount of student support at Stanford. After the Stanford Review, the campus’s conservative weekly newsmagazine, voiced its support for the issue over the past few months, the Stanford Daily joined the Review’s bandwagon with an editorial that argued that “we as a society must hold our armed forces in the highest esteem” and it’s time “for Stanford to do the right thing and send the right message by allowing the ROTC back on campus.”

The fifth Monday of the term is tomorrow, which means it's your last chance to add or drop a course. You'll need the instructor's permission to add (but not to drop) a course, and you'll have to pay a $10 fee—still, if you're currently in a class that's driving you crazy, consider it a small investment for your sanity. You can also just change the course's grading status to pass/fail, which won't incur any fees.
Any and all forms will require your concentration adviser or sophomore/freshman advisor's signature. Get them in by 5 p.m. to the Registrar's Office!

It seems that degree we all work so hard for may not be worth the same to everyone. The country of Azerbaijan has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of a digitally-signed Harvard Kennedy School degree, according to a recent Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty blog post.
Bakhtiyar Hadjiyev, an Azerbaijani citizen and a graduate of HKS, applied to establish a newspaper in preparation for his campaign for the Azerbaijani parliament. Government approval is required for each of those things, and that approval is contingent upon proof of higher education.
According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the electronically signed master’s degree Hadjiyev submitted with his application was rejected because it did not have a traditional ink seal or stamp. All this even though the law of the land places electronically-signed documents on the same footing as handwritten ones.
