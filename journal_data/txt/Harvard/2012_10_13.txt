After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barack Obama wins three to one against Mitt Romney among those voters who say that health care is their primary concern, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health learned. Overall, with voters ranking health care as the second most important factor in determining their presidential choice for the first time since 1992, Obama’s lead among that category of voters may prove significant.
“With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we’ve started a debate about one of the biggest pieces of health care legislation in U.S. history,” said Robert J. Blendon, a School of Public Health professor who authored the study. “Because it’s so large and so controversial, it really has become a voting issue.”
Controversy over Obama’s 2010 health care legislation, combined with campaign trail talk about Medicare policy, shifted voters’ attention to the issue of health care, Blendon said.
With Romney pledging to repeal Obama’s Affordable Care Act and to follow his vice presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan’s plan to offer seniors a fixed voucher for either private insurance or Medicare, the divide between the candidates’ positions on health care seems stark.
“Suddenly, you have two candidates representing vastly different policies on different elements of health care, and voters are taking notice and beginning to choose sides. Three times to one, that side was with Obama,” Blendon said.
John M. Benson, a research scientist at the School of Public Health, said, “We are always interested in what role health care has in the election. We wanted to, in this case, look at the issues that have been in the campaign, which would be the ACA, Ryan’s Medicare proposal, block grants for Medicaid, and more restrictions on abortion—the big four health care issues...and to look at the people who said health care and Medicare specifically was going to alter their vote.”
To measure the significance of issues to the voters, Benson, Blendon, and their colleagues gathered polling data from citizens nationwide. After determining that a subject was registered and planning to vote in the 2012 election, poll administrators presented subjects with a list of issues: the economy and jobs, health care and Medicare, federal budget deficit and taxes, abortion, the war in Afghanistan, and immigration. They asked, “What is your single top issue when it comes to your choice of a presidential candidate?”
For 51 percent of the respondents, the economy and jobs was the most important issue. Health care and Medicare beat out the other options with 20 percent of votes.
Those who selected health care as their top issue were then presented with sets of issues that presidential candidates are talking about regarding nationwide health care and the candidates’ respective stances. Participants chose the specific decisions important to them.
The last time health care ranked as so many voters’ main concern was 20 years ago, when former President Bill Clinton ran in 1992 on implementing nationwide health insurance.
“Generally, the big issues in any election tend to be the economy in one form or another and if there’s any kind of foreign conflict, that’s the other issue,” Benson said. “Other domestic issues fit in when there aren’t wars or recessions, and this is why we see health care making a rise in prominence.”

With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than a month away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. First up is MIT.
When the Harvard men’s basketball team welcomes crosstown rival MIT to Lavietes Pavilion on Nov. 9, it will mark the second straight year the Crimson has opened its season against the Engineers.
MIT, which competes in the Division III NEWMAC Conference, dropped last year’s contest 76-49.
Although the Crimson dominated the matchup, forward Will Tashman, then a junior, posed problems for Harvard, scoring a team-high 16 points. Tashman was a crucial piece of the Engineers’ offense all season, averaging 11.5 points and 9.6 rebounds per contest.
Another key player for MIT will be senior guard Mitchell Kates, who in 2011 was named to the D3Hoops All-America fourth team after posting 14.2 points per game.
The Engineers saw unprecedented success last season, making it to the NCAA Division III Final Four for the first time in the program’s history and going 29-2 on the season (11-1 in conference play). MIT fell 71-56 in the semifinals to the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, which went on to win the national championship.
But last spring, the Engineers graduated two of their most talented seniors, and it is yet to be seen how they will adapt. Guard Jamie Karraker ’12 led the team with an MIT single-season record 111 three-pointers and was third in scoring averaging 12.6. Center Noel Hollingsworth ’12, who led MIT in scoring (17.2), is also gone.
Though the freshmen have big shoes to fill, the recruits show a lot of promise.  One standout is 6’10 rookie Lampros Tsontzos, who played for the Greek National U18 team and is known for his rebounding and shot blocking abilities. MIT will also look to freshman Ryan Frankel, who was voted New York City’s best guard in 2012 and tallied a total of 1,200 points in his high school career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With back-to-back wins this weekend at Cornell (6-12, 2-5 Ivy) and Columbia (8-8, 3-4 Ivy), the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-11, 4-3 Ivy) jumped into a tie for third place in the Ivy League.
This weekend’s strong showing against the Lions and the Big Red was in large part due to the Crimson’s balance and chemistry.
“I thought we all worked really well together,” said captain outside hitter Taylor Docter, who had 35 kills on the weekend. “I thought everyone did a fantastic job and really took care of their own job on the court and then it kind of came together. We all meshed really well.”
After starting the season 3-10 and 0-2 in the Ivy League, Harvard has now won four of its last five contests, all against Ivy League opponents, to turn its season around. This was the Crimson’s first weekend sweep of the season.
“Taking a weekend sweep is one of the best feelings,” Docter said. “I think it can only help us from here on out.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
Each set against the Lions was close, but the Crimson found a way to close out each frame, winning in straight sets, 25-23, 25-22, 25-20, in New York on Saturday.
Nine kills in the third set by Docter helped Harvard comfortably close out a successful weekend, but not every set came so easily for the Crimson.
“It was a really fun game,” Docter said. “I think [freshman setter] Hannah [Schmidt] and [senior setter] Beth [Kinsella] both set lights out which made my job really easy.
“[Sophomore outside hitter] Kristen Casey and [junior defensive specialist] Natalie Doyle’s passing were absolutely fantastic,” she added. “I had a great game, but I thought of it as due to how well everybody else was doing; that made my job really easy.”
With Harvard trailing 14-9 in the first set, it appeared unlikely that the Crimson would escape New York with a victory in straight sets.
But the Crimson fought back to win the first set and rarely trailed for the rest of the match.
“Even when the games are tight, if we were down by a couple points, we never felt like we weren’t going to win,” Casey said.
The second set was tight all the way, but after two consecutive Columbia points cut Harvard’s lead to 23-22, a Docter kill gave the Crimson a match point. Harvard converted and took a commanding 2-0 lead.
Earlier this season the Crimson struggled closing out matches, but Harvard’s strong play in recent matches has boosted the team’s confidence at the end of sets.
“I think a lot of times we were…kind of nervous about not winning,” Casey said. “I think now we’re kind of just trying to focus on keeping confident and calm… and it helps when you’re playing well for that.”
Docter had a double-double with 12 digs and a game-high 21 kills, and Casey led the game with 23 digs.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
After getting out to an early two-set lead, the Crimson dropped the third, but rebounded in the fourth to defeat the Big Red, 25-19, 25-23, 25-27, 25-20, on Friday night in Ithaca.
Late in the second set, with the score tied, 22-22, junior right side Erin Cooney stepped up and scored three kills in the last four points to give Harvard a commanding 2-0 lead.
The Crimson began to take control late in the first set, closing out the frame on a 12-2 run to grab the win after trailing, 13-17.
In the third set, Harvard came within four points of taking the match, 21-16, before Cornell closed out the frame on an 11-4 run to extend the match.
Neither team built a large lead in the fourth, but Harvard closed out the set on a 4-0 run to grab its first victory of the weekend.
Doyle recorded 13 digs on the night, matching her third highest mark on the year.
“[Doyle] brings a lot of energy, and I thought she had an amazing match on Friday,” Casey said. “She’s a great person to play next to.”
Docter led the Crimson with 14 kills, and Casey had a game-high 14 digs. Schmidt and Kinsella led the team with 19 assists each.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team started slowly Saturday, but by the second quarter, the team found its rhythm and pulled away from Bucknell for a 35-7 victory at Harvard Stadium.
After one period of play, the Crimson (5-0, 1-0 Ivy) held a tenuous 7-0 lead over the Bison (1-5, 0-2 Patriot), and that score only came after a Bucknell fumble near its own end zone set up an easy Harvard touchdown. In the first quarter, senior quarterback Colton Chapple was just 1-for-6 passing with an interception, and senior running back Treavor Scales had gained only 19 yards against the third-most effective run-defense in the FCS.
But in the span of just over five minutes in the second quarter, Harvard showed how it has put together what is now a 14-game winning streak, earning a top-25 ranking in the FCS in the process.
Eight minutes into the second quarter, a 14-yard touchdown pass from Chapple to junior Cam Brate capped a six-play, 71-yard drive that gave the home team some breathing room.
Less than two minutes later, the Crimson extended its lead to 21-0 as freshman wide receiver Andrew Fischer took a pitch from Scales 58 yards to the end zone on a double-reverse for his first career score.
"We felt like if we misdirect them, we’d get some big plays," Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. "When Seitu  [Smith] went out, we were looking for kind of an explosive guy that fit that role and Andy Fischer is a guy that looks like he’s 150 pounds soaking wet but pound-for-pound fights a couple weight classes up."
With just under two minutes left in the second quarter, Chapple threw his second touchdown pass, this time to senior Kyle Juszczyk, who broke four tackles on his way to a 59-yard catch-and-run that gave Harvard the 28-point lead going into the break.
"We went through some adjustments, and we knew the seams would be open," Juszczyk said. "So I was running a simple seam route, and Colton delivered a perfect ball once I got past the linebacker."
On the Crimson’s first drive of the second half, Chapple ran 59 yards for a touchdown that added an exclamation point to Harvard’s third straight victory by at least four touchdowns. Chapple finished the game with a career-high 120 yards running on eight carries.
"I didn’t know he had enough speed to finish that," Murphy said of Chapple’s scamper on a designed run. "The bottom line is we try to recruit quarterbacks who are athletes, guys who can run. It’s a lot harder to defend teams who can make plays with their feet."
As it became clear that Harvard was headed to another blowout, Chapple and the starters were pulled from their third straight contest. As a whole, the Crimson finished with 459 total offensive yards, largely due to the three plays for more than 50 yards a piece that gave Harvard a large cushion.
While the Crimson offense was clicking, the Bison were unable to get anything going on offense. Bucknell quarterback Brandon Wesley finished the day with 189 yards on 20-for-28 passing while facing constant pressure from a Harvard defensive line that tallied six sacks in the game.
"I don’t think they are an Ivy League defensive line," Bucknell coach Joe Susan said. "That defensive line would fit in in other leagues.... Those guys pose matchup problems. It’s the best defensive line in terms of performance [we’ve seen]."
The Bison got into the red zone one time in the first half, but the threat quickly ended when a Wesley pass was tipped by junior Josh Boyd and intercepted by junior Chris Splinter in the end zone.
On the first play of Bucknell’s next drive, junior safety Jaron Wilson recovered a Bison fumble forced by junior linebacker Matt Martindale. That play set up Harvard’s first touchdown of the contest.
The Bucknell offense didn’t reach the red zone again until the final minutes of the game, when Bison running back Jeremiah Young rushed for a one-yard score to spoil the Crimson’s bid for a shutout.
"The thing that we talked to our team about all the time is never stop playing," Susan said.
That was one of few highlights for the Bison running attack, which finished the game with 23 rushing yards.
"You won’t run the ball on us," sophomore Zach Hodges said. "That won’t happen."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lavietes Pavilion has been around since the Roaring Twenties, but Harvard basketball fans may soon be roaring in a brand new arena.
On Thursday night, senior associate director of Harvard Athletics Jeremy L. Gibson said at a Harvard-Allston task force meeting that a new basketball facility would be built between 2017 and 2022, replacing the Pavilion that has recently proven too small to suit a growing interest in the men’s basketball program.
“This is a master planning project, and what we’re trying to do is make sure we have things that might happen in the next 10 or 15 years in the mix,” Director of Athletics Bob Scalise said. “[But] it’s really too early to say. It’s such a preliminary scope out of what it would be right now, but it’s nice that [a new stadium is] being considered in the Allston plan.”
With a seating capacity of just 2,195, Lavietes is the second smallest arena in the Ivy League—with 95 more seats than Dartmouth’s Leede Arena—and one of the smallest in the country among Division I teams.
Accompanying the Crimson’s rise to the top of the Ivy League over the past two seasons has been an increase in ticket sales. Harvard sold out 12 of its 14 home games last season—with tickets to the biggest contests often selling for high prices on online marketplaces—leading many to point to the need for a larger arena.
“I think every coach would like to see facilities improve,” Harvard  coach Tommy Amaker said.  “We’re all in the same boat when it comes to  that. It happens every so  often and you need the donors and those  things to step forward.”
In addition to calling for the construction of a larger basketball stadium, Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan also includes a new building for executive education, renovations to several Business School buildings, the creation of a hotel and conference center, and a renovation of the Soldier’s Field Housing Project. Gibson also said that Harvard Stadium, the oldest football stadium in the country, would be renovated.
“[The Allston expansion] has been in the works for a while, and obviously it’s been put on hold somewhat over the past few years, but it’s exciting not just for the basketball possibility of that but [for] all the other things that are mentioned too,” said men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker. “[This] expansion will make this environment that much better for all of our students, employees, and faculty.”
In addition to being one of the smallest stadiums in the nation, Lavietes is also one of the most aged. First opened in 1926, it is tied with Oregon’s McArthur Court as the second-oldest facility still used for basketball, behind only Fordham’s Rose Hill Gymnasium, which opened two years earlier.
“Given the age of the facility and the size of it, [a new stadium is] something that definitely should be in the mix,” Scalise said.
Originally named the Briggs Center, Lavietes was initially home to Harvard’s indoor track teams, and its batting cages were a favorite of a number of collegiate and professional baseball players, including Ted Williams.
Following the 1981 construction of the Gordon Indoor Track and Tennis facility, the building was refurbished as the new home of Harvard basketball, replacing the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson’s first contest at the facility was on Nov. 27, 1982 against MIT, and it has played every home game there since.
In March 1996, the building was renamed after Ray Lavietes ’36, a former player who made a $2.1 million contribution to the arena’s second refurbishing project in the mid-90s.
The Crimson has enjoyed an enormous amount of success on its home court of late, going 25-1 there over the past two seasons. It had the second-longest home winning streak in the country at 28 games—behind only national champion Kentucky—before it fell to Penn in its final home contest of the season last year.
Amaker said that when combined with the program’s recent success, the possibility of a new arena could help attract “even higher level recruits.”
“There are a lot of things that are part of that plan, [so] it’s nice to find out that maybe we can be included in that,” he added. “It’s a long way off, but certainly it’s nice that these things will take shape at some point for our campus as a whole.”

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient  Eight (and other schools too).
Though Tigers in years past have chosen to poke fun at Harvard students for our less-than-universal access to hot breakfast, they're not laughing anymore. Now, in fact, they wish they were us. A recent news story in the "Daily Princetonian" berated Princeton's lack of a shopping period at the start of the semester, listing Harvard as the primary example of a place that does it right. We may not get to eat pork rolls for breakfast, but who needs those when we can use all the money we're saving on add/drop fees and spend it on hot breakfast in the Square?
Down in New Haven, they're counting the days till the first of their two—yes, you read that right, two—fall  breaks. After deciding the fall semester was just too long (and coming  up with some numbers to justify the extra time off), Yale added a mini-recess at the end of October to its academic calendar. Alas, it looks as though Yalies may need to  use that extra time to get ahead on readings and assignments before the  administration starts cracking down on grade inflation.  In any event, we'll catch you at The Game, friends. Or, um, that  sporting event on the first day of your second fall break. Whatever.
Cornell is determined to prove that Lupe Fiasco is not talking about them in his new song "Hood Now (Outro)" when he credits "Cornel[l]" with making the Ivy League hood (at about  1:22). Instead, they maintain, he is talking only about former Harvard  professor Cornel West.  "Although the University was founded much later than the other members  of  the Ancient Eight," they write, "it was never 'let into' the league,  but rather  established the conference with the other Ivies in 1954." Cornell is a  real Ivy League school, you guys! Meanwhile, Cornell with two "l's,", take that hurt; make it into songs.
In other news, it looks as though Emma Watson, enigmatic as ever  when it comes to her educational status, may well be on her way back into the Ivy League. Let's hope she doesn't get too famous to stay this time.

There are so many shows, performances, and galleries in and around Harvard Square that sometimes it's hard to know where to start—so the arts blog is here for you. We've compiled a list of interesting (and nearby) events happening this weekend to satisfy your craving for art.
Saturday 10/13
Food Truck Throwdown, The Rose F. Kennedy Greenway, Boston, 11 a.m.–9 p.m.
In the battle for the coveted title of "Best Food Truck," the real winner is you—because you get food.

It'll be overseen by a panel of celebrity judges that includes NECN's Jenny Johnson.
Community Garden Harvest Festival, Community Garden, 27 Holyoke Place, 1 p.m.–4 p.m.
That garden in front of Lowell House is usually empty, but on Saturday there will be a community festival celebrating the end of the summer growing season. Activities include cider pressing, pumpkin carving, live music, chef demos, and more.
Tango By Moonlight's 16th Anniversary, Weeks Footbridge, 7:30 p.m.–11 p.m.
Tango By Moonlight, a free event showcasing the Argentine tango, will celebrate its 16th anniversary on Saturday. Newcomers can take 15-minute mini-lessons before dancing the night away on the Weeks Footbridge or just stay and watch the fun happen by the Charles River.
Sunday 10/14

Late-night Lamonsters are in luck. Following a pilot program last spring, Lamont Library will stay open 24/7 during reading period and exam period this academic year, College administrators announced Thursday.
This December, Lamont will keep its doors open from 9 a.m. on Dec. 2 until 5 p.m. on Dec. 21, the last day of exam period.
Administrators said that informal counts by Lamont staff members during last spring's extended hours indicated that demand was sufficient to justify continuing staying open 24/7 for the end of the semester.
“Students voted with their feet,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in a statement. “We’re really pleased that we can respond to that demand by making Lamont available again this semester for late-night studying.”
Michael George '14, chair of the Undergraduate Council's Student Life Committee, called the move "a very, very welcome step."
George, who is also a Crimson news editor, said his committee, which conducted an online student survey gauging student interest in extending Lamont hours last spring, plans to continue exploring the possibility of keeping Lamont open 24/7 year-round.
Here's hoping Lamont's extended hours this December will inspire more of this.

You can recognize them by the crimson buttons proudly displayed on their chests—parents have been flooding into the yard since early Friday morning. Freshman Parents Weekend is finally here.
Many students may rejoice at the opportunity of spending some time with their parents, from whom they parted two long months ago. But for others, Parents Weekend signals a last minute room cleaning session and a low-key Friday night.
Despite the rich compilation of events designed by the Office of Student Life, it might be hard to choose what to do. Here are five things freshmen and parents should not miss.
1.  It's Getting Cold. In Need of Warm Clothes?
You have just left home and experienced two months of tough Harvard life. Your parents will naturally be inclined to spoil you. Take advantage of it! Winter is coming and no one wants to be caught in Cambridge without a good winter coat and sturdy pair of gloves. Take the T or rent a ZipCar to do some fall shopping.
2. Take a Break from Annenberg
In spite of the tempting welcome banners on Annenberg's entrance, there's really no reason why you should eat there with your parents—they can see the interior in pictures. Take a break from the d-hall menus and try out some restaurants in the Square.
3. Art at Harvard
Take your family to one of the night events offered on Saturday. If you are looking for something fun, the improv show by the Immediate Gratification Players is for you. If your parents are into music, take them to the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra Concert tonight.
5. We're (Sort Of) a Sports School!
The Class of 2016 Luncheon at the Gordon Indoor Track promises another break from Annenberg, and the football team is currently undefeated, making Saturday's match against Bucknell a must-see.  Who says we don't have school spirit?
After sending your parents off, come back to earth. It's time to study.
