After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of five Harvard alumni are running for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, on an unconventional ticket: eliminate undergraduate tuition and make public how Harvard considers race in its admissions practices.
The group—which includes former presidential candidate, environmental activist, and Harvard Law School alumnus Ralph Nader—calls itself “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” a name that evokes its two-pronged platform. The candidates  argue Harvard’s endowment, which grew to $37.6 billion last fiscal year, is large enough to allow the University to stop charging undergraduates for tuition. The group also calls into question Harvard’s admissions practices, which they contend may be discriminatory against Asian-American applicants, and demands more detailed data about how Harvard ultimately selects students.
Ron K. Unz ’83, the campaign’s organizer and spokesperson, said a free College education would combat the perception that only wealthy students can afford to attend Harvard.
Unz, an outspoken conservative and Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said he decided to create a campaign for the Overseers because he thought Harvard had not been responsive to concerns he raised in columns for the New York Times and elsewhere, in which he criticized Harvard’s high tuition costs and what he alleges are admissions quotas against Asian students.
The group’s formation is recent; Unz said he recruited the other candidates within the past three weeks.  Joining Unz and Nader on the slate are physicist Stephen D. Hsu, conservative writer Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., and NewEgg’s Chief Legal Officer Lee C. Cheng ’93, all of whom have previously argued against race-based affirmative action.
Most Overseer candidates are nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association—they nominated eight this year— but the organization did not nominate any members of the slate.  Still, the group will qualify to run in the Overseers elections this spring if each member gains a certain number of Harvard alumni signatures. Anyone with a Harvard degree can vote for Overseers, a body currently composed of 30 members who each serve six-year terms.
In a statement challenging the platform, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that Harvard has a “generous” financial aid program. More than 60 percent of Harvard undergraduates receive some form of aid, and families who make $65,000 or less each year pay nothing for tuition, room, and board, according to Neal. He emphasized the complicated and segmented nature of the endowment, writing that Harvard cannot and would not liquidate parts of its funds.
“There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard’s, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available,” Neal wrote. “In reality, Harvard’s flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it must be maintained in perpetuity and that it is largely restricted by the explicit wishes of those who contributed the endowed funds.”
Still, if elected to the Board of Overseers, the group says it would “demand the immediate elimination of all tuition for undergraduates,” according to its initial platform. That move could make a Harvard education appear more attainable to students from lower-income families, according to Unz.
“If Harvard eliminated tuition, very quickly almost everyone in America would know about it, and a lot of less affluent families...would suddenly consider Harvard for the first time,” Unz said.
Harvard College’s Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue holds a different view. In an interview last fall, she contended that eliminating tuition for all students would diminish Harvard’s resources and offer a free education to students whose families could actually afford to pay the sticker price.
Echoing the allegations of an ongoing lawsuit against Harvard, the group of candidates also argues that the College’s admissions processes set illegal quotas on applicants of Asian descent. In its platform, the group demands “greater transparency in the admissions process, which today is opaque and subject to hidden favoritism and abuse.”
Edward Blum, a conservative advocate leading the lawsuit against the College, praised the group’s stance. In its anti-affirmative action arguments, Blum’s initial complaint against Harvard cites Cheng, a member of the group of candidates and the founder of the Asian American Legal Foundation.
“It is gratifying to see the momentum to end racial classifications and preferences in admissions at Harvard is growing among Harvard alumni,” Blum wrote in an email. Several Asian American organizations and alumni have also received the campaign’s platform enthusiastically, according to Unz.
Harvard has repeatedly defended the legality and necessity of considering race in college admissions; University President Drew G. Faust publicly pledged a “vigorous defense” against the lawsuit last September. In his statement, Neal also defended Harvard’s admissions practices as vital to an undergraduate education.
“Harvard College’s admissions policies are essential to the pedagogical objectives that underlie its educational mission and are fully compliant with the law,” Neal wrote.
The deadline for petitioning to run for an Overseer position is February 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the halfway point of ECAC play, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team finds itself in a familiar spot near the top of the standings.
With a conference record of 7-3-1 (10-4-1 overall), the No. 8/9 Crimson sits eight points behind first-place Quinnipiac (17-1-4, 10-1-3 ECAC), but Harvard has three games in hand by virtue of the two squads’ differing schedules this past month.
The No. 4/4 Bobcats are not playing conference games this weekend, giving the Crimson a golden opportunity to make up ground in the standings. To earn the points it needs, however, Harvard will have to travel to upstate New York for two difficult matches at St. Lawrence and No. 5/5 Clarkson.
“We got two wins against two good opponents last weekend to get the year started, so we’re hoping to build on that this weekend,” said Crimson defenseman and captain Michelle Picard. “The opponents are even tougher, so it should be an exciting weekend of hockey for us.”
No. 8/9 Harvard at St. Lawrence
The Crimson starts off the weekend Friday night (7 p.m.) against the Saints (11-10-1, 5-5-0) at Appleton Arena in Canton, N.Y.
Despite St. Lawrence’s middle-of-the-road standing in the ECAC, the Saints have always given Harvard a challenge. Dating back to the 2011-2012 season, seven of the past eight matchups between the two teams have been decided by a goal or less (including two ties).
This Friday, St. Lawrence will be looking to avenge a close loss back in October, when the Crimson emerged with a 3-2 win in Cambridge. The Saints actually outshot Harvard, 30-19, in that encounter, and will aim to capitalize on more of their chances this time around.
To counter, the Crimson will likely call on leading goal-scorer and Preseason All-ECAC senior forward Miye D’Oench for the second time. D’Oench had a memorable performance last time out against the Saints, scoring one shorthanded goal and another on the power play to lead her team to the win.
“We have a better idea of what to expect from them this time, but our game plan is pretty much the same,” D’Oench said. “Both teams have improved a lot since October, so it’ll be pretty different from the last time we lined up against them.”
Senior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, a four-year starter and fellow Preseason All-ECAC honoree, is another player who is key to Harvard’s hopes on Friday. Despite splitting games last weekend against Brown and Yale, St. Lawrence has recently been hot offensively, outshooting the Bears, 42-15, and the Bulldogs, 34-22.
No. 8/9 Harvard at No. 5/5 Clarkson
Clarkson, much like Harvard, will be looking to make up ground in the ECAC standings when the two teams face off Saturday afternoon (4 p.m.) at Cheel Arena in Potsdam, N.Y. The Golden Knights (17-3-2, 5-3-2) sit directly behind the Crimson at fourth place in the ECAC, three points back of Harvard with a game in hand.
The matchup between the two teams who shared the regular season conference championship last year has historically been a great one. The last four games have all been decided by a goal or less—including two ties, but the Crimson has not emerged victorious since 2013.
Both squads have momentum on their side heading into the clash, as Harvard outscored Cornell and then-No. 10/- Colgate by a combined 8-2 margin last weekend, while Clarkson did even better, dispatching Yale and Brown by a combined 12-2.
The Golden Knights have been boosted the entire year by a strong offense, which averages an ECAC-leading 3.59 goals per game.
“One of their main strengths is that their defense is also an offensive threat,” D’Oench said, “We need to not just contain their forwards but also block outside shots and angle their defensemen well.”
Senior defenseman Erin Ambrose leads the charge for Clarkson, as she ranks among the ECAC’s top 10 point-getters in conference play despite being a blue-liner.
Picard, the anchor of the Crimson defense, can be confident, however, knowing that her team has been one of only two squads all season to keep the Golden Knights scoreless. The two played to a 0-0 tie the last time they met at the end of October.
“We know we can contain them if we just play our game,” Picard said. “We need to play to our strengths and use our speed to put pressure on them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off two heartbreaking losses, the No. 7/8 Harvard men’s hockey team will take the ice against No 18/- St. Lawrence and Clarkson in the familiar confines of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center starting on Friday. Beat writer Kurt Bullard has three things to watch for in the Crimson’s weekend slate.

OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT
The Crimson (8-3-3, 4-2-3 ECAC) has played its last four games under the microscope of a wide audience. Harvard’s two wins in Minneapolis at the 25th Annual Mariucci Classic resulted in the team bringing home hardware to Cambridge. Its next two contests came against high-profile programs—crosstown rival No. 10/10 Boston University and No. 2/1 Quinnipiac, with Harvard taking on the latter in the Big Apple. Both games resulted in nail-biting losses for the Crimson, and they involved a stretch of play between games where Harvard conceded seven goals in just under 17 minutes.
Harvard’s slate this weekend, however, is rather vanilla when it comes to conference play. St. Lawrence (10-8-2, 4-3-1) sits fifth in the ECAC, two points behind the Crimson having played one less game. Yet the Saints enter the weekend having dropped three games in a row, including one to cellar-dwellar Clarkson (9-9-2, 1-5-2), whom Harvard will cap off the weekend against on Saturday. Neither visitor boasts a star scorer, with no players on either side ranking in the top 12 in goals or points scored this season. This weekend offers an alternative to the high-pressure games that the Crimson has played over the past two weeks.
QUESTIONS BETWEEN THE PIPES
In the Crimson’s last two contests, two different goalies have given up at least five goals apiece. First came sophomore Merrick Madsen, who surrendered six goals on 30 shots in a 6-5 loss to BU. Freshman netminder Michael Lackey followed that up by conceding four goals on the first 12 shots he faced against Quinnipiac, a start that shadowed his 21-shot save streak that allowed the team to come back and force overtime.
It remains to be seen who will skate out to the crease to start Friday against the aptly-named Saints, but a defensive performance similar to the one shown during last weekend’s slate of games might hand the team its third loss in as many contests. Madsen is the most likely candidate to get the nod—even though the Flyers prospect has given up 11 goals in the last three games he’s played, he started off the season hot. The sophomore surrendered only seven goals in his first seven games and is a large part of why the team concedes 2.16 goals per game on average.
A SUSTAINABLE OFFENSIVE PACE?
Harvard finds twine at the sixth highest rate in the nation and the highest in the conference, averaging 3.93 goals per game. Four players on the team—including senior Colin Blackwell and junior Alexander Kerfoot—average at least a point per game, with freshman Ryan Donato two points shy of that mark. Co-captains Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo round out the point-a-game crowd, having logged a combined 39 points through 14 games.
The offense so far has been able to cover up a struggling defense still searching for an identity following the departures of defensemen Patrick McNally and Max Everson. But this type of production will unlikely be able to mask the Crimson’s defensive woes if the squad wishes to venture deep into the ECAC and NCAA tournaments.
