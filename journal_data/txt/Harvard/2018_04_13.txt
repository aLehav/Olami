After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some horror movies, like Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining” and Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” hinges on a character’s gradual spiral into madness in order to terrify. Some, like Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” and Bryan Forbes’ “The Stepford Wives,” make a psychological thriller out of a social satire. And some, like Andy Muschietti’s “It,” lean on an antagonist whose physical appearance alone paralyzes viewers with fear. “Atlanta’s” sixth episode, “Teddy Perkins,” is a Frankenstein monster that combines these three approaches, a masterpiece that will likely become known as “Atlanta”’s best episode. The episode opens innocuously enough: Darius goes to a convenience store looking for “dehydrated mango, ginger… Jicama, perhaps,” and leaves with a red, Confederate-flag adorned hat that he proceeds to color in to spell “U MAD.” It’s the Darius episode we—and Theodore Perkins—have all been waiting for.
In “Teddy Perkins,” as in “Helen,” the show makes clear references to “Get Out.” It is not without its usual celebrity shade—”You know, we got Jay-Z. He’s, like 65,”—or its endless allusions of Alfred’s growing fame—”Paper Boi!” a fast-food server exclaims, wanting a photo of the rising star—but its cinematic nature evokes the film it so clearly takes inspiration from. In both the episode and the film, Lakeith Stanfield plays a black man soon to be held hostage in a mansion, and the mansion’s owner is a wealthy white man who is obsessed with black people. Stanfield even gets photographed with flash, though in this case, he doesn’t wake up to realize the situation he’s been forced into. When he drives to Theodore “Teddy” Perkins’ home in response to an ad for a free, multicolored key piano, Darius finds himself stuck in a mind-game of checkers, the loser of which might end up dead.
“Is Teddy the white dude or the black dude?” Alfred asks over the phone, the Rod to Darius’ Chris. Trick question: Teddy is both. Despite what the credits may say, Donald Glover goes all out in whiteface to play Teddy, a ghastly anomaly of a man. Even without the physical performance Glover gives, Teddy is eerily unnatural: “Darius would like a glass of water when you have a moment,” he speaks in what Darius assumes is a call to a butler but is actually a recorder Teddy uses to “remember things.” He cracks open a soft-boiled ostrich egg, before swirling his fingers through the oozing mess. And most crucially, he has a brother Benny who is too allergic to sunlight to live independently, a struggle Teddy insists Darius can never understand.
Glover’s dedication to the role makes the performance and, by extension, the episode. In an exercise in method acting, Glover never broke character on set, staying in whiteface the entire time while filming the episode. His eyes pierce through the prosthetics of his appearance, as uncannily unmoving as the rest of his waxy, post-’80s-Michael-Jackson-esque face. His body, at once too small for his head and disproportionately large for his hands, moves with a slow smoothness that belies his ominous intentions. His voice, as uncomfortably high-pitched as a creaking door, chills in its near-monotony. “I don’t think Teddy even exists, bro,” Darius tells Alfred, and he’s not entirely wrong.
The episode plays close attention to detail, and it wants its audience to do the same. The nearly 40-minute long, commercial-free episode opens and closes with a Stevie Wonder song—“Sweet Little Girl” and “Evil,” respectively—mirroring the episode’s trajectory. Wonder is referenced during the episode’s emotionally fraught climax. “Stevie had his own sacrifices. He was blind,” Teddy whitesplains to Darius. “Yeah, but he wasn’t blinded. He saw through his music,” Darius counters. The exchange reminds us of Darius’ past wisdoms, but its tone gets more at what “Atlanta: Robbin’ Season” is really about more than anything else has so far: A struggle to see the familiar through fresh eyes.

35 years ago, alt-rock band R.E.M. released their debut album, “Murmur.” Six years later, Rolling Stone Magazine called them “America’s Best Rock & Roll Band." In 1983, when “Murmur” came out, “Karma Chameleon,” “Billie Jean,” “Flashdance…What a Feeling,” “Let’s Dance,” and “Every Breath You Take” were the biggest hit singles. R.E.M’s jangly sound is decidedly unlike that of their contemporaries, among whom stand Michael Jackson and The Police. Instead, the album’s sound is mellow and instrument-focused.
The Georgia-based band’s lead singer, Michael Stipe, lets his accent show through his notably mumbled or slurred words. In a 1989 interview with Rolling Stone, R.E.M.’s lead guitarist Peter Buck said, “We were conscious that we were making a record that really wasn't in step with the times... It was an old-fashioned record that didn't sound too much like what you heard on the radio.” The album’s energy rarely rises very high, and its songs give way to jumping somewhat more than dancing. It has a sparseness to it: The songs generally maintain their feeling of quietude. From our current musical standpoint, R.E.M.’s sound no longer feels radical. After 35 years, the band is such a household name that their songs regularly appear in television shows and movies. In other words, they are far from niche. But when they first emerged onto the scene, their genre was somewhat undefined and hazy. Both their music and aesthetic incorporate bits of folk, rock, pop, and post-punk, making them both unique and a bit familiar at the same time. R.E.M.’s music is in part a blend of styles that already exist, and in shifting our gaze, it reinvents the way we look at these genres.
Right off the bat, “Murmur” is enigmatic. Its first song, “Radio Free Europe,” is almost impossible to understand. Stipe immediately surprises by singing in a mumble about media and freedom of speech in Europe. This sets the tone—“Murmur” is not an album full of love songs or heartbreak anthems. Much of it is about freedom, imprisonment, war, and making your voice heard. Its melodies aren’t dirge-like by any means, but the lyrics are often pessimistic: In “Talk About the Passion,” Stipe mumbles, “Empty prayer, empty mouths / …Not everyone can carry the weight of the world.” In “Moral Kiosk," the chorus reads “It’s so much more attractive / Inside the moral kiosk / Inside cold dark fire twilight.” The rest of the album isn’t any lighter. Gallows, scythes, tears, and horrific childhoods all come to mind as the songs continue. “Murmur” is cryptic and heavy—if you can make out what the words are.
Although the album carries a quietness with it, it is rarely silent. All instruments fire at all times, and it’s often hard to pick apart what exactly you hear. The instruments are identifiable, but deciphering what each one does is difficult, a testament to the album’s lo-fi quality: It has a staticky haze that goes undetected unless a listener is seeking it out, like white noise; it has a muffling effect, enhancing the album’s roughness in the days when grunge had yet to blossom musically; it follows well with the album—and band’s—theme. The indecipherable singing, cryptic lyrics, overlapping instruments, and the sound that didn’t fit perfectly into any genre 35 years ago all combine to create R.E.M.’s mysterious, or at least complicated, air.
It may be harder for those of us who are college-aged (including myself) or younger to understand the significance of the album’s release. With its spontaneous yet purposeful quality, its one-take recording on many songs, and even its odd cover with a giant thistly plant, “Murmur” feels unique. Next to the neon and synths we so often remember when we look back at the '80s, R.E.M.’s grayness helps them stand out. At the same time, it can be easy to let each song blend together. When the instruments and lyrics are all so interwoven, the gaps between songs grows smaller. The R.E.M. “sound” is so specific that it’s easy to write all songs off as similar. But there’s a reason why “Murmur” received so much acclaim and is still held as one of their greatest albums. It is raw, rough, and one of the oldest remnants of a band that no longer exists.

Not even Monday blues keep EDEN fans from packing the House of Blues in Boston on April 2. Born Jonathan Ng, the Irish singer kicked off his "vertigo" tour last month to promote his newest album. Ng debuted his first EP in 2013 as “The EDEN Project.” When the name stuck, Ng dubbed himself “EDEN.” He produced another two EPs, “End Credits” and “i think you think too much of me,” but “vertigo,” released in January, is his first album.
As he embarks on his first big tour, it is clear EDEN is still adjusting to being in the limelight The lighting in the first few songs allowed only the silhouette and shadow of his figure to cross the stage, and even as he emerged into more lighting, his face remained largely concealed in the dark. Additionally, his voice was initially enshrouded in the layers of bass and electronica sounds, his uncertainty further emphasized in the lyrics of his opening song, “wrong:" “Have I lost sight of everything I’ve worked for?/ Did I get this all wrong?” Despite the doubt characteristic of both his stance and words, his voice exuded a sense of confidence and reassurance: a soft blend of the two, with a touch of hoarseness, his voice felt unique and poignant.
His setlist combines “vertigo” tracks and singles from previous EPs. EDEN holds off on some of his more established and older songs until later in the concert, keeping the audience anxious by saving “Wake Up” for the encore. More disappointing, however, is his exclusion of old hits like “drugs” and “XO, ” making the concert feel incomplete without his established repertoire.
The flashing light rods sticking out of the front of the stage resemble a visual interpretation of a sound meter. The colors of the lights match the tonal color of the sound:in “fumes,” orange and red colors flare up the stage, an intensifying compliment the heavy guitar; In another soulful guitar-heavy song, blue lights create an electrified representation of water in “wave,” an unreleased single  that’s an extended part of “crash,” a song on “vertigo.” EDEN stands under a single spotlight in “lost//found,” his voice shining clearly. His head hangs low, and all the attention in the room fixes on him. The end is the most poignant moment, as his plea, “I don’t wanna be left alone,” drifts off into a void before the audience erupts into cheers and applause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long push for a bridge program to ease the transition to Harvard for freshmen coming from under-resourced schools and first-generation and low-income backgrounds, the College announced a pre-orientation program for students coming from marginalized communities. This program will run from August 23 to August 26 and is part of a two-year pilot program. It has been named the First-Year Retreat and Experience, and it will be limited to 100 students.
While we think this is a step in the right direction, we believe Harvard is lagging behind in its pursuit of helping under-resourced students adjust to college life in a well-managed, comprehensive, and enjoyable way. Harvard prides itself on the diversity of students. While efforts to accept students from marginalized backgrounds are getting better, there is not enough support once they arrive here.
We’ve seen plenty of other colleges take steps to bridge the gap for incoming freshmen from marginalized communities. Yale offers a bridge program that focuses on issues of race and on aiding racially marginalized groups, particularly students of color, in the transition to college. Called “Cultural Connections,” it consists of an extensive set of activities that include panels by faculty on academic expectations, and conversations with faculty members with expertise in the areas of ethnicity, nationality, and race. Furthermore, it also helps bridge the gap students in these marginalized communities face by familiarizing them with financial, academic, and social resources that can help them throughout their first year.
As another example, Wesleyan has a pre-orientation program dedicated to another under-resourced group: first-generation college students. The program allows participants to hear from current first-generation students, build up study techniques, learn about resources available to them at Wesleyan, and partake in fun activities to build community. Indeed, Harvard’s peers are ahead of us. The creation of FYRE is step in the right direction to remedying this.
Nevertheless, we are concerned that the program will conflict with other programs for new students that are vital in helping all students form a community. We encourage student organizers and the Freshman Dean’s Office and soon-to-be-created Dean of Students Office to make their best efforts to help students have the opportunity to engage in other pre-orientation programs in addition to FYRE. Students should not have to choose between a bridge program and another pre-orientation opportunity; they should be able to have both.
Furthermore, Harvard should be highly appreciative of the students who put so much time into conceiving and organizing FYRE. However, we hope that the administration will take more responsibility in shifting the burden off of students. Other schools have programs to help transition students over the entire summer. Harvard is only offering students four days. There is no way that the educational gap can be bridged in such a short amount of time. We hope there are efforts to expand FYRE in the future to look more like other examples that have already been set.

It’s hard to miss Lowell House’s most recent set of renovations. Beneath the blanket of green tarps, we can see Harvard’s customary neo-Georgian aesthetic, Flemish bond brick, and paned-glass windows. If Lowell is any indicator, Adams House, Harvard’s next target in its River House renewals, will bow architecturally and unapologetically to the past. Lowell House and Adams House represent a 1930s era effort to capture the stylized Georgian architecture of Harvard Yard erected at the school’s founding circa 1720. “What’s wrong with that?” the Cambridge Historical Commission might haughtily query. Quite a bit, actually.  One would hope that the cloud of nostalgia surrounding Harvard “as it was” has by now been blown away by a cold gust of historical reality that has exposed the exclusion, inequality and opacity of the past.  As Harvard modernizes its values and aspires toward inclusion, equality and transparency, should the University’s architectural composition not mirror this change?
As Harvard completes the Lowell project and works through its designs for the Adams renovation, the University should seriously consider moving past its neo-Georgian fixation and updating its architectural approach. It is crucial that we build physical structures that reflect and and even amplify a more progressive outlook. Our buildings should reflect our contemporary values, inspiring occupants to feel included, welcome and connected to one another. We should dare to create distinctly 21st century spaces rather than letting the campus be defined solely by its history.
In expanding its undergraduate housing Yale serves as an excellent example of what not to do. At Yale’s new Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin Colleges, the school chose to duplicate, almost to a tee, the Gothic architectural stylings of its past. This choice, whether by intention or not, signals backward-looking priorities and values. Clinging to an architectural style of a bygone era that perpetuates an aura of elitism and exclusion, the private courtyards and hulking towers create a fortress-like divide between the campus and the city of New Haven, a separation emphasizing the stark divide between a predominantly lower-income community of color and the elite world of Yale.
While Yale is mired in the architectural design strategies of the past, the University of Pennsylvania’s New College House, completed in 2016, provides an excellent example of an elite university designing for a modern era. The sloping public field at its center, green roof, and extensive public walkways, reinforce, rather than undermine, values of inclusion and transparency. Inspiration can also be found closer to home in the notably avant-garde structures at MIT. In the creative patchwork of windows and sponge-like structure that comprise MIT’s Simmons Hall combined with the unmistakable form of Frank O. Gehry’s famous Stata Center, MIT’s architectural aesthetic pushes the viewer to break with normal preconceptions of elite New England academic institutions to recognize the cutting-edge nature of the University.
But Harvard doesn’t need to look to other schools for inspiration—our own campus is home to groundbreaking modern buildings that signaled the arrival of globalism in the postwar era. Harvard’s architectural victories include the Carpenter Center, the Design Research Building in Harvard Square, and Hilles Library, exciting modern counterpoints to older and more historic structures. Sadly, there have also been several notable missteps. The Harvard Science Center and the Smith Holyoke Campus Center, both designed by architect and former Dean of the Graduate School of Design Josep Lluis Sert, feel drab and over-scaled rather than forward-facing and innovative.
It’s more difficult, of course, to express modern values in the context of renovating a historic complex like Adams House. But it isn’t impossible. To promote inclusion, Harvard could cut away the house’s imposing entryway to create a new set of transparent gathering spaces that are open to the Cambridge community—reversing Harvard’s usual inward focus.
Germany’s parliament building, the 1894 Reichstag, shows how such a reversal is possible. In renovating the building, architect Norman R. Foster created a viewing platform for the public in the place of the former dome, directly above the parliament chambers: The government operates only under the watchful eye of democracy. Perhaps, if the right architect were hired and the school were willing to take a risk, something similar could happen at Adams House—providing the future undergraduates who will live there with a more expansive view of the world.
Many will balk at the idea of reimagining undergraduate living quarters that are nostalgically associated with a certain idea of Harvard’s identity. But as the Reichstag shows, a contemporary approach doesn’t need to mean erasing history. It can instead mean the introduction of new, contrasting elements that prompt the building’s residents to see its history in a new light. Interiors can be updated, and portions of the building’s masonry structure—currently hidden by decoration—could be exposed. Small additions could be built in leftover spaces like the courtyard, with new outdoor spaces created through a green roof above.
Architects can work out the design specifics. But as they do so, they shouldn’t forget that our buildings need to evolve along with our identity. In the end, our architecture reflects who we are: our aspirations, our values, and our forward-facing vision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before we had Wale at Yardfest 2018, we had Wale at Yardfest 2010. And though Yardfest has a complicated history, some things—like Wale—have remained the same.
Before Yardfest, we had Springfest. From 1994 until 2006—when Yardfest got its name and came under the purview of the College Events Board—the Undergraduate Council planned an annual event called Springfest. The event featured a number of festivities missing today—carnival games, dunk tanks, sumo wrestling, jousting, and free beer.
Since conception, Yardfest has sought to unify the college student body. In reference to the goals of the first ever Springfest, one organizer said it was designed to be “one day when everyone at Harvard from gov jocks to pre-meds puts aside their work, leaves their rooms, and comes to the Yard where we all started off.”
The idea that Yardfest creates monolithic unity among undergraduates is only partially true. Even though thousands of undergrads come together for Yardfest, we arrive there from wildly different places—some from final clubs, others from kickbacks in our dorms. Yardfest should be used as time to bridge these divides. But even the debates around music selection undercuts this project.
Music has been a staple of the event since 1995 when several local bands were invited to play. Though initially a grab bag of nationally relevant artists (Violent Femmes in 1999) and in-house performers (purely student acts in 1998 and 2001), recent years have brought bigger names to Harvard. Today, Yardfest is all about the headliner.
Choosing a headliner has never been a simple task. In 2002, the UC was considering OutKast for Springfest. In an email to the UC president, Associate Dean of the College David P. Illingworth wrote that “their language may not be acceptable for many audiences, and also that, reportedly, Rosa Parks once sued the group. These comments cause me to worry that OutKast may not be the best group for the Concert Commission to bring to campus.”
Most recently, and perhaps notoriously, over 1,000 students protested Tyga’s 2013 Yardfest performance because of his “explicitly and violently misogynistic” lyrics. The complaints prompted administrators to ask the CEB to reconsider their selection, while not forcing student organizers into anything. Though Tyga was ultimately allowed to perform, the event schedule was modified to allow people to leave before he came on stage.
Parsing through the complexities of Yardfests-past brings us to a simple truth: artist selection matters. It matters, not only because the performer is the factor that determines whether Yardfest will be—as the kids say—lit, but also because artists inherently send a message about who we as a community imagine ourselves to be. Beyond an artist’s lyrics, their selection can remind us of the ways we are not as united as brochures and administrator’s speeches portray us.
Artists will not be booked if they don’t have popular appeal, but notions of “popularity” privilege certain sectors of the College student body over others. Country music and Latino music have become increasingly popular in recent years, concurrent with the increase of regional and ethnic diversity at Harvard. Yet in 24 years, there has not been a single act under either of those genres.
The “popularity” of the Yardfest act caters to the tastes of a majority that is so wealthy and white that in 2012 a headliner yelled “What’s up, you drunk, overprivileged shits?” and “All you white people make some noise” at the crowd. Minority preferences at Harvard—though popular in other parts of the country—simply won’t make it onto the stage.
Even rap music, made by black folks and co-opted by white Harvard students, reveals the fractures in this amorphous entity we call our undergraduate community. In advertising Yardfest this year, the CEB put out a flyer with a whale and a yacht, presumably a homage to Lil Yachty and Wale. But the flyer is predicated on the mispronunciation of Wale’s name (pronounced wah-lay, not whale), an error also made in 2010 when The Crimson attempted to make a joke about how the rapper’s name rhymed with Yale.
Though seemingly minor, the transgression shows just how different member of our community consume music differently based on their backgrounds. Yardfest is then a reminder of how difficult transcending class, race, gender, and religious lines at Harvard can be. As a Crimson editor wrote in 2009, “Harvard is a diverse place with high expectations, and no artist choice will ever satisfy everyone.”
Acknowledging these fractures and criticizing naive notions of unity is not antithetical to continually reaching for them. We’ve always striven to frame Yardfest as a moment of unity. At Jesse J’s 2015 performance, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said “I think it’s a great way our community comes together,” echoing a comment made in 1996 by a Campus Life Committee co-chair about Springest being “a really great opportunity to bring the campus together.”
We should continue to strive for unity, but we should not do so blindly. We should realize that fostering a unified student body requires more effort than simply attending a social event with individuals we generally don’t cross path with. After we’ve recovered from one too many drinks and strained vocal chords, our responsibility lies in what we’ll do to achieve the cohesion Yardfest allows us to imagine.

UPDATED: April 15, 2018 at 8:30 p.m.
Behind the information desk at the Harvard Book Store, a red banner reads, “Find it here. Buy it here. Keep us here.” The store has long promoted independent retail, so when Chronicle Books released comedian John Oliver’s bestselling picture book solely through Amazon, it spoke out.
Oliver’s book parodies a picture book released by Vice President Mike Pence’s family. “Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of the Vice President” is a story narrated from the perspective of the Pence family rabbit. Oliver’s spoof, “A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,” describes the same-sex romance of the Bunny of the United States (BOTUS). The book’s profits will be donated to the Trevor Project, which supports BGLTQ youth, and to AIDS United, which seeks to end AIDS in the U.S.
“It almost just seemed like an afterthought that people are going to want to buy these books in bookstores,” says Alex W. Meriwether, the general manager of Harvard Book Store. “That was what was so frustrating. For a commentator who seems to think so much about the bigger picture, it seemed a little tone-deaf that that wasn’t thought of.”
In a March 23 email to the American Book Association, Chronicle Books President Tyrrell Mahoney apologized for the frustration caused by the book’s launch. “We had to ensure that the book was a complete surprise,” she wrote. “We ultimately agreed to make the book available for purchase at the time of the on-air surprise by allocating a percentage of the print run to Amazon and making the rest of the first print run available to all our other retailers as soon as possible.”
Oliver’s representatives from Avalon Management did not respond to a request for comment.
Secret book releases, though, are common—Oprah’s Book Club books form one prominent example. Publishers have thus established processes that allow stores to order books with access to only cursory information about their content.
“I’m not going to say it’s unprecedented, but I cannot think of a time this has happened before,” Meriwether says.
Harvard Book Store finally received its first shipment of Oliver’s book 10 days after its initial release on Amazon. “It's hard to estimate how many more we might have sold had we had books sooner, but I'm sure that we lost sales,” head buyer Rachel M. Cass wrote in an email.
Nonetheless, store employees say they are pleased the event re-sparked conversations about protecting local retail. The store’s response, staffers say, is less the panicked cry of a dying business than the defiant backlash of an industry threatened, but still thriving—for now, anyways.
The independent bookstore industry has certainly suffered. From 1995 to 2000, almost half of the country’s independent stores closed, unable to compete with chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders. By the 2000s, Amazon dominated the book industry, and was poised to reshape it entirely with the release of the Kindle in 2007. Even large chains could not compete—Borders closed in 2011.
But as Amazon expanded, the indies fought back. From 2009 to 2015, the number of independent bookstores in the U.S. increased by 35 percent, according to the ABA.
“In the last three, four, five years, the independent bookstore industry has done a much better job of getting the word out about the importance of shopping local and the real, insidious danger of Amazon to local economies,” says David Sandberg, an owner of Porter Square Books.
The result is a bifurcation of the book industry. On one side stands Amazon—vast, convenient, and cheap. On the other side stands small bookstores, promoting what Ryan L. Raffaelli, a Harvard Business School professor studying the industry, calls “the 3 C’s”: community, convening, and curation.
“There are tons of people who come through [Porter Square Books] because they want to come here with their kids, or they want to come for coffee with their friends,” Sandberg says. “If it was just a place to buy a book, and if we were just competing for price, we would lose. But we have an identity as a community space.”
At Harvard Book Store, lectures, author events, and book signings promote intellectual “convening.” Each week, the store holds “Friday Forums” at which scholars, including Harvard professors, speak on a range of academic subjects.
The success of local independent bookstores supports used bookstores, too. “Anything that helps new book businesses helps us,” says Ken Gloss, current proprietor of the nearly 200-year-old Brattle Book Shop.
Brattle Book Shop has long owned its space in the heart of Downtown Boston, a product of decades-old foresight that has allowed the Gloss family to avoid today’s sky-high rents.  Brattle distributes maps marking other local bookstores to their customers. Thus, Boston-area bookstores report having formed a cooperative, rather than a competitive, network.
Each store has a unique identity: Harvard Book Store boasts an Academic New Arrivals section to showcase university press books, while Porter Square Books, located near a more residential community, offers a wide array of children’s and young adult books.
“Over time, the buyers in a store learn their customer base,” Sandberg says. This allows for what Raffaeli calls “curation,” in which stores carefully select content that caters to their specific customers. Raven Used Books, a bookstore that specializes in scholarly works of philosophy and history, has particularly refined curatorial skills, and sells between a third and a half of its inventory every month.
“We have a constant turnover of stock and that allows us to make the rent,” says John Petrovato, the owner of Raven Used Books. “It’s all about nurturing them, the local community. I would say half our customers come in once a week, so we want to keep good, fresh books coming in.”
“It’s a matter of how every store owner adjusts,” Gloss says. He promotes his store in lectures, online, and through a self-produced podcast. “I keep the name out and I think our business will be fine.”
But the Internet has also crippled specialty bookstores: Globe Corner Bookstore, the Mt. Auburn shop that housed one of the largest map and travel book collections in North America, closed in 2011. Schoenhof’s Foreign Books was down the street, and closed last year after 161 years of business.
Nevertheless, local stores have learned to fill gaps left by the impersonal Internet. “The future feels more certain than it might have been in the earlier days of Amazon,” Meriwether says. “The indie bookstore uproar around the John Oliver roll-out is just an opportunity to bring those issues to the forefront again, to have this conversation again, to say, ‘Is price the only thing that matters?’”

Philosophy concentrator Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 was one of 59 college students from across the country to be selected for the Truman Scholarship, a selective graduate scholarship awarded for outstanding commitment to public service.
The Scholarship provides each winner up to $30,000 to support their graduate studies, along with career and leadership training and priority admission at some top-tier graduate universities.
Whittaker and the other Truman Scholars were chosen from a pool of 756 candidates, all of whom were endorsed by the university they attend,  according to an announcement Thursday.
Throughout his time at Harvard, Whittaker has served on the Undergraduate Council and has focused his efforts on supporting underrepresented minorities on campus. As a UC representative for Adams House, Whittaker said that he has worked to include minority voices in UC decisions by co-founding the minority caucus system.
“Essentially, representatives from these marginalized communities can get together and form an official structure that has multiple soft and hard powers,” Whittaker said. “They are also supposed to be the communicative body between the UC and marginalized communities.”
Whittaker is also involved in the Harvard Black Community and Student Theater organization, also known as Black C.A.S.T., and writes opinion articles for The Crimson. He said both activities are tied to his advocacy for underrepresented groups.
“It’s very refreshing to write all these things about blackness, do all this bureaucratic work about the multicultural center and the caucus system, and then it’s really refreshing to then go to a black arts space that’s doing black protest art, and be involved in that community,” he added.
In terms of his academic interests, Whittaker is exploring “the philosophy of race and gender and the way that intersects with the radical political commitments and also the 3,000, 4,000 year old tradition of philosophy, which is dominated by white, cis, straight men.”
“It’s been really cool to work within that academic tradition particularly at this institution, which is like a white male institution, and to see how there’s little nuggets or spaces where I can sneak my way in and then broaden them, and make this tradition into this powerfully radical, and really cool and useful tool of liberation for marginalized communities,” he added.
Whittaker said he plans to pursue graduate and postdoctoral studies in philosophy, with the goal of becoming a professor in the field. He said although many people think that philosophy does not welcome marginalized groups, he believes that minorities can find their own niche.
“The thing that keeps me going is knowing that philosophy and education and academia doesn’t have to be elitist. It doesn’t have to be inaccessible,” Whittaker said. “All of our modern liberation movements came from philosophy, like feminism, the project of class equality, anti-racism and anti-white supremacy movements, the queer liberation movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adams House will retain several of its historic features—such as the pool theater and the former suite of President Franklin D. Roosevelt—when it undergoes renovations, starting in the spring of 2019.
The renovations will also preserve the Coolidge Room and the elliptical stairs in Randolph Hall—one of the seven buildings that comprise Adams—and the lobby of Claverly Hall, another building, according to a press release.
These specifics follow the hosting of a town hall in March intended to elicit residents’ input on the renovations. At the town hall many students emphasized the need for the preservation of Adams House’s “finer details.”
The pool theater in Westmorly Court, a building that houses mostly upperclassmen, was originally a 100-year-old swimming pool. After its closing in March 1990, the space was converted into a theater intended to host both student and professional productions.
In addition to these preservations, administrators and architects are looking to improve accessibility. The seven buildings of Adams House now include only one elevator in Claverly Hall; by the end of the project, there will be eight spanning across the House. All entrances will also be made accessible as well.
Architect Elizabeth R. Leber, a partner at Beyer Blinder Belle, the firm overseeing the project, said in the press release that the renewal of Adams is “particularly exciting.
“Each House renewal project comes with a distinct set of challenges and opportunities,” Leber said. “Adams House is a particularly exciting project for us, in that it occupies some of the oldest and most historically significant buildings in the House system, with architectural details that are about as unique and extraordinary as the Adams House culture.”
Adams is the next house slated to undergo renewal, with renovations of Lowell House wrapping up in 2019. Previously, the University renovated Dunster and Winthrop Houses, and portions of Quincy and Leverett Houses.

Following a fall semester launch, Harvard University Health Services is expanding “Let’s Talk,” a drop-in program that enables students to speak with a Counseling and Mental Health Services counselor without scheduling an appointment.
The expansion was announced in an email to Harvard affiliates by Dr. Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services, and CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis on Tuesday.
The Let’s Talk program launched in fall of 2017. During that semester, the program was limited in location to a few campus buildings in Cambridge and Longwood. HUHS has now instituted the program in Dudley House, Lyman Laboratory, Littauer Hall and Cabot Library among other campus spaces.
As of last week, the Let’s Talk Program is collectively available five days a week, according to Lewis.
“The clinicians are available for 15 or 20 minute chats about anything from ‘I just want to get input from someone other than my friends, an advisor, or a professor’” Lewis said. “It’s a non-clinical encounter. We don’t write a note, it can be anonymous.”
The impetus for Let’s Talk was sparked by an overburdening of CAMHS counselors, according to Lewis. Since its launch campus-wide, there has been a steady increase in students utilizing Let’s Talk.
“Throughout the spring term, CAMHS increased the number of Let’s Talk locations, providing opportunities for students to visit a location Monday through Friday,” Barreira and Lewis wrote.
Although the statement announcing the expansion was emailed to all College students, Lewis said she anticipates a challenge in garnering public awareness of the resource. She said her goal is for more students to know about and take advantage of the program.
“Our hope in the fall is that when new students are coming and students are coming back we can really advertise that as a way or a first stop or for students who don’t want to come to counseling and would rather do something more informal” Lewis said.
In the future, CAMHS is interested in expanding the hours of Let’s Talk, but Lewis said doing so, amidst Smith Campus Center renovations and changing locations of CAHMS services, is a difficult process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs hired its first pair of diversity fellows at the beginning of this semester.
The 2018 fellows, Ph.D. students Alyssa M. Hernandez and Alfredo M. Valencia, both said they applied for the position as a way to make underrepresented minorities feel more welcome on Harvard’s campus.
Sheila Thomas, the GSAS dean for academic programs and diversity, wrote in an email that the fellows are a valuable addition because they can ask questions of their peers in a way that administrators cannot.
“While we have gathered student feedback from regular meetings with student groups and town halls, one of the most important things the Fellows will do is go out into the community and have honest conversations with underrepresented students,” Thomas wrote.
On April 15, admitted students will decide whether to accept an offer from one of Harvard’s Ph.D. programs at GSAS. Hernandez and Valencia, both of whom spoke to prospective students at visiting events last month, said many of their discussions centered on the sense of “impostor syndrome” that admits feel when coming to Harvard.
“There’s such a reputation, and it’s intimidating. I felt intimidated and I still feel intimidated,” Hernandez said. “Graduate students talk a lot about impostor syndrome and feeling like they didn’t deserve to get in. We want to make Harvard more welcoming to students of color.”
Both fellows are members of affinity groups within GSAS, including the W.E.B. DuBois Graduate Society, Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science. Valencia said these groups “help students feel safe in a new environment.”
“When I first moved across the country from Southern California to the northeast, I felt like it was a very different culture,” Valencia said. “In student groups I found a really close-knit community.”
Hernandez added that one of the fellows’ major priorities for the coming year is making both admitted and current students more aware of diversity efforts at the departmental level.
“When I was applying to schools, I went directly to the program websites,” she said. “Freddy and I talked about what we saw when we applied, and whether they advertised diversity. It is something I noticed and something I took into consideration, so I thought a lot about how it might affect other students.”
Valencia estimated that about one in four program websites currently include information on departmental diversity efforts. He also noted that some other departments link to information on diversity at GSAS more broadly. Moving forward, he said he and Hernandez hope to work with administrators to increase the visibility of diversity efforts on these websites.

Five former governors spoke about state responses to the opioid epidemic at a roundtable discussion at the Harvard School of Public Health Thursday.
The panel featured Steve Beshear of Kentucky, Jim Douglas of Vermont, Jack Markell of Delaware, Ted Strickland of Ohio, and Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, who also served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama administration. Douglas is a Republican; the other four are Democrats.
Strickland was unable to attend in person, so he participated remotely.
Throughout the event, the panelists discussed their experiences working to stymie the opioid epidemic at the state and federal levels. Proposed solutions included residential treatment centers, needle exchanges, and combating the overprescription of opioids.
Sebelius criticized the Trump administration, specifically mentioning financial support for opioid treatment as an area where federal leadership has fallen short.
“Ideally we would have an administration that would cease trying to take payment for treatment away from millions of people who desperately need it, stop trying to roll back Medicaid expansion,” she said.
She also said federal officials are prosecuting perpetrators of non-violent drug crimes too aggressively.
“The Justice Department continues to believe this is a criminal justice issue—‘lock ’em up’—which has been a proven failure and cost a lot of money,” Sebelius said.
The governors also shared personal anecdotes about the opioid epidemic in their states.
Strickland said that last December he picked up a hitchhiker on the highway who was walking to his drug-treatment appointment.
“I’ve thought about that man a lot. No car, no job, prison record, an addiction, walking to drug treatment on a very cold morning. And that gives me hope,” he said. “I may never see him again, but I hope that he is a success story because I know he’s trying.”
The event was held at the School of Public Health’s Leadership Studio, and was organized in cooperation with Reuters. Reuters Boston Bureau Chief Scott Malone moderated the event.
Lisa Mirowitz, executive producer and director of the Leadership Studio, said that this event differed from past opioid-focused programming because it focused on treatment programs, a choice inspired by recent polling from Robert J. Blendon, a professor at the School of Public Health.
Blendon’s surveys indicated 34 percent of Americans do not think there is a treatment for prescription-painkiller abuse that is effective in the long term, and 49 percent oppose requiring insurers to provide more extensive coverage of treatment programs.
“The public really does not understand if treatment is worthwhile. They’re confused about treatment,” Mirowitz said.
Christina Roache, associate director for production and web at the studio, said the governors provided valuable information on the opioid issue.
She said that they had “a unique perspective into the tools that can be used to address the issue and some of the challenges that they’ve had to grapple with.”
The roundtable comes as Harvard faculty across the Longwood Medical Area are stepping up their research and education efforts in response to the opioid epidemic, which claims an average of 115 lives every day in the United States.

Global Support Services, a University department that supports Harvard-affiliated international travel, distributed fact sheets informing students of sexual assault risks and resources when travelling abroad.
The flyers and posters, which Global Support Services slid under dormitory doors last week, warn that “sexual assault and gender-based violence have no borders.” They urge students to research cultural norms in their destination countries and consult Global Support Services regarding safety measures prior to traveling.
The department was founded in 2011 to support students, faculty, and staff activities abroad. In recent years, it has been working to increase awareness about historically underreported sexual assault and harassment abroad. The office has distributed printed awareness materials every April since 2016 to coincide with Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
University spokesperson Liz Marr wrote in an emailed statement that the recent distribution of flyers to students aims to increase awareness of sexual assault resources abroad.
“One of our priorities in GSS is to ensure that Harvard travelers are aware of the laws, cultural norms, and resources abroad,” Marr wrote. “These can vary greatly by country, including those for sexual harassment and assault and gender-based violence.”
The pamphlets were originally created in 2016 after the University released findings from a spring 2015 survey about sexual assault and misconduct within Harvard. According to Marr, these findings prompted the Global Support Services to introduce initiatives to generate more awareness for resources available to students outside of the United States.
Elizabeth H. Esparza, senior program manager for strategic initiatives, wrote about her own experiences with sexual assault while studying abroad in the mid-1990s in a Harvard Business School blog post published in 2017. As a member of the International Safety and Security team within Global Support Services, Esparza is involved in the pre-departure programming and preparation for students going abroad.
When crises do occur overseas, Esparza said her office is also there to support students and Harvard-affiliated individuals.
“In the case of sexual assault, the immediate thing that we are going to focus on is the traveler’s safety,” Esparza. “If they need immediate medical attention, we work to get them the medical resources they need. In some places, those resources are readily available. In other locations, we may have to move someone to ensure that they are getting the help they need.”
Global Support Services also works with University administrators in the Title IX Office, Harvard University Health Services, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to provide assistance to Harvard students who disclose experiences of sexual harassment or assault abroad, according to Marr.
Caroline S. Ko ’21, a student who will be in Venice, Italy, this summer, said that Global Support Services has already been in contact with her to make her aware of the resources available while she is studying abroad.
“I’m glad that they are trying to make students aware of sexual assault and harassment, instead of trying to ignore these issues,” Ko said. “Awareness is key for prevention.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 13, 2018 at 2:46 p.m.
Harvard Law School announced Wednesday that Arizona Senator Jeffry L. Flake will be its 2018 Class Day Speaker.
Since President Donald Trump took office, the 55-year-old Republican has been one of his most outspoken critics on the right, even going so far as comparing the president’s attacks on the media to former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Last summer, Flake also published a book— “Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle”—criticizing the president.
Flake wrote in a statement provided by a spokesperson that he was “honored” the Law School invited him to speak.
“I’m very honored to have been asked to speak. As un-senatorial as it may seem, I’ll try to be as brief and concise as possible,” he wrote.
Flake announced in Oct. 2017 that he would not seek re-election to the Senate, raising speculation that he would challenge Trump in 2020. Flake spoke at a “Politics and Eggs” breakfast in March at New Hampshire’s Saint Anselm College, a key stop for presidential candidates. Asked whether he would run for president, Flake did not rule out the possibility.
“It has not been in my plans to run for president, but I have not ruled it out,” Flake said at the New Hampshire event.
Flake, a graduate of Brigham Young University, served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives before becoming a senator for one term. Flake is currently the chair of the Africa Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Flake has also served as the executive director of the conservative and libertarian think tank Goldwater Institute in Arizona as well as the Foundation for Democracy in Namibia.
As a senator, Flake has been at the forefront of efforts to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Representing the border state of Arizona, Flake has also pushed for immigration reform and recently introduced a bill to confirm the legal status of DACA recipients.
Flake will address graduating Law students on May 23, the day before Commencement.
Class Day speakers are selected by representatives of the graduating class, but not all students approved of the choice.
Pete D. Davis ’12, a third-year Law student, voiced his disapproval of Flake in two Harvard Law Record opinion pieces published Wednesday and Thursday.
Davis, who has been a vocal critic of what he calls a lack of support for public interest at the Law School, wrote in the first piece that he believes the political Right has “work[ed] the ref” in an effort to push liberal institutions to move toward the center by courting conservatives. Davis argued that this strategy motivated the school to select of Flake.
“An understanding of this right-wing power tactic helps make sense of the selection of Jeff Flake as Harvard Law School’s 2018 Class Day Speaker. The selection of such a figure...is a consequence of another successful effort by the right to work the ref,” Davis wrote.
Davis criticized Flake’s voting record—highlighting his support of the Iraq War and his opposition to gay marriage, among other stances.
Davis’s second letter specifically criticizes Flake’s support of closing the Legal Services Corporation, citing Flake’s long-term opposition to funding the program, which provides funding for civil legal aid to the less fortunate.
Third-year Law student Cameron Pritchett, one of the class marshals who selected Flake, said the marshals chose Flake as part of an effort to bring a range of perspectives to campus. He said he thinks Law students can learn from the Republican senator.
"We are looking forward to Senator Flake delivering that message to an audience that may not have necessarily traditionally agreed with many of his points of view,” Pritchett said.
Flake could not be reached for comment on Davis’s criticisms.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has reached gender parity in the tenure track of the sciences division for the first time, according to the the school’s annual Faculty Diversity and Development report released Thursday.
The report, compiled by Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, contains statistics on the number of ladder faculty—meaning tenured professors and those on the tenure track like assistant and associate professors—who are women or minorities within FAS and the University’s professional schools. The report also details initiatives each school is undertaking in order to diversify their faculty.
Singer called achieving gender parity within the sciences division tenure track one of the “bright spots” of the report.
“In particular, I would point out that 50 percent of the tenure-track faculty in the sciences division in the FAS are women,” Singer said. “That is the result of a very, very concerted effort to look broadly for talent and to recruit people and support them.”
The number of tenure-track women scientists has grown in the past 10 years, starting at 32 percent in 2008, the earliest year included in the report. Though women make up 50 percent of tenure-track faculty in the sciences, they make up 18 percent of tenured sciences faculty, marking the second-lowest percentage among the four divisions of FAS.
Sixteen percent of tenured faculty in the engineering division of FAS are women and 19 percent of tenure-track faculty are women. The social sciences division is also yet to achieve gender parity among its ladder faculty, as women in that division make up 31 percent of tenured faculty and 40 percent of tenure-track faculty.
The arts and humanities division boasts the highest percentage of women across its ladder faculty. Women make up 35 percent of tenured faculty and 54 percent of tenure-track faculty.
Hiro L. Tanaka, a Benjamin Peirce Fellow in the Mathematics department, said there is still work to be done within the sciences and that 50-50 representation is a “very poor substitute” for what it means to have gender equality.
“I think gender parity would probably be defined by the feelings of the individuals in a particular community at the student level, at the professor level, at the professional level—whether they feel like gender is not a factor that disadvantages them in their success,” said Tanaka, who is also a faculty advisor for Gender Inclusivity in Math.
The Math department recently hired its second-ever tenured female professor, Lauren K. Williams ’00, who will join the department in the fall.
Similarly, the Statistics department gained its first ever tenured female faculty member, Susan A. Murphy, last semester.
“This is the way you do it. You start with one, that person helps recruit the next one, and then you continue the progress,” Singer said.
While women have made strides in the sciences, only 3 percent of tenure-track faculty and 6 percent of tenured faculty in the sciences are minorities. Across FAS, 9 percent of tenured faculty are underrepresented minorities and 12 percent are Asian; the numbers for tenure-track faculty are 9 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
Engineering has the smallest percentage of underrepresented minority tenured faculty, at 1 percent, while social sciences has the largest percentage, at 16 percent. Engineering, however, has the largest percentage of underrepresented minority tenure-track faculty at 19 percent.
The report outlined several ways FAS has attempted to increase the number of women and minority faculty members, including providing “guidance, support, and data” for departments as they recruit faculty.
“Encouraging underrepresented students to engage in academic endeavors and surveying and recruiting from the full range of talent in the Ph.D. pipeline are vital if we are to bring the most extraordinary faculty into the FAS,” the report reads. “We cannot simply hope that the best scholars will find their way to us. We need to actively develop and search for them.”
Singer pointed out, as an example, that the Graduate School of Education has complete gender parity in the faculty, at 50 percent men and 50 percent women. She said she attributes the parity to the large percentage of women earning Ph.D.s in education and related fields.
“That's not terribly surprising,” Singer said. “I mean, if you look at the pool of people getting doctorates in education or in social science or humanities fields that are related to education, they are disproportionately women.”
Singer added, though, that the composition of recruitment pools is also one reason why SEAS faces a low representation of women and minorities.
“If you look at our engineering school, which has made progress and knows it still needs to make more progress, there's no doubt we still need to make more progress,” Singer said. “We are pulling talent from a pool of people who are themselves less diverse than the undergraduate class at Harvard College.”
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith also said in an interview last week that the applicant pool poses a challenge for departments during the hiring process. Smith said FAS is working towards increasing the percentage of women and minorities in the pool of applicants from which Harvard hires.
“We still have more things to do, but we're shifting our focus to try to do more outreach and programs around what to do to increase the amount of minority applicants that we have in faculty positions across the board,” Smith said.
Tanaka said one thing that could help promote gender equality across the sciences would be if STEM students who identify as men begin educating themselves about gender issues in their fields.
“As with any gender issue, I don't think the burden can fall on the people being adversely affected,” Tanaka said. “People who take advantage, consciously or not, of the system really need to help make a change too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith approved policy changes last year restricting professors’ ability to hold certain public service positions while also remaining active members of Harvard’s faculty.
The changes, passed in May 2017, mandate that any professor whose public service commitments take up—or have the “undue potential” to take up—more than 20 percent of their “total professional effort” must take a maximum of two years unpaid leave. The policy also forbids service that could take the professor’s “primary professional loyalty” away from Harvard.
A faculty committee appointed by Smith in late 2016 proposed the changes to three Faculty steering bodies. After making some small adjustments in consultation with these three groups, members of the original committee presented the policy to Smith.
Smith approved the policy as written, according to Economics Professor James H. Stock, who served on the committee.
Economics Professor Jeremy C. Stein, who chaired the committee, said that, until recently, Harvard “didn’t need” a clear public service leave policy for faculty.
“Most of the cases that I think they have dealt with in the past have been mostly Americans looking to do U.S. public service,” Stein said. “We didn’t need much of a policy because the U.S. government would force you to go on leave.”
But Stock said it “became apparent” that Harvard professors engage in other kinds of public service—like working for foreign governments—that were not “really covered” by Harvard’s previous policy.
Stock and Stein said the committee formed to adjudicate these “complicated” cases.
Stein particularly pointed to the example of History Professor Sugata Bose, who was elected to serve in Indian Parliament starting in Sept. 2014. While Bose’s current parliamentary duties do not take him away from Harvard during the year, Stein said Smith worried that unforeseen circumstances could distract Bose from his duties in Cambridge going forward.
Bose’s specific situation in part led to the formation of the committee, Stein said.
“We were not questioning the idea that the leave could never be more than two years in any circumstance, because that’s a Corporation-level rule,” Stein said, referring to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. “[The question] was, within those parameters, when would you have to take leave to do public service as opposed to when could you do certain things while remaining on the faculty?”
Stein said the committee decided to use a “common law approach” to answer the question. This meant the committee sought to establish “high level principles” that Smith could apply according to his best judgment.
Stein said committee members took this approach because they wanted to acknowledge the committee itself could not anticipate “every contingency.”
History Department Chair Daniel L. Smail, however, said he is concerned this policy is too broad and will have far-reaching effects on professors’ abilities to work in the public sector.
Smail said he objected to the scope of the policy changes when the faculty committee first presented them to the Social Sciences steering committee in late 2016.
In arguing against the changes, Smail cited the experience of History Professor Nancy F. Cott, who served as a consultant and expert witness for the lawyers arguing against the Defense of Marriage Act, which was struck down in 2013. Cott performed these services while still working as a full-time Harvard professor.
Smail said he fears the new policy will deter professors from taking on the kind of project Cott undertook.
“She was a very important figure in terms of turning the national wheel toward allowing same-sex marriage,” Smail said. “[But] it was a huge commitment that probably exceeded 20 percent of her time.”
“I worry: is it possible that someone under this policy might look at the kinds of things Nancy Cott was doing and say no, that exceeds this undue commitment, this 20 percent?” Smail asked.
More broadly, Smail argued that—unlike private, for-profit consulting, which he agrees should be restricted—public service could never be in conflict with a professor's mission at or loyalty to Harvard.
“I still think there’s no case where my loyalty to the university can be in conflict with my loyalty to the public good,” Smail said. “Because what is the point of a university? It’s a nonprofit. It’s meant to serve the public good.”
Stein, however, disagreed.
“There’s some [public service] jobs you could have where even if they don’t necessarily have a lot of hours, you could imagine a situation where if there was a conflict, you’d be pulled towards that rather than towards your teaching or your research or your students,” Stein said.

Few people choose to live in Cuyama Valley.
With a population of less than 1,000 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, the 300-square mile area is home to large, empty expanses of ranch and agricultural land. Less than a foot of water graces the parched earth of Cuyama each year, making the region one of the driest regions of Central California.
Beneath the arid ground, though, there exists great agricultural potential. Cuyama— the Chumash word for “clam”— is an apt analogy for the region. Hardened and seemingly intractable on the outside, it is full of untapped riches underneath. Ever since the region’s oil reserves declined, crops have been king.
Harvard Management Company— the stewards of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment— has positioned itself to benefit from the richness of the region.
HMC has a long-standing history of owning eclectic natural resource assets, including New Zealand cattle farms, timber, and Brazilian sugar canes. Central California—which boasts some of the world’s finest vineyards—has also become part of HMC’s extensive, and little known, asset portfolio.
In the University’s 2013 financial report, then-HMC president Jane L. Mendillo wrote that continued positive returns in the natural resources portfolio “demonstrat[es] the continued potential of this investment area.”
HMC has offloaded some of its natural resource assets after particularly poor performance in this asset class in fiscal year 2016. In 2017, HMC CEO N.P “Narv” Narvekar—who took the helm of the endowment roughly two years ago—marked down the value of natural resource investments by $1.1 billion.
But the company has retained its holdings in California vineyards, and now a number of local residents are questioning the wager Harvard is making in the county.
Since 2012, Brodiaea, Inc.—a Delaware-based company wholly owned by HMC—has spent over $60 million and purchased about 10,000 acres of vineyard land in the Paso Robles region of California. Brodiaea followed that purchase by dipping its toes into Cuyama.
Harvard’s land grab in central California has raised local concern over the University’s water well drilling and its potential impact on the region. With California confronting a water shortage crisis, residents of Cuyama have begun to band together and draft a vision for a more sustainable future—one that may challenge the vineyards Harvard holds.
Bounded to the southwest by the Sierra Madre mountains, Cuyama Valley hugs the Cuyama River and spans four counties in California. Once a hotbed for oil production, Cuyama Valley peaked in the early 1950s as California’s fourth most productive oil region. The oil boom also gave rise to New Cuyama—now the most populated city in the region with just over 500 residents. Once the oil began to dry out, though, farmers started tapping the region for agricultural use.
Stephen R. Gliessman, an agroecology professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Cruz and a farmer in the valley who has challenged the Harvard vineyard’s water usage, said the region experimented with a variety of crops like alfalfa, oats, and carrots. Regardless of the crop, Gliessman said, one issue has persisted across California.
“In reality, the climate is perfect for agriculture—nice long dry summers, mild winters in large parts of the state,” Gliessman said. “The only problem is water. There’s not enough of it.”
As the demand for water increased, the Cuyama Valley Groundwater Basin—the sole source of water supply in the region—began to dwindle in size. A 1998 Department of Water Resource study conducted by the state of California found water levels had dropped 150 feet in the west-central region of the basin and more than 300 feet in the northeastern part of the basin in the preceding 50 years. As groundwater levels decrease, growers have been forced to lower wells reaching up to 1,000 feet in depth, the Santa Maria Sun reported.
Recent precipitation data do not offer a bright vision for the future. According to data collected by the Western Regional Climate Center—a government climate research center—New Cuyama has averaged 8.35 inches of precipitation from 1981 to 2010. Between the dry months of April and September, the city sees fractions of an inch in monthly average precipitation.
The rest of California has suffered similarly dry conditions. In Jan. 2014, Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought state of emergency in California that lasted more than three years.
In the meantime, Harvard has not been deterred by the parched conditions in Cuyama. In April 2014, Brodiaea Inc. paid $10.1 million for more than 7,500 acres of vineyard land in northeast Santa Barbara County, making it one of the biggest holders of land in Cuyama Valley.
The vineyard purchase moved local residents to action.
Amid the water woes, residents have questioned the viability of Harvard’s vineyards in Cuyama.
Randall Tognazzini, whose family has owned a ranch in the northern part of the valley for decades, said he is unsure about the University’s purchase.
“I would love to see it work,” said Tognazzini. “Nothing would make me happier to see that work there, but I’m just extremely, extremely concerned that this money has been poorly spent there.”
Tognazzini estimated that 800 acre-feet—or nearly 35 million cubic feet—of water may be needed to grow the vineyard per year. That amount, Tognazzini said, may not be sustainable for Harvard’s vineyard project.
“They will make it as perfect as they can, but they can’t guarantee that it’s not going to fail because nature is going to take its course,” he said.
Santa Barbara County Supervisor Das Williams said his constituents are wary of the vineyard’s impacts on the valley.
“Larger agriculturists, and owners, and the townsfolk, and the farmworkers, and the everyday folks—they have very different viewpoints. The one thing they agree on is that they are afraid of the potential impact and uncertainty that the vineyard project poses,” Williams said.
Gliessman said he has heard questions about Harvard’s project since its inception.
“Nobody in our valley could understand why they were doing it, it just didn’t make sense from an environmental or agronomic perspective,” Gliessman said. “Number one, there is not enough water to support more water-intensive agriculture.”
Brenton Kelly, a farmer in the valley and vice chair of the advisory committee to the Cuyama Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency, said the land has changed significantly since it became a vineyard.
“It’s certainly no longer phenomenal range land with wildflowers and open space," he said. "It's many miles of vineyard now, engineered landscape—much like the rest of the valley."
As the valley continues to see its water disappear, its residents have mobilized to preserve it.
In Sept. 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which for the first time provided a framework to manage groundwater use in the state. The act instructed the Department of Water Resources to categorize basins based on groundwater metrics. Basins of either “medium” or “high” priority are required by SGMA to form Groundwater Sustainability Agencies that draft Groundwater Sustainability Plans to manage use.
Jennifer Clary, a manager at the grassroots environmental advocacy group Clean Water Action, said the law will change the landscape for groundwater use in California.
“The main impact of SGMA is that for the first time it’s requiring balanced and sustainable use of groundwater,” Clary said. “The difficulty is that groundwater has always been our fallback supply.”
Cuyama Valley, along with 20 other basins, has earned the classification “critically overdrafted.” This means that, over multiple years, more water is withdrawn from the basin than is replenished, and the depletion could have significant adverse impacts. For basins in critical overdraft, the timeline is accelerated and the sustainability plan must be implemented by Jan. 2020.
The Cuyama Basin GSA, formed in June 2017, comprises representatives from the Cuyama Basin Water District, the counties that hold land in the valley, and the Cuyama Community Services District, which provides water and wastewater treatment to residents living in the New Cuyama area.
The GSA has the power to potentially tax water use, impose restrictions, and fund projects that could increase inflow of water into the valley.
To get a seat on the GSA, property owners in the Cuyama Valley formed the water district, which the county certified in 2017.
“It was partially formed because the large landowners wanted to be in the driving seat,” Williams said.
The special election to form the water district—a group of landowners who will weigh in on water issues—took place in February of last year. The district, which holds a plurality of seats on the GSA, does not include the Harvard-owned vineyard.
Harvard is not represented through the district, but rather, through the counties in which the vineyard lies.
Williams said it was unexpected to see a major landowner like the vineyard owner sitting out of the process.
“We did not anticipate that there would be large entities that didn’t participate with the district,” Williams said, adding he has met with vineyard representatives to ask them to participate directly on the GSA.
“They have come to some meetings, all of the large landowners are paying part of the cost, except for them,” Williams said. “I have asked them to participate voluntarily in the cost, that hasn’t happened.”
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment for this story.
The Groundwater Sustainability Agency may end up imposing water restrictions on landowners in the valley, Williams said.
And, as one of the most precious resources in the region, restrictions on groundwater could keep Harvard from turning water into wine in Cuyama.
“I do believe that the plan could impose restrictions on groundwater uses. It’s one of the most endangered groundwater basins in the state. It’s very possible,” Williams said.
In early 2016, Santa Barbara County filed a proposal with the Department of Water Resources that seeks to modify the boundary of Cuyama Valley. Their recommendation cites a recent USGS study that suggests that the Russell fault divides the groundwater basin.
The Harvard-owned vineyard has advanced a similar argument. But in June 2016, the DWR rejected the boundary change proposal, which would have split the vineyard away from the critically overdrafted Cuyama Basin.
The ruling placed the vineyard under the purview of the Cuyama Basin GSA, meaning any groundwater sustainability plan the group develops will apply to the vineyard.
Meanwhile, though, to protect its vineyard from frost, Brodiaea is applying for a permit to construct three reservoirs slated to hold over 52 million gallons of water.

On August 15, 2016, Joseph D. Ostas rented a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Norman, Oklahoma. He brought along stuffed animals, a well-used Virgin Mary candle, and loving notes to family and friends.
Then he shot himself in the head with a Taurus 9mm semi-automatic pistol he purchased legally at a nearby Academy Sports. He was 24 years old.
Ostas was an outgoing and happy child, but he developed anxiety, depression, and mild Asperger’s Syndrome during high school. He struggled with suicidal thoughts for the last three years of his life, but was proactive in seeking help—his family spent years working through psychiatric and prescription therapies, and he self-admitted to mental health facilities on six separate occasions.
“This was a young man who was asking for help,” said his mother, Andrea Scopelitis. “Joseph was very open—he wore his heart on his sleeve.”
“I think the most tragic part about the whole thing is that everyone knew it was coming,” said Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18, who grew up down the street from the Ostas family.
Ostas had already purchased handguns twice before committing suicide; but because none of his mental health facility admissions were court-ordered, he passed all background checks and never earned a spot on a no-sell list, despite his parents’ pleading with the local gun store owner.
In the wake of Ostas’s death, Shafer-Ray, a Social Studies concentrator, decided to take legal action to ensure something similar would never happen again. After reaching out to legislators, Shafer-Ray began pushing for two separate bills in Massachusetts meant to improve gun safety for individuals like Ostas.
One bill seeks to make it more difficult for those at risk of self-harm to obtain guns by allowing family members or law enforcement officials to petition to prohibit or revoke those individuals’ access to firearms. The other would allow Massachusetts residents to voluntarily put themselves on a “no-sell” list.
Both bills are currently wending their way through various Massachusetts House committees; it is unclear when they will come to a full vote. In order to advance the twin laws, Shafer-Ray has spent hours negotiating with Massachusetts legislators, has testified in committee several times, and spoke in front of tens of thousands of people at last month’s March for Our Lives protest in Boston.
Scopelitis is working with Shafer-Ray to argue for the bills; though she lives in Oklahoma, she traveled to Boston in Nov. 2017 to testify along with her son’s childhood friend.
Scopelitis said she believes her son would have taken advantage of the legislation she now hopes to bring into existence.
“If Joseph had the option to have himself put on a do-not-sell list, or the option for me to be able to put him on a do-not-sell list, he would have chosen that option, because he wanted protection for himself,” she said.
“It was this very preventable death,” Shafer-Ray said. “If you could just prevent him from getting a gun, he wouldn't have been able to do what he did.”
Shafer-Ray was preparing to return to Harvard for the 2016-2017 school year when he heard Ostas had committed suicide. He swiftly reached out to Scopelitis to discuss trying to push through gun control legislation in their home state, but the filing deadline in Oklahoma had already passed.
“Instead of just waiting a whole year to try to pass it in Oklahoma, I was like, ‘Why don’t we bring it to Massachusetts, where I can actually advocate for it?’” Shafer-Ray said.
Shafer-Ray contacted Massachusetts Rep. Marjorie C. Decker, who said she was interested in his ideas. The two met for the first time in fall 2016; soon after that meeting, Decker’s office drafted versions of the two bills, dubbed H.3610 and H.3611, respectively. Decker could not be reached for comment.
H.3610—“An Act temporarily preventing firearm access for extremely dangerous or suicidal individuals”—seeks to prohibit high-risk individuals from obtaining firearms via “Extreme Risk Protection Orders.” Under the bill, petitioners—comprising family members, household members, or law enforcement officials—can file written applications for these orders in civil court.
Within the court day, a judge considers the written petition and determines whether there is reasonable cause to believe the individual in question “poses a significant danger of causing imminent personal injury to self or others.” If the judge agrees with the petitioner, the court immediately issues a temporary version of the order that prohibits the individual from acquiring new firearms and takes away firearms he or she already owns for a maximum of two weeks.
The judge later holds a full court hearing, during which the petitioner and respondent are both allowed to present “credible evidence,” including recent acts or patterns of violence and dangerous mental health issues. If the court finds a “preponderance of evidence” that the individual is a danger to themself or others, the judge issues a more permanent version of the order that bars access to firearms for one year.
Laws establishing similar programs have already been enacted in Connecticut, Indiana, California, Washington, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Florida. On Wednesday, the governor of Vermont added his state to that list when he signed into law a new initiative allowing for protective orders.
The other bill Decker’s office drafted, H.3611—“An Act authorizing the voluntary disavowal of eligibility to purchase a firearm”—establishes a statewide list of people who voluntarily deny themselves the ability to buy guns. Individuals who place themselves on the no-sell list must petition the court to regain access to firearms.
Shafer-Ray acknowledged some have criticized gun control measures for infringing on Americans’ Second Amendment rights, but said he does not think either H.3610 or H.3611 violate the Constitution. He noted the no-sell list, in particular, is “completely voluntary.”
“3611 is more novel, and it's something that Joseph's mom and I came up with pretty independently,” Shafer-Ray said. “What his mom likes to call his bill is the 'Siren bill,' referring to Odysseus.”
In the Odyssey, Homer tells of Sirens—horrific creatures with angelic, seductive voices. At one point in the epic, Odysseus asks his crew to lash him to the mast so he can listen to the Sirens’ song without giving into temptation and swimming to his death.
“[Joseph] knows that the temptation is great for himself, and he knows that it’s extremely dangerous and it’s something he doesn't want when his mind is clear,” Shafer-Ray said. “But he knows also that he will be tempted and he will, on bad days, he’ll reach out for the guns.”
In addition to joining forces with Decker, Shafer-Ray has worked with Frederick E. Vars, a law professor at the University of Alabama, who independently developed the idea of a voluntary do-not-sell list in 2015. Vars, like Scopelitis, has traveled to Massachusetts to testify in committee as part of Shafer-Ray’s push to pass the bills.
To date, only one state—Washington—has enacted some version of what Vars called “the Odysseus bill.” But Vars said he hopes more will follow; he noted that, when he asked high-risk patients at the University of Alabama Birmingham Medical Center if they would be interested in joining a no-sell list, 46 percent of patients answered yes.
“Suddenly the public health implications, if you could actually get that kind of percentage of people in a large and high-risk population to restrict their access to guns in this way, is no longer just saving a few lives—it’s saving hundreds of lives,” Vars said. “I really do think if it were national that it would have that kind of potential.”
As the two bills wind through the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Shafer-Ray is not sitting idle.
In addition to collaborating with Scopelitis in Oklahoma and Vars in Alabama, Shafer-Ray is working closer to home. He has joined forces with local activists and members of the Harvard College Democrats to garner support for H.3610 and H.3611 as well as gun control measures more broadly.
During Shafer-Ray’s freshman year, he and Sharon Yang ’18, then the co-chairs of the College Democrats’ policy and publicity committee, established a now-annual Lobby Day, during which Harvard students travel to the State House to promote certain pieces of legislation.
The College Democrats have lobbied for H.3610 and H.3611 during past Lobby Days, Yang said, and will continue to advocate for both bills.
Recently, Shafer-Ray lobbied for the bills in a different way, speaking in front of thousands of people at last month’s March for Our Lives protest in Boston. That march, meant to push for stricter gun control measures nationwide, came in the wake of a deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. that left 17 people dead.
Shafer-Ray said his anger outweighed any fear he felt addressing such a large crowd.
“I just thought about all of the horrible, horrible things that have been happening in this country in terms of gun violence—thinking about Joseph, thinking about Parkland victims, thinking about Las Vegas, thinking about Columbine,” he said. “I honestly got out there and I was just very angry. I was just full of rage. I was just full of defiance.”
Leonardo A. “Leo” Garcia ’21 and Te S. Palandjian ’21, who attended the march, said they found Shafer-Ray’s speech inspiring. Garcia and Palandjian have organized a Harvard sit-in for gun control, slated to take place April 20.
Both said they think Shafer-Ray’s twin bills are relevant to the sit-in and should form part of the larger campus discussion around gun control.
Garcia said the notion of a voluntary do-not-sell list is “changing the narrative” of the intersection between gun violence and mental health.
“Giving more autonomy to people who are diagnosed as mentally ill is a really important step,” Palandjian said.
Shafer-Ray and Vars both said they are hopeful for the future, noting there is a swell of support for gun control measures across the country right now. Both pointed to the #NeverAgain movement started by survivors of the Parkland shooting to illustrate the power and energy young people can bring to the fight for change.
Since its inception in February, the movement has had tangible effects—on March 9, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed an array of gun limits into law, including legislation that raises the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21.
“It’s really exciting,” Shafer-Ray said. “Bills like this are getting passed across the country. I’m very, very optimistic about the chances of these bills being passed in Massachusetts, too.”
“Those student voices are hard to ignore,” Vars said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2018 at 12:45 a.m.
Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer spoke Thursday at an off-the-record Institute of Politics study group in the Kirkland Senior Common Room.
The conversation was to center around the 2018 midterm elections, according to an email sent over an Institute of Politics email list.
Spicer previously came to Harvard as a visiting fellow at the Institute in Oct. 2017, when he spent three days attending classes and off-the-record meals with students.
The IOP’s decision to grant Spicer the fellowship sparked pushback from students and alumni at the time. More than 600 Harvard alumni signed an open letter calling on the IOP to rescind its fellowships for Spicer and for former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
Following a tumultuous six months as President Donald Trump’s press secretary—including often-contentious exchanges with reporters—Spicer’s three days on campus were comparatively quiet.
While on campus in October, Spicer attended 11 events, all of them off-the-record and closed to the general public.
The IOP Weekly Newsletter did not feature an announcement of Spicer’s visit. The email announcing his visit was sent at 8:00 p.m. Wednesday.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 20, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Sean Spicer participated in an off-the-record study group held in the Kirkland Junior Common Room. In fact, the study group was held in the Kirkland Senior Common Room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black Sheep Bagel Cafe successfully earned a license from the Cambridge License Commission Tuesday, paving the way for the bagel eatery to officially open its doors at 56 JFK St. in Harvard Square.
Owners Shoshanah Garber and Manny Ramirez said they are excited their new cafe will soon come to Harvard. The two hope to work with student groups and organizations, Garber said.
Some students said they are pleased Black Sheep is opening given the Square does not currently boast any bagel stores. Gelila G. Wolle ’21, who said she often has “a lot of trouble deciding where to go to breakfast” given what she called a scarcity of local options, noted she is looking forward to being able to visit a new type of eatery.
“I think people would go because there isn’t that much choice,” Wolle said.
Elizabeth M. Cordoves ’20 said she thinks Black Sheep will be a “nice place to meet up when you want to get out of the d-hall… that is not too expensive either.”
Black Sheep will be open seven days a week for breakfast and lunch and will offer twelve different types of bagels, according to Garber and Ramirez. Both said they are currently working on planning the menu—and pricing the bagels.
“We’ve definitely done our research in regards to the surrounding bagel spots and cafes,” said Ramirez. “We don’t want to be on the high spectrum of pricing, which is very important to us because we understand we are surrounded by college students.”
Ramirez said Black Sheep hopes to price its offerings lower than nearby cafes. The store will also offer student discounts, Garber said. These student discounts will be available for both graduates and undergraduates, Garber said, in part given that Black Sheep is close to the Harvard Kennedy School.
Garber and Ramirez are local Cantabrigians. The two said they were inspired to open Black Sheep after realizing the Square could benefit from a cafe with lower-priced offerings.
“We’ve noticed the need for a more affordable breakfast and lunch option, and we are here to fill that need,” Garber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs has partnered with Bank of America to start an initiative to study the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, the Kennedy School announced Tuesday.
The effort, called the Council on the Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence, aims to bring together academics with public and private sector professionals to discuss the “legal, moral, and policy implications” of adopting AI technologies.  Bank of America will fund the program for its first three years, according to a Kennedy School press release.
Geology Professor Daniel P. Schrag, who is the co-director of the Belfer Center’s Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program, said the aim of the council will be to “figure out the rules of the road” for AI technologies in the future.
Four themes that the Council will cover include “privacy,” “rights, justice, and equality,” “transparency,” as well as “workforce,” according to the press release.
Schrag also said that Harvard’s resources and stature will help the initiative bring together a diverse group of experts.
“The idea of the council is to convene a group using Harvard’s convening power and wide range of expertise in the space to explore the ethical and policy dimensions of [machine learning] and AI,” Schrag said. “These fields potentially have enormous benefits, but also risks.”
Catherine P. Bessant, Bank of America’s Chief Operations and Technology Officer, outlined the council’s mandate in the press release.
“As business, public, and private entities rush to realize the efficiencies and effectiveness of AI, we will examine how these benefits are balanced with the human components of AI to determine how best to reskill the workforce for an AI world,” Bessant wrote.
Previous efforts to convene working groups on AI, according to Schrag, tended to be focused within the technology industry, rather than involving the broader service and manufacturing sectors, which also utilize these technologies.
In addition to the Kennedy School, Schrag said the council will include affiliates from the Law School, the Business School, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, along with researchers from outside universities including MIT.
The council plans to have its first meeting in the fall, Schrag said, and is currently working on building its staff.

At its annual banquet, the Harvard men’s hockey program named its captains for the 2018-2019 season while also honoring the accomplishments of players in the past year. Rising seniors and forwards Michael Floodstrand and Lewis Zerter-Gossage will wear the “C” for the Crimson, becoming the 131st and 132nd captains in program history.
“I’ve had the privilege of being around...pretty stellar guys and great leaders,” said Zerter-Gossage, alluding to the captains of years past. “But it’s a big responsibility, and now it’s up to us, the seniors, to be really setting the tone and having the younger guys follow.”
Zerter-Gossage (32 GP, 10–19—29) played on Harvard’s productive top line this past season, also chipping in on the premier power play unit and helping out with faceoff duties with linemate and fellow junior Ryan Donato. Floodstrand (33 GP, 4–6—10) spent time on the wing of tri-captain Jake Horton this past year, slotting in on an energetic and shutdown third line.
Both Zerter-Gossage and Floodstrand knew, after the 2017-2018 season,  that they would have to step up to leadership roles regardless of the election’s results. The Crimson will bid farewell to its winningest senior class (83), which beat out a twelve-year record to earn that distinction. The class of 2018 also supplied the team with a trio of captains—the program’s first of its kind—in Horton, goaltender Merrick Madsen, and forward Eddie Ellis.
“Me and [Zerter-Gossage] are the ones that are going to be wearing the Cs,” Floodstrand acknowledged. “But when you look back at past years that have had a lot of success, the entire senior class and even the junior class are leaders on the team.”
Leadership by committee isn’t a new principle for Harvard. Even before this season’s three captains, the class of 2017 graduated as the highest-scoring senior class in the NCAA and was at the helm of the team’s 2017 Frozen Four run. Floodstrand and Zerter-Gossage agree that the entire class of rising seniors will be a part of next year’s leadership core. Floodstrand pointed to net-minder Michael Lackey and defensemen Adam Baughman and Jacob Olson as teammates he will rely on to step up.
“All of them have a tremendous amount of respect from guys in the locker room,” Floodstrand said. “Any one of them could have been a captain…. To have extra voices in the locker room that can communicate things, that can really resonate with the guys, is huge.”
 
Current sophomores, too, must rise to the occasion. Zerter-Gossage cited defensemen John Marino and Adam Fox, as well as his own linemate Ty Pelton-Byce, as critical to upholding the Crimson’s culture. A major aspect of that culture, one that Harvard has emphasized since its resurgence as a program, is establishing goals in advance of the season. Very often, the primary goal is crystal clear.
“Everybody on the team truly believes that next year we can win a national championship, or get really close,” Floodstrand said. “That’s obviously the number one goal. You obviously want to win a Beanpot championship, an ECAC championship, an Ivy League championship...and then there’s day-to-day things to hold yourself to, as a standard.”
Any incoming captain must adapt to a more accountable dynamic with his coaching staff. Zerter-Gossage and Floodstrand, however, have unique perspectives in their relationships with Crimson bench boss Ted Donato ’91 due to their concurrent roles as classmates and friends of the coach’s son Ryan.
“I was always...seeing [coach Donato]  in more of a relaxed setting than most players do with their coaches,” Floodstrand said. “[Zerter-Gossage] is in the same situation as me, where we’re very comfortable talking to him about stuff, and that’s huge…. It’s always good to have that extra bit of transparency.”
Any college hockey club must deal with the reality of a rotating cast of personnel. With a locked-in group of rising upperclassmen, the Crimson has its sights firmly set on accomplishing more of its goals in the 2018-2019 season. The squad has already lost its top scorer, Donato, to the NHL’s Boston Bruins, but otherwise returns eight of the next nine names on the points table.
That group contains several rookies who enjoyed success in their debut campaign: forwards Jack Badini (10–7—17) and Henry Bowlby (8–8—16) and puck-moving defenseman Reilly Walsh (7–13—20). Harvard will look for its young, talented sophomore scoring corps to continue doing what it does best alongside Fox, Pelton-Byce, and Zerter-Gossage.
“There’s not a doubt in anyone’s mind that we can be a national championship type team next year,” Floodstrand emphasized. “That’s our goal, and everything that we do from here on out has got to be towards that.”

If you haven’t been living under a rock, or in the Widener stacks, you know that Yardfest is tomorrow! To make it as hype as possible, make sure you’re prepped with all the essential Yardfest info:
Pregames
We all know that pregaming is one of the most essential part of Yardfest, so if you haven’t already started, here’s what you need to know. Each neighborhood hosts a block party with food, free t-shirts, and of course some choice beverages for 21+ers. Head to the Quad Lawn, Eliot Courtyard, Adams Courtyard, or Leverett Towers Courtyard.
Dinner
After the extreme sport of pregaming, you’ll surely be hungry. All of the dhalls will be closed except for Currier, Dunster, and Hillel, so head to the Yard instead. If you can make it to Yardfest, you can make it to dinner, which will be served from 5 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. in the Tercentenary Theatre.
Guests
If you’re bringing guests, hopefully you’ve already bought guest tickets as they will not be sold at the actual event. You must enter with your guest, and they get to eat dinner too!
Entry
The two entrances to Yardfest are between Pusey and Widener libraries or between Weld and University Hall, and gates open at 4:45 p.m. Make sure that you bring your HUID, and make sure not to bring any backpacks/large bags or *beverages*, and keep in mind that they may search your personal items.
Timing
If you’re trying to extend your pregame, or are more interested in the headliners than the openers, know that, based on previous years' show lengths, they probably won’t go on ’til around 6:30.
