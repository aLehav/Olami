After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite its early remonstrance of perceived human-rights violations ranging from the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay to Central Intelligence Agency detention centers around the world, the Obama administration took a step backward last week by issuing a waiver that will allow the continuation of military aid to four countries that openly employ child soldiers. The decision waives, in part, the 2008 Child Soldiers Protections Act, which prohibits the U.S. from giving military aid to countries with child soldiers unless the money will professionalize the armies and directly address the use of child soldiers—two stipulations that will not be followed, given the waiver. Administering aid to these countries was a hypocritical and harmful decision that will only perpetuate a cycle of continued human rights violations and irresponsibility.
The four nations that will continue to receive aid due to the waiver—Yemen, Sudan, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo—all employ child soldiers, some as young as 14. Although the argument was made in a State Department memorandum that the waiver was in “the national interest” and would lead to stability in the nations, there are limited benefits in this decision for the U.S. In reality, ripping families apart to recruit child soldiers only destabilizes countries further, creating resentment and tearing apart the societal fabric. All four nations are in undoubtedly treacherous situations right now, but allowing them to go forward and continue to use child soldiers will only render them even more unstable.
In defending the decision, the White House said that the intention was to allow the U.S. to work with these nations for another year before completely cutting off aid. Pushing back the deadline for these nations to comply with human rights regulations for even one year is, at this point, irresponsible. The administration has had ample time since it came into office over 20 months ago to push its partner nations to fix the problem of child soldiers in their armies. Taking another year to act on the issue means only delaying and excusing what should have happened already. By failing to enforce the deadline, the administration is demonstrating a weakness in upholding its commitments.
Furthermore, it is uncertain that the military aid will bring about the intended benefits for the nations. Oftentimes, we assume that aid will help prop up governments and weaken opposition forces, yet the results are not always as expected. It is likely that we are overly optimistic in our evaluation of the benefits of military aid and the likelihood that countries direct aid exactly where the U.S. intends it to go. In particular, it is unacceptable that even a single U.S. tax dollar might go to funding child soldiers—but it is quite possible.
The Obama administration’s decision was quite hypocritical and violates some of the basic tenets of American values, as well as many of Obama’s campaign promises. Although we understand that international affairs are a complicated network of decisions, upholding American values and the law in this situation would be beneficial both to upholding our moral integrity and to producing long-term stability worldwide.

She has sold over 13 million albums and 51 million singles.  She has been likened to Madonna, with fans arguing that she is a social phenomenon.  Now, she will enter academia.  This spring, students at the University of South Carolina will have a chance to study this icon through the course “Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame.”  Taught by Mathieu Deflem, a USC professor of sociology and a self-proclaimed Gaga fanatic, the course will examine Gaga as a “social event.”  While some critics may argue that Gaga is not worthy of academic discussion, we approve of the course to be taught at USC, especially as many professors struggle to make the material they teach in class relatable to students attempting to learn complex concepts.
Focusing on Gaga is a positive way for the professor to encourage students to engage with sociological subject matter. Lady Gaga is a unique figure in society, and, since the point of the course is to study how people become famous, it makes sense to examine her trajectory.  Of course, the professor and students should keep in mind that this is a sociology class, and thus Gaga should be taken as a case study. The instructor would do well to refrain from evangelizing the star, instead treating her in an appropriately academic manner.
We hope that Professor Deflem will succeed at translating his infatuation for Lady Gaga into a thoughtful exploration of how she became famous, ideally instilling in students an interest in studying more about human behavior. Since our culture today tends to fixate on celebrities, the study of fame as a phenomenon is certainly a relevant endeavor. For those who assume the course will be simple because of the title, the fact that it has a prerequisite suggests otherwise. The professor has demonstrated through his life choices that he feels inspired by the material he will be teaching, and we believe students will benefit from his personal interest.
Ultimately, “Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame” has the potential to be a unique course—the kind of class that students will be excited about out of a genuine interest in the subject matter.  We encourage professors to bring their passions into the academic arena more frequently, for the benefit of students.

The 18th biannual Institute  of Politics survey is out. It reports that Millenials (18-29 year olds) are significantly less enthusiastic about the electoral process now than they were just nine months ago. Only 35 percent of students report that they will definitely express themselves when 100 percent of the nation’s congressmen and women, at least 36 of our senators, and 37 of our governors are up for reelection.
I am not sure I understand the reasons behind the lowered interest by Millenials in the electoral process. Some of my political-pundit friends tell me that mid-term elections are always like this. They have neither the same glitz and excitement nor the same glamorous national conventions as elections during presidential years. But in many ways the decisions that are made are as crucial as those made in the past, and this year the concerns in front of us as an educated electorate could not be more compelling.
There are big stakes at hand with the economy in its weakened condition, the country’s armed services engaged on two foreign fronts, and our states suffering some of the tightest budgetary crunches they have experienced in years. Everything that happens in state houses, Capitol Hill, governors’ mansions, and the White House has implications for the type of job opportunities, housing choices, healthcare, and long term benefits that members of the classes of 2011-2014 can count on in both the near and the distant future.
As many students know, as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics this past year, I was deeply ensconced in the healthcare reform debate. Through it, I learned two lessons. The first is that, despite what you see on television and read in the blogs, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle were dead serious about producing the very best health-reform legislation they could. They all knew that this was a big commitment and a once-in-a-generation opportunity and they wanted to get it as right as they possibly could. The other thing is that change through legislation and regulation does not happen overnight. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 was passed on Mar. 23, 2010 and its first provisions just became active on Sept. 23, 2010. The full bill’s provisions won’t roll out until 2014. They can’t. It will take that long to make the kind of major transformation that the bill calls for.
When the new Congress comes to work after the elections, it will have some serious work on their agenda. Depending on the outcome of the election, there may be a challenge to the ACA—a call for its repeal. Also, the House will again take up the Child Nutrition Act. As a pediatrician, I see these two issues as crucial for our nation’s children and for all of our country.
The ACA was crafted with major benefits. For the first time in our history we have universal health insurance coverage. We have a heavy emphasis on preventive services including seriously needed behavioral and mental-health services. Women’s health care is strengthened in the bill. There is a great provision that allows people up to age 26 to stay on their family health insurance so that they can pursue graduate studies and other career opportunities. The ACA was debated and the debates strengthened it. The ACA was analyzed and reconfigured financially and the Congressional Budget Office reported that it lessened the deficit. The ACA was passed and is now moving into the regulatory process where there is still ample opportunity for refinement.
Repealing the Affordable Care Act would waste all the hard work that both parties have put into this major reform. It might be another decade or two before we would have legislation that would tackle the current healthcare system. Without reform, the $2.7 trillion we now spend per year on health care would have spiraled to $4 trillion per year. The United States cannot afford that.
And what about the Child Nutrition Act? Again, as many of you know, with the American Academy of Pediatrics, I have been working with the First Lady on the “Let’s Move!” initiative targeted at childhood obesity. One of the major contributors to obesity is the poor quality of the food that is offered to children in our public schools: Remember those great cafeteria school lunches of Agriculture Department leftover commodities?
The Nutrition Act has been passed by the Senate and awaits a House vote. It would greatly improve the quality of food served to children—good, fresh food for our kids. If we are going to take the obesity epidemic seriously and conquer it in this generation, we need to stop feeding children the wrong things on the taxpayer’s dollar and need to start wisely offering school students healthy lunches every day.
So, I hope the IOP is wrong. In my field, there are crucial questions on the line. There are in other fields, too. At Harvard, students study all about these questions. At the ballot box, students can do something about them.
Judith S. Palfrey ’67 is a Master of Adam’s House and the Immediate Past President of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

If you are anything like me, you can’t fly without an instant of doubt about the danger of being in an aircraft. For the last few years, that danger has mostly been the fear of terrorism, since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 or September 11th. Each time I fly, I remind myself how many flights reach their destination safely every day and shake off the thought along with the other usual fears.
The “air freight bomb plot” of last week shows that such fears—although highly unfortunate—may still be justified, as on-plane hijackers have been the biggest perceived threat recently . National Public Radio touched off a controversy by firing Juan Williams for saying that he felt nervous when he sees people who are noticeably Muslim on a flight. Williams is certainly not the only American to feel that way. But it turns out that Al-Qaeda and other organizations may be moving to a different tactic, packaging explosives and shipping them on flights. Logistics giants such as FedEx and UPS have become masters of sending packages quickly around the world, but that connectivity might have created new difficulties for counter-terrorism.
Quick shipping around the world requires private air fleets that carry only parcels and packages, and it was originally thought that these bombs traveled in the same way from their origin in Yemen. It now appears that one of the packages traveled on a Qatar Airways passenger jet. It’s a scary thought that the biggest threat we face may lie in the belly of the plane, out of sight of everyone above from passengers to air marshals. The marshals are trained to stop a hijacking attempt, but they cannot spot concealed and packaged PETN, the explosive favored by Al-Qaeda for such operations.
The pressure is on the carriers and airports to detect such materials before they travel in the air and put people at risk. In the case of the plot last week, the bombs were found—but after they had been in the air for several legs of travel. The fact that they did not detonate is fortunate but not necessarily reassuring for the future.
We have a new risk to accept and make a variable in our risk assessments of air travel. If anything, the counter-argument to that statement could just be that this risk is not even new; we just have not had the danger brought home in such fashion until last week. It’s difficult to gauge whether this is the tip of the iceberg, or a stand-alone attempt—but expect security and terrorism experts to be reviewing the tactic.
Apart from the quantifiable aspects of such a risk, there will at least be a psychological effect. It’s similar to any disaster—natural or man-made: We hear about it and think of those in the vicinity or involved, and can’t resist asking, “Was I ever at that beach/airport/building? How long ago did I walk/fly/drive by there, and could it have been friends/family/me?” Personalizing a disaster in this way is not really a bad thing. It helps us empathize and consider the people affected; we also consider our own safety by wondering how we fit in its context.
My friend and I shared this process just yesterday, when a suicide bomber injured 32 people in Taksim Square of Istanbul. We stayed in a hostel near Taksim in June, even walked through a public rally about Israel’s attack of the flotilla held in the square. The statue of Mustafa Ataturk seemed oddly juxtaposed then, as people waved Hamas flags and sang songs praising the Palestinian group. It must have seemed a poignant contrast for the New York Times journalist at the scene of yesterday’s bombing attack, who noted the proximity of the terrorist’s body to the statue in the report on the attack. Of course, basically every tourist who visits Istanbul spends time in and around Taksim Square, and many thousands pass through. Yet I would bet that my travel friend and I were not the only people to find it particularly horrific that the attack happened somewhere we knew and had been not so long ago.
Turkey has experienced bombings in past years, often by Kurdish separatists from the turbulent southeastern region of the country. This attack could have been by a Kurdish group, especially given that a truce was set to end later in the day, but it might have been a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda. Such a group murdered 28 people in a bombing in Istanbul in 2003.
Even as I grieve for those hurt in yesterday’s attack, I would still go back to Istanbul as soon as I could—I loved the city. And in a similar way, I will continue to use air travel whenever it makes sense for me. Such risks never go away. All we can do is file away their knowledge and continue with our daily routines. I, for one, will accept the variable and continue to fly. I just might not accept any packages from Yemen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About two weeks ago, the Yale fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon offended many members of the campus community with a cheer that included the following: “No means yes, yes means anal.” The ensuing backlash was further enflamed by a Yale Daily News editorial, which criticized the Yale Women’s Center for its “overreaction” to the incident as well as its history of radicalism. The Yale Daily News has since issued an editor’s note and clarified its original statement. However, the editorial’s original message, that Yale’s progressive campus environment diminishes the need for radical feminist voices, is symptomatic of a problematic view in our society that feminism is a nearly finished cause.
First, jokes about the quality of Yale’s education aside, Yale and other institutions of higher education inculcate the ideals and morals of the next generation of American leaders; campus environmental norms and values become national ones. Thus, such institutions must be held to a higher standard. The “boys will be boys” attitude expressed in the YDN editorial is unacceptable. After they graduate, these boys will go on to represent Yale, and perceived expressions of sexual violence should not be part of Yale’s legacy.
More insidiously, the editorial alleges that the radicalism of the Yale Women’s Center is unnecessary on such a “progressive campus” and fails to represent the interests of the typical Yale female. But Yale’s campus liberalism does not eliminate the need for feminism. Regardless of the battles already won, there will always be a need for radical voices on college campuses to monitor the campus climate. The purpose of organizations that represent marginalized peoples is not to appease the masses. Rather, by pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and responding to offensive behavior such as the DKE incident, the Yale Women’s Center creates dialogues and environments more accepting for the average Yale women. Indeed, it is through the radicalism of the Yale Women’s Center that the “average women” who are discussed by the editorial are able to lead more equal lives. The article’s idea that the Women’s Center fails to represent the best interests of Yale’s women misses the important role of such organizations.
Still, the problematic attitude that the battle for feminism and gender equality has already been won is hardly a problem exclusive to Yale. Sentiments similar to those expressed in the editorial that “all of us agree on gender equality” and thus that feminists have fewer legitimate battles to fight are sadly all too common in our society. The end of progressivism, and indeed of progress itself, is the result of silencing progressive voices through the assertion that society is acceptably equal.
It should be unnecessary to point out that facts still prove gender equality is not the norm. The persistence of gender income disparities demonstrates that society still does not value women’s abilities as much as their male peers. Further, despite the fraternity’s intent of humor, as Jeff Gordon, president of the Yale College Council, pointed out in a response article in the YDN, campuses across the country, including Yale, are no strangers to “sexual violence.” Nationally, domestic violence and abusive relationships still disproportionately affect women. These phenomena are not to be taken lightly. Jokes about rape are not acceptable, and their existence is proof that women’s bodies, even at Yale, are still not fully respected.

Rizwan “Riz” Khan, the host of an Al Jazeera English program that bears his name, discussed  newsworthiness in American and Middle Eastern media outlets last Friday at the Barker Center.
Invited by the South Asia Initiative, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program, Harvard Pakistan Student Group, and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Khan—a former BBC and CNN reporter—spoke about the lack of coverage of the catastrophic floods in Pakistan this past July to illustrate editorial choice and how it affects reporting.
M. Abbas Jaffer—a student at the Divinity School who introduced and concluded Khan’s talk—added that the Harvard Pakistan Student Group asked for a specific media focus on the recent floods, which affected the lives of nearly 20 million Pakistanis and led to the deaths of almost 2,000.
“We’ve seen an utter lack of coverage,” Jaffer said, “and really a lack of breadth in terms of understanding the disaster, its aftermath, and exposure to it in the U.S. and Western media.”
In contrast, “Al Jazeera did have quite a deep coverage,” he continued.
Khan, whose father is Pakistani and mother is Indian, said news outlets in the United States frequently look to make an emotional connection with their domestic audience.
“Even in international news, they’re concerned with [an] American being in the story,” Khan said. “Suddenly the importance is there.”
As a former BBC producer and CNN show host, Khan also reflected on the complex process of choosing certain stories to cover.
“There are so many stories vying for importance, and often what’s happening right now is the one that dominates,” Khan said, adding that, due to the spatial distance between the U.S. and Pakistan, reporting on the floods was not a priority for American news.
Further comparing Middle Eastern and American news sources, Khan said that news outlets in the United States often blur the boundary between objective reporting and subjective commentary.
“In America, people have to have [the news] shoved down their throats,” Khan said.
Though Al Jazeera English—launched four years ago—is a 24-hour news channel, Khan criticized the danger of demanding information instantly.
Khan turned to a slightly less serious topic when he expressed his support for The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, which he said has championed Al Jazeera in the past.
“I think he’s brilliant for what he does,” Khan said. “I would love for us to have something like that. The Arab world is not very good at laughing at itself.”

MIT saw four possibly related street robberies in the last ten days, two of which took place on Oct. 22 and the other two on Oct. 26, according to the City of Cambridge Police Department.
On Oct. 22 at 7:45 p.m., a male MIT graduate student was robbed on Broadway Street. Around half an hour later, two other MIT graduate students were robbed approximately a mile away on Albany Street.
The two incidents on Oct. 26 also occurred within a short span of time—approximately 15 minutes—though reports about the incidents appear to reflect some discrepancy about the exact locations of the crimes.
Cambridge Police Spokesman Daniel M. Riviello, in an interview with MIT’s The Tech, said that at 9:55 p.m. on Oct. 26 a MIT instructor was robbed in the 700 block of Main Street. The Cambridge Police log for Oct. 26 did not mention an incident in that loction, but did record a report of an armed robbery at the intersection of Broadway and Ellery Streets—about a mile away—at 9:55 p.m.
At 10:10 p.m. that night, a person, whose identity is not known, was robbed between 200 and 300 Mass Ave, according to The Tech. There was no record of this incident on the Cambridge Police log, but the log did record a robbery on Main Street at 10:07 p.m.
Riviello could not be reached for clarification on the locations of the robberies.
In three of the four robberies, victims reported being approached by two black males who “brandish a knife and relieved the victims of their wallets, backpacks, laptops, and cell phones,” according to an alert from the Cambridge Police Wednesday.
The CPD reports that the suspects are believed to be in their late teens or early twenties. One of them is described as “chubby” and the other “tall with a thin build and dark skin,” according to the alert.
Three of the five victims in these four robberies were white males between 25 and 30.
The CPD is still investigating the string of robberies and is sharing information with the Harvard University Police Department and MIT’s police department.

The Bertarelli Foundation—the philanthropic arm of the Swiss biotech company Serono—announced at a press conference last Friday its $9 million gift to Harvard Medical School, which will be used to establish a program fostering collaboration in neuroscience between American and Swiss researchers.
The program, dubbed the Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering, will offer a grant for students and faculty on the cutting edge of neuroscience at both HMS and its partner school in Switzerland, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).
Ernesto Bertarelli, co-president of the Bertarelli Foundation, said he has high hopes for the gift’s use.
“It’s not all about money. This program in particular has the ability to bring people together,” he said. “Although science is competitive, it advances because it is driven by collaboration. There is no lab, university, or country that can make breakthroughs on its own.”
The gift will also fund an endowed professorship at HMS, the Bertarelli Professorship in Translational Medical Science, and finance an annual neuroscience symposium to be held alternatively in Boston and Lausanne.
The press conference last Friday was preceded by a reception for Swiss delegates, Harvard Medical School officials, and the media. Among the Swiss delegates were Didier Burkhalter—head of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs and Minister of Health, Science, and Culture—and Patrick Aebischer, president of EPFL.
According to Aebischer, the Bertarelli gift will support research on neuromotor treatments. Existing treatments are less than ideal, he said, adding that, although treating neuromotor deficiencies by implanting electrodes in the brain has improved the lives of people with the condition, such treatment “is invasive—and when the battery dies, the patient can’t move anymore.”
HMS and EPFL already have collaborated on brain research. Aebischer discussed one initiative of the universities’ partnership—a program code-named “the Blue Brain Project” that uses supercomputers to model the inner workings of the brain.
Working with Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard and EPFL also recently published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) about the structure of the brain in children 2 to 18 years of age.
This latest collaboration between HMS and EPFL will include research aiming to create next-generation hearing aids, according to HMS Executive Dean of Research William W. Chin.
The incumbent of the chair endowed by the Bertarelli gift, Chin will also oversee the implementation of a pipeline from device development at EPFL to clinical testing at HMS, and will coordinate academic exchange between the two schools.
“The challenges of neuroscience and sensory loss will not be solved overnight, but we need to get started,” Chin said. “And we need to have hope—hope will be the thing that allows us to envision future opportunities.”

Richard T. Gill ’48, an influential economist, late-blooming opera singer, and former Master of Leverett House, died on Oct. 25 in Providence, RI. He was 82.
Gill became an assistant dean of Harvard College at the age of 21, rising through various administrative positions before assuming the post of Leverett House Master. Gill also taught Economics 1—the predecessor to today’s Social Analysis 10.
“He was obviously an outstanding teacher and everyone wanted to be in his section,” Professor of Economics Stephen A. Marglin ’59, a freshman when Gill was teaching a section, wrote in an e-mail. “I didn’t get in.”
His students remember him as “an engaging lecturer” with an “enthusiastic” and “exuberant” teaching style, according to Benjamin M. Friedman ’66.
Entering Harvard at the age of 16, Gill served in the occupation force in Japan before graduating summa cum laude in economics in 1948.
But those outside Harvard remember him as more than just an academic or an administrator.
While at Harvard, Gill began singing lessons as a way to curb his heavy smoking habit. Despite having had little experience with opera, he improved at an astonishing speed as a low bass. He subsequently played Count Almaviva in a 1967 Leverett House Opera production of “Marriage of Figaro,” co-directed by John C. Adams ’69—now a noted composer—and John A. Lithgow ’67—now a Hollywood actor.
“His voice is as majestic as his bearing”, a 1967 Crimson review of the opera noted.
Four years later, Gill drew national media attention by announcing that he was giving up his tenured position at Harvard to become an opera singer with the New York City Opera. His contract enabled him to sing two shows for $75 each.
“It took a lot of courage to make such a large and what seemed to me at least very risky career change”, wrote Emeritus Economics Professor Dwight H. Perkins in an e-mail. “I was even more impressed when he clearly made a success of it.”
Gill eventually sang with the Metropolitan Opera 86 times and toured internationally, in an opera career that spanned 14 years.
“If I failed, there was no way to return to Harvard,” Gill told The Crimson in 1998.
Yet Gill did not stop exploring. In the late 1980s, he helped to launch “Economics USA,” a telecourse for college and high school students, serving as its writer and on-air analyst in all 28 episodes of the series.
In addition to a large collection of published research, Gill also wrote fiction. Marglin remembers stumbling across a story called “The Code” in a 1957 edition of the New Yorker and being “so impressed” that he checked who the author was, only to find that it was Gill.
“Now there’s a multi-talent, I thought,” Marglin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Citizenship, Commitment, Scholarship and Courage,” reads a motto painted onto a school hallway. The inspirational graffiti is a play on the acronym of the Community Charter School of Cambridge, one of two charter high schools in Cambridge.
Since its founding in 2004, CCSC has aimed to close the racial achievement gap in Cambridge, attracting 80 percent African American and five percent Latino students, most of whom come from economically disadvantaged families.
The school’s teachers, however, come from the opposite end of the spectrum. One-third of the school’s teaching staff graduated from Harvard College or a Harvard graduate program, according to its Chief Communications Officer Justin T. Martin.
As it enters its sixth year, with two graduating classes and alumni at Cornell, Swarthmore, Boston College and at several University of Massaschusetts campuses, the charter school has its share of successes and continues to strive to resolve lingering issues.
MODEL SCHOOL
Located in an atypical school setting—occupying multiple floors of a former office space—CCSC prides itself in its uniqueness, says Paula Evans, Head of School and also one of the school’s founders.
Though only six years old, CCSC has been recognized by Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 as a 2010 Commendation School, an honor presented to schools that have helped to close the achievement gap.
All CCSC sophomores passed the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, with 92 percent of students receiving a score of “proficient” or better in language arts and 74 percent receiving similar marks in mathematics and sciences. In comparison, 56 percent of African American students in Cambridge Public Schools performed below average this year according to a CPS report.
Teachers attribute the school’s success to its focus on individualized support for its students through individual attention.
“All of our students get to know the adults and teachers in the building. [Teachers] get to know every student through advising,” says teacher Laura R. Fleming, who received her masters from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Math teacher Laura A. Sheppard-Brick, also an HGSE graduate, agrees with the sentiment.
“Teachers have a lot more autonomy and smaller number of students,” she says.
A CHARTER’S CHALLENGES
The school is open to the entire Cambridge community and admits students by lottery, a system that has forced teachers to work with students starting at very different academic levels.
William D. Connell, who is also an HSGE graduate and teaches 10th-grade humanities, thinks that the “managing that kind of span” is the most challenging aspect of teaching at CCSC. There are sometimes students who join CCSC at later grades who are four to five grades behind, he says.
According to Evans, 20 percent of the students at the school are enrolled in its special education program.
“It was more of a commitment than working at a normal public or private school,” teacher Sherelle S. Ferguson ’08 says. “But if you let it, you can let it consume your life because you want the students so badly to achieve.”
While students are admitted on a first-come, first-serve basis, staff hiring is much more selective, according to Evans.
YOUNG VETERANS
According to Evans, both teachers and students are held to higher standards. And because the school itself is young and boasts a young teaching staff, teachers become leaders early in their careers. Katherine E. Rieser ’07, who has only taught for four years, is already considered a veteran among her peers.
According to Evans, CCSC teachers are told they should expect to put in 60-65 hours of work every week.
“We are building a strong academic culture of the school. We are continuing to bring new teachers. We have high expectations for academics and behaviors,” she says.
Several teachers agree that their experience at Harvard helped prepare them for their tough teaching schedule.
“My days at Harvard translated to a highly structured program,” Rieser says.
“A Harvard experience give you a sense of the skills you need in school,” Ferguson says. “Charter schools are hardcore.”
For Ferguson, who was involved with several activities at Phillips Brooks House that prepared her for this position, it was easy to translate her “training of doing so many different things” to the class room setting.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
While the rigourous curriculum and behavioral standards of CSCC have had tangible benefits, some students still find the strictness difficult to handle.
“It was hard to have a dress code for me,” recalls Steven Rodenas, now a sophomore at Boston College.
“Those that were able to stay enjoyed it, [but] some could not handle the workload,” Rodenas said, noting that some of his peers at CCSC transferred to other schools. The majority of students lost have been male, Connell notes.
Several teachers agree that the school still faces problems of retention.
Accordingt to Sheppard-Brick, “that’s always going to be a problem with a school that has higher standards.”
“We need to make sure that we’re retaining students. It’s a really rigorous environment. Some students are not ready to rise to the expectations,” Connell says. “[But] I’ve seen what happens when they stay with us.”

CORRECTION: November 1, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 1 news article "Charter School Promotes High Expectations" incorrectly stated that the Community Charter School of Cambridge is the city’s only charter school. In fact, it is one of two charter high schools in Cambridge. Prospect Hill Academy Charter also has a high school campus in Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three days after a University Health Services administrator called Four Loko “badness in a can” at an event about discipline at the College, Harvard health officials issued a warning against the consumption of the caffeinated alcoholic beverage that, amid rising popularity, has been receiving nationwide scrutiny.
In an e-mail to students sent through House officials on Friday, UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 and Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Director Ryan M. Travia urged students not to drink Four Loko, saying that one 23.5-ounce can contains the equivalent of six standard servings of alcohol and five cups of coffee.
“Dozens of college students around the country—including Harvard—have required medical treatment as a result of consuming this alcoholic beverage,” they wrote. “We strongly recommend that members of the Harvard community do NOT drink Four Loko and urge your friends to do the same.”
A malt beverage available in a variety of flavors, Four Loko combines alcohol with stimulants like caffeine, guarana, and taurine—a mix that Harvard health officials and other doctors deem hazardous.
“Drinking alcohol with energy drinks is dangerous, given the inherent risk in mixing alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants such as caffeine, ginseng, guaran, and other additives,” Rosenthal and Travia wrote in the e-mail. “Often, stimulants mask the depressant effects of the alcohol, allowing the person to consume even more alcohol and thus, delaying feelings of drunkenness.”
In a statement, Phusion Projects, the Chicago-based company that makes Four Loko, said that it would be “unfair to blame the manufacturer of Four Loko—or the manufacturer of any other single alcoholic product—for abusive or illegal use.”
“Making college campuses safe and healthy environments for learning is a goal we share with administrators—even those who have chosen to ban our products or to single them out in this way,” the company said.
In the past, Phusion Projects has defended the amount of alcohol and caffeine in cans of Four Loko, saying that they “contain less alcohol than an average rum and cola [and] less alcohol and caffeine than an average Red Bull and vodka.”
The advisory issued by Harvard followed a similar announcement made to students at Boston College last week, prompting one Harvard College administrator to “wonder if we’re behind the curve in not being more vocal against its negative effects,” according to an e-mail thread forwarded to a House list.
At other schools, hospitalizations have led to condemnations of the beverage by university officials. Ramapo College of New Jersey, a school in Mahwah, N.J., banned Four Loko after 23 students were hospitalized for alcohol-related reasons, and Central Washington University prohibited alcoholic energy drinks after nine freshmen were hospitalized after drinking Four Loko at a party in Roslyn, Wash.
In a statement sent by a UHS spokeswoman, Travia wrote that incidents related to Four Loko around the country spurred UHS to “get information out to the Harvard community about Four Loko and the risks associated with its use.”
Students at the College said that they welcomed the e-mail, and some said that the warning could even affect future drinking habits.
“It’s a legitimate concern. I did not know just how much alcohol and just how much caffeine were in Four Loko,” said Allan S. Bradley ’11. “I have not tried Four Loko, and I am less likely to try Four Loko because of the information in the e-mail.”
Others, though, said that the e-mail would have a limited effect.
“I feel completely unaffected by the e-mail,” said Joesph H. Corning ’11. “It’s nice to have a reminder that we should drink in moderation, but that’s nothing new.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students gathered at the Adams Pool Theater last Friday to listen as their peers presented lectures on a wide array of topics, ranging from a discourse on traditionalism to a costumed presentation about Einstein’s theory of special relativity.
During this third-ever “Harvard Student Lecture Series”—organized by the Harvard Diggers Society—seven student speakers talked for ten minutes each about an intellectual topic of their choice. The speakers were chosen on a first come, first served basis.
“There is no exclusivity or screening of speeches,” said Talia B. Lavin ’12, one of the organizers and a founding member of the Diggers, a group that seeks to foster a sense of community on campus based on intellectual passion. “We want to make the ground of public discourse fertile again at Harvard.”
Spencer B. L. Lenfield ’12 opened the event with a speech on Alfred Tennyson’s poem “In Memoriam” and the making of modern poetry. Exploring Tennyson’s use of poetry to grieve the loss of a close friend, Lenfield brought up the notion of poetry as an art form that transcends textual meaning and authorizes us to feel without having to explain.
Max D. Novendstern ’12 followed with a discussion on “Gov 2.0,” the commodification of government processes and data, as a tool of civic engagement. “Gov 2.0 is as old as the American democracy itself,” he said. “Its promise is to restore the conception of government as a platform that allows you to connect with fellow citizen to solve problems.”
Laura M. Hogikyan ’14 delivered a speech titled “Playing” that examined the realm of theater. “It is a world in which everything is intensified and possible,” she said. “You have to suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to be inspired.”
Noam J. Hassenfeld ’12 then delved into the intersection between tradition and innovation. Drawing from his Jewish upbringing, he discussed different ways of thinking about tradition and finally tipped the scale in favor of the view that tradition is dynamic and that human control of tradition is a good thing.
Lester C. Kim ’11 followed, dressed as Einstein, with a presentation on the theory of special relativity and its implications for time and space travel.
Co-President of True Love Revolution Rachel L. Wagley ’11 considered the clash of traditionalist and secular orthodoxies in modern American culture. She touched on a wide scope of issues including moral relativism, moral rhetoric and contraceptive justice.
Brett A. Rosenberg ’12 concluded the event with a presentation titled “‘Van’-dalism,” discussing her admiration of Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States.
Members of the audience said they were largely satisfied with the quality of the speeches and their delivery.
“The event did not disappoint,” Abigail B. Lind ’12 said. “I have a lot of admiration for people who can pull off public speaking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—They say the exception proves the rule.
If the rule was that Dartmouth’s offensive line has been impenetrable all fall, then the one sack the Big Green had allowed before Saturday would have somehow proven Dartmouth’s prowess on the line of scrimmage.
But on Oct. 30 in Hanover, N.H., the exception was the rule.
Where others saw a wall, Harvard’s defensive line saw an open gate. Heading into the contest, the Big Green hadn’t allowed a sack since the first half of its first game, but the Crimson found its way to four on Saturday.
“[Defensive coordinator Scott] Larkee’s very good at mixing up not only the coverage but also the blitzing, so I felt like we were getting back there more than usual,” said senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz. “And we kind of just threw him off and made him uncomfortable, and the defense...made some great plays.”
Ortiz made quite a few of those himself, but it was his first sack on Big Green quarterback Connor Kempe that was most resounding. The third-quarter play seemed to have implications greater that the eight-yard loss it produced.
“Every time you play someone, you’re sending a message out to the rest of the league,” Ortiz said.
Most immediate was message the tackle sent out to his teammates. After Ortiz made a second sack, Alex Norman and Chuks Obi followed his lead, posting back-to-back sacks in the fourth quarter for a total loss of seven yards in two plays. Norman, a sophomore, struck first for a six-yard loss, while senior Obi set Kempe back one more yard on the following play.
TOSS-UP
Many teams will attest to the importance of a strong start. The Big Green seems to eschew that philosophy: after six games, it had yet to get on the board first. In four of those, Dartmouth won the coin toss, deferred possession, and then watched as its opponents scored on the opening drives. Yet when the Big Green won the coin toss Saturday, it deferred again.
The strategy backfired as it has all season. Before five minutes had elapsed, the Crimson had already put up seven points and had gained hold of the momentum. Harvard would go on to score 24 points before Dartmouth finally got on the board off a punt return by Shawn Abuhoff.
The Big Green’s early struggles are not entirely the result of coin-toss decisions. In the only game when Dartmouth chose to start with the ball, it failed to secure a first down on its opening drive, and its opponent, Penn, went on to score seven soon after.
But whether or not a coin-toss decision can be blamed, it’s clear that the Big Green’s strategy for its opening minutes isn’t working. Its seven opponents have all scored on their opening drive, and only Bucknell and Sacred Heart had to settle for a field goal.
ROLE REVERSAL
Had Dartmouth not given up 24 points so quickly, the end result might have been different. After charging to a commanding 27-7 lead at the end of the first half, Harvard never made it into the end zone in the second half, scoring only once on a David Mothander field goal in the third quarter while punting on its other three possessions. The Big Green outscored the Crimson, 7-3, in the second half. But the score itself doesn’t tell the full story of Dartmouth’s second half surge. A missed field goal and a completion failure in the endzone spoiled what could have been 10 more Big Green points.
But Dartmouth’s moments of brilliance proved to be too little, too late, as Harvard’s 20-point first half lead was too much to overcome.
“We didn’t figure it out until maybe the third quarter, and by that time it was too late,” said Dartmouth senior wide receiver Tim McManus. “Obviously we had a chance down towards the end that made it exciting. But unfortunately that’s not what we came out to do. We came out to win, but it was good to see us bounce back and execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—We’re nearing the home stretch of the 2010 football season, and for the Ancient Eight, it’s been a tale of two leagues. At the beginning of the year, it appeared that Ivy teams were moving towards parity, with recent doormats Dartmouth and Princeton showing signs of life. But with four conference games in the books, the Ivy League has once again split into its hierarchy.
Defending champion Penn sits alone at the top, its unbeaten record intact after a 24-7 spanking of Brown. Harvard sits at the next level of the Ancient Eight pyramid, tied with Yale and the Bears at 3-1, while the lower half of the league is an exact mirror, with three more teams owning a 1-3 record and winless Princeton alone at the bottom.
Realistically, then, it’s a four-team race to the top, and as far as Harvard is concerned, the crown is still very much within reach.
The 21st-ranked Quakers looked every bit as good as advertised on Saturday, yielding just a kick return for a touchdown against Brown. Since Penn has already topped Yale, only a matchup with the Crimson seems to stand between the squad and another outright title. Of course, Harvard will be sure to make its own statement. Despite its early-season loss to the Bears, recent history may favor a Crimson comeback.
“Even with the loss, I mean we were in this position [two years ago],” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “We lost at Brown, still had a chance at the end to win, and we were able to take advantage of it and win out and...get a share of [the Ivy title]. So that’s been our mission, and that’s what we’re going to set out to do these last three games.”
Winning out is by no means a given for this Crimson team, as matchups with Penn and Yale follow this coming weekend’s contest against Columbia, but Harvard still controls its own destiny. With the Bears and Bulldogs set for a showdown next Saturday, at least one of the single-loss teams will fall out of contention, and we could easily see at least two teams hoisting a collective trophy.
That is, if the Crimson maintains the full-team brilliance it displayed in Hanover. With Winters back under center and both running backs looking stronger each week, Harvard’s offense appears as potent and balanced as it promised in Week 1.
Sophomore Treavor Scales and senior Gino Gordon continued to share the ball effectively, rolling for 124 and 93 yards on the ground, respectively, and it was Winters who got the rushing touchdowns, getting over the goal line twice with his legs.
Like any good head coach, Tim Murphy will emphasize this week that Harvard isn’t looking past the Columbia game, but every Ivy League football fan will be salivating at the matchup between this group and Penn’s rushing defense. Since the Quakers have allowed just 66 yards per game and three total rushing touchdowns, something has to give. And while many people will be chalking it up as Penn’s advantage, the Crimson has every reason to be confident. Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens prides himself on the Big Green’s ability to get leverage at the line of scrimmage, but Harvard made it clear on Saturday that its players up front are the ones in top form.
“They’ve got some pretty stout ballplayers on both sides, specifically on the offensive and defensive lines,” Teevens said. “I mentioned offensively, we weren’t getting the surge off the ball that we’ve had to date, and they were. They got a pretty good push against our guys, and that’s why they [had] second and two, second and one.”
Running the table is never easy in the Ivy League, even with most of the season gone. But with a rapidly-improving offensive line, the Crimson’s balanced running game may be exactly what gets it there. Three difficult Ivy games remain, but Harvard should still be setting its sights on the crown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 3-3 tie against Yale on Friday, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team garnered its first win of the season against Brown Saturday afternoon. The 4-2 victory over the Bears (0-3-0, 0-2-0 ECAC) was the product of a team-wide effort by the Crimson (1-0-1, 1-0-1 ECAC), which controlled the ice from the starting whistle.
“I think we came out with much more intensity than [Friday] night,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We possessed the puck really well and dominated the majority of the game.”
In the first period alone, the Crimson outshot Brown, 13-7, and recorded a 41-15 advantage on the game, forcing Bear goalie Aubree Moore to make an impressive 37 saves.
Moore was able to protect the cage throughout most of the first period, shutting her opponent out until Harvard, with the stick of sophomore Josephine Pucci, put one into the back of the net with just over a minute left to play.
Pucci, from a great individual effort, was able to stop a Brown breakaway at the blue line and weave through the Bears’ defense until finally putting the puck into the top corner of the net, securing the first goal of the game.
The long wait for a finish in the opening period proved to be trying for the Crimson.
“It gets frustrating when [a scoring opportunity] is right there, because you know you’re doing the right thing and making the right plays,” sophomore Jillian Dempsey said. “We did a really good job of staying composed and keeping up the attack. It’s all about how you capitalize on the next chance.”
The second period was a continuation of Harvard’s domination, in which it posted two back-to-back goals halfway through the frame. The Crimson again outshot Brown, keeping the Bears to only two shots.
Tri-captain Liza Ryabkina struck first for Harvard, taking advantage of a pass from sophomore Kaitlin Spurling and one-timing it past the reach of Moore.
Dempsey echoed the effort only 58 seconds later, finishing the rebound of a shot from freshman Gina McDonald, which came off the foot of an overworked Moore.
“We just talked about it being big to come right out and get after them right away,” Stone said. “It was important that the kids don’t try to finesse plays, just get to the net and bang it home.”
Although the Crimson allowed only two shots in the second period, Brown was able to put itself on the board with the help of a power-play man advantage. Erica Kromm narrowed Harvard’s 3-0 lead off a shot just beyond the crease, taking control of a pass from teammate Alena Polenska. The goal was Kromm’s second of the season and Polenska’s second assist.
The Bears took a lesson from the Crimson and upped the intensity from the start of the third period, notching another goal in the opening five minutes of play. Polenska pulled her team within one from a close-range goal off passes from Samantha Woodward and Laurie Jolin four minutes in.
“I got a little nervous for a second—anyone in a 3-2 game would be,” Dempsey said. “You’re ahead and next thing you know, you’re tied, and there’s a huge momentum shift.”
But rather than crumbling under the pressure, Harvard responded with a goal of its own following back-to-back penalties committed by Brown. With a 5-on-3 advantage, tri-captain Leanna Coskren gave her team an insurance goal, securing the Crimson victory.
“You can either demoralize yourself of you can just say, ‘Hey, let’s go, let’s go get ourselves another goal,’” Stone said. “We just have to keep playing our game...it’s just a matter of staying focused for the entire time it takes to win the game.”
This is the second straight game in which Harvard has recorded over 40 shots while keeping its opponent to under 20, a straightforward formula for victory.
Despite the help from her defense, sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy made 13 saves on the night, many coming at key moments in the game.
The undefeated opening weekend—with a tie on Friday and win on Saturday—gives the young Crimson team a positive start from which to assemble a successful season.
“I hope [the weekend] is something to build on,” Stone said. “We have a lot of young kids in a lot of key spots...but, as a result [of this weekend], we’ve gained a lot of confidence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were 14 seconds on the clock when tri-captain Liza Ryabkina launched a laser of a shot from the left circle. And when the puck found the back of the net, Bright Hockey Center erupted in celebration.
But what felt like a game-winner was just a shot that let the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team escape with a tie in a game that should have been a win.
The Crimson slipped up in its season opener on Friday night, fighting back to a 3-3 tie with conference rival Yale (0-2-2, 0-1-1 ECAC).
“I felt that we shouldn’t have been in that position,” Ryabkina said of her last-second goal. “It felt great, but at the same time, we really wanted to win this game, so we were a little bit disappointed.”
Despite getting off more than three times as many shots as the Bulldogs, Harvard’s offense struggled to find the back of the net while the defense had trouble shutting down Yale’s few quality chances.
The Crimson got off to a strong start, putting six shots on goal before the Bulldogs could muster one. And when Yale goaltender Jackee Snikeris left the game eight minutes in with an injury—putting untested sophomore Erin Callahan in the cage—it seemed that Harvard had caught a break.
“We put a lot of pressure on them, and they did a really good job,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Their goaltender did a great job stepping in—sometimes that infuses a lot of energy.”
And the Bulldogs channeled that energy towards getting on the scoreboard first.
On a power play generated by tri-captain Kate Buesser’s interference penalty, Yale senior Bray Ketchum fed a pass to rookie Jackie Raines, who cut across the ice and beat sophomore netminder Laura Bellamy on a shot from the right circle.
The Bulldogs’ first lead didn’t last long. Just over two minutes later, freshman Marissa Gedman hit senior Katharine Chute in transition. The winger juked past a few defenders before flicking the puck just inside the left post to knot the score at one.
Yale stormed back with 2:35 to play in the first with another power-play goal. Once again, the freshmen got it done for the Bulldogs, with Jennifer Lawrence finding the right side of the net off a pass from Aurora Kennedy.
Forty seconds later, sophomore Jillian Dempsey received a game misconduct penalty after laying a massive hit on Heather Grant from behind. Suddenly, Harvard was facing five straight minutes of penalty kill with one of its top forwards in the locker room.
“It was tough to lose Dempsey, but I thought we weathered that storm really well,” Stone said. “We made some adjustments, which is a testament to our depth.”
The defense tightened up during the kill, holding Yale scoreless despite a few good looks in front of the net early in the second period. Harvard then got its own opportunities on offense with a pair of long 5-on-3 advantages.
Though it failed to capitalize on the first, Ryabkina didn’t let the second chance slip away.
Buesser played the puck up from the corner to Gedman, who sent in a shot from the blue line. Ryabkina tipped the shot past Callahan, tying the score once again.
Gedman’s two assists marked her first career collegiate points.
“She played well—she’s tough, she’s a winner,” Stone said of Gedman. “She knows how to do it. She wants to make things happen, [and] she has a great feel for the game.”
The Crimson came out strong to start the third period, shutting the Bulldogs down on a power-play chance and limiting Yale to just four shots in the frame. But one of those four put the Bulldogs on top again.
With just over nine minutes left in regulation, a series of Bulldog shots forced Bellamy to sprawl onto the ice. Though the sophomore stopped the initial barrage, Alyssa Zupon was finally able to slip one past her to make the score 3-2.
Harvard picked up its play in the final minutes of the period, but Yale managed to hold off the onslaught until the final seconds. Grant was sent to the box for bodychecking with 1:52 to play, and Stone pulled Bellamy with 40 seconds on the clock to give her squad a 6-on-4 advantage.
After sophomore Josephine Pucci clanged a shot off the crossbar, the Crimson offense regrouped. Tri-captain Leanna Coskren set up Ryabkina high in the left circle, and Ryabkina’s slapshot was dead on.
“We’re going to ride the seniors and expect a lot from them,” Stone said. “They’re ready to go, and they know how things have been done in the past, and you’re going to see that all year.”
Although Harvard dominated play in overtime, getting off four shots to the Bulldogs’ zero, it couldn’t capitalize on a power play and the game ended in a 3-3 deadlock.
Callahan—who had played just 20 minutes total last season—finished with 32 saves.
The game also marked Joakim Flygh’s return to Bright. Flygh, an assistant with the Crimson for the last three seasons, was named Yale’s head coach in late July.
But though Flygh came close to earning a major upset in his first conference game as head coach, Harvard’s depth proved to be too much in the end.
“Like I just said to the kids, it took a lot of character to come back,” Stone said. “It was a great hockey game, and again, it was exciting that we were able to tie it up. But I think I would have liked to see us strike first and get after it instead of playing catch-up all the time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Big Crimson Halloween Invitational, Harvard men’s tennis offered a number of its less experienced players the chance to get a few more games under their belts before spring play begins.
“[This was] an end-of-the-season tournament to get more matches for the players who needed it,” said Crimson assistant coach Andrew Rueb ’95. “We needed more chances to play tournaments. This helps us build for spring and our team competition.”
The Harvard-hosted invitational ran from Friday until yesterday afternoon in the Murr Center and featured players from Amherst, Brown, Dartmouth, MIT, and Tufts.
Dartmouth’s Xander Centenari pulled out a win in the Singles A Flight final yesterday morning, while a Brown team defeated another pair of fellow Bears in the Doubles A Draw final later that afternoon.
No Harvard players advanced to any of the four final rounds.
“Results-wise, we didn’t do as well as we expected to,” junior Jonathan Pearlman said. “We worked on different doubles plays and different skills that we’ve been working on and been developing for the spring.”
Despite the disappointing results for the Crimson, junior Mac McAnulty made a strong appearance in the Singles A Flight Consolation final, and the doubles pair of Pearlman and sophomore Will McNamee had a very good showing in the Doubles A Draw Consolation final.
Pearlman and McNamee won their consolation round, 9-8, 8-6, but according to Rueb, McAnulty had the best performance of the weekend, even though it culminated in a 6-1 loss to Brown freshman Brandon Burke in the third set of the final.
“Mac just brought this kind of energy, and he had a lot of determination,” Rueb said. “He’s very physically powerful, and now he’s becoming more dogged and stingy in not giving up free points.”
Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien used this tournament as a chance to return to play for the first time after his recent shoulder surgery.
He lost in the second round but managed to beat Burke within two sets of his opening match.
“Aba played a very strong first round for coming off a shoulder injury,” Rueb said. “It gave us a window into what his game might look like in the spring if he stays healthy.”
While several of the Crimson’s players spent the weekend resting and recovering from last week’s regional tournament, the team nevertheless benefitted from the learning experience provided by the Halloween Invitational.
“Everyone’s leaving this weekend hungry to get more matches and ready to win,” Rueb said.

The Harvard women’s field hockey team suffered yet another close loss to Dartmouth this Saturday at Chase Astroturf field. For the third time this season, the Crimson lost in overtime after putting on a strong defensive performance during regulation. In the sixth minute of overtime, with both teams scoreless, Big Green sophomore Lisa Masini took the ball into the Harvard circle, spun one way to draw Crimson goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, and put the ball past the sophomore into the left corner of the net for the game-winner.
Harvard (3-13, 1-5 Ivy) could not break its eight-game losing streak, and with the loss, dropped to the bottom of the conference. Dartmouth (9-6, 3-3 Ivy), on the other hand, snapped out of its own four-game losing streak to establish itself firmly in the middle of the conference.
“It was definitely a huge step up from the BC game,” sophomore Kim Goh said, “and from a lot of other games we’ve played. We put together a lot of pieces we tried to work on throughout the season. It was definitely a hard-fought game, and we put a lot into it, but it didn’t come out our way in the end. We were definitely happy with the way we executed the game plan and worked together to pull off a team effort.”
From beginning to end, the game was a stalemate between two very aggressive defenses. Neither team could  get its offense flowing due to the quickness of the other team’s interceptions and counterattacks.
“Practically, we had a lot of great defensive intercepts,” Goh said. “What allowed us to do that was because the forwards really understood their role in putting on good pressure on the defense that threw away bad passes, and our midfielders and defenders could pick those up and start up a counterattack. We had a lot more goal-scoring opportunities than we have in the past that came off the counterattacks.”
The Big Green held a slight edge in shots, 10-8, and in penalty corners, 8-5, but could not capitalize on any of its opportunities. Just a minute before Masini’s game-winner, Dartmouth senior Kelly McHenry had a chance to end it early with a great look to the goal, but Tassopoulos made a great low save to keep the shutout going.
“Cynthia is basically the best player on the team,” freshman Mariah Pewarksi said. “She sees the whole field. She is the mind of us all and tells us where to go. She is the loudest out there. Besides helping us all out, she does her part really well, and she has a great percentage of saves.”
Tassopoulos made four saves throughout the game, and Big Green goalie junior Meagan Vakiener tallied three saves, all of which came from the desperate Crimson offense late in the second half. Harvard’s best chance came with a brilliant give-and-go play that fell just short as Vakiener made a critical kick save to send the game into overtime.
“There are fewer girls on the field [during overtime],” Pewarksi said. “Only six field players as opposed to 10. It was mentally draining. Since it’s sudden death, you try a lot harder and run a lot faster, because you know once you score it is over.”
Harvard co-captain KJ Warren made her season debut after missing time since 2008 due to injury, playing 11 minutes and getting one shot.
“It was awesome,” Goh said. “She was out all of last year. She brings a great energy to the team regardless of where she is, even if she is on the sideline, but to be able to play with her was awesome. In the [second-to-last] game of her collegiate athletic career, not only did she play well, but considering she hasn’t played in so long, she brought a lot to the field and to our defensive end. The energy and the excitement of being there to play gets everyone going and gives us an extra kick for us to remember why we want to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One spring season has gone and another remains off in the distance. The leaves have changed color, and crew teams take to the water for longer head-race pieces instead of 2Ks. But there are some things that seasons can’t change, and the rivalry between the Harvard and Princeton lightweight rowing teams seems to be one of them.
After a Head of the Charles in which the Tigers stole the show, the Crimson proved that the rivalry is still a battle of equals yesterday on Lake Carnegie, Princeton’s home course.
The teams traded places, with the Tigers winning the Lightweight 8+ and Harvard taking top honors in the Lightweight 4+.
“We’re happy. It looks like we’ve improved from last week,” Crimson coach Charley Butt said. “We know that we have quality through the entire lineup.”
On Carnegie’s head-racing course this past weekend, crews raced in a tailwind for a little over half the race, took a sharp turn, and finished the race in a headwind. Harvard’s top four, which had been in second place in the first part of the race, took advantage of the shift.
The Crimson’s top four, which usually rates slightly lower than Princeton, according to captain Will Newell, was able to use a long, powerful rhythm in the headwind  to take it to the top of the fours competition. That four, consisting of Newell, juniors Tom Nesel and coxswain Angela Chang, and sophomores Matt O’Leary and Erich Schultze, topped second-place Georgetown by nearly eight seconds, with the Tigers finishing over 12 seconds behind Harvard for a third-place finish.
The Crimson’s other three fours placed fourth, fifth, and ninth, making Harvard the deepest team in that event. In fact, its fourth boat beat the top entries of five teams: Yale, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, Navy, and MIT.
“It was very gratifying to see everyone perform well,” Butt said. “That just means we’re working on the right things, we’re making improvements. The adjustments we’re making are, for all we know, correct.”
But while the Crimson took the cake in the fours races, the home team had its way in the eights.
Princeton’s A boat edged out Harvard’s by a little over three seconds to win the race.
The Crimson was five seconds ahead of the Tigers after the first half of the race, but Princeton was able reel in Harvard in the back half.
“It was a very good race,” junior Austin Meyer said. “Last weekend at the Charles, we were 15 seconds behind Princeton. So we came in with a fresh perspective, a more relaxed team atmosphere. Overall, the race was really really good and promising.”
The Tigers B boat took fourth overall, while the seventh-place finish by Harvard’s B boat was good for second among B entries. The Crimson’s C boat finished 22nd overall.
While the races finished without controversy, Halloween was not without its tricks, and Harvard’s freshmen were one of its targets. During its warm-up, the Crimson’s top freshman boat lost its skeg, leaving the rookies to race without the steering device on their boat’s stern.
“It didn’t really contribute to boat speed,” freshman coach Linda Muri said. “They had stopped to get some water, they blew a little closer to shore [and] ran into a partially submerged stump, [which] broke the skeg off.”
But despite the setback, the freshmen still managed to place ninth in the Freshman 8+ race, an event that included heavyweights.
“Persevering in that kind of adversity: that’s a challenge you don’t expect,” Muri said. “That’s just the nature of a head race. We saw a number of boats that had lost skegs. It’s pretty easy to tell a crew [without a skeg] by its steering.”
“We feel like they did well,” Butt added. “To their credit, they didn’t panic, they just rowed hard without a skeg.”
Harvard’s second boat, which consisted entirely of walk-ons, finished 30th in what was the first race for all of its members. The rookies turned it a time of 16:08.5. The time put the Crimson near the bottom of pack, but the boat still managed to beat Princeton’s second heavyweight 8+.
“I talked to them about how fast a race goes by,” Muri said. “It’s hard to know what to expect the first time. They felt like they rowed well, they had some balance at times. I can’t expect them to have a perfect race.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to outrun a Tiger.
The Harvard cross country team ran with all its might, but fell short against its competitors at the annual Heptagonal Championships on Friday in Bronx, N.Y. Out of the eight Ivy League teams competing at the meet, the women managed to nab fifth place, while the men took sixth. The men stood at sixth place in last year’s Heps, but the women dropped three places from second last season.
The Princeton Tigers dominated the competition this year, capturing the men’s and women’s team and individual titles, as well as placing four runners in the top 10 in both the men’s and women’s races. Captain Dan Chenoweth and junior Jeanne Mack proved to be the Crimson standouts, setting the pace and leading the teams with the best times for Harvard.
“Overall, I think the team competed hard,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “I think the best thing about the Ivy League Championships is that the teams are so close. We just came up a little bit short of what we were hoping for.”
The Crimson men wrapped up the event with 141 points, well behind the Tigers’ total of 33 points, but managed to slip ahead of Brown and Yale. Chenoweth took second at the meet, leading the Harvard men but falling just short in his hopes of a title defense. He completed the 8K course in a time of 24:14.0, only 10 seconds behind Princeton’s Donn Cabral, who finished in 24:03.8.
“I was kind of disappointed not to get the win,” Chenoweth said, “but I tried my best, so I guess that’s all you can really do.”
Though Chenoweth proved that experience pays off, the rookies also stepped up into the role of leading the team. In the first Heps meet of his career, freshman Aaron Watanabe placed 22nd overall, crossing the finish line in 25:11.1. Two other freshmen scorers for the Crimson men were James Leakos and Kellen Blumberg, posting times of 25:29.5 and 25:51.4, respectively.
“The freshmen have dropped some time over the season,” Chenoweth said. “We’ve seen improvement in their times, and they’re getting used to racing longer distances. They’ve become more competitive and confident over the course of the year.”
For the women, Mack led the squad, which tallied 121 points total to finish fifth. Mack posted a time of 17:29.6 in the 5K event, taking sixth and finishing behind runners from Brown, Princeton, and the host of the event, Columbia. Tiger Alex Banfich took the title with a time of 16:58.9—the only time under 17 minutes in the women’s meet.
“[Banfich] was really good and almost got the course record,” Mack said. “She’s in really great shape and deserved to win. I could have done a little bit better. I think I could have maybe come in fourth.”
Fellow juniors Nicole Cochran and Kailyn Kuzmuk also turned in solid performances. Cochran completed the course in 17:53.4, just sliding into the top 15 with a 14th-place finish. Kuzmuk ran a time of 19:25.5, good for 36th place.
Harvard now turns its focus toward the NCAA Regionals in two weekends at the Hammonasett Beach State Park in Madison, Conn. The cross-country squad is nearing the end of its season, which will culminate at the NCAA Championships the week after. The Crimson will need to step up its game to improve on last year’s performance at these two events.
“The great thing about the team is that there is a lot of depth this year,” Saretsky said. “I think we can bounce back from this and compete even stronger at the NCAA Regionals in two weeks.”
And Harvard will need to bounce back quickly, because the team will be facing even tougher competition at the NCAA Regionals—runners who can finish the race faster than a Tiger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—For the last 13 years, a date with Dartmouth has meant an almost-guaranteed easy win for the Harvard football team. The Crimson didn’t think it would come so easily this year, but for the first half of play at Memorial Field, it seemed that nothing had changed.
Harvard (5-2, 3-1 Ivy) overpowered the resurgent Big Green (4-3, 1-3) early, jumping out to a 24-0 lead and cruising to a 30-14 victory—its seventh straight against Dartmouth—on Saturday afternoon.
“They’re a good football team,” said Big Green coach Buddy Teevens. “They played well, better than we did today. We spotted them a bunch of points early on and played better in the second half, but just didn’t convert enough to close the gap.”
In his first start of the season, junior Collier Winters guided the Crimson to 480 yards of total offense in its most balanced performance of the season. Harvard gained 233 yards on the ground and 247 in the air.
“We felt like we wanted to diversify and balance our offense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve been a pass-first team for a long time, and after the Brown game this year and the injuries to all of our quarterbacks, we became a run-first team. And we’re getting back now to being the type of team we want to be—as balanced and as unpredictable as possible.”
The Crimson received the opening kickoff and used a 14-play drive—seven run plays and seven pass plays—to get into the endzone. After a reception by senior Mike Cook brought Harvard to the one-yard line, Winters punched the ball in himself for his first of two rushing touchdowns on the afternoon.
Harvard followed up with a run-dominated, 87-yard drive that culminated in another Winters dash into the endzone. In the first quarter of play, Harvard held the ball for 11:17, limiting Dartmouth to just 39 yards of offense and silencing the homecoming crowd.
“We knew going into the game that this was probably going to be the biggest game they’ve had in a while—at homecoming, they’re playing really well,” Winters said. “That was our focus, to just come out and really take that momentum and take the spirit out of them, and just really get on top of them in the first half. I think we accomplished that.”
On the first drive of the second quarter, freshman David Mothander booted a 43-yard field goal—the longest of his young collegiate career—to extend the lead to 17-0.
The bulk of the Crimson’s yardage on that drive came from a trick play that put the ball in Cook’s hands.
The wide receiver found junior Adam Chrissis, who led the team with seven catches for 86 yards, 35 yards downfield.
As the offense was rolling, the defense got into a groove as well. When the Big Green’s offense—led by star tailback Nick Schwieger—began to settle in early in the second quarter, sophomore linebacker Josh Boyd made a big stop by intercepting a Connor Kempe pass at the Harvard 29-yard line. Boyd ran the ball back 45 yards to set up the Crimson’s third touchdown of the day.
“You still have to stop the run, and you’re not going to completely do it against a team like this,” Murphy said. “But we never really gave them a chance to be in a rhythm. There were a lot of second and longs. We did a great job, at least in the first half, of converting our defensive stops on third down, and those things were huge.”
Rushes by senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales set up a 10-yard touchdown pass from Winters to Chrissis for the 24-0 lead.
Dartmouth got on the scoreboard for the first time with 2:24 left in the first half when cornerback Shawn Abuhoff returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown.
Mothander split the uprights with an easy 27-yard field goal as time expired to give Harvard a 27-7 lead heading into the half—and ensuring that the Crimson scored points on each of its five first-half drives.
“We struggled a little bit defensively, we didn’t tackle particularly well,” Teevens said. “They just had a lot of plays in that first half.”
Riding its big lead, Harvard let up a bit in the second half. Mothander’s third field goal of the afternoon—this time a kick from 35 yards out—put the Crimson up by 23, but the Big Green fed off the crowd’s energy and the excitement of a televised game to orchestrate a bit of a comeback.
Near the end of the third quarter, a series of runs by Schwieger—who leads the league with 129.7 rushing yards per game—and a long pass to Tim McManus set up a 40-yard field-goal attempt by Foley Schmidt.
Although Schmidt’s kick went wide right, Dartmouth found the endzone on its next possession.
Long completions to wideouts Michael Reilly and Tanner Scott set up a five-yard score by Dominic Pierre, who was called into action when Schwieger went down with a minor injury.
Pierre’s run made it a two-score game with 10:46 to play, and once the Big Green got the ball back, it drove all the way down to the Harvard seven. But Kempe threw three straight incompletions to turn the ball over on downs and seal the win for the Crimson.
Scales picked up 24 yards rushing on the drive to finish the game with 124 total. In the battle between the Ancient Eight’s two most prolific rushers, Gordon came out on top, amassing 93 yards to Schwieger’s 69.
“It’s a shame, because it was a good turnout, certainly being on TV and everything else, but Harvard is a good football team, and they didn’t help us,” Teevens said. “They didn’t turn the football over, they didn’t make mental mistakes. They had one coverage lapse, and unfortunately we missed the throw. And outside of that, they played a pretty solid football game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s volleyball split a pair of Ivy League matches this weekend, defeating Cornell (4-15, 2-7 Ivy) on the road Friday while losing to Columbia (14-6, 6-4) the next day in New York. Both matches proved to be tight affairs, as the Crimson (7-15, 4-6) won the first one, 3-2, but lost the next match by an identical score.
“I think we had a really good showing against Cornell,” freshman Teresa Skelly said. “We came out strong. A lot of people stepped into their roles. We were dishing out wonderful sets and everyone came together really well. We fought really hard for that fifth set and won.”
“The game plan for this weekend was to focus on our team system,” co-captain Miyoko Pettit added. “We wanted to get our offense going and play with a strong defense to keep the other team out of the game. We tried to capitalize on the weaknesses of our opponents and put them out of the match so they couldn’t get anything going.”
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 2
After picking up a big win on Friday, Harvard suffered a harsher fate in the Big Apple on Saturday, losing to Columbia in five sets.
“Columbia may not have been our best night, but we worked hard as a team,” Skelly said. “If we can have more of that type of play then I think we’ll do well against Yale and Brown [next weekend]. We want to show Brown what we’ve been working for.”
Once again, the match represented a tight affair, with Harvard losing in the fifth set by a slim margin at 15-13. The Lions dominated the opening set, but the Crimson responded to capture a close second set. Harvard had its back to the wall yet again as it needed to win the fourth set to force a game-deciding final frame.
Although the team accomplished that goal, winning, 25-19, the Crimson faltered to give Columbia the five-set victory.
“We were definitely hoping to win this match in three, but we came out slow,” Skelly said. “We stepped up in a couple of the sets, and then the last set barely got away from us. It was a tough loss. We want to keep the good pieces of play going, bring them together, and capitalize on them next weekend against Yale and Brown.”
Skelly was quick to note the leadership of her captains this weekend as well.
“[Junior co-captain Anne Carroll] Ingersoll had amazing kills this weekend,” Skelly said. “She was unstoppable against Cornell. Great volleyball. Pettit works on keeping the team calm and focused, and she makes sure the simple plays are taken care of and that everything is executed properly.”
Strong play from junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, sophomore Taylor Docter, and sophomore Beth Kinsella helped Harvard to stay within reach of victory for much of the game against the Lions.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 2
After dropping three consecutive league games from Oct. 15 to Oct. 22, Harvard seemed to have rebounded from its league woes, defeating Brown on the 23rd and then the Big Red again Friday. The team traded sets with Cornell, winning the first, third, and fifth.
“At the fifth set, we realized that we had let it get too close,” Skelly said. “We grabbed an early lead, and that gave us the momentum we needed. People were making great plays, so we forced them into a lot of errors. We knew we should have taken it in three sets, but we won in five sets, and a win is a win.”
Notable play from Docter and Ingersoll helped lead the Crimson past the Big Red.
Harvard needed to respond after losing a tight fourth set, 25-23, which tied the match at two sets apiece. The team managed to do just that, jumping out to a comfortable lead and finally taking the fifth set, 15-4.
Though its 1-1 record on a long road trip was satisfying, Harvard still felt an urge to improve.
“Going into the weekend, our team goal was to come out with an even record in conference play,” Pettit said. “Moving forward from here, we realize anything can happen in the Ivy League. Cornell and Columbia are our longest trips, so playing five sets against these schools can take a toll on us—but that’s not an excuse. We have to prepare better. Going into another weekend traveling, we know what we have to take care of, and we know what we have to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first annual Ivy League Championships, the Harvard men’s water polo team certainly made a splash.
The squad went two-for-three on the weekend in Princeton, N.J. at the tournament, which pitted varsity and clubs teams from the conference against each other. With the two wins and one loss, the Crimson finished in third to round out the tournament.
Harvard (8-16, 2-6 CWPA North) dominated the club No. 5 seed Cornell, 22-5, on Saturday, but fell at the hands of varsity No. 2 seed Brown in its second match, 15-7. Knocked out of the championship match, the Crimson battled for third place against club No. 3 seed Yale and pulled out the win, 12-7, to end the tournament on a good note.
“I think in the last week and a half, we’ve had a lot of injuries and some guys out sick,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “But they did a really good job, and I’m happy with the way the guys played.”
HARVARD 12, YALE 7
It wasn’t the big football game, but hopefully the win was a prelude to Harvard’s success in The Game. With third place on the line in its final match, the Crimson defeated Yale’s club team in an exhibition match.
The Bulldogs, 12-0 before the tournament, were coming into this tournament just having won the regional championship, but Harvard ended the team’s success. The Crimson has never lost to Yale, holding an impressive 46-0 record over the Bulldog squad.
“We started out a little bit slow,” freshman goalkeeper Jimmy Field said. “We were tired from iron-manning the weekend. We dug deep against Yale and tried to get the W. I think it was a great effort by the team.”
BROWN 15, HARVARD 7
In its second match of the weekend, the water polo team couldn’t notch the win to reach the championship match. The Crimson fell at the hands of the Bears, 15-7. Brown was on a four-game losing streak up until the start of the tournament, but the team managed to continue its winning streak against the Crimson, earning its seventh straight victory in the series.
Despite the loss, junior Kevin DiSilvestro had one of his most impressive games for the season. He led the team in scoring with five goals. Senior Alex Thompson also added to the squad’s score with two goals of his own. Field played all four quarters and made 10 saves.
“I think we were missing a couple of key guys due to injuries, so we weren’t really playing with the same group,” senior Jeff Lee said. “I think we still did a pretty good job, but Brown had a really good game.”
HARVARD 22, CORNELL 5
The men may have been a bit rusty coming into the tournament, only playing one game in the last two weeks, but the squad completely dominated Cornell in its opening match of the weekend.
The offense for the team was key, scoring 22 goals and posting the highest score for the Crimson in a match this season, though this was an exhibition game.
“I think we were able to counterattack really hard,” Lee said. “We outslammed them throughout the entire game, and I think the counterattack is something that’s coming together for us.”
The squad now sets its sights on the CWPA Northern Division Championships next weekend before rounding out the season at the CWPA Eastern Championships if the team is able to move on. Last year at the Northern Division Championships, co-captain Bret Voith led the team with four goals in its final match to finish in fifth place.
“I think the focus is on [the Northern Division Championships] next weekend,” Minnis said. “If you win that, you move onto the [Eastern Championships]. We have four days on campus, so tomorrow is an off day. Then we’re going to prepare for whomever it is we play. We’re really excited for this opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in Hanover Saturday night, the Harvard men’s soccer team went up early again. But, as has been the case all too often this season, its opponent’s offensive aggressiveness and the Crimson’s lack thereof led to a large shot discrepancy and a third straight 2-1 defeat.
In the loss, the Crimson (4-6-5, 1-2-2 Ivy) was outshot, 16-4, by the Big Green (7-6-1, 2-3-0), continuing a troubling theme for a team that started out so well but now finds itself officially eliminated from the Ivy League title race.
“Credit to them, they played to their strengths,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “I didn’t think we had enough quality opportunities on goal, so overall the result is very disappointing.”
Once again, it was sophomore Brian Rogers who proved to be the Crimson’s lone offensive threat, as the team extended its streak of scoring one goal or less to 13 consecutive games—just two of which have been wins.
For the third consecutive match, Harvard got on the board first but gave up two second-half scores and was unable to come back late. In each of the three contests, the two goals came within a five-minute span of each other.
“I think it’s a mental thing,” Rogers said. “It comes from our being young. We get out to leads because we’re talented. As the game goes on, we kind of lose our mental composure...we rarely give up a goal to the other team because they’re very good, [rather] it is from our team having mental lapses.”
Rogers started things off for the Crimson, scoring on the team’s first shot attempt of the game at 34:49. The forward took a cross pass from senior forward Alex Chi in the left side of the box and drilled the ball past Dartmouth goalie Lyman Missimer to give Harvard the 1-0 advantage. It was the forward’s team-leading fourth goal and ninth point on the year.
“It was a good team goal,” Rogers said. “Chi played a great layoff back to me, and I just had to swat it by the keeper.”
The teams did not score again until the midway point of the second half, when the Big Green began to increase the pressure on the Crimson defense and junior goalie Austin Harms.
“In the first part of the second half, we did a good job applying pressure, being defensively organized,” Junot said. “We weren’t especially dangerous in the attack, but we didn’t allow Dartmouth to become dangerous.”
That all changed at 70:08, when Big Green junior defenseman Nick Pappas took a corner kick from senior forward Andrew Olsen and headed the ball over an extended Harms and into the corner of the net to tie the game at one. Junot called the goal Harms’ “first real goalkeeping error of the season.”
Just over a minute later, junior forward Lucky Mkosana got open on a breakaway and beat Harms with a shot to the lower left corner of the net, giving Dartmouth a 2-1 advantage that it would not surrender.
“I thought in the first half we put up a good performance,” Rogers said. “After Dartmouth scored their first goal we kind of hung our heads, and then at that point their second goal was kind of inevitable.”
Despite the loss, Harms was solid on the whole, making seven saves in the contest.
“Overall Austin did very well,” Junot said. “Dartmouth played very direct, so a lot of crosses were sent at Austin, a lot of corner kicks...[he] was very good, made some crucial saves.”
After the game, the coach also complimented the play of Rogers and freshman forward Connor McCarthy on the offensive side of the ball.
Missimer managed two saves for Dartmouth, as the Big Green outshot the Crimson, 10-3, on net. Freshman midfielder Gabe Hoffman-Johnson and Pappas had four shots each for Dartmouth, while Olsen added three and Mkosana attempted two. Four players took one shot for the Crimson.
Though the defeat officially eliminated Harvard from the race for an Ivy League title, and with it their only realistic chance of an NCAA tournament birth, the Crimson will now be forced play the role of spoiler in its final two games of the season. But Rogers said he nonetheless hoped to help the team’s senior class finish its career on a high note.
“A lot of the motivation is to send our seniors off right,” Rogers said. “I think sending them off with two wins in a row would be great, and also I think it’s really important that we do well in these last two games in order to build momentum for next year.”

Last year, the Harvard women’s soccer team beat Dartmouth, 2-1. With the win, the squad clinched the Ivy League title.
Things went a little differently this time.
Despite a late push, the Crimson (7-7-1, 3-3 Ivy) couldn’t catch the Big Green (6-7-2, 3-2-1) Saturday at Dartmouth, falling, 3-2. With the loss, Harvard fell out of contention for its third straight league crown.
“It’s a tough loss,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “We did some great things, and so did Dartmouth, and I have to give them credit that they put in three and we put two. It’s as simple as that.”
In the 33rd matchup between the two squads, the Big Green took control early, finding the back of the net within the first 10 minutes.
Harvard responded quickly. Just over three minutes later, sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro found co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh, who maneuvered around the Dartmouth goalie to tie the score at one apiece.
“She didn’t get a lot of looks, but obviously the one she got was a great finish,” Leone said of the goal.
20 minutes after Sheeleigh evened the score, Big Green senior Melisa Krnjaic hit the ball over Crimson goalie AJ Millet and into the goal to put the home team back on top. Shortly after the new half began, Krnjaic struck again, giving Dartmouth a two-goal advantage.
“To be down two made it difficult,” Leone said. “But it wasn’t insurmountable...[and] the team would not go easily into the night.”
“The second half, obviously our back’s against the wall,” sophomore Aisha Price added. “And so we knew that we had to pull up, play hard, and see what could happen.”
With a little more than 11 minutes to play, the effort paid off, as Price headed a Conigliaro corner kick past the Big Green goalie to cut the deficit in half.
In the remaining time, Harvard threatened and pushed hard for the equalizer, with Sheeleigh even firing a shot as time expired. But the Crimson came up short.
“We weren’t giving up hope,” Price said. “We just kept on fighting, kept on trying to get a goal off, trying to get good plays off. We literally fought until the last second.”
After taking 31 shots in its last match against Quinnipiac, Harvard continued its strong offensive play. Despite only scoring twice, the Crimson outshot Dartmouth, 8-7, and had 12 corner kicks compared to the Big Green’s one.
“We moved the ball at times and played incredible attacking soccer at times...against a really great defensive team,” Leone said. “[And] to get [12] corner kicks in a game is amazing.”
Instrumental to both goals was Conigliaro, who had two assists in the contest. She brought her season points total to 12, good for third place on the team.
“[Conigliaro] plays with so much fire and so much desire,” Price said “She’s...really playing well [and] really doing awesome things for our team.”
Sheeleigh also had a strong showing in what was her final regular-season away game. Her goal marked the 30th in her career and her eighth this season. She is fifth in program history for goals scored and leads the team this season in goals and points.
“Sheeleigh’s always going to bring every ounce of energy she has the whole game, and she did it again tonight,” Leone said.
The co-captain leads a group of seniors that helped bring two straight league crowns to Cambridge but failed in its third and final attempt.
“I’m really proud of the level that this team has brought for four straight years,” Leone said. “This senior class—amazing.”
Despite the team’s loss, both the players and the coach were satisfied with the effort.
“We laid everything we could out on the field, so that was the best we could expect, and we were happy with our end performance,” Price said.
“When you don’t give your all or try as hard as you possibly can, it’s just a horrible feeling,” Leone added. “They’re not feeling like that tonight. They let it all hang out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Head of the Charles is over, and most of Cambridge has probably forgotten about rowing, but in New Zealand, the action is just getting started, as the World Championships kicked off today. Since Lake Karapiro isn't particularly convenient for many of us, let The Back Page fill you in on the latest action by three competitors who used to call the Charles River home: Malcolm Howard '05, Esther Lofgren '07-'09, and Henrik Rummel '09. None of the three have raced yet, but here's a little background information on the Harvard and Radcliffe rowing alums.
MALCOLM HOWARD '05
In crew, Malcolm Howard is something like a backboard. Competitors throw their best efforts his way, and he sends them back to where they came from. As a member of the Canadian national team, Howard has made his way to the top of the podium at both the Olympics and the World Championships, winning gold in the 8+ at the Beijing Olympics and the 2007 World Championships. Howard has also taken two world silvers with the team-- one in the 4+ in 2004 and one in the 8+ in 2009.
The Harvard crew team has found that Howard's name alone is enough to break the opposition—literally. In a spring race between the Crimson and Princeton, the Tigers veered off course, crashing into Harvard's new Empacher, the same exact boat in which Howard won gold in Beijing. What might have been a sad ending for an accomplished boat turned out to be a broken bow on Princeton's boat. The Crimson dedicated the boat to Howard soon after.
But while Howard has proven beyond doubt his ability to move big boats, how will the star rower fare in his new event, the single? Formerly a member of the engine room, Howard has to adjust to rowing with two oars and adding steering and setting the rhythm to his responsibilities. Will the gold medalist find success in his latest endeavor? Stay tuned for The Back Page's coverage of the World Championships.
ESTHER LOFGREN '07-'09
In the 2008 Olympics, two Radcliffe alumnae helped changed the world rowing landscape. Neither one was named Esther Lofgren. Instead, the Californian trained for her final collegiate season while watching Caryn Davies '04-'05 and Michelle Guerette '02 steal the show in Beijing. But with Davies and Guerette off to law school and business school, respectively, the stage has been set for the next Radcliffe alum to make her mark.
After being named a Division I All-American rower in 2007, Lofgren decided to take a year off from school to train with the national team in hopes of making the U.S. Olympic squad. But she wasn't ready just yet.
Since being cut from the Olympics, Lofgren has shown her ability to move boats in both collegiate and international competition, making a strong case for her selection to the 2012 squad. In her final year at Radcliffe, the port helped the first varsity eight finish in a near-tie at Eastern Sprints while rowing in the four-seat. On the international scene that summer, Lofgren was even more impressive, taking silver in the four at the 2009 World Championships after earning the same medal in the eight at that year's World Cup event. This year, she has found continued success, stroking the U.S. women's eight to a gold medal at the World Cup race in Lucerne, Switzerland. Now in the seven seat, Lofgren hopes to deliver similar results in Lake Karapiro.
HENRIK RUMMEL '09
He may speak five languages (English, Danish, Swedish, German, and French), but on the water, Henrik Rummel lets his stroke do the talking. Originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, his move to the United States proved to be a boon for the U.S. national team. Rummel has won world championships at the junior, U23, and senior levels. The rower took on North America first, winning gold in two events in the 2003 CanAmMex Regatta. After proving his continental prowess, Rummel set his sights on the rest of the world, and two years later he won the junior world championships in the eight. Like many top junior rowers, Rummel chose to call Newell Boathouse home for his collegiate years. In 2007, he helped the Crimson's top boat win both Eastern Sprints and the Ladies' Challenge Plate at the Henley Royal Regatta.
But it is on the international level where Rummel has truly made his mark. A year after winning Henley, he took gold in the U23 world championships, again in the eight. The very next year, Rummel took gold again, this time rowing the pair in the senior world championships.
Now in the four without coxswain, Rummel hopes that a different event won't bring him a different result. Having found success at every level, he looks to return to his most familiar setting: the top of a podium.

Move over WHRB, Dunster House now has its own radio station.
Not officially, of course. But through a new website called Songza, Dunster residents can collaborate to create playlists that will constantly stream to anyone who has the link to the station. The music is an aggregate of all the musical tastes of the House, which include everything from Bob Dylan to Usher. Here's a selection:
 
"Range Life" by Pavement
"Dayjob" by Ssion
"Soon" by Delorean
"Rude Boy" by Rihanna
 
"Evacuate The Dancefloor" by Cascada
Renee G. Stern '13, who interned at Songza, sent an e-mail about the station over the Dunster open list a few days ago.  She told us that she created the station to facilitate the sharing of musical tastes across the House.
“It would be really exciting if people in other Houses started stations and Songza spread through Harvard. The site is awesome for parties, because anyone can go online and add to or vote on the playlist. That way it attracts guests, cuts down on playlist building time, and no one can really complain about the music—it's a win-win situation,” said Stern, who is also a Crimson arts editor, in an e-mailed statement.

Love the chicken fingers HUHDS served today? Hate gratuitous servings of squash? Let HUHDS know by filling out the "HUHDS Residential Dining Satisfaction Survey."
Questions on the survey run the gamut from queries regarding quality of the food to its visual appeal, so if you're dying to gush about the aesthetic appeal of pumpkin gnocchi, now is your chance.
The survey is open until this Sunday, and according to an e-mail from HUHDS spokeswoman Crista Martin, if 50 percent of the residents of any House—or of the entire freshman class, in the case of Annenberg—participate, they will get a Sunday brunch smoothie bar.

The deadline for the Pre-Term Planning tool is coming up, both for juniors but especially for seniors.
Deadlines are staggered by class, so check out the PTP site to determine which cutoff applies to you. Seniors have until this Wednesday to submit their selections. Juniors will have until the following Wednesday. The late fee is $40, so keep an eye out for the deadline.
In case you forgot what PTP is, the Pre-Term Planning tool is a way for the Registrar’s Office to gain preliminary information on what courses students plan on taking. The data will help the Registrar’s Office gauge the demand for each course and plan TF allocations, classroom assignments, book orders, and other logistical concerns.
How do you actually use it? Visit the PTP section of the Registrar's website. If you want, take a look at one of the instructional videos, and then click “Enter the Student Planning Portal” and type away.
