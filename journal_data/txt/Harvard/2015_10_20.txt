“Ready,” the eleventh track on Alex G’s label debut “Beach Music,” is the most succinct encapsulation of the sometimes-frustrating magic its artist is capable of creating. Alex G—short for Giannascoli—sings a lilting mantra over again: “She came right through me.” As his reedy voice gets louder and more guttural, Giannascoli starts bringing in subtle vibraphone countermelodies, staccato guitar phrases, and, eventually, a smooth organ that carries the song to sleep. The swell and subsequent fall is so technically perfect, so paradoxically restrained and maximalist, that Alex G almost fades into the woodwork; he is the animator rather than the presence. The disparity between Giannascoli’s undeveloped musical identity and his prodigious talent holds “Ready,” and the album, back from the brilliance of which Alex G is almost certainly capable. Despite the fact that “Beach Music” often trades in warmth for exactitude, Alex G continues to prove that he has the ear and the raw skill to create beautiful noise.
Alex G is only 22. He’s released seven full-lengths on Bandcamp, plays essentially every instrument known to man, and has affected an increasingly penetrating falsetto to accompany his eclectic lo-fi mélange. 18 months ago he was finishing up his junior year at Temple University and putting the finishing touches on the fantastic “DSU,” a slightly punky, often beachy paean to teenage angst and miscommunication. Now, he stands poised to ascend to indie rock heaven thanks to the buzz “DSU” generated and his signing to godmakers Domino Recording Company. Amidst all of this dreamy fanfare, Giannascoli has crafted, in “Beach Music,” a restrained, artistic statement that doesn’t do much to distance itself from his past work. The album may be more consistent in its sound and mood than Alex G’s other LPs, but it also feels less experimental, more willing to glide by on its progenitor’s inherent ability.
One of the primary elements that holds “Beach Music” back is its lyrical malaise. The new work doesn’t have any songs like “Harvey,” a surreal, self-contained portrait off “DSU” that tells a story of imagination, striving for success, and the danger of illusions. Here, most of the words are elemental—references to staying, going, walking, other obvious forms of literal and metaphorical movement. Only a few songs rise above this generality: “Kicker,” one of the album’s standouts, bursts open with “White bird in a black cloud / You flap / Eyes rolled back” and continues in the same visual vein, offering glimpses of “Twitchin’ out the corner of your eye” and “First flight / Into white light.” This brand of confrontational imagery is infinitely more engaging than the stripped-down stanzas on most of the work. Giannascoli is not only capable of writing a gorgeous lyric, but he also has the instrumental acumen to gracefully follow a dense cypher; his guitar and bass bounce gloriously around with his enunciation.
Why, then, doesn’t Alex G put more obvious stories into his songs? Perhaps it’s a matter of keeping the instrumental integrity intact—if you stuff too much poeticism into a small space, you run the risk of entering a Dylanesque territory of words augmented by music and not the other way around. And Alex G creates compelling enough instrumentals that he could let lyrics melt into the background entirely, relying, like My Bloody Valentine (for a disastrously cliché example), on his jangly guitars and harmonics to fill in the obscure specifics of his words. But Giannascoli doesn’t let his lyrics fade; they are almost always comprehensible, his voice turned up as loud as any other instrument. He has a responsibility, if he’s going to keep words central to his vision, always to say something at least nominally interesting.
What keeps “Beach Music” out of the realm of disappointment, granted its lyrical troubles and stylistic similarities to the rest of Alex G’s prolific output, are the subtle improvements on his sumptuous instrumentation and production. Giannascoli talks with himself several times over the course of the album through subtly utilized vocal modulation. The beautiful “Station” sounds, despite the predictably vague words, like a contentious debate between the ethereal, high-pitched Alex G and his more brutally honest, low-voiced counterpart. “Brite Boy,” the most purely pretty song on the collection, employs a similar back and forth. Elsewhere, Alex G uses illuminating, brief guitar flourishes, unexpectedly psychedelic tape loops, and even brief hints of heavier synth and 808s.

Michel Houellebecq’s latest novel, “Submission,” imagines a France in 2022 that is simultaneously shockingly unrealistic and surprisingly probable. Rioters light cars on fire. Women cannot wear clothes that expose their bare legs. A middle-aged university administrator has several wives, one of them a teenage girl. Up to this point, protagonist and college professor François is preoccupied with sleeping with his students and obsessing over 19th-century French decadent author J.K. Huysmans. But François’s story has changed with the French political landscape, and he is plunged into a world of uncertainty along with the plot. Through careful use of satire and character, Houellebecq achieves in this novel a vision of a future rife with ambiguity, to much success.
Houellebecq begins his study of a confused French society by examining the career and personal life of the novel’s narrator—the jaded, melancholic academic François. From François’s disillusioned perspective, “Submission” goes on to explore a world of political instability. The presidential election season is a heated and close race between three parties—the far-right National Front, leftist Socialist Party, and the infant Muslim Brotherhood. François, distracted by his romantic affairs and Indian microwave dinners, watches the events in boredom. When the National Front gains popularity, the Socialists and other left-wing groups ally themselves with the ultimately victorious Muslim Brotherhood, creating a new Western society under Islamic law with conventions that force François to choose between conversion to Islam for a lucrative academic advancement and his solitary life of freedom. Such a premise treads dangerous territory—one that could easily fall within the bounds of Islamophobia. Surprisingly, Houellebecq, despite having avowed his hatred of Islam, successfully stays away from writing a sensationalized novel by maintaining a level of ambiguity and ensuring that such convictions do not seep into the novel’s social commentary.
In fact, for a satire, “Submission” is relatively tame, or rather its satire manages to evade the gaudy, caustic character present in most works of the genre. Houellebecq’s critique of society—be it the Islamic order he imagines or the Western world as readers know it—is muted, at times even imperceptible in its sardonic nature. He accomplishes this effect by immersing the political and social commentary within his hero’s scholarly ruminations, particularly on Huysmans. Meanwhile, events that should produce reactions of horror deliberately receive little emphasis. For instance, the changes implemented by the new president Ben Abbes are met with little fanfare. François returns to Paris after the election, observing indifferently that “The biggest change, a subtle one, was in the shoppers themselves.” This detached tone is not detrimental to the novel; in actuality, it elevates Houellebecq’s critique to a higher level when he explicitly comments on the situation, whether seriously or satirically. “A transformation was indeed under way,” François later notes. “There’d been a fundamental shift. Several hours of channel surfing revealed no further changes, but then soft-core porn had gone out of fashion years before.” Francois’s comment is as misplaced as is his concern for sex instead of for his fragile country, but such moments, ridiculous in their skewed priorities, break the realism that Houellebecq constructs. By subduing his satire, Houellebecq encourages his audience to submit to his theoretical world, only to dismantle it through dry humor or unexpected exaggeration. In that way, “Submission” becomes more provocative and powerful; its acerbic critique, when it does come, feels more like a punch than a slap to the face.
As middle-aged professor at the University of Paris III, the flawed but intelligent François is the perfect vehicle for Houellebecq’s satire, providing most of the jarring one-liners that give the book humor, but he also drives the novel’s themes forward. “You’ve always had this weird kind of honesty, like an inability to make the compromises that everyone has to make, in the end, just to go about their lives,” Myriam, his last girlfriend, tells him. Such a characterization—one of resistance and obstinacy—is significant for a novel whose title is “Submission.” In fact, François’s development as an aimless character desiring happiness becomes even more significant as the new authorities try to convince him to submit and convert to Islam for fulfillment. As he talks with Rediger, the new university president who received his position due to being a convert, Rediger argues, “The shocking and simple idea, which had never been so forcefully expressed, [is] that the summit of human happiness resides in the most absolute submission.”
Houellebecq reinforces the ambiguity of his text through his compelling but simple writing. He is not intent on constructing lyrical phrases, and the novel’s best sentences derive strength from the boldness of the ideas expressed therein. “Europe had already committed suicide,” Rediger declares, using the intensity of his diction to explain his conversion to Islam. Such lines reveal an author aware of the effect that his language can have. This awareness becomes most evident in the last chapter, which presents the resolution to François’s decision to convert or not convert to Islam. Surprisingly, however, Houellebecq switches from using past tense to employing the conditional tense: The chapter starts with the phrase, “A few more weeks would go by.” Instead of coming to a close, the novel continues to perpetuate uncertainty about François’s choice and presents it as a situation as hypothetical as the novel’s political setting. The last chapter emphasizes the ambiguity that defines the entire novel—it leaves not only the protagonist’s fate unanswered but also provides little solution to the political and social issues that the novel posits.
In this way, Houellebecq’s “Submission” is an engrossing, philosophical addition to his repertoire. Despite its engagement of a potentially explosive subject matter, the story considers the situation with care and space, allowing readers to question and think about his imagined society. “In the same way,” François says, “to love a book is, above all, to love its author: we wish to meet him again, we wish to spend our days with him.” While Houellebecq’s latest novel might not win adoration everywhere, it is nevertheless riveting enough to warrant an afternoon with the author.

I admit that I cannot justly give tribute to the writings of Svetlana Alexievich, the most recent winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her oral histories broadly challenge society to honesty while refusing to neglect the specifics of each experience—an undertaking that cannot be fully captured by my isolated voice. I feel compelled, however, to reference her work, in which she explores, as she puts it, “what happens to [the human being] in...our time. How does man behave and react. How much of the biological man is in him, how much of the man of his time, how much man of the man.” Alexievich takes on the roles of psychologist, sociologist, and journalist. She is an artist who defies boundaries in the service of human wellness and authenticity.
In this effort, whether intentionally or not, Alexievich captures the essence of the medical humanities. Her nonfiction work “Zinky Boys,” for instance, contains interviews from civilians and soldiers who experienced the 1979-1989 Soviet War in Afghanistan. Particular voices in the book acknowledge the limitations of the medical humanities, yet the work as a whole serves as a paragon of the genre which merges the social questions of this war with medical tragedy, individual perspective, and honest detail. “Zinky Boys” also allows the reader to explore one particular aspect of the medical humanities: how storytelling and literature provide powerful tools for attaining emotional wellness.
First, one must recognize that literature as a tool may be limited. One of the veterans speaks to this directly: “What’s the point of this book of yours? What good will it do? It won’t appeal to us vets. You’ll never be able to tell it like it really was over there.” This vet is cautionary as he reminds the author, as well as the reader, that one can never authentically represent the experience of war. Even “Zinky Boys,” which has an unusually intimate connection to life because of its interview format, cannot completely transgress literature's removal from reality. Portrayals of lived experiences may always raise questions of audience, authenticity, and applicability.
“Zinky Boys,” while it acknowledges these limitations and the validity of skepticism, also suggests that we should not forget the power of storytelling, because stories can foster empathy and understanding. Another vet asks the author and reader to do him a favor: to hear his story and attempt to understand. Adopting the language of religion, the vet says he is making a confession and even places the reader in the privileged position of the confessor. Narrating can be curative, then; individuals may want to express their experiences in hopes of being partially, if not fully, understood.
Storytelling also opens up definitions by providing speakers with the opportunity to describe or even deny their categories and names. One speaker, for instance, hates the category Afgantsi, which is so often applied to him and other veterans. This term is ambiguous—the speaker relates it to a “hero” and “idiot” as well as a “criminal”— but it definitely implies an unnecessary and unfavorable separation from the rest of society. Literature provides us with the opportunity to unpack and repack labels in this way, as Susan Sontag first illuminated in “Illness as Metaphor.” Writing and speaking—or, as in “Zinky Boys,” a combination of the two—allows one to comment on the social connotations of labels and can encourage readers to sympathize with stigmatized individuals.
“Zinky Boys” displays another tool of the medical humanities in its application of former works of the genre to contemporary perceptions and experiences. Two of the book's speakers use Dostoevsky, for example, as a medium through which to process their experiences. For these soldiers, the bleak power of Dostoevsky's prose becomes associated with their home. They call him a former teacher who cannot belong in their war experiences but taught them how to live before being in war changed everything. Literature can instruct and shape its readers, and it can provide a kind of mental handhold. As people’s lives change, a text remains constant.
Although traditional literature, like the classics of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, is perhaps more commonly associated with the medical humanities, “Zinky Boys” profoundly places this tradition in the background of the insights of mothers, soldiers, and widows. Alexievich likewise plays with notions of textual authority, by inserting transcripts of readers' phone calls and letters in the postscript. Here, Alexievich's style itself reminds the reader that the field is one that inevitably links to the author’s and reader's contemporary experiences. Scientific, artistic, or ethical questions of life, death, and the struggles in between have the potential to remind readers of themselves, their families, and their friends. They also, though, suggest that there is a myriad of other individuals whom we may not understand but with whom we should try to sympathize. As Alexievich explains on her website, “I chose a genre where human voices speak for themselves.” In her work, then, one can begin to realize how intricate and important this process of understanding can be.

Peter Schjeldahl, the New Yorker’s mustachioed art critic, describes the ideal museum as “a place where we can go en masse and be alone.” When I first read those words, I thought that they extended to the practice of art-viewing in general. Possibly because nearly all of my meaningful experiences with visual art have taken place in museums, or possibly because I always appreciate justification for my introversion, I took Schjeldahl’s comment to heart and determined that I would need to be alone, or at least feel alone, to achieve a deep connection with a piece of art. Illuminus, a locally organized nighttime contemporary art event, forced me to question my reliance on solitude. For if the museum is pushed into the street, its walls torn down, and thousands of non-museumgoers ushered in, can one still expect to be alone with the art?
In its second annual iteration, Illuminus is Boston’s contribution to the increasingly popular “nuit blanche” movement, featuring “installations and performances by artists who manipulate light, sound, and projection to create an immersive, multi-sensory spectacle.” The 30 “projects”—predominantly large-scale art installations—are geographically centered on Lansdowne Street, the corridor sandwiched between two of Boston’s most prominent venues of spectacle, Fenway Park and the House of Blues. Indeed, the nocturnal festival seems to take spectacle as its starting point, primary medium, and ultimate goal.
As I first made my way down the asphalt stretch, skirting behind the Sausage Guy cart to break through the mob of visitors, signs of just how un-museum-like this event was became apparent. A festival worker turned DJ belted “Happy Birthday” through loud speakers, several spotlights roved the sky, and even some of the art projects themselves appeared superficially extravagant. “Waking the Monster,” a performance project in which 15 percussionists banged on the steel girders of Fenway’s “Green Monster,” had the potential to expose the living identity of the iconic institution but instead came across as a Bostonized “Stomp” better suited for the seventh-inning stretch. Yassy Goldie/gjyd’s “i want to sox yu0,” a dystopian take on the souvenir shop, seemed to function as the requisite haunted house of a theme park. Within minutes I assumed the pretension that only a young Harvard art history concentrator could muster and scrawled “ART CARNIVAL” diagonally into my notebook.
In the past several years, an expansive critical discussion on what Schjeldahl calls “the art world’s prevailing values of commerce and spectacle” has emerged in newspapers, magazines, and art journals, especially with regards to the spectacularization of museum programming. Artist and former New York Times art critic Brian O’Doherty describes “the museum as spectacle, the museum as entertainment, fun,” Going as far as to ask, “But what draws people to these museums? Why aren’t they going to the zoo?” SUNY Stony Brook professor Donald Kuspit remarked that “Postmodern art events are not much different than postmodern sporting events.” In 2013, Cornell even offered a summer session course entitled “Museum as Spectacle.”
At first, “Touch This”—a massive structure entirely encased in tin foil onto which “confusing, disruptive, and addicting videos” were being projected to “create an overall sense of unease”—seemed to be just another of the many participatory, environmental installations (selfie-fodder) that characterize Illuminus. Nearly all of the 75 visitors crowding up against the work had taken the piece’s title to an extreme and were violently stripping the foil off of the installation to fashion crowns and hats. I saw the artists, Jesse Kaminsky and Isabella Koen, watching from a distance and asked them for their reaction to the destruction. “We didn’t expect people to rip it to shreds like this, but you have to go with it,” Kaminsky explained. “Maybe that’s an interesting direction to go with for the next piece. You can learn a lot from what people want to do.”
Illuminus initially seemed to be the culmination of the phenomenon of entertainment-driven curating, having turned a platform for contemporary art into an outdoor extravaganza with the word “spectacle” in its mission statement. Or at least that was my impression until I began to appreciate that Illuminus was not trying to create a museum in the streets but was actually intentionally distancing itself from museum conventions by placing itself in the public arena. The event did have curators and did present art for viewing, but its carnival-like atmosphere, rather than solely exemplifying the triumph of meaningless spectacle, might have been intended to bring contemporary art to those it was unlikely to reach in a museum—and to force traditional museumgoers out of their jaded habits and into experiencing art in a wholly new, contemporary setting.
I did not have any personally meaningful experiences with art at Illuminus, partially because I was largely unwilling to wait in the hour-long lines to access most of the art. But in seeing the informative impact that a spectacle-driven show can have on everyone from infrequent art viewers to the artists creating the works, I came to understand the importance of occasionally leaving the white cube for the carnival tent.

“We’re not looking to compete—except in kickball,” says Gideon W. Nachman ’16 of Three Letter Acronym, describing his group’s attitude towards "VERI(funny)TAS." An improv festival created and inaugurated at the Adams Pool Theater on Oct. 17 and 18, "VERI(funny)TAS" featured Harvard’s three improv groups—Immediate Gratification Players, On Thin Ice, and Three Letter Acronym—alongside six others: Liquid Fun of Boston University, Starla and Sons of Brown, Dangerbox of New York University, Mason Improv Association of George Mason University, Seriously Bent of Suffolk, and McGill Improv from McGill University. In addition to three weekend shows, hosted by stand-up comic Sierra L. Katow ’16, the festival included an improv workshop for the participating groups and one highly anticipated kickball game.
Members of TLA stress that, mock-competitive sporting matches aside, the spirit of the festival was intended to be collaborative. “I think the way we set up our festival, it’s explicitly defined as a non-competitive atmosphere,” Alex N. Lee ’17 says. Rather than produce a “winner,” "VERI(funny)TAS" aimed to create an exchange of ideas and laughs among the nine participating groups as well as between the performers and their audiences.
“I think that’s sort of the big draw of these festivals,” Jason Boxer of NYU’s Dangerbox says. “You get to see what other people are doing and share techniques and steal ideas. The festivals that are no good are the ones that are competitive and the ones where you’re sizing each other up. The ones that are great are the ones where everyone’s collaborating and sharing stuff.”
With the exception of Harvard’s On Thin Ice, all the ensembles performed long-form improv, a technique requiring the creation of disparate short scenes and characters with distinctive personalities, all of which must then be woven together into a complete play of sorts. Each group’s individual brand of humor added yet another twist to their variations on the format. McGill Improv included a voice-over that set the scene (“We begin in an abandoned warehouse...”) and announced each change of context (“Cut to happier days!”) in their 30-minute creation, while IGP and TLA, in providing no context, kept their audiences guessing both as to where each scene was taking place and how it related to an ever-unidentified, overarching story.
The groups’ shared workshop took place on the afternoon of Saturday, Oct. 18. “It will be a really nice opportunity for us to learn from each other, as well as do some improv with the people from other groups,” festival organizer David A. Kaufman ’17 said before the workshop. “The thing about improv is it’s all based on this trust and this connection, so it’s really hard to do a scene with someone and not feel like you want to be their friend. So hopefully that leads to some really good connection among the different groups.” The post-improv familiarity he described was evidenced at the end of the 7 P.M. show on Saturday. After performing individually, IGP, McGill Improv and TLA all played one final game together, entitled “Sex with me is like…” Although the game consisted entirely of one-liners and thus did not include explicit interaction, members from the three groups appeared to enjoy riffing on one another.
Members of TLA hope to host more festivals in the future, in addition to those held annually by IGP. Speaking for the group as a whole, Lee says, “It is without a doubt something we’d like to have happen again, hopefully on a regular basis.”

Marlom Meirelles entered the film industry far from the star-studded sidewalks of Los Angeles. The 26-year-old director-producer hails from Bezerros, a small town in the northeastern countryside of Pernambuco, Brazil. At just 21 years old, he founded his own production company, Eixo Audiovisual. Meirelles has since gone on to present his short film “A Emparedada de Rua Nova” (The Bricked Girl) at the Cannes Film Festival and win a script competition for his documentary “Entre Mulheres” (Among Women), which deals with women’s rights and gender issues. On Oct. 13, Meirelles visited Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies for a screening and discussion of his latest film, “Olhos de Botão” (Button Eyes). Meirelles spoke with The Crimson during his visit to campus in anticipation of the presentation of this 18-minute fictional suspense short film.
The Harvard Crimson: What drew you to filmmaking at such a young age?
Marlom Meirelles: I feel very comfortable having a camera in my hands because since I was very young, I was always filming. I’m from the VHS generation, so I was always making films at family events and in schools. Then, it became an obsession. And then I went to college to study film, and it became something professional and a part of my life.
THC: How would you describe your style of filmmaking?
MM: I’m a young filmmaker—I’m only 26 years old—so I’m still getting to know my style. I like to bring in references from Brazilian filmmakers and also references from South American filmmakers and filmmakers from America and Europe and Asia…. As for my style, this is the second film I’ve done using legends from [the Pernambuco countryside] as a theme. I like to use fantastic elements in my film, [though] I try to keep it realistic because I also work on documentaries.
THC: What are your thoughts on the current status of filmmaking in Brazil?
MM: Luckily we are living in a very good moment right now. If we look back in history, in the ’80s, the Brazilian government stopped funding films and culture in general, and it was a very tough time. And then we had to recover, and it took a lot of years. But now the government is investing a lot of money in filmmaking, so they have a fund…. So it’s like a big cake, and everyone is taking a slice to produce the films. I feel very privileged to be in this era right now, so I can be part of it.
THC: What specifically can you tell us “Olhos de Botão”?
MM: I was very inspired by the folk legends that are very common in my state and also all the states in that region of Brazil…. But also I took inspiration from negative aspects of the Brazilian culture, because we live in a very traditional, conservative society. When people watch the Brazilian Carnival, they have a picture of Brazil that is not really reality…. This [clash] is an aspect of our culture [that] I tried to make clear through this film.
THC: Why did you decide to participate in the DRCLAS screening at Harvard?
MM: Well this is the kind of invitation that you cannot refuse. I had to devote more time in my life as a filmmaker producing films rather than being in an academic space. So every time I get an opportunity like this one to talk to people from the academic side, I think it gives me a different perspective about the film, especially with critics, who watch a lot of films.
THC: Why do you think you have achieved such impressive success for your age?
MM: I think it takes a lot of persistence. It’s very important to be focused and also to know yourself as an artist…. When you know what you are trying to communicate to people, I think it helps you to get to a more international level and to communicate with other audiences from all around the world. For example, [“Olhos de Botão”] was recorded in a very specific area in the northeast of the Brazilian countryside. But people from Russia or from Israel can watch the film and understand that context, because the interaction between the characters is more universal.
THC: Do you think people in Brazil will react to the content of the film differently from your international audiences?

“Far from affording artists continuous inspiration, mass-media sources for art have become a dead end,” art critic Robert Hughes wrote in 1990. Hughes lamented creative production’s submission to the immaterial, to the mind-numbing spectacle of television. Yet 25 years later, even with the advent of the internet and the further absorption of everyday experience into the disembodied realm of the digital, the contemporary Japanese artistic collective teamLab sets out to push the bounds of media art.
teamLab, whose multimedia installation “What a Loving and Beautiful World” opened at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Friday, Oct. 16, engages with this question of the expressive potential of digital media. In the installation space, Japanese characters float on gallery walls rendered luminous veils of color by light projections. When the viewer reaches out to touch a character, the symbol transforms into the image it represents: Silver waves ripple out from the point of contact with the character for “sea,” and pink cherry blossoms burst from the character for “flower.” As more visitors enter the space, images whirl across the walls, then subside. Within the installation, the boundaries between text and image, nature and culture, spectator and actor are constantly in flux.
Through digital media, teamLab’s artists, calligraphers, programmers, and engineers create a participatory visual environment that is both playful and meditative. “teamLab demonstrates what is possible when people with different kinds of expertise—in the arts, engineering, computer science, robotics, architecture, different areas of design—come together to solve artistic problems,” writes Yukio Lippit, professor of History of Art and Architecture at Harvard and the exhibition’s curator, in an email.
Meg Rotzel, the Radcliffe Institute’s Arts Program Manager and a practicing artist, believes that the immersivity of teamLab’s installation renders it uniquely compelling. “I’m happiest when I’m really in my work, when I’m thinking and making simultaneously,” she says. “When I go to a museum, normally I feel like I’m here and the work of art is there, and there’s a separation. But with ‘What a Loving and Beautiful World,’ you can see whole groups of people just playing in the art, within the space of the work of art.”
Hughes feared the passivity enforced by media spectacle, but teamLab uses digital media to invite the viewer to participate in the art’s making. The gallery acts as a canvas upon which the viewer inscribes his or her curiosity. Because the animation responds to the actions of viewers, the possibilities for visual variation are endless: The installation will never look the same twice. Lippit says that he appreciates the work’s capacity to give visible form to the viewer’s thoughts. “I really enjoy standing in the room and doing nothing. Somehow, the work responds,” he writes. “In theory it is supposed to be interactive and ‘triggered’ by the movements of viewers, but the installation somehow takes on new moods and can quicken its metabolism even if one does nothing, generating an uncanny sensation. It is like a mindscape.”
Within the dreamlike gallery space, teamLab weaves together calligraphy and computer-generated images, the expressive gesture of the artist’s hand and the pixel, traditional artistic practice and modern digital technology. Melissa McCormick, Harvard professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and Lippit’s wife, says that teamLab’s work engages with both the conditions of contemporary life and with artistic precedent. “Traditional Japanese painting is radical by many standards: It uses a multidimensional and shifting perspective, [it] folds time into spatial representation, and its formats are immersive and anticipate the movement and touch of the viewer,” McCormick writes in an email. “These are all things that have come to characterize digital art made in our current age...but teamLab’s work emphasizes their connection to art in the past and encourages new ways of thinking about links between the science of perception, consciousness, and artistic representation.”
She adds that teamLab’s work has resonance beyond the field of art history. “It would be hard to find a better example of the kind of visually stunning and even poignant results that can emerge through an integration of art and science, something in which many on this campus are thoroughly engaged,” she writes.
Lippit also emphasizes the potential of the work to broaden students’ experience of the arts. “It is not often that Harvard exhibits contemporary artists from Japan or Asia, and the exhibition expands the purview of the arts featured here,” he writes.
The installation “What a Loving and Beautiful World” will be on view in the Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery in Byerly Hall in Radcliffe Yard until Nov. 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the collaborative ability required to play in an orchestra to the technical precision and stage presence needed to be a soloist, different musical ensembles require varying sets of skills. In a string quartet, the four musicians must strike a balance between these two extremes. At Paine Hall on Oct. 16, the Parker Quartet succeeded in this goal as they combined teamwork and technique in their interpretation of Mozart’s String Quartet No. 16, Szymanowski’s String Quartet No.1, and Tchaikovsky’s String Quartet No. 1.
The Grammy Award-winning Parker Quartet, composed of violinists Daniel Chong and Ying Xue, violist Jessica Bodner, and cellist Kee-Hyun Kim, are renowned for their skill and musicality. As artists-in-residence at Harvard, they are committed not only to performance but also to spreading appreciation and knowledge of music by holding lectures at the university. Last Friday, they accomplished that mission by performing at Paine Hall as part of the Blodgett Chamber Music Series.
The Mozart string quartet pleasantly introduced the night, demonstrating the musicians’ obvious skill as they fearlessly approached the fast tempos and virtuosic scales that characterize Mozart’s compositions. With an evidently careful treatment of the piece, the ensemble ensured that each note in every scale was pronounced and that each instrument came together to sound perfectly euphonious—and by adding no unneeded nuance or frivolity, the Parker Quartet ensured that theirs was a highly exact interpretation of Mozart’s String Quartet.
However, as the Parker Quartet delved into Szymanowski and Tchaikovsky, the musicians were able to show that they possessed not only technical skills but also a true knowledge of the purpose and themes of the music they played as they tore through the demanding pieces. While maintaining their precision, the musicians remained emotionally invested in their pieces, expertly translating the notes into melancholy yet exciting music. This combination of skill and connection to the music itself was reflected in the quartet’s impressive harmonization during the Tchaikovsky; in a piece that could have easily been cacophonous due to the number of technical and contrasting chords, the musicians’ individual parts never once clashed. As they played the Szymanowski and Tchaikovsky with great force (as well as with their characteristic accuracy), the Parker Quartet transformed the performance into a thought-provoking experience, moving in and out of mournful and cheerful movements with perfect grace.
In addition to the quartet’s cohesiveness as a group, the musicians’ individual skill was a key reason the concert proved so satisfying. Chong’s and Xue’s respective first and second violin parts rose into eerie yet beautiful high notes that struck the ear with the way they continued to blend with rest of the quartet in spite of their pitch. Likewise, cellist Kim and violist Bodner proved integral as the pieces transitioned into slower, quieter movements, adding soft tones to balance out the high notes of the violins. In the end, it was only through this particular combination of well-trained and well-balanced musicians that the pieces were rendered in such an authentic way.
This performance was a graceful and exact interpretation of three demanding and different works, as the Parker Quartet’s ability to relay the optimism in Mozart’s piece and changing landscapes of Szymanowski and Tchaikovsky’s pieces showcased their musical skill and provided a pleasing night of music. The ensemble’s novelty is not in its new interpretations of music but rather in its ability to make the classic string quartet appeal to a modern audience.

“The truth is rarely pure and never simple,” smirks Algernon Moncrieff (Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16), a rich society man determined to live a life of purposeful moral negligence. The HRDC’s new production of “The Importance of Being Earnest,” which runs Oct. 16-25 in Farkas Hall, shows that this phrase is just as relevant in a modern setting as it was in its Victorian origins. Although the show, directed by Olivia M. Munk ’16, tends to get caught up in its own histrionics, its experienced actors and intelligent direction pull through to make it a cleverly delivered, flawlessly timed production built for levity and amusement.
“The Importance of Being Earnest” follows two society men in a farcical search for a separation of public and private life. In the process, they manage to make up two more characters, impersonate the same man (who doesn’t exist), and, of course, find love—or something close enough to it to get married. The play features Jacob D. Rienstra ’17 as John Worthing (known as Jack), Olivia R. Miller ’16 as Gwendolen Fairfax, Taylor L. Vandick ’16 as Cecily Cardew, and Caleb Spiegel Ostrom ’18 as Lady Bracknell.
While Munk’s direction successfully makes use of the updated setting, the advancement of the script into the 21st century is at times awkward and superficial. The dichotomy between the two settings used in this version of the play, Brooklyn and the Hamptons, reflects the discrepancies between the two concepts. The modern world of New York is wildly different from the play’s original setting, yet the modern transference of Wilde’s classic comedy—overseen by dramaturg Emma R. Adler ’16 (an inactive Crimson Arts editor)—is nevertheless a primarily faithful one, generally keeping in line with his original work almost line by line. The random insertions of modern culture, from hashtags to derogatory comments on veganism, then seem out of place and disrupt the flow of the performance. The play could have been directly related to modern culture in a much more nuanced manner instead of simply slotting in some comedic lines about Long Island or having Hilgartner and Rienstra sing, snap, and practically howl to an overtly horrible reproduction of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” which only adds to the over-dramatic acting present in some scenes.
At times, the actors get carried away. From Gwendolen’s screeching stress-giggles to melodramatically delivered monologues to Jack’s romantic ramblings about Gwen and Cecily’s tantrum when denied her engagement, some of the scenes are overdone. Toward the end of the play, the actors become overly aware of the humor of their own lines, making the audience, like Jack, “sick to death of cleverness.” However, the majority of the play is delivered with reliable finesse. The actors’ extreme comfort on stage reveals itself in a delighted chase scene between Hilgartner and Rienstra,running around stage and throwing their lines over their shoulders to each other, and the simultaneous speech in the third act among Vandick, Miller, Hilgartner, and Rienstra. Their constant movement about the stage keeps the play alive, allowing them to deliver Wilde’s famed epigrams with ease and irreverence.
The instrumental music accompaniment, however, composed by Eric R. Corcoran ’16, is what really steals the proverbial spotlight. Every note played in pairing with the actors’ lines only serves to add to the experience in enriching and humorous ways. Set to the audience’s right, the orchestra doesn’t distract or detract from the onstage action but rather offers a grounded and romantic live accompaniment. The stage is solidly done as well, with simple backgrounds and minimal decor, allowing the majority of the focus to remain on the actors’ capers and verbal sparring. The cast interacts with the sparse props—chairs, food, and drinks—to great comedic effect.
This production of “The Importance of Being Earnest” is a well-timed, well-directed exercise in purposeful cleverness. While the modern interpretation seems out of place at times, the acting is inventively hilarious—if occasionally overwrought—and the staging and directing are thoughtful and intelligent, making for a fun, interesting reproduction of Wilde’s classic farce.

Dizzying, humorous, and sincere, “Song of A Convalescent Ayn Rand Giving Thanks to the Godhead (In the Lydian Mode)” deftly combines Ayn Rand, Beethoven, migraines, and a multitude of other elements, including a night at a strip club and a lecture at the Cato Institute. The play, which runs Oct. 15-Oct. 23 on the American Repertory Theater’s OBERON stage, presents two major questions: What does the novelist Ayn Rand say about pain, and what is the point of suffering?
The play’s title is adapted from Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132 “Heiliger Dankgesang,” or “A Convalescent’s Holy Song of Thanksgiving to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode.” Written by Beethoven during an intense bout of illness, the composition, according to the play’s author and primary actor Michael Yates Crowley, symbolizes how pain inspires art. Crowley takes this belief and adds the Objectivist philosophies of Rand to form the foundation of “Song of a Convalescent,” a combination which lends the play a source of compelling tension and conflict.
Set up as 24 variations (or scenes), the play moves successfully between many different characters and settings. Some, such as a scene featuring Cindy McCain, are immediately comprehensible in their thematic purposes, while others are considerably more vague. It is through Crowley that the audience explores the show’s multiple worlds. In a near one-man production, Crowley plays, in total: himself; a young, angsty teenager named Garner Miller; a Professor Michael Sanders; a Doctor Schuss; the dignified drag queen Tinky Holloway; Beethoven; and, finally, a pale (and very dead) Ayn Rand. Aided by director and fellow cast member Michael Rau during transitions, Crowley moves quickly and effectively among these roles.
The play opens in present day with an introduction to the central motif, migraines, which serves as a jumping-off point for Crowley to ruminate on pain’s meaning. Throughout the production, Crowley and Rau both read from the former’s “migraine diaries,” a series of melancholic journal entries that outline the physical and psychological complications of chronic migraines. Each excerpt details a particular day’s events and the levels of of pain experienced, as well as the toll Crowley’s suffering exacted on him. These highly emotional readings powerfully manifest and reinforce the consideration of pain that lies at the play’s center.
Following scenes—Professor Sanders’ lecture on Ayn Rand at the Cato Institute and Holloway’s musical performance and musings at a strip club in Peoria, Illinois—propel the play’s narrative forward. Both characters’ unironic reverence for Rand informs much of the production’s oddball humor. During these scenes, Crowley still finds a way to maintain the migraine motif; Holloway, for instance, performs songs from her album “Migraineuse.” What Crowley lacks in musical talent—his performances are entertaining but not tuneful—he makes up for in dynamic facial expressions and effective staging. Holloway’s utter devotion to Rand and her own intellectual and musical talents make for a few memorable moments, particularly in the play’s final scene.
Experimental in nature, the play’s set design is minimal: A faded Persian rug, piano, and table where Rau controls sound and video form the basis for about 10 different settings. Creative use of video projection and audio effects establish different backgrounds, signal transitions, provide humor, and allow members of the audience to stay engaged despite the sparse set design. The level of audience participation incorporated in the play before and during the performance makes the experience dynamic. Audience members are asked to write on note cards something that causes pain; these note cards are eventually read out loud by Rau as “Things Ayn Rand Does Not Care About,” creating an enjoyable, improvisational moment.
Crowley does an admirable job at juggling so many roles, yet unfortunately not all of them are entirely distinct or particularly remarkable. His rendition of Beethoven, full of interjecting “ja’s” in an overperformed German accent, treads into caricature and feels forced. Additionally (and strangely), Rand’s cultured demeanor comes across as too similar in personality to the intellectual Holloway. Crowley does a much better job with other characters; the nutty migraine specialist Doctor Schuss, for example, is thoroughly entertaining, providing memorable lines such as “Castration is beautiful, really, like a great game of tennis,” which Crowley delivers in a cheerily nonchalant manner. Rau, the only other actor in the show, who takes over the stage during Crowley’s switches between characters, has a laidback style that meshes well with Crowley’s dramatic monologues. He executes vocal and physical humor quite well throughout the performance, earning many laughs.
A couple of weaknesses—fumbles in dialogue, one scene with strobing lights and random flashing images that feels gratuitous—detract only slightly from the play’s overall success. “Song of a Convalescent” works best when it strikes a balance between humor and sincerity, moments exemplified by Holloway’s enthusiastic musical performances. Although it seems haphazard at its surface, the play maintains a sense of narrative control through the repetition of Crowley’s migraine diaries.

“If you liked ‘Interstellar’ or ‘The Martian,’ but you thought, ‘This isn’t dumb enough […] and I wish this was on a much smaller scale in Adams Pool Theater,’ you should come see ‘Another Sky,’” says Mike A. Skerrett ’18, writer and assistant director of the show. Adventures and misadventures in space have indeed figured prominently in the cinematic world of late. “Another Sky,” which runs Oct. 23-25, hopes to add a hilarious stage production to the entertainment exploration of that final frontier.
In the play, two scientists searching for extraterrestrial life (Elana P. Simon ’18 and active Crimson editor Ben G. Cort ’18) must share a small spacecraft with the cast and producer of a reality TV show (Hannah L. Needle ’19, Adam S. Wong ’17, and Dan E. Hughes ’18). Conflict, comedy, and existential crises ensue. “I think it’s a grounding play,” says Wong, who also directs. “It makes you realize, ‘Oh, things are chill, because nothing matters.’”
Although it is set against the backdrop of the void, the primary aim of “Another Sky” is laughter, says Hughes, who plays reality show producer Bryan Seacrest—“kind of a cross between Patrick Bateman from ‘American Psycho’ and Billy Mays.” Above all, he says, “We hope the jokes come across, and people have to be carted away in ambulances from laughing so hard.”
Skerrett and Wong, who perform together in the improv group Instant Gratification Players, agree that their prior experience together has helped in bringing the script’s humor to life. “I know how [Skerrett’s] joke process works,” explains Wong, “so I’m able to deliver that to the actors better than if I didn’t know what that joke process was like.”
Despite its focus on laughs, “Another Sky” also looks to explore some weighty themes, which the cast hopes will resonate with Harvard students. “It’s got a lot of good, deep underlying messages about not being alone and teamwork and family,” says Needle, who plays Scarlett, a “dumb reality TV star [who] corrects people’s grammar all the time.” “I think that’s important on a college campus, where your friends are your family.”
Cort, who plays one of the scientists, finds another meaning: “It teaches you to go after what you love. As a sophomore who’s struggling to pick a concentration right now, I think that’s really good advice for Harvard students—it’s about passionate people doing passionate things because they’re passionate about them.”
With opening night just a few days away, the cast and staff are palpably excited to bring “Another Sky” to life on Earth. Needle concludes, “It’s out of this world!”

This is probably pure, pretentious coincidence, but “Elegy to the Void,” Beach House’s single from their surprise album “Thank Your Lucky Stars,” shares a title with Cathleen Schine’s beautiful 2011 New York Review of Books write-up about Joan Didion’s “Blue Nights.” Even if vocalist Victoria Legrand and instrumentalist savant Alex Scally didn’t lift the title, however, the likening between their work and “Blue Nights” is oddly compelling. Both works are dark, cerebral, and focused on death. Both works also operate outside of time, trading in political commentary or relevance for something more elemental. Beach House’s elegy, like Didion’s farewell to her daughter, is a restrained, heartbreaking examination of mortality.
After releasing an album every two years since 2005, Beach House has had a wild 2015, offering “Depression Cherry” in August only to drop their unexpected second album in three months last week. Both are fantastically produced, full of interesting lyrical ideas, and sadder than anything Beach House has put out before (which is saying something). The latter is more brooding and referential but not a dramatic departure by any means. Far from being a standout because of its difference, then, “Elegy to the Void,” with its simplistic arpeggios, imagistic poetry, and piercing guitar counter-melody, may be the purest distillation of the duo’s lasting identity. What separates the track is its epic dimensions. The song, which stretches to almost seven minutes, relentlessly tackles the darkest of questions during its gradual build into a guitar solo and final verse that, while devoid of a clear crescendo, feels almost aggressively loud.
“Black clock looming distant / You’re a great white,” Legrand laments near the beginning of her lyric. This clock, perhaps the void itself, is present in every stanza, be it in “a garden of remains,” “the altar,” “the mirror,” and, at the end, “the night.” Legrand intones these seeming sublimations of death with such an ethereal effect that it’s hard not to feel scared. But Scally’s guitar work, oddly comforting, static, and familiar, keeps the song from entering into the macabre. This instrumentation, reverberating as if in a fishbowl, provides the humanistic backbone to the singer’s chilling words. Taken in concert, “Elegy to the Void” is a remarkably tragic and technically stunning work in what has been an overwhelming, yet mostly positive, year for Beach House.

A frayed French almanac, ornate, gold etchings lining the edge of its leather cover. The diary of suffragist Susan B. Anthony, blue ink splattered across its gossamer pages. A dusty vinyl record of the Grammy-winning hiphop standard, “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” A 19th-century drum microscope, years of use having chipped away at its silver coat. It’s an eclectic set of items, spanning generations, continents, and lifestyles. And yet, all share one common quality: Each calls Harvard’s campus home, nestled away in one of the University’s several libraries and archives containing special collections.
Established at different points during the 20th and 21st centuries, these collections stand as a testament to the depth and breadth of scholarship that the college has long fostered. From the artifacts of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments to the poems of Emily Dickinson in Houghton Library, to the feminist art on the history of women in America in the Schlesinger Library to the vinyl records of the Hiphop Archive, the thousands of objects are as numerous as they are diverse. In allowing both College students and outside researchers to come face to face with such historically relevant primary sources—to examine the crinkling pages of artist Walter Crane’s illustrations or peruse the original poetry of John Keats—these collections not only promote rigorous study, but also serve as a conduit between the past and the modern world.
And yet despite the incredible academic opportunities these collections provide, they still struggle to attract the attention of much of the undergraduate population. Recently, collection teams have turned to technology to better engage with the student body, utilizing social media and digital archives to promote both aspects of their collections and potential learning experiences within the libraries. These efforts have proved quite successful, but regardless, the mere existence of the collections bodes well for Harvard. These special collections do more than bolster research opportunities; they preserve and illuminate the stories of the past.
While these unique collections are open for student use, outside researchers and graduate students continue to be the primary patrons. Brionna M. Atkins ’16, a research assistant at the Hiphop Archive, suggests that the imbalance in researcher and undergraduate engagement stems from how many undergraduates simply don’t realize these spaces exist, let alone that they are open to them. “There’s a certain subset of campus that knows about [the Hiphop Archive], and the people who know will come to events,” Atkins says. “But I don’t think most [undergraduates] are aware of it.” For those who are aware, like Atkins, interacting with the archives presents a chance to combine scholarship with personal interests. “It doesn’t feel like work to me. I’m a Sociology concentrator, so I’m combining things I’m working on academically with what I listen to in my free time,” she says.
Since College student attendance has consistently remained lower than that of researchers, several librarians have expressed interest in drawing more undergraduates to these special collections. “I don’t think we’re underutilized, but I do want Houghton to be utilized more,” says Thomas Hyry, the librarian of Houghton Library. “In addition to supporting advanced scholarship, we want to see Houghton as an intellectual center for undergraduates on campus. It’s important that they know about us and that we’re here to help.”
Marilyn Dunn, executive director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library, agrees. “We would love to see more students come to the library,” she says. “We have graphic novels, rare books, inscribed copies, a number of workshops—lots of things students would particularly enjoy.”
Both librarians and administrators understand that the notion of “rare books” or “specialized collections” might potentially intimidate undergraduates from stepping inside the libraries, and their efforts to promote their material are often centered around dispelling that idea. “We really want undergraduates to see Houghton as their library as well,” Hyry says. “Over the last generation, things have really changed here. The attitude that this is an undergraduate’s library was tolerated maybe a generation ago, and then a generation before that actively discouraged, but we’ve really turned a corner.”
The online registration process required to interact with certain library collections can also act as a deterrent to interested students. Unlike in the cases of Widener and Lamont Libraries, undergraduates cannot simply walk into Houghton; instead, they must first fill out a brief form on the library website. “The library is a real intellectual nexus. To do research here, you have to go through a registration process, simply because we need to know just who’s inside,” Hyry says.
Marcyliena Morgan, executive director of Harvard’s Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, says that opening the collections to all undergraduates without screening them risks damaging, or potentially removing, the material inside. “The first hiphop magazine, ‘The Source,’ began here,” Morgan says. “We used to have every issue, but unfortunately, there were some people who felt they should have them more.”
Though the libraries encourage undergraduates to engage with their material, they understand that drawing the same numbers as Widener and the Natural History Museum libraries just simply isn’t feasible. “We’re different than a natural history museum; we just don’t have the infrastructure to have 150,000 people a year. It feels quite crowded when we have 40 people in our permanent exhibit,” says Dr. Jean-François Gauvin, administrative director of the CHSI. “We know our niche: teaching and research and engaging with the Harvard community.”
In recent months, the special collection teams have turned to technology to spread awareness of their materials. Several libraries have begun creating digital versions of various letters, books, and drawings in hopes of piquing the interest of Harvard undergraduates. There’s a growing trend in the idea that if students aren’t coming to the collections, then the collections will come to students. “We’re digitizing the larger, significant collections—Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Dorothy West—so if students can’t get here, they can still get the resources,” Dunn says, in reference to the Schlesinger’s materials. “We’re compensating for the fact that our materials do not circulate, because we want them to be available.”
Houghton Library has even turned to social media to share its material with the academic community, becoming one of the few Harvard collections with an Instagram. Using hashtags such as #watermarkwednesday and #theatrethursday, Houghton routinely posts images of illustrations, photos, and book covers from within its collection. “Social media platforms allow us to promote awareness of Houghton’s collections and services to new audiences,” Hyry says. “Maintaining an active presence on social media provides opportunities for students to learn from our collections in new contexts and, ideally, draw new researchers to the library.” And the strategy seems to be working: Hyry notes, “If you compare the number of undergraduates using Houghton’s reading rooms from last September to this September, we’ve seen a 46 percent growth.”
Other libraries use word-of-mouth tactics to draw Harvard affiliates and outside community members to their collections, often focusing on engaging patrons once they’re actually in the space. “We have guided tours with faculty and students, in addition to hands-on sessions in the library where we bring some of our objects out so people can interact with them,” Gauvin says. Recently, the CHSI team has turned to innovative ways of engaging students, including creating interactive games. For their exhibit on the Rawson Electrical Instrument Co., CHSI volunteers handed guests colorful cards with names and descriptions of famous scientific figures then encouraged the visitors to peruse the gallery in search of what each card was referencing. “The idea was to have people roam around the exhibit, learning more about the company in a fun way,” Gauvin says.
Though strategies for appealing to students differ among libraries, one goal remains constant: to emphasize that the collections are for everyone despite their specializations. The Schlesinger team, for example, hopes undergraduates will recognize that its collections are not solely geared toward those concentrating in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. “Although our collections document the history of women in America, it doesn’t mean the only things you can investigate are women’s studies,” Dunn says. “All of these records allow you to explore American history, because they document the lives of all people, just through a woman’s experience.”
Aside from manuscripts, watermarks and letters, among the collections’ most valuable offerings are the little-known employment and funding opportunities they provide students. This past summer, Alona M. Bach ’16 worked with CHSI through Harvard’s Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program. For Bach, part of the appeal of working at CHSI was the recurring opportunity to hidden secrets of the collection. “We were looking at [marble tablets], and we took these little squares...out of the frame and looked at them under UV light. All of a sudden, we could see place names and numbering systems previously hidden,” Bach says. “These objects are so easily accessible, and the possibility of discovering something new is just so exciting.”
Though not all undergraduates will end up seeking employment at the collections, the librarians agree that it is still possible to have this hands-on experience simply by visiting. The number of classrooms attending Houghton’s collections has increased in the past few months, a trend Hyry attributes to a burgeoning interest in an interactive approach to education. “Teaching has really changed. With a book like ‘Moby Dick,’ you can talk about that in front of people and have this abstract idea, or you can show them this manuscript of ‘Moby Dick’ along with the first edition,” Hyry says. “There’s something that can really come alive: The technical term I think is ‘experiential learning.’ We want to see Houghton as a center for that.”
Additionally, several of these academic spaces, including Houghton, Schlesinger, and the Hiphop Archive, offer monetary stipends for pursuing scholarly work linked to the collections, something of which officials want undergraduates to be more aware. “We have student fellowships that we award every year, for the summer or the school year, that provide students with up to $2,000,” Dunn says. “But these are under-applied for, so we would love to see more students express interest in these research grants.”
Past projects have included everything from papers covering the political participation of Middle Eastern immigrants in the post 9/11 era, to theories of how food trucks evolved from roach coaches, to podcasts about the Houghton library and its collections. Regardless of the subject, the fellowships provide students with the opportunity for a newfound appreciation for the academic material they use in their studies. “From looking at an object instead of just hearing about it, you can see how it was held, or find what spot might’ve been used the most; or if it was broken, see that someone cared about it enough to keep it and mend it,” Bach says. “You can really learn something about the value of an object.”
Regardless of fluctuating student attendance and the occasional opportunity left untaken, those running Harvard’s special collections are simply glad that such spaces for scholarship exist on campus. For some, the collections’ significance lies in their ability to weave threads between ostensibly unrelated topics. “There’s a history to hiphop that matters, one that’s connected to the history of the United States for the past 40 years,” Atkins says. “It illuminates the different things we study in academic disciplines, as well as speaks to them. And these connections are there, but we’re not necessarily making them.”
For others, the collections act as safeguards for historical voices at risk of being forgotten. “We do history here, and we’re an extraordinary resource for original scholarship,” Dunn says. “I suspect that women’s history would still be somewhat invisible if some of these prominent women archives—including the Schlesinger—didn’t exist.”
According to Morgan, the archives can even cultivate a greater sense of community. “People are really hungry for this,” Morgan says. “Hiphop—and the archive—is a symbol to so many people on what they can do, who they can be, and how they can dream. They think, ‘If a place like this exists, then I belong somewhere.’”
Nearly all, however, agree that the collections house more than historical artifacts; they act as repositories for the accounts of generations prior. “There are so many smaller stories that are hidden within the libraries themselves that have really never been worked on and can complicate received narratives of history,” Bach says. If anything, the items stored away in Harvard’s collections are vestibules. Each manuscript, correspondence, and piece of art bears with it a story of shared dreams, failures, and experiences that link the distant past to the present. The collections provide students with the opportunity to examine who we are, and also, to consider where we’ve come from.

“Artists lead and hacks ask for a show of hands,” says Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) to Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) in Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin’s biopic of the Apple co-founder. The film follows Jobs’ rise, fall, and return, delving into his unrelenting bravado, his explosive relationships, and ultimately his art: leading even when that means walking alone. The snappy dialogue of Aaron Sorkin’s masterful screenplay, buttressed by convincing performances by the film’s lead actors and Boyle’s innovative direction, captures the complex essence of a man who was at once loathed and worshipped and ultimately changed the way in which we interact with our world.
Sorkin’s masterful screenplay digs into Jobs’ character with striking depth despite a relative lack of settings and scenes—the entirety of the mimetic action of the film occurs in the moments leading up to three product launches throughout Jobs’s career. While overloading these scenes with drama might have caused the script to fall flat, Sorkin is aware of the potential heavy-handedness of the narrative’s organization. During the third act, Jobs asks an auditorium full of employees if, “five minutes before each product launch, everyone goes and gets drunk and tells [him] how they really feel.” It is this lucidity that allows Sorkin’s script to overcome any necessary pitfalls of storytelling and keep the audience engaged, disbelief safely suspended.
The script also invites the audience into a sort of meta-joke by layering Sorkin’s screenplay with dramatic irony, playing on the gap between perceptions of computers in the early days of Apple and the knowledge of computers that has become so commonplace today. The film opens with a video clip of Arthur C. Clarke discussing in 1974 what he believed the computer would accomplish by 2001. “They will make it possible to live really anywhere we like. Any businessman, any executive, could live almost anywhere on Earth and still do his business through a device like this,” Clarke says. The peek back into the history of these machines that have become so commonplace provides a laugh, certainly, but it also begs the viewer to reflect on the seemingly endless reach of computers and to think about how they interact with them.
With such a large shadow cast by Sorkin’s screenplay, it is remarkable that director Danny Boyle is not entirely lost in the dark. While Boyle’s direction does tend to err toward safe shots that minimize the role of the camera and maximize the role of the dialogue, his directorial prowess shines through at select moments that are integral to the fabric the film. One particular sequence, which acts as a segue between two product launch acts, is a tracking shot that follows Jobs’s daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine) down a corridor, the camera floating along with boozy disregard, the lens drifting and poorly focused. Headlines are projected onto the frame, and the early failure of the Mac is made clear. The tactful and inspired direction of this sequence allows a four-year gap in the screenplay to pass without missing a beat.
And still, it is the stage-like simplicity of most scenes in the film that is most memorable. The actors who bring Sorkin’s words to life do so with remarkable vigor. Most remarkable of these performances is that of Kate Winslet, who dons an Eastern European accent in her portrayal of marketing executive Joanna Hoffman. She perfectly captures the complex nature of her character’s strange relationship with Jobs—she is once referred to as his “work-wife”—and is a likely candidate for nominations when awards season comes round.
Fassbender, for his part, plays a convincing Jobs. It is difficult to like his character, and that is the point. “The musicians play their instruments, and I play the orchestra,” he says in response to a comment that he lacks technical abilities. The Steve Jobs of Sorkin, Boyle, and Fassbender is an artist, perhaps even an auteur, but he is also a narcissist who alienates those around him. He pushes people away to provide space to accommodate his ever growing ego and loses many friends as a result. Simultaneously, he creates the iMac and the iPod.
Is designing a computer art? Is leading a team of software developers akin to conducting an orchestra? “Steve Jobs” asks—but ultimately does not answer—these questions. For the character of Jobs, however, the answer is obvious. Periodically throughout the film, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) objects to Jobs’ notion that he is some kind of artist. “Computers aren’t paintings”, he says. Steve Jobs has a simple reply: “Fuck you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Faust and the Harvard Corporation insist that investing Harvard’s endowment is work properly reserved exclusively to them and the experts they employ. They are, after all, not only the legal but the legitimate authorities. They are in charge because they are smart, rational, single-mindedly results-oriented. Their authority rests not only on assumptions of propriety but on evidentiary claims.
That is, the University leadership claims to know what the rest of Harvard’s stakeholders—faculty, students, alumni, and others—do not: how to maximize returns on $37.6 billion. Unlike moralists, they do not let extraneous concerns stand in their way. They know how the real world works; we do not. Not only our moral but our empirical arguments are misguided. Ignorant, we have no standing.
In the Corporation’s view, Divest Harvard’s do-gooders are, in the end, amateurs. Arguments to the effect that Harvard is directly and indirectly invested in activities that threaten civilization are nothing more than worthless, self-righteous gestures. Harvard’s campaign to divest from fossil fuel companies, however commendably intended, is the work of interlopers, moralists, and other childish miscreants who fail to grasp the grown-up world in which professional adults carry out their well-informed labors.
President Faust’s certitude that she knows how to address the unfolding climate change catastrophe extends to a program of action. Harvard should teach, research, and engage (i.e., talk things over with corporate leadership). Yet here too, the engagement part of Harvard’s program floats free of evidence. If the Corporation sincerely believes that “engagement” produces results, to paraphrase a notorious manifesto, do the University’s leaders not need to pay decent respect to the opinions of its stakeholders by declaring the causes which impel them to their policies?
The Corporation's claim to a monopoly of relevant expertise now crashes against hard numbers. As has been widely reported, during fiscal year 2015, the endowment grew 3.3 percent. In fiscal 2014, the investment return was 5.8 percent. Harvard’s returns lagged significantly behind those of Yale, Stanford, MIT, Bowdoin, and the University of Virginia. For years, Divest Harvard and other divestment campaigners have argued that fossil fuel investments not only gamble with the future of civilization but make less money than fossil-free portfolios. (One strong summary of such arguments can be found in this article written by former SEC commissioner Bevis Longstreth, who graduated from the Law School in 1961.)
A less generous way to put it: The Corporation’s professed expertise does not pass the laugh test.
So what test does it pass? How does their claim to knowledge and sound judgment fare? Where is their fiduciary responsibility hiding?
The Harvard Management Company’s filings with the SEC (the latest, from this August, can be found here) show that direct stockholding of fossil-fuel stocks is low. (In recent years, Harvard has sold most of its direct fossil-fuel investments. About indirect holdings we are in the dark.)
If the holdings that remain are bets that oil prices are going to rise again long-term, Harvard is betting that global efforts to hold down global warming to a more tolerable—or less intolerable—degree will fail; betting that the forthcoming Paris talks will fail; and that Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, is mistaken when he says that “investors face ‘potentially huge’ losses from climate change action that could make vast reserves of oil, coal and gas ‘literally unburnable.’”
But most of all, the Corporation is insisting on its prerogative to invest where they like wherever they like on the grounds that their judgments are sound and, since their purpose is good, it is also ethical.
When Divest Harvard got off the ground, just about all leading institutions in American society were in default. Corporations were merrily proceeding to spend some $674 billion a year to acquire far more fossil fuel reserves than can safely be burned. One of our major political parties was in the grip of climate ignoramuses soaking up millions of dollars in oily donations. The other, the Democrats, were stalled, wishing to roll back fossil fuel dependency but taking little action. The churches were pious but inactive. Universities looked to be the only core institutions in America who might be in some sense free to evolve.
Over the last two and a half years, President Obama has taken important (though not adequate) steps toward climate sanity. So has President Xi of China. Many (not nearly all) investment funds have taken responsibility. Major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are launching sustainable investment funds with the conviction that (as Goldman Sachs partner and managing director Hugh Lawson says) President Faust’s claim that divestment from fossil fuels would “come at a substantial economic cost” is “not necessarily true.” Governments of the major nations are moving. Pope Francis has issued a stirring and brilliant clarion call toward climate sanity. Stanford, the University of California, Syracuse, have in greater or lesser degrees set their own courses toward divestment. Most self-described conservatives now accept that climate change is happening and has human causes.
The rest of the world is lurching toward reason, by fits and starts, and not adequately, but Harvard remains obdurate. The Corporation’s commitment to its own hauteur is apparently so intense as to crowd out what is supposed to be their strong suit, namely their knowledge of how to develop a comprehensive, long-term vision of fiduciary responsibility and to direct investment accordingly. They demonstrate neither veritas nor gravitas. This is scandalous. How long, Harvard?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was quietly posted on the website of the Title IX Office last week. Though billed as “Frequently Asked Questions” on the university’s newly created sexual assault policies, the 10-page document reads like much more than that: a backdoor revision to the existing procedures that appears to contradict or significantly alter the meaning of some policy provisions.
Examples of these contradictions and alterations abound. Though the procedures say that personal advisers “should be an officer of the University who is affiliated with the School or unit in which the advisee is enrolled or employed,” the FAQs specifies that students may use attorneys as well. While the procedures specify that appeals are heard by “the Title IX Officer or designee,” the FAQ expands the meaning of designee from one person to an entire “standing committee of faculty and senior administrators.”
Significantly, the FAQs also explain for the first time that the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which investigates University-wide allegations of sexual assault and harassment, will use a “reasonable person” standard to determine if sexual harassment occurred. The move addresses serious concerns about academic freedom. The document also establishes a difference between “intoxication” and “incapacitation.”
To be sure, all of these changes are for the better. But significant updates to the policy ought to be codified in the official policies and procedures themselves, not in separate, disjointed documents of unknown standing in actual adjudication.
Many of the questions posed and answered seem to be direct responses to the concerns of Harvard Law School professors, who broke away and established their own, significantly better sexual assault policy last year.
So while it is good that the University has responded to the critiques and made sure to dispel worries about academic freedom and the possible forbidding of consensual sex between intoxicated students, those important protections need to be institutionally recognized in more than an FAQ document. That would be for the benefit of all—accusers and accused.
The release of the FAQ also seems a tacit acknowledgment that the University erred when it first rolled out its new, centralized sexual harassment policy. Law School professors complained that they weren’t consulted in the first drafting, and that their concerns were ignored in the months after it was put into effect, leading them to publish an embarrassing condemnation of the policy in the Boston Globe.
Even now, issues remain. The University’s policy still centralizes fact-finding and adjudication in a single body. Though students now apparently have the right to attorneys, no mention is made of providing lawyers to students who cannot afford one—a key measure that the Law School procedures do include. And all cases will operate on the Department of Education-preferred “preponderance of evidence” standard, while the “clear and convincing evidence” standard proposed by some law professors is better.
These quibbles may seem small, but they are not. On something as consequential as sexual assault policy, the University must ensure that its policies are as fair and coherent as possible. And sometimes, to make things better, we have to admit that we made mistakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Something is rotten in the state of Connecticut. It all started one month ago, when the Wesleyan Argus had the audacity to publish an op-ed critical of the Black Lives Matter movement. Soon came the wrath of that new breed of student, incapable of confronting opposing opinion and quick to call for radical intervention, who filed a petition to defund the Argus unless their demands were met.
Among them: that editors attend a mandatory social justice training every semester and that a dedicated space be provided on every front page exclusively for marginalized groups. Until then, boycotters of the paper have pledged to destroy copies of the paper on campus.
Read that again. Weep.
Intolerance of counterrevolutionary messaging, mandatory reeducation of its practitioners, and burning the books of dissidents—sheer totalitarianism. Brazen attempted censorship of this sort cannot be called anything else.
This disturbingly illiberal tendency springs from their unshaking belief in their ideology’s infallibility. Not only that, but that their project is so righteous that it must be imposed upon the unwilling, who could only be acting out of selfishness and ignorance. They who know not what they do, and who must not be forgiven.
Consider the claims of the students clamoring for the newspaper’s dissolution—that “the Argus chose to give this man somewhere to share his disrespectful opinion…a silent agreement with its content, and a silent agreement to the all too prevalent belief that black [and] brown people do not deserve a voice.” Disregard for a moment the assertion that a concept as subjective and ill-defined as respectability trumps a person’s freedom to speak, or what that might logically entail in Iran, and examine the alleged secretly racist intentions of the newspaper:
The offending op-ed, a neither-here-nor-there piece that would have been safely disregarded in less scandal-hungry times, actually took pains to be measured—repeatedly emphasizing that his objection lied with extremists and not the movement itself. But no matter. Were it twice as strident, it would still have a place in a campus newspaper.
Let’s establish what the op-ed was not: It was not racist and it did not create an unsafe space in any reasonable construal of the concept of safety. Yet an anonymous “group of concerned and unapologetic students of color” wrote an open letter pronouncing that “the debate has become whether members of our community even deserve, not only to exist on this campus, but simply to live.” If anyone has any idea how this statement even approximates logic, I’d appreciate knowing—I’m baffled.
The very next sentence in the letter gives me a sense of the response I would get: “By focusing on the freedom of speech instead of students’ lives and ability to safely exist on this campus, you are practicing censorship and you are partaking in racism.”
Oh, well. Let’s carry on.
Apparently censorship isn’t the literal attack and attempted dismantling of newspapers that challenge the official narrative, as any fair reading of the word might suggest. No, it is the dissent from orthodoxy that is labeled censorship in this newest of Orwellianisms.
Opinion pages aren’t echo chambers. In the best of worlds, they publish original ideas, factually supported and logically structured, on any topic—especially those deemed unpopular to most. Rather than cater to the demands of the most vocal activists of the day or the values of the silent majority of their readership, opinions pages present arguments and viewpoints that uplift, depress, excite, and enrage us—not to comfort us in the righteousness of our own beliefs, but to confront them, their messy contradictions and shaky assumptions, head-on.
All that is to say that the sins of the op-ed, or whatever you hallucinate the sins of the op-ed to be, do not redound upon the newspaper. To shy away from opposing ideas and discomforting questioning may be a personal preference, but foisting one’s inflexibility on the rest of us is an entirely different matter.
It’s disappointing then that the Argus editors have largely acquiesced to the criticism, rather than forcefully denouncing its wrongheadedness. A front-page editorial apologized “for the distress the piece caused the student body” and its “position of power on campus.”
“We failed the community on Tuesday in many ways.” They promise to publish a “Black Out issue” written entirely by students of color.
No. There was a chance there to stand for something, for the hard-fought gains of the free speech movement that are now threatened everywhere from Michigan to California, rather than kowtowing.
The newspaper only failed its community when it refused to stand up for itself. Those extremists who would shut down an entire paper rather than be challenged by a single article are just that—extremists.
The newly conjured right to avoid offense is inherently impossible to satisfy. And we shouldn’t try to either. No, mandatory “social justice trainings” won’t prevent you from ever being discomforted, and offering front-page space to people of color is a half-baked idea without any precedent in journalism.
The theory of separate spaces for people of color is predicated on the inaccessibility of traditional spaces to us, an assumption that doesn’t hold in the case of newspapers that, to my knowledge, do not limit applications to whites only. To sequester people of color into a designated section wrongly implies that they could not have been printed otherwise—and I’d rather publish this column under the same banner as my peers than in a separated special box.
On campuses across the country, the mantle of progressivism has been seized by the illiberal and illogical, by people whose philosophies are so shaky that they feel required to shut down and censor voices of dissent. And if that remains the case, if rightly-intended movements continue to be co-opted by Stalinist factions, then those movements will fail.
It’s as simple as that.

This weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta brought with it more than just spandex-clad rowers and crowded bridges; for Harvard Square establishments, it also brought a boom in sales and a change of pace from business as usual.
Attracting more than 11,000 rowers of all ages and more than 400,000 spectators each year, the Head of the Charles Regatta is the world’s largest two-day rowing event. It regularly drives traffic to Harvard Square’s businesses, especially those in the hotel and food industries.
"It’s always a great weekend for the Square, and this weekend was no different,” Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said. “It’s a weekend that businesses count on every year.”
All 295 of the rooms at the Charles Hotel were booked well in advance of the weekend, according to Michael O’Connell, the hotel’s assistant director of the front office, adding that people were already reserving rooms for next year.
Other parts of the Charles Hotel saw increased foot traffic as well, particularly its shops and restaurants.
“It was phenomenal business,” said Najie Elkarmach, manager of Henrietta’s Table, an American bistro within the Charles Hotel. “It was just a constant flow of business, people walking in and pretty much ordering everything we had to offer.”
Other restaurants in the Square experienced similar surges in customers, especially those that offer take-out options.
The Just Crust saw a 40 percent increase in sales, according to chef and general manager Joaquim Filho. For its part, Tasty Burger had one of its busiest days in recent memory, corporate manager Lem Taipan said. Similarly, Tom Brush, co-owner of Felipe’s Taqueria, said that the Mexican restaurant reaped an added bonus this year from its new bar.
“The bar supports the food and the food supports the bar,” Brush said. “This year with Head of the Charles, the bar definitely added another dimension to our offerings and definitely spurred sales quite a bit.”
Brush, who also owns Flat Patties and whose daughter owns Crema Cafe, spoke of the success that his family’s businesses enjoyed over the weekend: “We’ve got Crema in the morning, Felipe’s at late night, and Flat Patties in between."
In addition to added revenue, business owners said that they enjoyed the chance to interact with customers from all over the world, including members of visiting rowing teams.

Choreographer and “punk ballerina” Karole Armitage discussed the meaning behind dance and its connection to other realms of life in a talk entitled “Naked Body Language” at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Monday afternoon.
Armitage’s talk, this year’s Julia S. Phelps Annual Lecture in the Arts and Humanities, focused on her unique perception of dance.
“I believe that dance, like all of the arts, is a philosophic practice,” Armitage said. “We start to see or feel or gain insight from this unfolding of pattern.”
Armitage’s talk drew on her diverse range of experiences in the dance world. She began her professional career in classical ballet but later went on to expand her repertoire, choreographing two Broadway musicals, including “Hair,” and music videos for Madonna and Michael Jackson. She also choreographed contemporary works that blended dance, music, art, and philosophical questions.
“People think [ballet] is an aesthetic like Giselle or Swan Lake,” Armitage said. “But for me, ballet is actually a science of motion, and a very brilliant science that...gives you the tools to use your body, control your body, and have freedom to do what you want.”
With the use of video excerpts, Armitage progressed through the history of dance, noting times when variances in choreographic style reflected changing societal norms.
“It is the job of a contemporary artist to try to reveal the meaning of our times today, and put forth ideas for people to confront or dispute,” Armitage said.
Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute, discussed the unique nature of dance as an art form in her remarks introducing Armitage.
“Whereas painters depict with line and pigment, and composers craft with sound, choreographers create with the human form,” Cohen said. “Just as learning a second language can light up new neural pathways in our brains, so encountering the language of dance can teach us new ways of discovering and communicating meaning that go beyond the verbal.”
ZZ Packer, a former Radcliffe fellow and the speaker at last year’s Phelps Annual Lecture, said Armitage’s presentation expanded her understanding of dance.
“For me, this was incredible because...I felt as though, even though I’m a writer, I don’t have the language for dance or the capacity to understand it very much,” Packer said. “She began by expressly talking about that and how there’s no particular code.”
The event culminated in a discussion between Armitage and Richard Colton, founder and director of Summer Stages Dance at The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston.

UPDATED: October 20, 2015, at 6:37 p.m.
Harvard students now have access to the alumni directory as part of a new initiative from the Harvard Alumni Association that seeks to better connect students still on campus with those who have graduated.
This change comes with the replacement of Crimson Compass, an online platform created by the HAA to facilitate mentoring between students and alumni. About 18,000 alumni volunteered to serve as mentors on the site, which Anne Cushing, HAA's director of engagement marketing, called “dated” in an emailed statement.
Replacing the old site, HAA has revamped the alumni directory to deliver “a more intuitive and dynamic data management and search experience for alumni and students,” Cushing wrote.
For instance, students and alumni can now connect more easily with alumni in their field of interest over social media platforms like LinkedIn.
“Alumni and students can build their professional brand and networks by reaching out to alumni in industries, specialties, and companies of interest,” Cushing wrote. Cushing added that the updated site allows users more flexibility when describing their professions, making the process “more natural and current with industry trends.”
Staff members of the Office of Career Services applauded the new changes, emphasizing the site’s usefulness for students looking for mentors or job opportunities, especially in careers for which OCS does not have an pre-existing contact network.
“What...we’re so lucky to have is leveraging the Harvard network,” said Robin E. Mount, OCS director of career, research, and international opportunities. “Harvard has probably the best built out alumni networks, so we’re able to help students.”
Deborah Carroll, OCS associate director of employer relations and operations, also emphasized how useful a resource the Harvard alumni network can be for job-seeking students.
On the updated site, students can access the profiles of all alumni in the directory, not only those who were previously part of Crimson Compass. Alumni who are willing to act as mentors would highlight that information in their profiles.
Though the updated directory is up and running, marketing for alumni and information for students about the system will be communicated by HAA and Harvard’s schools, respectively, later this fall, according to HAA staff.

Gasps from the audience filled the room during a Kennedy School of Government seminar Monday afternoon as BBC foreign correspondent Paul Wood played video of himself and his news crew under attack in Syria in 2014. Images of assault rifles and dusty streets flashed across the bouncing camera lens as Wood and his crew fled for cover in a nearby basement from the fighting.
“Everybody there assumed that if we didn’t die in the initial firefight, we’d be in the orange jumpsuits and beheaded,” Wood said
The discussion, titled “Understanding ISIS,” was the latest installment of the Herbert C. Kelman Seminar on International Conflict Analysis and Resolution. After Wood described his on-the-ground experiences, Georgetown University professor and Kennedy School visiting fellow Michael C. Hudson provided a historical and academic perspective on the region’s conflicts.
Hudson also spoke of social media, the interests of larger international powers like Russia and the United States, and the Iraq War as key developments that have led to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria’s insurgency.
Wood described in vivid detail the many atrocities committed by ISIS on which he had reported while on assignment. These included the capture and sale of women and girls into sex slavery, as well as torture, kidnappings, and internationally-publicized beheadings.
Sectarian conflict, Wood said, often forced rebels into allegiance based on religion, money, or security rather than organic fidelity to the movement itself.
Hudson and Wood alluded to the difficulties facing the United States in determining whether, to what extent, and how best to intervene.
At the close of the discussion, Wood described the unusual position in which ISIS has placed the international community in relation to President of Syria Bashar al-Assad—he and his regime are accused of crimes against humanity after allegedly bombing the Syrian people.
“It now seems appallingly logical that the one side that might be the right side to back might be the [Assad] regime: the regime that has killed 200,000 innocent people,” Wood said.
After the presentation, Hudson said that the actions of the U.S. in the Middle East have created unique challenges for the superpower going forward.
“The United States is seen as an enemy of Islam in the region,” Hudson said, “and continuing to bomb ISIS in the region, especially considering effects such as collateral damage to civilians, may actually worsen the problem.”e to civilians, may actually worsen the problem.”

Jennicet Gutiérrez, the transgender activist who interrupted President Barack Obama at a White House event in June, shared her experience immigrating to the U.S. and advocating for undocumented BGLTQ immigrants at Harvard on Monday.
The event, titled “A Call for Justice,” opened in Yenching Auditorium with a video clip showing Gutiérrez, an undocumented immigrant, interrupt Obama’s June White House address celebrating his work on BGLTQ issues.
Gutiérrez said interrupting Obama was intentional. She planned the move about a week in advance, when colleagues from the organization she co-founded, Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, reached out to her.
When her colleagues asked if she would be willing to interrupt Obama, “without hesitation I said 'yes,'” Gutiérrez said. “As an activist, I wasn’t really concerned about respecting politics… At the moment, I wanted to raise my voice.”
Gutiérrez argued that placing immigrants in detention centers without regard to their gender identities was humiliating and that BGLTQ-identified immigrants in detention centers often experienced sexual and physical assault.
Salvatore R. DeFrancesco ’19 said he was impressed by Gutiérrez’s willingness to “stand up for what she believed in” and then come speak to Harvard students about it.
“I was fascinated by how she spoke about all the transgender immigrants who are detained in facilities,” DeFrancesco said. “No one really talks about that.”
“The question-answer session was really eye opening and had a lot of profound statistics about what’s happening to that community,” Alea G. Challenger ’19 said.
The event was co-sponsored by Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, the Harvard College Women’s Center, and the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life, among other organizations.

UPDATED: October 20, 2015, at 6:33 p.m.
Harvard Medical School has raised just more than $467 million in its capital campaign, making significant progress toward its goal of $750 million in the first year of the drive’s public phase.
The Medical School’s arm of the Harvard Campaign, titled “The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine,” consists of four campaign priorities: “Education,” “Discovery,” “Service,” and “Leadership.” It launched in November 2014 and is now more than 60 percent of the way to its goal, according to data shared by Laura DeCoste, the executive director of development communications and special events at the school. 
This total, updated as of the end of August, represents contributions of 7,155 different financial gifts from various alumni, board members, volunteers, faculty, staff, foundations, corporations, and friends of the school. Recently, the Medical School took in a gift from the Warren Alpert Foundation, which pledged $20 million toward the school’s immunology research department, a new professorship, and the dean’s discretionary fund.
The school’s take, so far, has favored the research-oriented “Discovery” priority, which has raised $311 million of its $500 million goal. The “Service” bucket, which focuses on global health and the improvement of health equity and healthcare systems worldwide, has raised $80 million, $30 million more than its target. The “Leadership” objective, a broadly defined priority aimed at innovation, has raised $38 million toward its $40 million target.
The “Education” area of the Medical School campaign is relatively farthest from its individual target. It has raised $37 million out of a stated goal of $160 million.
The slower progress in this field comes as the Medical School implements a new curriculum that is more dependent on the flipped classroom model of pre-class learning and in-class application, representing a significant restructuring of the school’s teaching practice. Students have, so far, been mixed about the new style of learning, with some pointing to increased workloads, and many praising the increased interaction between faculty, students, and academic material.
One component of a larger $6.5 billion University-wide campaign, the Medical School’s campaign launched in fall 2014 at the Boston Park Plaza hotel with a star-studded guest list including Yo-Yo Ma ’76, 250 alumni, and University and Medical School officials. On the whole, Harvard’s fundraising drive has been kind to the Longwood Medical Area, which also hosts the School of Public Health, the recipient of a $350 million pledge last year from the foundation run in part by HSPH alumnus Gerald L. Chan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three panelists argued that being conservative or religious is not mutually exclusive with supporting same-sex marriage at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday.
The panel, titled “The Conservative Case for Marriage Equality,” featured speakers from a variety of backgrounds who approached the issue from both legal and religious perspectives.
Margaret H. Marshall, the former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, made a distinction between civil marriage and a religious conception of marriage.
Marshall, who famously wrote the landmark 2003 majority opinion in the case that legalized same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, said she realized during the case that many benefits were being denied to same-sex couples solely based on the fact that they could not marry.
She argued that oppression, in the context of many different issues, often comes from a religious perspective, which should not be a justification in the U.S.
Andrew M. Sullivan, a writer, blogger, and former editor of The New Republic who is gay and Roman Catholic, said he believed “we have kind of resolved the civil question,” and that now is the time to focus on bringing the religious conversation to the fore.
“There is no doubt as to where Jesus would’ve been,” Sullivan said, referring to allowing same-sex couples to have the same rights as heterosexual ones. He said he believes a conversation within the Church is required to bring about a change in mindset on this issue.
Matthew R. Vines ’12, the founder of the Reformation Project and author of “God and the Gay Christian,” argued that the Bible does not completely prohibit same-sex marriage, given that he believes the essence of marriage is not, according to the Bible, procreation.
“The essence of marriage, theologically, according to Scripture, is about making and keeping a covenant with your spouse that reflects God’s covenant with humanity,” Vines said.
Given the progress in same-sex rights already achieved on the civil front, Sullivan said the focus should now be on moving forward.
“The job of politics should at some point end and the challenges of life should begin,” Sullivan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's several large-scale construction projects across the Charles River are progressing as planned, University Construction Mitigation Director Edward G. LeFlore told Allston residents on Monday.
The University is currently in the process of securing permits for its plans to construct a complex for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in the neighborhood, LeFlore said at Monday’s Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee meeting. The six-story complex, as detailed late last month, will house classrooms, labs, lounge spaces, an exhibition space, a cafeteria, and 250 parking spots.
 Harvard Business School’s development of the Chao Center, meanwhile, is going according to plan, LeFlore said, although he suggested that the new Klarman Hall auditorium “is going to be tough to build” because of the small size of the roads leading into the graduate school’s campus.
Harvard is also in the “last stretch” of construction in Rena Park, LeFlore said.
And while LeFlore came prepared with updates on those multi-million-dollar projects, residents directed the latter part of the meeting to criticize the leadership of the Harvard-Allston Task Force.
“We have to get the task force straightened out,” neighborhood resident Paul “Chip” Alford said, arguing that a lack of transparency surrounding appointments to the advisory board hinders its ability to represent the neighborhood.
Attendees also expressed concerns about the area's rodent population and how the University's construction might be related to its perceived growth. In the past, Allston residents have voiced their concerns about Harvard’s construction developments creating favorable living conditions for rats.
“Today when I saw [a rat] jumping through my yard, I thought it was a bunny from the way he was hopping, but then when he went under my fence, I said ‘Hey, that’s not a rabbit!’” Allston resident Joyce Radnor said. “Harvard always gets blamed, though, but it might not always be their fault; when [Harvard’s] big foundations and ditches are being worked on and then we see rats, we assume a correlation.”
John Meaney, assistant commissioner of the Boston Inspectional Services Department, said, “We like to think that all our [sewer] systems are tight, but they’re not.” Despite this, “overall in this area we’re doing pretty well.”
LeFlore said Harvard has continuously worked to contain the rat population in areas near its construction sites.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate leaders of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group, are criticizing the “Frequently Asked Questions” document administrators released to clarify Harvard’s sexual harassment policies, arguing that it contains language that is opaque and inaccessible to students.
Last week, administrators released the supplementary document in the wake of results from the University’s sexual conduct climate survey, which showed that students overwhelmingly had little knowledge of and trust in Harvard’s response to sexual assault on campus. Administrators designed the supplementary document to clarify the University’s policies after a federal probe found Harvard Law School in violation of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX last year.
Law School professors, many of whom oppose Harvard’s policies, offered praise in response to the document’s release. But undergraduates in Our Harvard Can Do Better, a group whose members have been among the most vocal student critics of Harvard’s handling of campus sexual assault, said the document offers little clarification. 
The frequently asked questions and answers are “totally inaccessible,” said Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better. “This is not written or formatted in a way that makes it easy for students to understand, or even really possible for students to understand in a quick way,” she said.
In an interview last week, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said the document clarified, among other points, the policy’s protections for freedom of speech in the classroom and the difference between the states of incapacitation and intoxication and when individuals can consent to sexual activity. The document also stipulated that students may turn to lawyers as personal advisers throughout the case investigation process, and that case appeals go to a body of faculty and senior administrators.
Fournier said some questions do clarify points of confusion in the policy, and she praised the document for specifying that complainants and respondents will not be asked to face each other during a case.
Still, she said that many answers contain legalistic language, which she argued may not be accessible to students. Specifically, she said, the document’s mention of the “reasonable person” standard used by case investigators to assess whether sexual harassment occurred may not be clear to undergraduate readers.
Fournier also argued that the document—despite clarifying that students may consent to sexual activity while intoxicated, but not incapacitated, under Harvard’s policy—did not adequately define the difference between the two states. She also criticized the document’s use of the words “objective” and “subjective” to describe factors for determining whether sexual conduct is welcome or unwelcome without giving specific examples.
“Being a lawyer should not be a prerequisite to being safe on your campus or to be able to understand what your rights are and how this University is going to protect you,” Fournier said.
The student advocates also criticized what they said was a lack of student involvement in the FAQ document’s drafting. Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17 argued that unlike when administrators published a brochure further detailing the policy last semester, students were not adequately consulted this time.
Karvonides said last week that administrators did not speak to students about the document’s exact phrasing prior to creating it, but they did send the materials pre-publication to student leaders for feedback.
Our Harvard Can Do Better, which filed a complaint prompting an ongoing federal investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance last year, will still push administrators to clarify the policies, according to Fournier and Fox-Penner.
The group is also in the process of responding to the sexual conduct climate survey results, which were released late last month, by soliciting additional feedback from students. Last month, they hosted a private town hall discussion.
Fournier added that Our Harvard Can Do Better will continue to argue for increased mandatory Title IX training for students. She argued that sexual assault survey results, which showed deficits in undergraduate knowledge about training,  a need for increased programming.
“This is a moment where there could potentially be a lot of support for that,” Fournier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A victory at the New England Match Racing Championship in Newport, R.I., highlighted the Harvard sailing team's performance over five regattas this weekend.
NEW ENGLAND MATCH RACING CHAMPIONSHIP
With their victory on Sunday, sophomore Nick Sertl, senior Jacob Bradt, and sophomore Taylor Ladd became the first Harvard team to win the Larry White Trophy since 2002 and qualified for the ICSA Match Race National Championship.
Dartmouth and Yale finished second and third, respectively. Despite his boat's lack of experience with match racing, Bradt looks forward to competing at the national championships, which will be held Nov. 20-22 in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.
“A big concern of ours was our combined lack of experience racing this style of keelboat; however, our boat handling and boat speed rarely got in the way of our performance, and at time was far superior to our competitors,” Bradt said. “I’m definitely proud of our performance because of how well the three of us were able to come together and work as a team.”
Harvard came into Sunday as the number four seed after competing in the qualifying round robin on Saturday. The Crimson pulled a clean victory going 2-0 in the final round against Dartmouth.
TRUXTON UMSTED MEMORIAL REGATTA
Harvard finished third of 19 teams behind College of Charleston and Georgetown. Saturday saw five protests and one request for redress filed, resulting in three disqualifications.
With four divisions to fill, the Crimson sent senior pairing of skipper Andrew Mollerus and crew Sydney Karnovsky in the A division, senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord in the B division, junior Juan Carlos Perdomo in the C division, and freshman Andrew Puopolo in the D division.
“The team did extremely well and we were pretty solidly in third place,” Puopolo said.
Perdomo, who was NEISA coed sailor of the week of Sept. 30, finished third, only two points behind second and five behind first in his respective division. His teammates contributed as well, with every boat finishing inside the top 10 in its division
YALE’S WOMEN INTERCONFERENCE REGATTA
Harvard sailors finished 17th of 18 teams at Yale. The Crimson sent senior skipper Sophie Bermudez and junior crew Emma wheeler in the A division and freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Kristina Jakobson in the B Division.
In the A division, Harvard finished 18th out of 18 teams with a score of 245 rotating in Jakobson and sophomore Ariana Gross into the initial lineup.
The Crimson boat fared better in B division placing 16th with Gross also rotating in.
Shifty winds prevailed both days for the sailors who competed in Z420 boats resulting in two capsizes on Sunday. The US Coast Guard Academy dominated with University of Rhode Island and Yale behind them, respectively.
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
Harvard finished 14th out of 18 teams over three divisions at the Dartmouth-hosted Captain Hurst Bowl. Freshman skipper Nick DiGiovanni and junior crew Priscilla Russo took the A division, freshman skipper Jackson Wagner and junior crew Olivia Kjorlien sailed in the B division, and sophomore skipper Dylan Farrell and junior crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj took the C division.
Winds ranged from five to 15 knots and temperatures in the 60 degree range on Saturday. Temperatures dropped drastically on Sunday to lows in the mid 20s with mild snow flurries.
In the A division, the Crimson placed 13th out of 19 teams with a score of 156. The B division, won by Stanford freshmen Kathryn Booker and Russell Clarida, saw Harvard finish 16th with freshman Divya Arya and sophomore Kevin Coakley rotating in. They also pulled out a 13th place in the C division.
Boston College finished first backed by a dominating boat in the C division.
NEISA INVITATIONAL AT MIT
The Crimson finished in seventh place close to home, racing Firefly and FJ vessels in a one day regatta on the Charles River in ideal sailing weather. Harvard sent two pairings of freshman skipper Nick Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz in the A division and junior skipper Bennett Capozzi and freshman crew Catherine Tang in the B division.
MIT captured the gold in its home Regatta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team has been infected with the injury bug this year. Having lost the services of junior Grace Weghorst for the year and freshman Christina Cornelius for the past two weekends, the team has had to rely on each player to step up and pick up their slack in order to grind through an arduous conference schedule.
Senior Kathleen Wallace has answered the call each and every weekend this fall, but none more impressive than last weekend’s road trip.
Wallace recorded two consecutive double-doubles this weekend, leading her team to an important victory against Cornell on Saturday after coming off of a loss to Columbia. Against the Lions, the San Francisco, Calif. native logged a season-high 19 kills and career-best 17 digs, and then answered with 18 kills and 14 kills against Cornell.
Wallace started off the season on a whole new level of play, recording her career first double- double against Rutgers on the first game of the season. Yet Wallace’s stellar senior season was almost cut short by an ankle injury in the preseason. Wallace hasn’t allowed her injury to slow her down, turning in double-digit kills in five out of seven conference games.
“She did all the recovery that she needed to do and just got it done,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “She knows that she is a really big asset to our team and that we really needed her. She just wanted to, through any means, get back on the court because it is her, our, last season and she knows how special that is.”
Wallace’s dedication and diligence was rewarded when she was able to play in the Ivy opener against Dartmouth. Stepping back in midseason just as the team was closing up nonconference play, Wallace has proven that she is vital to the Crimson’s success.
“She’s been really coming out, firing on all cylinders during Ivy League play,” said sophomore outside hitter Paige Kebe. “She’s really stepped up during crucial time when we need her, which is awesome to be able to rely on her as a teammate.”
Wallace’s biggest asset might be the consistency she brings to the court. She has been a key player for Harvard all four years, never having recorded less than two kills per set in a season in her career.
“She is really a rock that you can rely on, emotionally and physically,” Holte said. “I think the setters feel really confident pushing up balls to her in pressure filled situations. For Cornell the whole game was a pressure filled situation, but yet Wally remained steady.”
As a senior Wallace relies on a lead by example style to motivate her teammates and lead the team. Although not a captain nominally, she holds an important leadership position alongside co-captains Holte and Hannah Schmidt and fellow senior libero Sindhu Vegesena.
“The way I see myself as a leader is as someone who has strong court presence and by wanting to motivate my teammates through action,” said Wallace.
While Wallace is all business on the court, Wallace sheds her normal exterior and brings a fierceness and an aura to the court that energizes her teammates.
“In games she becomes just a fireball. It’s so cool to watch the transformation of Wally because she is such a kind soul off the court, but when it comes to game time she puts her game face on,” Holte said. “She is extremely competitive and extremely fun to play with because she pours every part of herself onto the court and just leaves it all on the court.”
Harvard looks to continue to lean on Wallace as the team tries to win a back-to-back Ivy League title.
“She knows that this her last season and she is playing with that kind of pressure,” Holte said. “I’m so proud of her and she is someone I look up to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team extended a streak and snapped another before finishing second at the Ivy League Championships this weekend.
The Crimson’s (9-8, 6-3 CWPA Northern) 14-12 victory over MIT (7-9, 3-6) on Friday was Harvard’s 10th straight over the Engineers, while the 12-6 win against No. 10 Princeton at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J., on Sunday was the squad’s first triumph over the Tigers since 2001.
In the Harvard program’s first-ever Ivy League Championship Sunday evening, the Crimson could not catch up to No. 10 Brown (15-3, 8-0), falling 13-8.
BROWN 13, HARVARD 8
The Crimson found itself playing from behind most of the game as Brown won its second Ivy League championship since the event began in 2010.
Juniors utility Jake Wyatt and center Luke Irwin supplied the goals for the Bears in a fast-paced opening frame, which saw several big saves and only two ejections.
Though Harvard, paced by junior co-captain and attacker Joey Colton’s three goals, stayed within striking distance during the second and third quarters, Brown maintained a slim lead.
“It was tough to play against Brown after the emotional game against Princeton,” Colton said. “Fatigue starts to play a factor when you play two teams as good as those back-to-back.”
The fatigue showed in the last quarter as the Crimson managed only one goal in eight minutes. Brown, on the other hand, added three tallies to pull away for a comfortable win. Junior Bears goaltender Luke Weiser finished the game with a career-high 20 saves.
“Brown’s a really good team,” Minnis said. “I was just happy for the seniors that they had a chance to play in the final of this tournament before they graduated.”
HARVARD 12, PRINCETON 6
Before Sunday, Harvard had lost to Princeton 15 times in a row. Whether the game was a hard-fought overtime affair or a lopsided blowout, the final result was always the same–a Tigers victory.
On Sunday, a 16th straight loss seemed on hand for the Crimson halfway through the latest meeting between the two sides. In the second quarter, Princeton had seized momentum by erasing an early deficit and holding Harvard scoreless.
Despite the opposition’s momentum and home advantage, Harvard came out with even more energy in the second half. Five different Crimson players found the back of the net in a flurry to gain a commanding 9-5 lead.
“The energy on our bench, the way the kids executed, was amazing,” Harvard head coach Ted Minnis said. “There was that special excitement of a championship run.”
Riding this wave of emotion, Harvard made sure there would be no comeback this year.
The team scored three more goals in the last quarter to finish the game on an 8-2 run.
Goaltender Colin Woolway stood out on defense, making several key stops to spark the rally. The senior finished the game with eight saves.
HARVARD 14, MIT 12
Before the Crimson had a chance to end their losing streak against Princeton, Harvard faced a spirited MIT team that was trying to improve its own record in a one-sided rivalry.
The Engineers were the stronger side for much of the game, and did not lose its lead until the fourth quarter, when the Crimson took the lead for good. The energy was palpable, with fans as much a part of the game as the players themselves.
“It’s a good challenge to play there,” Minnis said. “They’re always banging the pots and making it tough for our players to focus.”
The change in venue made for a different matchup than when the two teams met earlier this season at Blodgett Pool. That day, Harvard handily beat MIT, 15-9.
“The crowd definitely gives us a mental edge,” freshman MIT attacker Jeffrey Zhang said.
Senior team scoring leader Noah Harrison added to his total with four goals in the game. Freshman attacker Grayson Judge matched Harrison with four strikes of his own, doubling his previous single-game high.

With the winter quickly approaching, there's going to come a day where you accidentally miss the dining hall's closing hours, you're too cold to walk to the Square, but you're starving. What is a helpless college student to do in those situations? Flyby's here to help you out:
Vending machines are an untapped resource on campus; snacks range from organic peeled mango slices, to white cheddar popcorn, to Justin’s dark chocolate peanut butter cups. If you haven’t stopped by a machine recently, you’re missing some real gourmet treats. Some of the vending machines in freshman dorms even include underwear for the freshmen that still can’t figure out how to do their laundry. You might even say that Harvard’s vending machines have more options than the salad bar at Annenberg.
For all the cold, hungry students out there, Flyby has come up with a few balanced and wholesome options to soothe your appetite:
1) Vegan Bites: Buy yourself some Eat Smart Veggie Chips and humus, fresh and available in your local vending machine. Using a knife, spread humus over a veggie chip and place another one on top to make mini-sandwiches. This combination is not only delightful and creative, but also low calorie– perfect for those who are trying to avoid the dreaded freshman fifteen.
2) “Treat yo self” Trail-Mix: All you need is a Nature Valley Granola Bar, M&Ms, and Ruger Vanilla Wafers. First, crumble the Granola Bar by smacking it repeatedly against a hard surface (It’s true, this recipe has caused injuries before, but it’s to die for). Proceed to pour the crumbled granola bar into a bowl along with the M&Ms and the wafers and voila, you have magical goodness.
3) The Lamonster:  Lamont Cafe has one of the best vending machines on campus. Whether you are working hard or hardly working, make sure to try mixing the pomegranate Chobani yogurt and the Açai Berry Chia Bar #basic
Bon appetit and happy cooking!

Yes, everyone, it’s that time of year again. Cold weather is crashing down on Harvard’s campus, and no one is safe. Not your professor, not section kid, not even the cute crush in your class. As sore throats and runny noses ravage the historic halls of Harvard, Flyby is here to provide some tips so you can stay healthy enough to procrastinate before your next exam.
Hygiene
Soap is your best friend. And hand sanitizer is a good person to know too. Use these whenever the opportunity arises: Before grabbing a meal, after sipping your 5th cup of coffee from Greenhouse Café or grabbing your grill order. You can never be too careful.
Getting some rest
But actually, we’re serious about this point. If you don’t want to keep on sneezing and sniffling during your taped lecture, sleeping is one of your best bets of making sure that doesn’t happen. And you can always take a nap every now and then in a lot of places. Just make sure you are not caught.
Warm Clothing
You must get a lot of it, especially now. Even though having many layers can slow you down when you need to rush to your 9 am class, being warm and protected is still more important. Wear your winter wardrobe. Wear your whole winter wardrobe. However, you probably still have to wait for new Bean Boots to arrive at your door.
Eating Well
Making sure you have a balanced diet is essential to staying healthy. We’re not quite sure about the health benefits of Tomato Basil Ravioli, but it is probably one of the more delicious ways to stay full. Maybe you can get a hot cup of fresh ginger, honey, and lemon. Or even better, swai soup.
If all else fails and you do get sick, your best option is to take it easy. Take the shuttle from Lamont to Widener if it is better for you. Besides, maybe you can get an extension out of this too.
