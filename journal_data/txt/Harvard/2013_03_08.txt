After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I grew up as a child of exile, so I grew up navigating between two imaginary worlds,” said Richard Blanco, the inaugural poet for Barack Obama’s second term, in a lecture and discussion he gave on Wednesday at the Winthrop House Junior Common Room. “One was the 1950s and 1960s of my parents and my grandparents—the Cuba that they talked about in their stories, and the gossip, and their family lore.” Blanco himself never lived in Cuba, but grew up in a Cuban community in Miami. “I really believed that the America that I saw on TV really existed outside the boundaries of that realm. I really thought there was a place like ‘The Brady Bunch’ or ‘Leave It to Beaver.’”
Blanco, who is also a civil engineer, spoke this past January at the inauguration, during which he read his poem “One Today.” He was the first immigrant, first openly gay, and youngest inaugural poet in history. Through his Winthrop reading, entitled “Navigating Identities,” he explored his identity as a gay Cuban-American.
When Blanco speaks, it seems as if his poetry is meant to be performed—verses come to life and his voice sounds slowly and musically. “I certainly don’t do it on purpose, but it’s the internal music that you hear,” Blanco said. “It’s more like the linguistic patterns of speaking Spanish.” However, he said, he is not convinced the musical aspects of his poetry are derived entirely from speaking Spanish, and he believes that every poet has a sort of music—or lack thereof—to his or her writing.
Blanco began his talk by speaking about his first collection of poems, “City of a Hundred Fires” and discussing about his struggle for cultural identity as a Cuban American. “Somewhere in between [the worlds of Cuba and America] I had to navigate a sense of who I was and where I belonged, so a lot of my work speaks to that,” he said. “We [immigrants] really hold [America] to its ideals, and I think that, since it never met those ideals, we kind of feel, ‘Well, that’s not me.’”
Participating in the inaugural reading helped to change that for Blanco. “The happy ending here is that it was really during the inauguration...that I finally felt American,” he says. The most defining moment for Blanco was when President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. shook his hand. “I wasn’t expecting that, and it really was a sense of ushering me and saying...here’s your country,” he said. “And so I finally realized also that my story was an American story. I kind of never accepted that.”
He also spoke extensively on another aspect of his identity: being gay. “[It’s] one of the other things Obama made me famous for now,” he said. However, until his latest volume of poetry, “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” Blanco hadn’t written about his sexuality. “I felt like I didn’t have literarily or emotionally a story to tell that was unique,” he said. In “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” Blanco explores several intimate and humorous recollections of what he called his cultural sexuality. “I realized what was interesting me was that intersection between my culture and my sexual identity,” he said.
In its evocation of specific places and times, Blanco’s poetry is very concrete as well as musical, but it is also defined by its extreme intimacy. During his talk, he gave his first reading of a selection from his forthcoming prose work that focuses on his formative relationship with his grandmother. “‘Better to have a granddaughter who’s a whore than a grandson who’s a pato-faggot like you, understand?’ [my grandmother] says with scorn in her voice,” he read. Yet a tender sadness characterizes the piece, despite these moments of intense emotion and abuse—it’s painful, but not traumatizingly so. “I’m a man when she wakes up, opens her eyes wide for a moment, looks at me and squeezes my hand, then slips away quietly, silently, dying, without a word, and I let her go,” Blanco read.
Though his work and lecture addressed deep and affecting situations, Blanco’s writing has a sense of humor he retained in his delivery. Even in a poem that he said was written almost scathingly, the constant refrain of “I’ve seen you,” read in the voice of an eerily voyeuristic grandmother, roused consistent laughter from the audience. “Writing humor into poetry is very difficult; it’s a very difficult thing to pull off and still be heartwarming,” Blanco said. “But it’s also a cultural reflection. In some ways, you cannot be from a Cuban-American household and not have this tragic-comic sense to your life.”
Since the inauguration, Blanco has made numerous appearances on the local and national media circuits, but once the fervor dies down he hopes to make more appearances in schools than on the news. “There’s a disconnect in America with the arts and with poetry especially,” he said. “The cause that I take away from all this is [that] I want to get into middle schools and high schools, and I want to see about how we can create a new generation of poetry readers.”

The  Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Eurydice,” which opens  today at the Loeb Ex at 7:30 p.m., finds its roots in the classical  age, but is anything but ancient.  The play, written by Sarah Ruhl and  directed by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14, is meant to breathe new life into  the old tale. 
“It  takes something that everyone is familiar with and puts a twist on it.  It’s not what you expect,” Bersin says. “It’s kind of an American take  on this in a big way…. There’s something very ‘at home’ about this  version.”
This  play reinvigorates the classic myth of “Eurydice” with a reimagined  plotline and infuses it with themes that are relevant to a modern  audience. 
“A  huge theme in this play is moving on or lacking the ability to move  on,” says Bryan D. Kauder ’14, who plays Orpheus. “I think that  literally every character in this show struggles with that, even the  stones.”
Talking  stones are just one new and bold aspect of the universe in which  “Eurydice” takes place. The staging too is unusual; the entire play  takes place in two distinct realms, an overworld and an underworld, both  of which are visible on the stage. At times actors can be seen  performing in both worlds, with the actions of the overworld  occasionally spilling into the space below. 
Regardless  of audience expectations or reactions, Bersin maintains that “Eurydice”  strays from its mythical origin, merging the serious subjects of  identity and understanding with an atmosphere that invites the audience  to laugh. 
“It kind of speaks its own language,” says Bersin. “You come in here, and you’re going to come along for the ride.”

“There’s  a Disney ride,” one audience member deadpanned as the hot air balloon  holding the man destined to become the Wizard of Oz careened down a  precipitous and preposterously cerulean waterfall. And it’s  true—Disney’s “Oz the Great and Powerful” is every inch an advertisement  for the roller coasters, action figures, and perhaps even sequels that  will follow in its wake. But the film, directed by Sam Raimi, doesn’t  pretend for a moment that it is anything else. Irreverent yet lovingly  referential, and gorgeous to boot, “Oz” is a film that mirrors its  protagonist: manipulative, but more than capable of putting on a good  show.
 
“Oz”  is the latest in a spate of films—not to mention musicals and TV  shows—that gather their box office momentum by reimagining classic  tales. Like “Wicked,” it is a prequel to the storied “The Wizard of Oz,”  but where Gregory Maguire’s novel and the subsequent Broadway  blockbuster asked us to forget the Oz we thought we knew, this spinoff  encourages us to revel in it. The movie chronicles how a carnival  magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) becomes the Wizard of Oz.
 
The  film spends most of its 127 minutes winking at the audience. Its  favorite trick is to pull a cliché in for a bear hug even as it turns it  on its ear. The yellow brick road is there, all right, but one  character complains of yellow brick potholes. As the wizard is conveyed  via tornado to Oz, the bicycling neighbor in the original is replaced by  a floating caravan, which hurtles back at the wizard and punctures his  balloon. Oz and his comrades encounter a lion in the woods, but this  feline shows no signs of being cowardly or capable of speech. An  impression of homage flirting with parody is sustained throughout the  film. It’s a loving contrast that lends “Oz” vitality and encourages us  to forgive its plodding over well-trodden ground.
 
A  200-million-dollar major motion picture cannot be labeled camp (if this  is camp, it is the air-conditioned-cabins, day-trips-to-Six-Flags  variety)—a better descriptor for “Oz” may be ebulliently self-aware. The  dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, but everyone is in  on the joke—no one more so than the film’s star, Franco, whose Oscar  Diggs aspires to Houdini-Edison hybridity. As Glinda (Michelle Williams)  describes him, he is “selfish, slightly egotistical, and a fibber.”  Nevertheless, you root for the guy—or rather, you root for Franco. It is  clear from the outset that this is not the Franco of “Howl” or “127  Hours,” but the Franco of “General Hospital” and “Saturday Night Live.”  He hams it up as best he can, and as is often the case with Franco, his  best is pretty darn good. Williams and Mila Kunis, as Glinda and the  wicked witch Theodora, follow Franco’s lead, gamely trading shameless  doe eyes and face-contorting snarls as occasion requires. The trio is  spectacularly unafraid to overdo it, and they seem a ruby slipper’s  length away from breaking the fourth wall.
 
The  film’s charm is bolstered as much by 3D glasses as it is by  two-dimensional characters. Raimi’s Oz is beautifully overdone, all  bright colors and absurd architecture. Far from cheapening these  visuals, the three-dimensionality of “Oz” underpins the celebration of  artifice that pervades the film as a whole. This mood is further  reinforced by a jocular score from the ubiquitous Danny Elfman and a  delectable array of costumes designed by Gary Jones.
 
Elfman  and Jones might have lent a hand to screenwriter Mitchell Kapner in  keeping the film interesting. Perhaps unsurprisingly given its prequel  status, “Oz” is weakest when it comes to plot. The backstory that  explains the ascent to power of the witch Evanora and why the citizens  of Oz feel in need of a wizard is poorly fleshed out. And the poisoned  apple that triggers a female character’s descent into madness may read  as an uncomfortable biblical allusion.
 
But  these are trivial faults for a film that is intentionally ludicrous.  “Oz the Great and Powerful” will not collect any gold statuettes, but it  does not remotely expect to. Where previous films of this ilk, such as  Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” have fumbled by taking themselves  too seriously, “Oz” succeeds by reveling in its frivolity.

This article is meant to be a general tribute to Clarence Thomas, my favorite Supreme Court Justice.
In a hearing in mid-January, the Supreme Court considered the competency of the lawyers of the defendant. After hearing the lawyers had attended Harvard and Yale, Clarence Thomas was heard making a snide remark about the aptitude of Yale Law students. However, the stenographer at the court’s proceedings, recorded only “Well- he did not-” before laughter drowned out the rest of a surely wondrous insult. Oh, the possibilities of what this venerable Justice might have said. A few suggestions:
“attend Harvard.”
“get into Harvard.”
“know Harvard existed due to a horrible brain injury that forced him to attend Yale.”
According to the New York Times, experts on the Supreme Court say it has been more than 40 years since a justice remained silent during oral arguments for an entire term, much less seven years. Clearly, Justice Thomas felt his insult warranted this historic occasion.
The brilliant Clarence Thomas was, in fact, a Yale graduate. He was the very best kind of Yale student—the kind that proudly displays his “Yale Sucks” bumper sticker on the mantle of his chambers because he knew it firsthand. According to his memoir, the Justice “peeled a 15-cent price sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of [his] law degree to remind [himself] of the mistake [he’d] made by going to Yale.”
Yet announcing the truth about Yale is not Justice Thomas’s only proud achievement. As a young man, Clarence Thomas had troubles with English, having spoken the African-English creole, Gullah, as a first language. So what does little Clarence Thomas do but major in English and graduate cum laude from Holy Cross University. Then in 1966 he registered for the Vietnam War draft. Yet he was rejected due to curvature of the spine. His show of backbone was not enough to straighten it.
Justice Thomas has not always been so reserved however. In fact, it was his alleged loquaciousness that got him into the biggest scandal of his career. After Thomas had been confirmed to the Supreme Court, hearings were reopened when testimony from a former coworker claimed that Thomas had sexually harassed her 10 years prior.  Yet the charges were hard to prove. The testimony was only hearsay and all those who testified had left the firm on poor terms. Ultimately, the case was dismissed and the culprit who put his or her pubic hair on Thomas’s can of Coke was never brought to justice.
Perhaps this explains the Justice’s reticence now. Thomas justifies his notorious reservation on the grounds that “the media often has its own script." Indeed, during his initial years as Supreme Court Justice, many media pundits derisively called him Antonin Scalia’s understudy. However, upon closer examination, it would appear that Scalia often changed his view to align with Thomas rather than, as most believed, the other way around.
The Justice may take a consistently originalist approach to the constitution, but his relationships are anything but partisan… and all but adorable. The Justice is particularly close to Stephen G. Breyer, who happens to be diametrically opposed to Thomas ideologically. Yet the two are often seen in court whispering, trading quips, and passing notes. They are like the Supreme Court version of a 1980’s teen Rom-Com. When Breyer really hits it home, Thomas is heard releasing “The Laugh,” as his rolling baritone laughter is known to Supreme Court insiders.
To take a moment to point out Thomas’ weaknesses, however, his Achilles’ heel is probably his Achilles’ heel. In 1993, Thomas tore his Achilles tendon playing at a pickup game in the Supreme Court’s basketball court, commonly known as “the highest court in the land.”
I write this homage to my favorite Justice because it is important to remember what makes The Nine representative of the population. Try as you might, nine coveted and highly powerful positions will never accurately reflect the demographics of American race, creed, and gender. In fact, the justices are strikingly unrepresentative of American demographics. For all his quips about Yale, Clarence Thomas and the rest of the justices all are Harvard or Yale graduates who reside in the upper percentiles of intelligence. With six Catholics and three Jews, not a single Justice is Protestant, though Protestants make up half the country. What makes them “representative” of the population is what makes them human. What makes them human is also what makes them likeable. That’s why we should take a moment to learn what makes judges human after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was recently on a panel of Harvard students at a conference when a high school student asked, “Are you ashamed that Bill O’Reilly graduated from Harvard?”
As someone who arrived at Harvard as a Tea Party supporter and subsequently moderated, I recognized the questioner as the kind of arrogant liberal that is unfortunately common on campus and who contributes to Harvard’s rocky relationship with conservatives.
Last week’s Crimson staff editorial entitled “Warning: Do Not Enroll” was just the latest flare-up, outraging conservatives across the nation who understood its message to be that they are not welcome at Harvard.
Thankfully, that was not its intended message. The editorial was a (failed) tongue-in-cheek condemnation of politicians who disingenuously attack Harvard for political gain. Its wording and tone certainly left it vulnerable to misinterpretation, but its core idea is difficult to deny.
I sadly can’t read minds, but it’s difficult to believe that Senator Ted Cruz is being honest when claiming that Harvard Law was packed with commies that no one else seems to remember. Or that Mitt Romney, who spent four years at Harvard to Obama’s three, was being honest when he criticized President Obama for spending too much time at Harvard.
Chances are Cruz and Romney, like most politicians, are practicing the ancient art of pandering. Ridiculing egghead liberals at elite universities plays well with the Republican base.
Pandering has a price, though. Like Democratic pandering on entitlements, the actions of Romney and Cruz perpetuate America’s political dysfunction. Harvard bashing is only one manifestation of many conservatives’ disdain for the liberal coastal elite. This disdain’s most harmful effect is that some conservatives now automatically dismiss research that contradicts their worldview as trash promoted by liberal hacks, rather than critically engage with it.
Perfunctory disclaimer: There are clearly liberal equivalents to these conservatives.
The reason the two parties seem to be on different planets is that, more or less, they are. They believe the world works in fundamentally different ways. Science offers the possibility of at least partially merging those worldviews, laying the foundation for compromise. Refusing to integrate new factual evidence into your worldview because you vote differently than the responsible researcher is indefensible and makes compromise even harder.
Yet conservatives are absolutely correct that Harvard mistreats them. It’s no secret that many Harvard liberals, especially younger ones, are intolerant of opposing viewpoints. Conservatives at Harvard constantly endure insinuations that they are unfeeling, selfish, bigoted, or dumb for disagreeing with mainstream campus views. Whether it’s prominent professors making fun of Republicans in lecture, Right to Life posters being torn down, or a campus-wide character assassination of a conservative student columnist, the message to conservatives is clear: you are not welcome.
This liberal illiberality is tragic. Too many students here waste a unique opportunity to learn from equally intelligent other young people who think differently than they do. On a campus that prizes diversity, diversity of thought is largely squandered.
I knew that I would be in the ideological minority at Harvard when I arrived, but I didn’t realize that many liberal students would deny my opinions even basic respect. Rather than justify their assumptions to me when pressed, many liberals would simply shut down the discussion by labeling my opinions racist, sexist, homophobic, or “problematic” (a catch-all word used by my least favorite kind of liberal to dismiss anything that threatens his or her belief system). I started hearing “I’m not even going to argue this” more from my peers than my parents. Some plainly said they couldn’t be friends with someone who disagreed with them on politics.
The more thoughtful liberals at Harvard, the ones that have so enriched my experience, understand that having smart conservatives on campus to challenge liberal orthodoxy and groupthink is fundamental to healthy liberalism. Stereotyping all people who disagree with you as uncritical only makes you yourself uncritical. A belief system is worth nothing if it hasn’t withstood scrutiny.
Conservatives are rare here: only 13 percent of the class of 2012 leaned towards Romney. It would be dangerous for that number to drop further. Harvard liberals need to start making conservatives feel welcome before they stop enrolling entirely.
So liberals: Engage. Debate empirics. Explain assumptions you’ve never had to explain before, even if they seem obvious. They are not obvious to everyone. Most of all, treat conservatives with respect and give them the benefit of the doubt. Like you, most of them are not terrible or stupid people. They just disagree with you.
I told the questioner at the conference that no, I am not ashamed that Bill O’Reilly went to Harvard despite my political disagreements with him. Of course there are times I think he’s being illogical or pandering himself, but mostly I think he is an intelligent man who cares about people just as I do. He simply understands the world to work differently and consequently believes different policies will best help society. May that more Harvard liberals realize the same of their conservative classmates.

Let me start off with a disclaimer: I’m a feminist, so I don’t actually have a sense of humor. Feminists aren’t allowed to have a sense of humor, because we’re too busy being angry and not shaving ourselves. Furthermore, we also hate free speech because we’re Maoists.
But really—this is the sort of response I usually get when I try to bring up some of the problems I have with objectifying jokes: I need to lighten up, I need to get a sense of humor, I need to stop trying to “restrict free speech.” The issue with these claims is that nothing is objectively funny; certain things can really only be funny to people who have certain kinds of privilege.
Take women’s bodies, for instance. Using women’s bodies as punch lines and disparaging feminists, women’s labor, and violence against women for laughs is nothing new. Women are made to listen to these sorts of jokes all the time, expected to laugh, and forced to acculturate themselves to a point where they learn to swallow any uneasiness and force a smile. And if they complain, they are told to “lighten up.” But this is very hard, because there’s a huge, heavy problem with objectifying women for laughs: Cultural acceptance of such objectification has concrete outcomes. Violence against women happens every single day, all around the world, and these sorts of jokes, this type of “humor,” normalize a way of regarding women and their bodies that is simply dangerous.
This is one of the many reasons that I found Seth MacFarlane’s hosting of the Oscars to be unbearable. His jokes about women rested entirely on disparaging female bodies, made light of domestic violence, and contributed to larger, harmful social trends. In this context, suddenly it seems like much less of a coincidence that MacFarlane was happy to use a situation of domestic violence (Rihanna and Chris Brown’s relationship) as a punch line, and that in his opening number, three of the scenes he mentions in which he saw an actress’s “boobs” were either rape scenes or scenes that occurred directly after a rape.
But it’s ironic! So it’s fine, right? No, actually, because I guarantee you that every single woman in that room has been harassed on the street, has had her body commented on time and time again in ways that made her uncomfortable and unhappy, and that about a fifth of the women in the room have also probably been sexually assaulted. So when someone makes jokes like this, not only is it old, and tired, and puerile, and uninteresting, but it’s also deeply offensive. And when William Shatner comes on the screen and essentially asks us to laugh at the fact that these jokes make women uncomfortable and unhappy, we are forced to ask: To whom can this actually be funny? Who is genuinely able to find women’s discomfort at being objectified to be a funny thing, in and of itself? Certainly not anyone who has experienced this discomfort or who has learned to view objectification as a source of physical danger in their lives.
MacFarlane’s sexualized joke about 9-year old Quvenzhané Wallis emphasized something slightly different: the fact that there is no escape from this sort of treatment for women. It has always been implied—by culture, society, or another one of those amorphous non-identities that force us to write in the passive voice—that all a woman needs to do to avoid disparaging comments is stay chaste; that being called a whore results from misconduct on her part; that “good women” don’t get talked about like that. But just look at this little girl and the joke that was made at her expense. It was a dismissal of her talent, of all her hard work, in order to emphasize her gender, her body—a dismissal but also a terrifyingly accurate indication of the sort of treatment she can expect to receive for the rest of her life. So what do we learn from this? We are reminded that our children are taught to take these things with a smile at an early age. We are reminded that girls are sexualized from the time they are born. We are reminded that as a female person you will never be seen as neutral.
So yes, Oscar night 2013 was not really a great night for women’s self-esteem, but whoop-de-doo, you say. It’s over. Let bygones be bygones. And also I’m just overreacting, because I’m a feminist, remember?
But it wasn’t a one-time thing. It was just a very public example of situations that arise every single day in our country because of the cultural sense that really anything is fair game for a joke. Jokes aren’t serious! And, of course, it’s only reasonable to be offended by serious things. So it becomes impossible to object, and the rape jokes continue, and the objectification of women continues, and these things become normalized as lighthearted topics. And then violence against women happens. And then we resolutely refuse to acknowledge that these things are all interconnected in a larger, socially reinforced rape culture. And it continues. And continues. Conclusion? I’m not laughing, and I’m not sorry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard students returned to their dorms Sunday to find eviction notices taped to their doors.  No, the College had not decided to move ahead with its House renovations early.  Rather, the Palestine Solidary Committee posted the fliers to publicize Israeli Apartheid Week, an international campaign designed to raise awareness about harmful Israeli policies toward Palestinians in the occupied territories and to advocate for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. While the human rights abuses that the PSC highlights demand recognition and rectification, Israeli Apartheid Week—in its international and local iterations—discourages civil discourse, leaving little hope that the event might promote a dialogue contributing to peace or reconciliation.
The PSC is not alone in criticizing Israeli practices in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  In January, a United Nations panel presented a report declaring that Israel’s transferring its citizens to settlements in Palestine violated the Geneva Conventions.  The report noted that the Israeli government maintains a “system of total segregation” in the territories, where native Israelis reap the benefits of preferential legal status while Palestinians find themselves barred from accessing basic resources such as water, education, and housing.  Days before the report’s publication, Israel became the first country ever to boycott a U.N. Human Rights Council review, and the Israeli government refused to recognize the report as legitimate after its filing.
Israel must come to the table on the question of the occupied territories. Unfortunately, Israeli Apartheid Week in its current form prevents exactly this type of conversation.  The campaign spreads its message through methods that are combative rather than constructive, alienating Zionist members of both the international community and the Harvard student body. Any productive dialogue on the topic of Israel-Palestine must include Zionists as well as pro-Palestinian advocates.
Papering dorms with eviction notices, erecting a wall reminiscent of the separation barrier along and within the West Bank, and referring to the whole event using a word as fraught with painful history as “apartheid” may provoke thought for students who have not yet come to hardened positions on the conflict in the Middle East. But these acts seem even more likely to cause a knee-jerk, negative reaction among groups who necessarily make up an essential element of any peace process. Pro-Israel groups, for example, will likely feel reluctant to parley with an organization that compares Israel to the racist, universally condemned Afrikaner regime of 20th-century South Africa. Although it is clearly the point of Israel Apartheid Week to make this very comparison, it is nevertheless an analogy that ignores crucial complexities in Israel-Palestine.
Moreover, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement promoted by Israeli Apartheid Week states on its website that the existence of the state of Israel constitutes “Jewish colonization,” a conclusion that can only be reached, at best, through a gross mischaracterization of Jewish and Israeli history. Such rhetoric not only reflects a misguided reading of history, but it is also directly counter to the cause of peace and mutual understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, which can only be achieved if each nation affirms the legitimacy of the other.
In its mission statement, Harvard College urges its students “to respect ideas and their free expression, and to rejoice in discovery and critical thought.”  The case of Israel and Palestine, in which elements on both sides have consistently proven intransigent in their unwillingness to recognize each other’s right to exist as a state, exemplifies the need for such open, respectful discourse among participants with differing viewpoints. Israeli Apartheid Week, unfortunately, does not pave the way for this sort of constructive dialogue and cannot be called a constructive step on the road to peace in the Middle East.

This is the sixth instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinions on thought-provoking issues.
If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic "What was Hugo Chavez’s most significant contribution?" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, March 6th at 11pm.
It’s Our Fault
Frankly, I was not exactly surprised to discover that about half of my classmates in the now infamous Government 1310 were being accused of violating the College’s policies on academic integrity. Although I sincerely sympathize with those individuals who were falsely accused, I do not think that the University is entirely at fault here.
To directly answer the question, no, Harvard does not place enough value on education. Although institutional change at the top maybe necessary, I would argue that the root of the problem truly lies with the student body itself. The scandal in Government 1310 last spring is not the first time a widespread cheating has occurred on campus, nor will it be the last. This problem is not caused by the Harvard faculty’s supposed apathy for undergraduate education, nor it is only a matter of institutional flaws within the system. Quite bluntly, the answer is human nature.
Unfortunately for many students, academics is simply not regarded as a worthy pursuit or a high priority and, as a result, students will choose to spend less time finishing their problem sets and completing their readings to make gains in the other areas in their life. Of course, those who are passionate about their field of study can invest most of their time in their academic pursuits; the problem is that many students do not. The vast majority of college students, not only those at Harvard, want to have everything: leadership positions, good grades, a prestigious internship, a vibrant social life, etc. without having to make the necessary personal sacrifices to reach those goals. Instead, some may turn to cutting corners and “collaborating” with others to finish their work on time, for as long as they get the grade they want, nothing else matters.
Yes, the university should attempt to evaluate not only faculty members’ contribution to academia, but also how well they perform in the classroom. Nevertheless, there is nothing the university can to do to help students from acting in their self-interest.

Opportunities Outside Academics Prove Fruitful
As a graduating senior concentrating in Government with a secondary in Economics, I have enrolled in classes that have run the gamut from academically intense to those considered “joke” courses. I confess that I am guilty of having enrolled in several courses not out of rapt interest in the topic, but in an effort to balance out the substantial workload of extracurricular activities. Although, in my experience, Harvard has not placed enough value on academics, it is only because the University offers experiences that go far beyond the classroom.
From connections to internships across the globe, to opportunities to manage and run conferences for thousands of attendees, Harvard’s vast resources for its students serve as much value as its classes in educating the next generation of working adults. Undoubtedly, the academic reputation of Harvard contributes to the existence of these opportunities. However, having a schedule comprised entirely of academically rigorous classes would limit the ability of many students to take full advantage of Harvard’s extracurricular learning opportunities. We are students, but our role is not only to study—but it is also to learn, and Harvard offers extraordinary resources outside of academics to do so.

A Necessary Balancing Act
Whether Harvard places enough value on academics is an irrelevant question that neglects to address exactly how Harvard students and professors navigate their commitments on campus.
Now, the real issue here is a question of balance. Both students and professors maintain a fragile balance between two primary activities. Students divide their time between academic coursework and extracurricular engagements, which include jobs, internships, and fellowship hunting. Professors divide their time between teaching and research.
The primary complaint implied by the supposed fall of academics at Harvard is thus twofold: First, students do not pay enough attention to their academic coursework, instead overcommitting to extracurricular engagements, including pre-professional concerns. Second, professors do not pay enough attention to their teaching, instead overcommitting to their respective research agendas.
Reality check: It is impossible for anyone to dictate exactly how anyone else should spend his time. It is also almost impossible to produce the kind of cultural change beckoned by this ongoing lament for the fall of academics. And not just that—it is absolutely necessary that students and professors sustain this double life of competing professional and personal interests.
Among the primary benefits and salvations of studying at a research university is that you do not simply take a class with a professor who knows a lot about something and can teach it to you. You’re taking a class with someone who is also actively shaping and driving the future of that field. We cannot simply ask that professors teach more and research less, since it is their research commitments that make Harvard the academic powerhouse that it is.
And more—what makes Harvard’s undergraduate culture so intense and chaotic is that we must uphold our own double lives: taking classes and leading organizations, producing plays, founding start-ups, and the rest. Harvard is boot camp, and it is boot camp precisely because we, for whatever reason, require ourselves to do everything and be everywhere at the same time. Of course, some will devote their lives to schoolwork (especially those for whom this work is actually pre-professional). Others would not take any assignment seriously if it meant more time to work on their pet projects. To each his own: If anything, Harvard’s undergraduate and professional culture appears to be encapsulated by this attitude.

Where Has All the Academics Gone?
Academic rigor, as of late, seems to be sliding downwards at Harvard. Many students who emerge from this institution cannot confidently name themselves as “scholars” and “academics,” but as “pre-professionals,” despite all the rhetoric of the liberal arts curriculum. Our conversations tend to be less deep and academically focused than they might be—perhaps this is a reaction to the stresses of a busy undergraduate career packed with extracurricular activities. Therein may lie another problem. In my experience, debates over politics, philosophy, and intellectual issues appear to be on a downward trend and students are no longer focused solely on academics, choosing to also split their energies on sports, organizations, and other activities.
Harvard, as of late, is doing little to stymie this decline in intellectual curiosity, using grade inflation to boost contentment with minimal levels of effort in the classroom. Although it is true that time spent in classes and on coursework varies differently among our many concentrations, in general, it seems like students are spending less time in libraries, looking up supplementary resources, and engaging in academic dialogue. This is, of course, not to say we have lost all respect for academics, but that the culture at Harvard has shifted quite markedly from where its focus should be: academics.
We have over 400 official student organizations and each student boasts a leadership position of sorts, using these titles to pad resumes for life after college. But Harvard should stress that students should continue their love of learning and that there is no shame in the pursuit of garnering arcane knowledge and obscure facts. Although it is true that the world is changing and becoming more competitive and that extracurricular activities do provide outlets for application of academia and networking opportunities, Harvard should move towards again standing, first and foremost, firmly and proudly behind academia.

“Learning for Learning’s Sake” Is the Privilege of the Few
Society tells us that education is an investment in our future. And not just ours—after all, “human capital” increases growth for the economy as a whole. Like any investor, we students, and our parents, expect a return. The majority of students here, for whom entering the middle class or at least remaining in it is not a guarantee bequeathed to them, naturally expect those returns to be denominated in dollars. Truly, as long as we as a society view education as an economic good or a commodity, only those who have enough other commodities to begin with will rationally use their education for something as, unfortunately, economically worthless as “learning for learning’s sake.”
Although Harvard’s financial aid program has succeeded in allowing students of nearly all socioeconomic backgrounds to attend this university, we cannot pretend that the demands on all these students once they get here are the same. Some have to work two, three jobs just to pay for such luxuries as cell phone service or detergent, not to mention a meal in the square once in a while. Even those students whose families can afford to pay for these basics are expected to graduate with an income to support not only themselves but eventually their families, who are often breaking the bank to send them here. “Academics,” as distinguished from merely getting good grades, good recommendations, and other resume-padding accomplishments, can only ever be the top priority for students insulated from these economic pressures. And that is very few of us.
As if these individual circumstances were not enough to force us to make education a means, not an end, society too promotes the narrative of education as economic necessity. President Obama frequently touts the economic importance of higher education in the globalized economy, where “skills” earn a growing premium. Politicians like Governor Rick Scott of Florida propose giving more financial aid to students in science, math, engineering, and technology fields—providing an economic incentive to study what will earn you more money and better the economy regardless of your academic interests. The common scorn against “useless” liberal arts degrees reflects a larger social value: Education should be directed toward immediate, monetary benefits, not such worthless tasks as, say, thinking critically about the world in which we live. Academics, not just in the humanities but all theoretical fields, are by definition distinct from the pragmatic, not tied down by the material here and now. Academics are transcendent.
Students attend college, Harvard especially, to gain access to the material world, to get at least a modest return on their significant monetary investment. Professors are here to help us do that—just look at grade inflation, which makes us more likely to get jobs and them more likely to keep theirs. And Harvard cannot hate the reputation, not to mention the donations, that comes with producing the most billionaires of any school in the world.
No, Harvard does not place enough value on academics. The students do not, the professors do not, and the administration does not. Why would they?

When Laura E. Donohue ’85 found out that the paper supplier Crane and Company was discontinuing the type of paper used by many students to print their theses, she knew she had to make a phone call.
“I actually called Crane’s and got as [much] as I possibly could out of their warehouse,” said Donohue, owner of Bob Slate Stationer, a business on Brattle Street that sells thesis paper and binders. Bob Slate has already gone through 20 or 30 reams, as well 100 packs of the discontinued Crane paper. A ream contains 500 sheets of paper, and a pack, 100. Only a week into March, there’s just one ream left.
As honors thesis deadlines come and go throughout March, businesses around Harvard Square are preparing for the inevitable spike in paper, binder, and printing requests that come as students complete the final stage of the taxing process.
Gnomon Copy, a printing and copying business on Mass. Ave., has in the past few weeks alone had about 60 student requests for thesis printing or binding, owner Michael Skikne estimated, a figure he said is consistent with years past. Skikne said he expects that number to  increase in the next week as spring break and thesis deadlines approach.
According to Donohue, Bob Slate has had about 100 students come in to buy acid-free paper or custom-made binders thus far.
Students have several options for where to print or bind their theses, from stores in the Square to the printing rooms in the Houses. Jeanne A. Follansbee, director of studies for the history and literature department, said her department does not make any official recommendations for where students choose to print their theses.
On Feb. 28, history and literature concentrator Erin M. Fahy ’13 went with a friend to Gnomon Copy to print her thesis the night before it was due.
Skikne said printing a thesis at Gnomon can cost anywhere from $10 to $100, depending on the type of paper used and whether or not it is printed in color. Fahy said hers cost about $23, and she said she was satisfied with the service.
Fahy said she chose to have professionals print her thesis rather than opt for the House printing room “more for the peace of mind to have someone else [print] it.”
Daniel M. Claridge ’13, an inactive Crimson video editor and an English concentrator, opted to print his creative writing thesis, a 90-page screenplay, in Lowell House on acid-free paper purchased from Bob Slate. Unlike many thesis writers, he did not have to purchase a binder because the English department provided one for him, he said.
While many deadlines are still looming, those who have already pressed print said they are ready to enjoy post-thesis life.
“It’s really nice to be done, and I’m glad hist. and lit. had an early due date,” Fahy said.

On Monday evening, students gathered in Hemenway Gymnasium, brightly colored yoga mats and chilled water bottles in tow. They quickly began to stretch, hoping to alleviate the day’s stress.
With all but one upperclassman House offering free yoga sessions this semester, students have latched on to the opportunity to stretch and rejuvenate in a relaxing environment as a complement to their hectic lifestyles.
“After the stresses of school, basketball practice, and homework, it’s really nice to be able to relax with some yoga,” said Katherine A. Metoyer ’16, a self-proclaimed yoga enthusiast. “It’s even nicer when you don’t have to go out of your way to find a time that fits your schedule because they’re offered so often.”
These yoga classes, taught by House tutors as well as trained yoga professionals, are open to any Harvard students regardless of their House affiliation.
“You’re welcome to join any of them—to go to another house if you can’t make Eliot’s sessions, or to go to every class and become, free of charge, an avid yogi,” Brandon R. Tilley, Eliot’s house wellness tutor, wrote in an email over the House list.
In the email, Tilley also encouraged everyone, including those who are more experienced and those who have never done yoga before, to participate.
“Classes are especially apt for beginners and experts: [The instructor will] gently teach you the fundamentals, and can help even the most experienced among us to fine tune,” Tilley wrote in the email.
Lucy V. Burke ’16 said she has been especially impressed with the yoga instructors on campus.
“There was one time I got stuck in a very uncomfortable position, and they eased me out of it with great prowess,” she said.
Kirin Gupta ’16 said that she believes this rising popularity of yoga at Harvard is a result of “contortionism being sexy.”
“Think about the sheer sex appeal of putting your legs behind your head,” Gupta said.
In addition to these classes at upperclassmen Houses, Harvard also offers yoga classes in Allston. The Center for Wellness has partnered with the Harvard Allston Education Portal to co-sponsor an eight-week yoga class series this semester.
According to the Harvard Allston Education Portal’s website, “Yoga provides a unique opportunity to build strength and energize, while cultivating flexibility and balance, and relaxing and quieting the mind.”
However, Hanna Evensen ’16 said she sees another dimension of yoga’s benefit.
“Everybody just wants to bend into a flexible pretzel,” she said.

As the numbers of practicing primary care physicians dwindle across the nation, new initiatives at Harvard to draw attention to the field of primary care are gaining momentum.
Only 32 percent of students nationwide plan to enter primary care, while the remaining 68 percent are hoping to specialize in a particular field, according to survey results recently released by Kaplan Test Prep. Although the financial incentives are great—according to a 2012 survey by the Medical Group Management Association, specialty physicians on average make $150,000 more a year than their primary care counterparts—most students in the survey who claimed an interest in specialty work cited “academic interests” as their primary motivation. Only 2 percent attributed their goals to the financial incentives, according to the Kaplan survey.
But many disagree that primary care is less intellectually stimulating than specialization.
In response to the survey data, Tarina Quraishi ’14, a pre-med student and former secretary of the Harvard Pre-Medical Society, remarked that primary care can be just as academically stimulating as a specialization, if not more so. Quraishi said she plans to pursue a career in primary care herself.
“An interdisciplinary approach can come into play [with primary care,]” Quraishi said. “You don’t necessarily get to do in a specialty.”
Oona B. Ceder ’90, director of premedical and health career advising at Harvard’s Office of Career Services, echoed the sentiment, describing primary care as “very intellectually stimulating and valuable.”
She also described her office’s recent collaborations with Harvard Medical School’s newly created Center for Primary Care. Last spring, the partnership sponsored a panel discussion, “The Hows and Whys of Primary Care,” and is currently planning similar events.
The Center for Primary Care is also implementing initiatives to expose medical students to the field of primary care. One such effort that the center participated in is the Crimson Care Collaborative, which has developed and implemented five community health practices in the surrounding neighborhoods of Boston staffed by Medical School students and faculty.
Albert C. Yeh ’07, a Harvard Medical School student who has been involved in the Crimson Care Collaborative for the past few years, described the program as a great experience.
Still, like many in his position, Yeh said he is not currently considering primary care seriously. Instead, he said he planned to pursue a longtime interest in oncology.
Overall, the popularity of primary care is increasing slowly but steadily, according to Ceder.
“We are seeing what appears to be a growing interest in primary care and community healthcare amongst Harvard College students and also among students at Harvard Medical School,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University officials promoted existing mental health resources, clarified policies, and listened to student concerns in response to demands for an open dialogue on mental health at a panel discussion Thursday night.
The Undergraduate Council-sponsored event, which attracted more than 60 students and other Harvard affiliates, opened with questions seeking clarification on students’ rights within the mental health system.
Chief of Student Mental Health Services Katherine A. Lapierre assured students that records are confidential and only released to Resident Deans with a student’s written permission, except in cases of hospitalization. She further emphasized that despite rumors, students are never forced to take time off.
“We don’t involuntarily put people on leave,” she insisted. “There is no such thing as a ‘medical leave’ when people go on a leave of absence.”
Associate Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger added that it would be illegal for the University to remove a student from campus for mental health reasons.
Lapierre said that although students returning from leaves are required to answer questions related to wellness, the intent is to ensure that students are able to handle the academic load.
During the open question session, one student relayed her friends’ personal experiences with Ad Board pressure.
She questioned whether students feel that they have a choice when Harvard gives a “strong recommendation” to take time off.
Other students offered their own suggestions for improving mental health care, including requiring all students to complete mandatory mental health check ups, creating a health class requirement for sophomores, and assigning all students to primary mental health physicians.
Lapierre said University Health Services looks for ways to improve its offerings and referenced several recent changes, including the hiring of new full-time access coordinators who schedule initial appointments, the doubling of outside appointments available to students on the Harvard health plan from 12 to 24 per academic year, and the hiring of additional full-time psychiatrists.
Thursday’s panel comes just over one week after a schizophrenic student’s anonymous Crimson op-ed accused the University of failing to provide adequate financial support for students facing emergency mental health expenses.
Sally C. Donahue, director of financial aid, told the crowd that her office encourages students facing unexpected medical expenses to drop in. She highlighted the Beneficiary Aid Program, which last year granted a total of $70,000 to more than 400 students facing unexpected costs.
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who endorsed last week’s rally for mental health, said she felt “overwhelmed” by the level of conversation at Thursday’s panel.
“I’m amazed at the turnout,” she said. “We’re going to find a way to continue this dialogue in an inclusive way. Students should be able to talk about this issue on campus and get answers.”

In a decision handed down Feb. 27, a federal appeals court held up a prior decision that a group of terrorism victims who won a judgment against Iran will not be allowed to claim Iranian artifacts in Harvard’s art museums as compensation for damages owed to them.
According to the verdict, the plaintiffs won a default judgment in 2003, awarding them $71.5 million in monetary compensation from the government of Iran due to its involvement in a 1997 bombing in Jerusalem. When the Iranian government refused to pay damages to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs instead attempted to lay claim to the artifacts in question, which include a large array of ancient Persian antiquities in the Harvard Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
The plaintiffs originally lost the suit in 2011 when a federal district court judge ruled that the artifacts could not be taken from Harvard as compensation.
The Crimson contacted lawyers representing Harvard and Peabody Museum administrators with knowledge of the suit, all of whom either declined to or were unavailable to comment on the story.
According to the verdict, the plaintiffs have sought the artifacts on the basis that they could be considered property of Iran due to their origins, enabling them to use the assets to satisfy their claims against the Iranian government.
In the 2011 verdict, Federal Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. wrote that “the plaintiffs simply are unable to establish that any item in the possession of the Museums, whether from Persepolis or elsewhere, is rightly considered to be the property of Iran.”
The decision published last week confirmed this ruling. “While we are mindful of the incident that gave rise to the judgment,” the panel of three federal appeals court judges wrote, “the general rule is that foreign sovereign property in the United States is immune from attachment and execution.”
The disputes over ownership largely centered on interpretation of a 1930 Iranian law regarding the excavation of antiquities within the country’s borders. According to an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Harvard asserted that the law did not automatically give the Iranian government ownership over excavated items, that the law was unenforceable outside of Iran, and that many of the artifacts were excavated before 1930.
Last week’s ruling denying the plaintiffs ownership of the artifacts upheld a 2011 ruling by a lower court that enabled the University of Chicago to retain possession of its share of the artifacts in question.
According to the Chronicle, had the rulings gone the other way, a precedent may have been set in American foreign policy allowing outside entities to seize foreign exhibitions on loan to American museums. This could have made foreign countries more reluctant to share exhibitions abroad.

A student and alumni activist group criticized Harvard this week for its investment in an index fund that is a major shareholder of firearm manufacturer Smith & Wesson.
The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition pointed out the connection in an emailed press release on Tuesday. Although not included in the press release, a second major firearm manufacturer—Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc.—is also linked to Harvard through the same index fund.
Harvard’s connection to these gunmakers is distant.
The Harvard Management Company’s most recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate no direct holdings in arms manufacturers, but rather an investment in a massive portfolio of companies that represent countless industries in the American economy, including gun manufacturing. HMC manages the University’s $30 billion endowment.
In these filings, HMC reported that it has nearly $3 million invested in the iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund—a portfolio of 2,000 American companies. According to financial magazine Barron’s, the Russell 2000 Index Fund is considered to be representative of changes in the broader American economy.
Harvard’s investment in the index fund drew attention from Responsible Investment at Harvard because the Russell 2000 is a major shareholder in Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc., which are two of the country’s top gun manufacturers.
“I think the key takeaway here is that Harvard’s money...is going to support the manufacture and production of assault weapons,” said Nicole E. Granath ’15, co-director of Responsible Investment at Harvard. She added that even though the investment is indirect, any amount of money going to gunmakers is symbolic of support for the industry.
Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin said that while the University does not comment on specific holdings, HMC’s strategy includes both internally and externally managed investments including exchange funds that “track broad swaths of the markets.”
The press release alluded to a national debate over gun control policies that has been galvanized in recent months by mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn.
“Given the tragedy in Newton and the fatal shooting on campus four years ago, Harvard’s failure to address these holdings is shocking,” said Kevin S. Wang ’16 in the press release. Wang is Responsible Investment at Harvard’s investments coordinator. “Stopping gun violence should be a critical concern for the University, and severing financial ties with these companies is a good first step,” he said.
Responsible Investment at Harvard’s press release added that the $244 billion pension fund for California government employees divested from index funds connected to Smith & Wesson after the Newtown shooting. Several other major public pension funds across the country have done the same.
Granath said her group’s discovery points to what she believes is a larger problem at Harvard—the lack of a clear, consistent policy toward weighing social concerns when making investment decisions.
“Ultimately we’d love for that process to be a little more open, to have Harvard make a clear statement on what its position is when we get to sticky social issues,” she said.
She said HMC has occasionally, but not consistently, adjusted investment strategy due to social concerns, such as when it divested from tobacco companies in 1990.
To rectify what she described as a “spotty” track record, she said that HMC should issue a policy statement regarding the social impact of investments, along with an explanation of the actions it would take if its holdings violate that policy.
She added that she hopes HMC’s newly created position, the vice president of sustainable investing, will lead to further clarity and action at HMC regarding the social impact of investments.
“We hope that this is something that the new office will look into immediately,” she said.

UPDATED: March 8, 2013, at 6:31 p.m.
Heavy snowfall in Cambridge slowed traffic across the city on Friday. But on JFK Street near Harvard, traffic stopped completely. On Friday morning, underground electrical cables ignited, causing a manhole fire and prompting Cambridge Police to temporarily close JFK Street between Mount Auburn Street and Memorial Drive.
The incapacitated cables caused power outages for 700 customers of NSTAR Electric and Gas, the city’s electricity provider, according to NSTAR spokesperson Michael Durand. He said the incident was probably not related to the snowstorm.
NSTAR received reports of a smoking manhole at the intersection of JFK Street and Winthrop Street at around 11 a.m., Durand said. The smoldering, he said, was due to energy released when the cables failed.
The cables burned for about an hour, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III, before firefighters dumped water onto the cables and extinguished the fire. NSTAR restored power for all but 100 customers within the hour, and expects to have all customers back online by 7 p.m., Durand said.
Traffic signals at the corner of JFK Street and Memorial Drive were without power due to the incapacitated cables, so state police directed traffic for some of the afternoon, according to a statement on the Cambridge Police Department website asking motorists to avoid the area.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email that 65-67 Winthrop Street, which houses Harvard University Dining Services offices, was the only Harvard building to lose power.
Soon after the fire was put out, Mount Auburn Street reopened entirely, and by around 2 p,m., all of JFK Street was open to vehicles. NSTAR employees remained at work on the scene.
Firefighters, police, and electrical workers attended to the cables and closed streets as heavy snow fell on the greater Boston area. As of 1 p.m., more than a foot of snow had fallen in the area, and the National Weather Service extended its winter storm warning until 7 p.m. for Eastern Massachusetts.
MBTA subway service remained unaffected by the storm Friday afternoon, except for the replacement of Mattapan Line trolleys with buses due to “weather-related issues.”
According to the NWS, snow showers will be mostly finished by 9 p.m., and the area can expect sunny weather with a high of 42 degrees on Saturday.

At the beginning of the season, the Harvard men’s hockey team was projected to finish near the top of the league, and the incoming crop of freshmen was touted to be the best in the ECAC.
While the team results may have fallen short of expectations, with the Crimson finishing at the bottom of the ECAC standings for the first time in history, the rookies did not disappoint.
The standout this season for the Harvard freshmen has been forward Jimmy Vesey, who was recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
Missing only a few games due to the World Junior Championships – in which he helped team USA earn the gold – Vesey played in 24 of 29 games for the Crimson, netting 11 goals and tallying 18 points, tied-for-first and second on the team, respectively.
In strictly Ivy League play he scored just one goal and had three assists, but in ECAC play he led freshmen in scoring with 15 points (nine goals and six assists), earning ECAC Rookie of the Week thrice and also ECAC Rookie of the Month for November.
The Ivy League also awarded captain Danny Biega, naming him to the All-Ivy League second team, his third All-Ivy honor of his career. The defenseman played a majority of minutes for Harvard, finishing the season with two goals and seven assists.
These two will look to continue their strong play into the ECAC playoffs, where the Crimson will face off against Ivy League rival Dartmouth, Friday night at Thompson Arena in Hanover, New Hampshire.

There is no debating that there are a number of question marks heading into the 2013 season for the Harvard baseball team. Out of the squad’s six leading hitters last year, only one player is still on the roster – the team has lost over 50 percent of its offensive production in the quintet. The Crimson also loses two of its top pitchers, who collectively accounted for nearly 100 innings last season. Furthermore, the team’s coaching staff has undergone a complete turnover as Bill Decker, hired out of Trinity College in the fall, has assumed the position of head coach.
Despite all the uncertainty, however, Harvard began its season with a walkoff win in the tenth inning against Bucknell, which equaled the team’s victory total in its first 17 games last year. The squad went on to drop its next three contests, but the Crimson nevertheless gained valuable experience and a much-needed opportunity to see what some of its new talent could do. Here is an overview of a few of the Crimson’s top performers from the weekend, who will most certainly have an impact going forward.
Brandon Kregel, Sophomore OF: Kregel registered at least two hits in all but one of the team’s four games. Highlights included a triple in the tenth inning of the win over Bucknell that set up the game-winning single from Rob Wineski, as well as a 3-for-4 performance against the Bison just two days later. Kregel is currently tied for the team lead in hits, and he also boasts four of Harvard’s six extra-base knocks.
Matt Doyle, Senior RHP and Baron Davis, Junior RHP: The Crimson’s opening day starter, Doyle held Bucknell scoreless for over five innings before he ran into trouble in the sixth. But Davis entered the game and quickly worked Harvard out of the jam. In sum, the two pitchers surrendered zero earned runs, five hits, and just three walks. Depending on the progress Decker sees in the rest of his pitching staff, the Doyle/Davis combination could be effective going forward.
DJ Link, Freshman Catcher/3B: Based on the distribution of playing time in the first four games, it looks as if Link will play a significant role this season. The freshman was in the lineup every game last weekend at either catcher or DH. Link notched a hit in all four games, including a combined 5-for-8 against 19th ranked Virginia. In addition to leading the team with 3 RBIs, Link also is tied for team-best with seven hits.
Harvard resumes action this weekend with three games in Myrtle Beach, SC. Look for these performers to continue contributing significantly, and keep an eye out for other untested talent to emerge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stress is an all-too-familiar phenomenon around Cambridge, Mass., this time of year. Stray more than 10 steps into the Science Center, and you’re bound to hear someone wailing about a midterm, a paper, or an extra five minutes of section. Wah, wah, wah.
In last week’s Around the Ivies, I offered a salute to the Ivy fans that come out to support their teams and hurl abuse at their more athletic peers. This week, I’d like to give it up for the players, struggling through the end of a physically and emotionally taxing basketball season while still hurdling the same general academic obstacles that the rest of us face.
I came to the realization the other day that, given my current lifestyle, there’s almost no chance I sustain a serious injury. I walk everywhere—no risk of car or bike crash—and loaf my way through games of pickup hoops at the MAC. The biggest danger I face on a regular basis is that I tilt back too audaciously in my desk chair and concuss myself on my laundry basket.
If I played Division I basketball, I would have to deal with the inevitable wear and tear on my body, in addition to the palpable risk of landing on my ankle and mangling a ligament into spaghetti. And God forbid something serious should happen. I’d probably drop out if I broke my arm. How am I supposed to stabilize and butter my Brain Break bagel with one good wing? It’s too much to contemplate.
So here’s to the ones who face down that danger every week and still take their midterms, even when they have to hobble to get there. Let’s finish out the year in prime bagel-buttering shape.
COLUMBIA at HARVARD
The last time these two teams met, in the aftermath of Nemo, Columbia stunned the Crimson by a comfortable 15 points in New York, largely due to the hot-shooting hand of junior guard Steve Frankoski, who finished with 27 points and hit five of his seven three-point attempts. But Harvard will be fully aware that it can’t afford another loss and vigilant in its three-point defense. I’m anticipating an easy victory and a bounce-back performance from Crimson point guard Siyani Chambers.
Pick: Harvard
PRINCETON at YALE
On Feb. 9, the Bulldogs outlasted Princeton, 69-65, at Jadwin Gymnasium in what was perhaps the most impressive road win of the Ivy season. Now the Tigers travel to New Haven, where Yale has played much better basketball—the Bulldogs shoot 50.8 percent from the field at home, compared to 37.8 percent on the road, and score 16.1 more points per game. This game represents the beginning of Princeton’s three-game road gauntlet to claim the Ivy title, and it might end up being the toughest test of the bunch.
Pick: Yale
CORNELL at DARTMOUTH
If a basketball game is played in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
Pick: Dartmouth
PENN at BROWN
In strategy and execution, Penn outplayed Harvard on Saturday night. The Quakers threw a variety of defenders at Crimson point guard Siyani Chambers, consistently applying pressure in the backcourt and accepting the series of borderline fouls that came as a result. Harvard also failed to contain Penn’s pick and roll offense; freshman forward Darien Nelson-Henry and his soft hands punished the Crimson, as he drove to the basket over and over on his way to 18 points and 11 rebounds. The young Quakers don’t have a single senior on their roster, like Harvard two seasons ago, and could be an early Ivy darkhorse in the fall of 2013.
Pick: Penn
PRINCETON at BROWN
I remember softly chuckling to myself during the press conference that followed Harvard’s 65-47 drubbing of Brown on Feb. 22. First-year Bears coach Mike Martin was close to rending his garments in frustration. “We will not accept that type of performance,” Martin growled at the assembled reporters. Come on, Mikey, I thought, it’s time to grow up. You guys have been doormats for a while, and that’s not going to change overnight. Fast forward a week and a half, and Brown is now on a three-game winning streak, including a road sweep of Columbia and Cornell that boosted it to a tie for third place in the conference standings. Crimson fans can hope Martin throws a couple chairs and gets his boys to make a serious run at the Tigers on Saturday.
Pick: Princeton
PENN at YALE
Did you know that “Penn Quakers” is an anagram for “Prank Queens”? I’m not sure what the implications are here, but they must be significant. Similarly, we can rearrange “Yale Bulldogs” to get “Balls-ugly Ode,” which is as apt a description of “Boola Boola” as I have ever heard.
Pick: Yale
COLUMBIA at DARTMOUTH
Get the shotgun out of the shed, Pa, it’s the mercy game: the final time the league’s two cellar-dwelling teams will set foot on the court this season. It’s hard to get a good read on Columbia. Despite their 4-8 Ivy record, the Lions have only been outscored by 1.0 point per game in conference play—but I don’t mean to suggest that they’re consistent. The final margin in five of Columbia’s eight Ivy losses was four points or less, and the other three came by an average of 16.7 points. On the other side, it’s pretty clear what Dartmouth is all about: losing early and often. Expect the Big Green to out-awful the Lions in this one.
Pick: Columbia
CORNELL at HARVARD
The Crimson’s Ivy season comes to a close when the Big Red comes to town Saturday night (*tear*). Assuming both Harvard and Princeton take care of business this weekend, the conference championship will be determined for the second year in a row by a Tuesday-night matchup between the Tigers and Penn. Last season, it was Princeton that derailed the Quakers’ hopes of forcing a one-game playoff with Harvard with an emphatic 10-point home victory. Next week, the Tigers will travel to the Palestra with a good chance of wrapping the Ivy title up outright. If the Crimson’s March dreams are to stay alive, it may well require the script to be flipped.
Pick: Harvard
PRINCETON at PENN
Bonus game! I’ll let Gary Wright take this one. What a beautiful hymn:
I have just closed my eyes again/Climbed aboard the Dream Weaver train/Driver, take away my worries of today/And leave tomorrow behind.
Dream Weaver/I believe [Penn] can get [Harvard to the NCAA Tournament]
Dream Weaver/I believe [Princeton] can [fall apart on the road at the Palestra].

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 32 seconds left to play in Friday night’s rematch against Columbia, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi stole the ball in the backcourt, took it the length of the floor, and hammered home an uncontested dunk. The basket pushed his team’s slim advantage to three points, and for the first time all night, Harvard was able to hold off the Lions, and hold on for the win.
Despite a late jumper from Columbia’s Grant Mullins, four Harvard free throws—two from sophomore Kenyatta Smith and one apiece from Moundou-Missi and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—sealed the deal for the Crimson.
“It seems like another typical night in the Ivy League for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[I am] obviously just really thrilled for us to gut this one out.”
Harvard eventually pulled off a 56-51 comeback victory against the Lions (12-16, 4-10 Ivy). And with that, the roller coaster that has been this season of Ivy League basketball took another dramatic turn. Harvard’s win, paired with a Princeton loss at the hands of Yale, rocketed the Crimson (19-9, 11-3) back into first place in league standings, just one half game ahead of the Tigers (16-11, 9-4) with three relevant contests still to play.
“We try to come out here not worrying about [Princeton’s] game and focusing on our game,” Saunders said. “But knowing that they did lose, that we are competing for a share of the title, is very exciting.”
Down four with 1:22 left in the game, Moundou-Missi converted two free throws after a Mark Cisco foul on the floor, ushering in an 11-2 Crimson run to close the game. After the ensuing possession, Moundou-Missi pulled down a defensive board and found Chambers, who took the ball the length of the floor and converted an and-one layup to give the Crimson a one-point advantage with 40 seconds to go. From there, it was all Harvard, as the Crimson maintained its slim advantage.
After trailing the entirety of the opening frame, Harvard came out strong in the second half, outscoring the Lions 8-0 over 1:38 near the start of the second, on a Saunders and-one, a three from Rivard, and a transition layup from Chambers. The freshman’s layup, which came off a turnover from Columbia’s Brian Barbour, knotted the game at 30 with 16:50 to play.
“You can’t say enough about Chambers,” Amaker said. “What more can he do for the team—his minutes, his effort, his moxie, his savvy, his daring.”
Harvard took its first lead over the Lions, 35-34, off of a Saunders three-pointer in the half’s seventh minute. From there, the game was back-and-forth, with neither team claiming more than a four-point lead until Harvard went ahead by five with 11 seconds to go.
Columbia bolstered its lead to four at the six-minute mark, as Mullins converted a three-point attempt.
And though the Lions threatened to stretch that lead further with two offensive rebounds—Columbia finished with 14 offensive boards to the Crimson’s five—within a minute of each other at 4:21 and 3:45, the Crimson was able to hold off the offensive onslaught after Moundou-Missi grabbed a defensive board at 3:21.
“I’m proud of our kids for putting us in a position to [win the league title on Saturday] considering the journey we have gone through this year,” Amaker said. “We talked about playing through the weekend and then picking our heads up.”
In an effective must-win game for a Harvard team that was then still hoping to find a way into the NCAA Tournament, Columbia held a 28-22 advantage over the Crimson at halftime.
The Lions jumped out to an eight-point lead thanks in large part to seven points in the first 7:34 from Alex Rosenberg. But Harvard was able to close the gap to three after a Laurent Rivard long ball with 11:39 to go and again at 5:23 on a layup from sophomore Wesley Saunders.
Columbia added to its advantage on an ensuing 7-2 run to capture an eight-point lead, finished off by a Rosenberg three with 2:41 left in the half. From there, despite an and-one from Saunders and one layup apiece from Chambers and co-captain Christian Webster, the Lions were able to close the half with a six-point advantage.
Rosenberg led all players with 12 points in the first half on four-of-five shooting, including two makes from deep, but Harvard was able to stall his momentum in the second, allowing just two more points from the forward. Chambers paced all players with a game-high 16 points. And despite its first-half offensive struggles, the Crimson was able to reclaim its spot atop the conference standings, a spot it secured after Saturday’s win over Cornell.
Smith and Moundou-Missi combined for 17 points and 16 rebounds on the night, while Smith tallied all six of Harvard’s blocks.
“It’s a great position to be in,” Saunders said. “Before, we were kind of down because we dropped both [games] last weekend, but now we just have to take care of business and do what we need to do.”

Visitors to the new "Harvard Speaks Up" website are greeted by familiar faces—those of their peers and their advisors, their professors, and their housemasters. None of the submissions are anonymous.
Harvard's Student Mental Health Liaisons launched the electronic twist on their public forum this week.  All members of the Harvard community—students, alumni, faculty, and staff—are invited to upload short videos sharing their mental health experiences. Participants describe their own obstacles and and how they have coped. All videos end with the phrase, "Speak up, you're not alone."
Since the website uses YouTube to store video data, guidelines for submission suggest that participants may wish to disable comments when they upload their videos to YouTube, or mark the videos as unlisted. Twenty-six stories of support and perseverance have been added so far.
Soon, the website promises to feature an interactive compilation of Harvard's mental health resources.
If you would like to add your voice to the growing dialogue about mental health on campus, speak up by sharing your own story here. As the website reminds us, you're not alone.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
Students at Columbia have been over-indulging in Nutella lately, and it's turned into quite the hot topic. While reports originally claimed the university spent $5000 on the stuff in one week, the figure has now been reduced to a more modest $2500. Apparently students have been filling cups full of Nutella, or just taking full jars back to their rooms, meaning around 100 lbs was disappearing each week. Lucky for students, there are no plans to take away the delicious hazelnut treat any time in the future, leaving all of us at Flyby extremely jealous but also kind of relieved we don't have such easy access to unlimited Nutella. That 100lbs has to go somewhere, guys…
Further north in the state of New York, Cornell has been taking things away from their students, namely three of their fraternities. Chi Psi has been suspended for "credible allegations of serious physical hazing," and Sigma Nu and Delta Phi were both placed on interim suspension for the same reason. Despite the disconcerting nature of the allegations, Cornell's Robert G. Engle Associate Dean of Students, Travis Apgar, has been looking on the bright side. He said that "[they] are pleased to see Cornell demonstrate that it is a community of action takers, not bystanders". Yep, that's definitely the takeaway from all of this.
Over in New Haven, Yale's Sex Weekend has been causing a stir. At their "Sex: Am I Normal?" seminar, 9% of around 55 attendees admitted to having been paid for sex, and 3% to sexual activity with an animal. The seminar has certainly fulfilled its goal of getting people talking about sexual taboos, but probably not in the way they'd hoped. News outlets jumped on the story, with one site using a "Yale School of Prostitution" still from "The Simpsons" as an illustration. Ouch.
Someone who definitely won't be heading to a school of prostitution any time soon (we hope) is Malia Obama, though she was seen checking out one Ivy League school this week, namely Princeton… Or not. The picture, allegedly of Malia and a student at the college, actually turned out to be a picture of two freshman friends who decided to play a prank via Twitter to see how "news" spreads on campus. Class of 2016 student and Malia lookalike Abby Lissanu told the Daily Princtonian she her friends never expected the story to get so big. Oh yeah, because having the first daughter on campus was never going to be a big deal. Malia, this is why you should come to Harvard.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Dunster House was built in 1930, and has the history (and housing) to match. Sure the nine minute walk from Dunster to the Yard isn't exactly ideal and the housing is at best subpar, but Dunster makes up for its flaws with fantastic House spirit and a dining hall that serves the best you can expect from HUDS. And if you're the type of person that values looks, Dunster House with its iconic red dome is one of the most beautiful buildings at Harvard.
 
House Spirit: Dunster House does Dunster House spirit pretty damn well. Dunster "meese" are overflowing with D Haus pride. The stein clubs are consistently well-attended and the House's other events—its annual goat roast for instance—draw students from across Harvard's campus.
Housing Quality: The quality of Dunster housing might be the its greatest shortcoming. Walk-through bedrooms are the most common setup in Dunster, and although seniors are generally guaranteed n+1 housing, juniors and sophomores consistently have to settle for n housing. Dunster's rooms are also known for being smaller than those in other Houses. The House is slated for renovation in June 2014 as part of the College's ongoing House renewal project, and hopefully that update will eliminate walk-throughs and boost Dunster in future Flyby rankings. And for now, there's always DeWolfe.
Dining Hall: The dining hall is one of the highlights of Dunster House. Covered in dark oak paneling, illuminated by chandeliers, and filled with long tables, the center of Dunster House life breeds a communal vibe and screams "Old Harvard." The food in Dunster's dining hall is arguably the best on campus, but most students don't realize that the trek to Dunster is worth it. As a result there are rarely long lines in the servery, meaning you'll get to the red spice chicken that much faster.
Facilities: Dunster is one of the few Houses on campus with an in-House grille, meaning when another snow storm hits Harvard, you won't have to leave the comfort of your home for some late night mozz sticks. The library boasts the same classic architectural vibe that gives the rest of Dunster its charm. The House also has a pottery room that offers semester-long courses and six squash courts, some of which have been converted into a weight room, cardio room, indoor basketball court, and indoor volleyball court.
House Masters: Government Professor Roger B. Porter and his wife, Ann Porter, are among the longest-serving House masters at Harvard. The Porters are pleasant and loving leaders of Dunster. They rarely introduce new events or ideas into House life, but there's something to be said for sticking to and maintaining traditions.
Extra: Part of what makes Dunster so unique is its annual events, including the Dunster House Opera, the goat roast, and the Hoedown Throwdown. The House has been home to a long list of celebrities, including Al Gore '69, Tommy Lee Jones '69, Norman K. Mailer '43, and Deval L. Patrick '78. Dunster may not be the most centrally located of Houses, but at least it's one of the closest to Trader Joe's. And hey, at least it isn't the Quad.
Our rankings so far:
11. Dunster
12. Currier
Disclaimer: Flyby's 2013 House Rankings, though unscientific, are based on careful research and review by the Flyby Staff. We encourage you to read the full posts—rather than the rankings alone—to learn more about each House. As difficult as it makes our jobs, there is good to be found in every one of the twelve.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
March 3, 1913: Unique Picture Exhibited in Fogg
A rare and valuable picture of Geoffrey Chaucer, the English poet, which was bequeathed to the Harvard College Library by Professor Charles Eliot Norton, has recently been placed on exhibition in the Fogg Museum. The portrait was at Llanshaw Court, in Gloucester-shire, for more than three centuries. It bears a close resemblance to the only known authentic portrait of Chaucer, the miniature in Occleve's "De regimine principum," written in 1411-12, and also to a later full-length portrait in another British Museum manuscript. It has been known in recent years as the Seddon portrait. Mr. James Loeb presented it to Professor Norton, who bequeathed it to the Library with the request that it be inscribed as a memorial of two lovers of Chaucer,—Francis James Child and James Russell Lowell.
March 4, 1931: Crane Gave Bells for Lowell Tower
Charles Richard Crane, Hon. '22, head of the Crane Manufacturing Company of Chicago, yesterday was revealed as the hitherto anonymous donor of the Lowell House bells, thus disposing of the rumor that they were the gift of President Lowell.
Mr. Crane, although never a student at Harvard, was awarded an honorary degree of LL.D. by the University in 1922 as having "sustained innumerable projects artistic, scientific and philanthropic," in the words of the official citation accompanying the degree.
March 8, 1958: Groundbreaking Sparks 'Program'
The call of the golden spade yesterday summoned alumni from Boston and New York to begin the second big push of the Program for Harvard College. About 500 area chairmen and captains returned to Cambridge to speak, to watch, and to listen, as the drive for the "thinner cats" began.
In addition to breaking ground for Quincy House, yesterday's festivities put into motion the Boston and New York solicitation campaign which will begin in earnest after Harvard's Day on March 28.
With most of the "fat cats" solicitation out of the way, the Program, which as of yesterday had garnered $34,250,000, turned to the prospects expected to contribute less than $100,000.
March 3, 1962: Congressman Claims MTA Should Sell to University
WASHINGTON, March 2—The Congressman whose district includes Harvard said today that the Bennett St. Yards of the Metropolitan Transit Authority should go to the University for the construction of a tenth house.
Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill, a Democrat, whom the eleventh district has reelected four times, told the CRIMSON that selling the land to anyone besides Harvard would "spoil the continuity of the University area."
However, O'Neill added, University officials should meet on "friendly terms" with the city to "make a respectable offer of tax revenues which the property would yield Cambridge in the future."
"Harvard wants the land so badly," he noted, "that it will make a deal equitable to all."
March 8, 1971: Women's Group Seizes Harvard Building, Demand Low-Income Housing And Permanent Women's Center
About 150 women ended a march celebrating International Women's Day by seizing a Harvard building Saturday afternoon.
The Architectural Technology Workshop, located at 888 Memorial Drive near Peabody Terrace, houses design workshops and two classes per week in the Graduate School of Design. The building is part of the Treelands site and is slated for demolition in the plan to construct new graduate school housing.
The group of organizers included women from organizations including Bread and Roses, the Old Mole Women's Caucus, and Gay Women's Liberation.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
When you imagined your life as an upperclassman at Harvard, you did not imagine Currier House. It's not even partly neo-Georgian, and unlike Mather it's got no river views. Currier is no freshman's top choice. But those who live there learn to love it, and for good reason (not to mention out of necessity). As Stephen Stills would advise, if you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with.
House Spirit: Timete Arborem. Fear the Tree.
 
New Currierites tend to think of the revered tree as hokey, not to mention a poor consolation prize for the unfortunate location and questionable aesthetics of their House. Soon, however, they, too, grow affectionate towards the feared tree.
 
Currier residents describe their House as tight-knit—it's the type of place where you can go into the dining hall and sit with a random person and there's a good chance that they'll be friendly. One hallway leads to giant common spaces and filters into the dining hall, and people are always around. Say what you will about Currier, at least it's totally internally connected, which comes in handy when it snows. Unfortunately, that internal connectivity does not extend to the Yard or the River.
 
Housing Quality: What Quadlings lose in proximity to the Yard, they gain in space. Currier has many singles, which often include their own bathrooms. It's possible for sophomores to have singles, with their own private bathrooms and common rooms. These are the perks of living in the Quad. There are also a few giant suites, including the coveted Currier Ten-Man, ten singles that surround a huge suite common room. Then there's the Solariums—the tops of the towers—which are comprised of three penthouse balcony suites. Plus, no creepy, crawly insects. There are mice, though.
 
Dining Hall: The dining hall is the social hub of the House. Some residents even trek back to the Quad for lunch just because they love the chefs, the food, and the environment so much.
 
Facilities: Currier is filled with awesome common rooms of all sizes.
The Fishbowl, a common space and entertainment center where people can watch the Superbowl or random movies on a 13-foot projector (which Currier students claim is the largest television on campus) is awesome, and a rather unique feature. The Mousehole is a fun common space with couches, a television, and grand piano, which you can sometimes hear people playing at 3:00 a.m. (Whether or not that's a good thing we'll leave for you to decide). The Gilbert Living Room, specifically for people in the tower, has a bunch of couches, a dining room, a piano in the back, and a kitchen. Actually, you can find a kitchen pretty much anywhere here. There are so many kitchens in Currier. Other Currier facilities include a cardio room, a weight room, and a dance studio.
 
House Masters: Richard Wrangham, Ruth Moore Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology, and Elizabeth Ross, who runs a children's home in Uganda, are not only accomplished professionals, they are also a great presence in Currier House life. They frequent dinner in the dining hall and host events that students describe as "immaculate" and complete with delicious culinary offerings.
 
Extra: The shuttle stop is conveniently located right in front of Currier's main entrance, so during the cold winter months you can wait inside. Currier hosts "Heaven and Hell," one of the hottest Halloween parties at Harvard. Quadlings can also explore nearby Porter Square. Finally, residents say their staff is loving and spectacular, which probably helps things if you have to live in such a faraway House.
Our rankings so far:
12. Currier
