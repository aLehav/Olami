After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a moment that decided the fate of nations, Siyavush and Afrasiyab—two characters in the Persian epic poem “The Shahnameh”—put aside their differences and embraced like brothers.
“This piece is one of my favorites,” says exhibit curator Mary McWilliams, while looking at a depiction of this scene in an illuminated manuscript now on display in the Sackler Museum.
“It is a moment of reconciliation, a moment of harmony between these ancient enemies. They really are choosing the more difficult right over the easier wrong,” McWilliams says.
The miniature painting is one of the centerpieces of “In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,” a new exhibit that presents art created in what scholars now call Greater Iran—an area of Persian cultural influence that stretched from modern day Iraq to Central Asia throughout the Middle Ages.
“In Harmony,” which opened on Monday and will remain on display until June 1, consists of the collection of Norma Jean Calderwood, a private art collector, curator, and former fine arts lecturer Boston College, who amassed an extensive array of Islamic art over the course of her life.
McWilliams says she aimed to display the works of art while still paying homage to the woman who collected them, such as by curating the collection based on Calderwood’s own interests and strategies.
“She gave a lot of public lectures and museum training at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston,” McWilliams says. “I have mined those texts to try and understand her thinking.”
To make sense of the eclectic collection, McWilliams organized most of the works in chronological order by the date of production, while she grouped others in clusters to highlight certain themes.
One display case contains ceramics from different time periods that all use images of birds. Another wall explores the development of miniature paintings from Shiraz, Iran. The result highlights the similarity in content across different mediums while still exploring the evolution in taste and style throughout medieval Iranian history.
To provide additional information, the museum made use of Layar technology, an iOS and Android app, to make a guide specifically for this exhibit. Viewers can access supplementary digital materials by scanning an item in the exhibit using their mobile devices.
The exhibit was made possible by a 2002 donation from Calderwood’s husband, Stanford Calderwood, a businessman and arts patron shortly before they both passed away. McWilliams said that Stanford Calderwood donated the collection in the hopes of conveying “the full scope” of his wife’s lifetime achievement.
“He gave this with really only two conditions: that we name the collection after his wife, and that we publish the entire collection,” McWilliams says.
In a lecture to Boston College students given in 1994, Calderwood described Persian miniature painting as a complex art form that combined disparate elements to form a cohesive whole.
“The compositions are a combination of visual types, all united to form a harmony, with patterns of line and color covering the whole surface of the picture space,” Calderwood said.
Despite the tangible influence of their collector, McWilliams says the pieces themselves are ultimately the focus of the exhibition.
“One other condition that Stan Calderwood put on the gift was that the catalogue and the exhibition would not be about Norma Jean herself. He wanted it to be about the art,” she says.

It’s difficult for a stage adaptation of a celebrated novel to become considered a great work in its own right, but the new adaption of “Invisible Man” effectively transforms Ralph Ellison's classic novel into an even more meaningful production. "Invisible Man" premiered in Chicago as the first adaption of the novel, the script written by Oren Jacoby. Now playing at the Boston University Theater through February 3, Huntington Theatre's production comes to new life through the unforgettably poignant performances of the actors, expressive, subtle direction by Christopher McElroen, and inventive lighting design that changes setting as quickly as the nameless narrator jumps from one memory to the next.
 
The success of the performance rests on the shoulders of Teagle F. Bougere, who plays the nameless narrator through whose memories the audience comes to understand the universal yearning for escape from societal invisibility. Ellison’s novel is told from an unspecified basement in New York City; thus, Bougere is alone on stage for a good portion of the show and must carry much of the momentum as the story progresses. At times Bougere appears to be two different characters—he acts as both protagonist and antagonist of his own story and alternates between arm-waving passion and seated resignation, a man with too much to say and not enough people willing to listen.
 
One of the most moving parts of Bougere’s performance is when his character gives a eulogy at the funeral of his friend, Tod Clifton (De’Lon Grant). This hair-raising speech shows the invisible man’s transformation from a naïve child to a disillusioned adult all in the space of three and a half minutes. As Bougere repeatedly shouts, “He’s dead,” first with anger and then through tears, his story comes alive. Though in the novel this monologue comes across primarily as  a political statement, Bougere’s performance turns the speech into a personal one. Bougere makes the character of the narrator especially relatable by using his speech almost instrumentally, carrying both passion and helplessness in the inflections of his voice. 
 
McElroen's subtle direction and tasteful use of silence is especially commendable; he is not afraid to allow emptiness to dominate a scene. The result is an unexpectedly lucid retelling of the narrator’s story. In one such silent scene, the battered and exhausted narrator allows Mary Rambo (Deidra LaWan Starnes) to wash the paint gently from his face with a wet cloth, a silent gesture that effectively defines Mary’s character.
 
Additionally, McElroen daringly shatters the fourth wall in this production. In one inventive moment, the narrator and Dr. Bledsoe (Johnny Lee Davenport) face off in Bledsoe’s office, but instead of facing each other, the narrator and Bledsoe sit side by side, facing the audience. This gives the audience the uncanny opportunity to be both characters in the scene, a blocking choice that opens the dialogue to the audience and asks the listeners to be more active participants in the conflict.
 
The successful translation from novel to stage is also a result of Mary Louise Geiger’s creative lighting. Though occasionally lacking subtlety in some of her choices, such as the flashing lights that seem to accompany most climactic scenes, Geiger still succeeds in taking the characters and audience through various settings according to the narrator's many memories. In the opening scene, a large panel of ceiling lights acts as the ceiling of the narrator’s basement room, from which the narrator claims to have hung 1,369 lights. However, as the scenes shifts from the countryside to an office building to the basement of a painting company, the panel is retracted above the stage and specific lights are lowered individually to complement the huge variety of settings.
 
By the end of the show, the stellar acting and innovative directing and lighting emphasizes the thesis of Ellison's novel; that the invisible man’s story could be true for anyone. “Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?” Bougere says before leaving the stage, a line that seems deserved after he has carefully taken the audience through his own memories. This production of Jacoby's adaption is a spectacular performance that goes beyond the pages of Ellison’s novel and creates new art. Indeed, the interpretation seems to lift the story beyond race and turn it into an open commentary on character, society, and the universality of an invisible man.

"30 Rock," the NBC comedy series known for its absurdist humor and its ambitious, awkward, sandwich-loving protagonist, Liz Lemon, died last night in Manhattan. It was seven seasons old.
Born in 2006, "30 Rock" survived longer than most television critics predicted it would, given its small cult following. But the show's niche appeal also provided its staying power, if not huge Nielsen numbers.
The cause of death was that all good things must come to an end. The show is known for several choice lines including, "I want to go to there," "Shut it down" (or "S that D"), and "We know what art is! It's paintings of horses!" The story was naturally winding down, so rather than resuscitating the plot—bringing back Hazel Wassername, making Criss and Liz divorce, pushing Liz and Jack together—the creators let the show die a peaceful death.
By the end of 2012, each member of the cast of crazies was well on their way to happiness. Jack Donaghy defeated the teenage Kaylie Hooper and took over Kabletown. Liz married Criss in a Princess Leia gown and adopted two children, one black and one white. And Dr. Leo Spaceman was promoted to Surgeon General of the United States.
The finale last night, an hour of kooky storytelling, inside jokes, and a few touching (if cockeyed) moments, stayed true to "30 Rock" form. The mentor relationship between Jack and Liz reached its culmination after one last bump in the road: "You’re just an alcoholic with a great voice!" says Liz.
The show's refusal to pair Jack and Liz together made a platonic relationship the focus of "30 Rock." Yes, Liz's myriad relationships with assorted crazies—well, Floyd was normal—and her relationship with her own success and priorities made "30 Rock" particularly compelling to the female demographic. But the Jack-Liz relationship provided a foundation for all the antics at everyone's favorite, least-watched, live variety show, "TGS." It was a love based on friendship and the exchange of insults and ideas. Liz's loneliness provided a lot of material for "30 Rock," but she was never really alone, and the show illustrated how full one's life could be without a romantic partner.
In lieu of flowers, meatball subs, cupcake sandwiches, and other consumable donations can be made to Liz Lemon. (Or just eat some lemon-y frozen yogurt in honor of the heroine herself.)

The workers will be the same, the name will be similar, but the values will be radically different. Coming in March, The Upper Crust Pizzeria, located on Brattle Street and shut down last year amid labor law violations and bankruptcy, will reopen as The Just Crust, a venture to be partly owned by the previous chain’s former employees.
 
The opening of The Just Crust will bring to a happy end an ugly story of exploitation and greed. Upper Crust Pizzeria, which had locations in Boston and Washington, D.C., came under fire in the past few years, locked in a series of labor disputes with workers who claimed they had been cheated out of overtime pay and that the chain had hired illegal immigrants. The bad press prompted boycotts from Harvard student groups and other investigations, one of which led to criminal complaints against the company’s owner. When the U.S. Department of Labor ultimately sided with workers, ordering The Upper Crust to compensate them to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, the firm was forced into bankruptcy proceedings from which it did not emerge. 
 
Rising from the ashes of The Upper Crust is a new venture, The Just Crust, which has been conceived and established by Shannon E. Liss-Riordan, the attorney who represented workers in their battle with Upper Crust management, and local businessperson Haluk Ozek. Riordan told The Crimson that she hopes Just Crust and its employee-owned corporate structure serves as a model for other businesses. We couldn’t agree more. Though John Galt would beg to differ, employee ownership has undeniable benefits. According to research done by the National Bureau of Economics, workers at employee-owned enterprises have higher levels of loyalty and trust and lower rates of turnover than do workers at conventional ventures. These businesses also fill gaps left by the free market, tackling otherwise neglected social problems, and in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, some posited that the model should be re-examined as an alternative to both socialism and conventional capitalism. 
 
In truth, the workers at Just Crust will enjoy basically the same privileges and responsibilities that white-collar workers have long been accustomed to. Each employee will receive an ownership stake akin to the stock granted to white-collar employees across the economy. The resulting alignment of incentives is likely to have positive effects on effort, worker treatment, and morale. At the very least, we can rest assured that worker abuse will never rear its head at Just Crust. 
 
That’s a lot to chew on, and we hope to be doing exactly that at The Just Crust next month.

The online edition of The Crimson has just undergone a significant relaunch, a culmination of months of collaboration from the redesign team. This redesign, the first in four years, came to fruition through a series of design and concept iterations plus thousands of lines of code.
The redesign began in early 2012 with the creation of a new concept, style guide, and design philosophy. We sought a seamlessly responsive design and a more maintainable, modern, and media-oriented site. The design, concept, and responsive implementation were the work of Preston G. So ’14, outgoing Director of Web Strategy.
Last fall we redoubled our efforts to ready the site for the redesign, translating the new look into code in preparation for its J-term transfer into our web application framework, completed on Jan. 27 by Nikhil L. Benesch ’16, incoming Tech Associate, and Joseph R. Botros ’15, incoming Technology Manager.
The online edition in its current state concludes our first phase for website development. Over the next several months the second phase, which seeks to implement a variety of further changes, will be executed to improve the user experience and administrative sustainability.
With our site now “responsive,” the same code will present the same overarching experience, no matter what device used to browse our new website. There is no need for pinch-and-zoom, nor any appearance of illegibly minuscule text.
Only a few major news organizations have responsive websites, such as The Boston Globe and Time Magazine. We are honored to have created one of the first responsive college newspaper sites in the Ivy League and among the first worldwide. Most importantly, we are excited by the enhancements in the design and user experience of the site.
Not only did we update the templates that control how our site looks in your Internet browser; we tweaked the internals as well to eliminate the old fixes intended to get content live as quickly as possible.
The online edition is powered by Django, an open-source framework for building web applications. In a newsroom, we must be able to build, test, and deploy new functionality in hours, not days. Django allows rapid construction of these new features, while keeping the code clear and maintainable. We are adapting to make full use of Django’s flexibility, and in the next few months, we will be able to more easily incorporate supplementary content, like Flash graphics and multimedia slideshows.
Although this redesign was the work of a core trio of individuals, we offer our thanks to all who contributed. Our appreciation to Kevin Grinberg at Active Frequency for damage control and some technical advice. We are also grateful to the many Crimson editors who composed the concept team and the implementation team, in addition to all beta testers, section executives, and others both in and out of the organization who furnished invaluable feedback and encouragement to help us reach the finish line.
Now, we invite you to use our website anywhere, on any device. We hope our endeavor has made The Crimson a richer and more robust news source, now not solely in newsprint but also on any device.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Feb. 4, 2013
An ealier version of this article incorrectly stated that the newly redesigned thecrimson.com is the first responsive college newspaper site in the Ivy League. In fact, The Brown Daily Herald launched its newly redesigned website on Jan. 23, four days before the The Crimson’s website relaunch on Jan. 27.

In Israel, when hawks suffer, doves usually gain. But that’s not what happened last month, when voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament. The right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did almost lose his premiership, as his Likud-Beiteinu Party shed 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, and Israelis did vote en masse for the center-left. They did not, however, embrace the peace camp. Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ran on a promise of renewed negotiations with the Palestinians, and her party, Hatnua, performed abysmally, winning only six seats. When I was in Israel in January, people expressed fatigue with the moribund process. “There is no partner for peace,” they lamented. “We can’t trust the Palestinians.”(Interestingly enough, when a friend visited Palestine, he heard much the same thing). Yet, there was a message in the results, albeit one that has not been heard in a while: Israelis want to pare back the prerogatives that ultra-Orthodox Jews, known as Haredim, enjoy.
Israel was first envisioned as a secular state—Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, was an atheist who viewed Jewishness as a national identity. Yet, Mount Herzl, the cemetery where he and other fathers and mothers of the nation are buried, is governed by the dictates of the Haredim. That is because in 1948, when the state was declared, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, secured the support of the very religious by allowing them to mold the country’s Jewish life.
Under the compromise struck between secular and religious elements, the Haredim were given dominion over marriage and divorce policy, funerals, conversions, and kosher certifications, all of which conform to Orthodox standards. The state apparatus and public services were also accommodated to certain aspects of Jewish law, such as strict Shabbos observance. Lastly, the ultra-Orthodox were granted communal autonomy. A separate, state-funded Haredi school system teaching almost exclusively Torah was established. Legislation was passed exempting yeshiva students from the compulsory military service that other Jewish Israelis perform.
There has been a human cost to such concessions. According to the Haredim, Judaism is transmitted matrilineally, a standard that other movements have relaxed to include those who trace their Jewish ancestry only patrilineally. The Law of Return, which dictates who can claim Israeli citizenship, allows people who have only one Jewish grandparent to immigrate. However, the Haredi definition is used when it comes to rites like marriage, leaving 300,000 Israelis who identify as Jewish but who do not meet the Haredi standard of Jewishness in a state of legal and religious limbo.
More ominously, the Haredim’s special privileges have morphed into an existential threat as their population has exploded. Some ultra-Orthodox have taken communal autonomy as an excuse to impose their lifestyle on others, using violence and intimidation to enforce “modesty codes” and gender segregation. The government has condemned these abuses, but it is fundamentally hypocritical to denounce attacks on pluralism in the civil sphere while tolerating a Haredi monopoly in the religious one—a schizoid policy that enables and encourages bad behavior. At present, 51 percent of Israeli schoolchildren are Haredi or Arab, belonging to groups that do not serve in the military, depriving the institution of what it most needs: bodies. Finally, many Haredim do not work, relying on state subsidies and going to schools with woefully spare secular curricula, which does not bode well for an economic juggernaut.
On January 22, the Israeli electorate offered up its own deliverance. The contest’s surprise second-place finisher with 19 mandates was journalist-cum-politician Yair Lapid, the leader of the new Yesh Atid Party. He ran as a centrist, pledging to tackle quality-of-life and corruption issues, in addition to a larger commitment of sharing societal burdens more equally. To Lapid, whose father spent decades fighting against the influence of religious parties, burden-sharing means an overhaul of the welfare system and a requirement that religious youths serve in the military. Crucially, Lapid is a supporter of whole society pluralism, advocating the implementation of civil marriage, a rewrite of Haredi lesson plans, and official recognition of the worship and practices of more liberal strains of Judaism.
Center-left parties, such as Hatnua and Labor would back such an agenda, and Likud Beiteinu, a largely secular bloc, would probably do so as well, as long it were not beholden to religious parties for a majority in the Knesset. Shelly Yacimovich, the leader of Labor, has said that her group will not sit in the government. She should rethink her position and join a grand coalition of secularists. It’s not an ideal fit. The alliance would have to put off peace to a later date. But that’s fine. Stopping fanatics within is a prerequisite for dealing with stone-throwers without.

It’s the usual mid-semester day. I’m rushing to make my afternoon class by Harvard time. And from afar we greet each other with a quick wave. As we’re about to cross paths, that question comes. The question that holds so much potential, that could mean so much.
“How are you?”
To you it’s nothing more than a half-hearted handshake. And I treat it as the same.
“I’m fine,” I say.
But you don’t see how my strained smile doesn’t reach my eyes. You don’t because you can’t. You can’t because you’re like me: so caught up with how things look on the outside, we don’t know how to look inward.
I’m not fine. Neither are you. But it’s easier to pretend we are. We convince ourselves that we’re having a meaningful conversation as we lament the all-nighters needed for the two ten-page papers due this week. We think we’re bonding as we flip through notes for answers to tomorrow’s problem set. And we think we know each other as we covertly boast about that research program we have lined up for summer.
But I don’t tell you that the real reason I’m losing sleep is because I worry about how my parents will afford tuition for next semester. I don’t say that the reason I’ll be here this summer is that there’s no place I truly feel at home.
As Harvard students, we feel that we’re supposed to have everything together. Weaving through tourists in Harvard Yard, sometimes it almost feels like we’re on display. So we feel as though we have to put all of our efforts into the upkeep of a façade of perpetual success. But what is a beautiful house that is shambles inside?
We give greater regard to outside recognition than to inward fulfillment. We are devastated when we end up with a B on that midterm we studied so hard for.  We feel hopeless when we don’t get accepted into that analyst internship we were vying for. And we’ve come to define our time here as a necessary experience to reach the next rung of the success ladder.
But what are we climbing up to? And when we get there, will we finally be happy?
The problem is that we don’t take the time to truly ask ourselves: Am I really fine? We’ve somehow come to convince ourselves that by being successful, we will be happy. But what do we see as success?  Is it an A on that midterm? Is it acceptance into that summer internship? But why then do we still feel like we’re not good enough? Why do we still feel like we’re at the point of our feet slipping, still reaching?
Maybe it’s because happiness isn’t about scores, marks, certificates, or the next prestigious award. Maybe it’s because happiness is about how we feel about ourselves.  And maybe we find it so hard to grasp happiness because self-worth can’t be quantified. Self-worth can’t give a GPA or resume boost, so we don’t give it the time of day. We’re used to quantifying the worth of our lives by our achievements. But in doing so, we often forget that we have the power to define what an achievement means to us.
An accomplishment doesn’t always need to be academic. We can feel accomplished by simply attending classes for the day. We can feel accomplished after coming back from hard tennis practice. We can feel accomplished by finally having dinner with a friend we haven’t seen in a few weeks. In building self-worth, we can’t always wait for other people to congratulate us. We need to learn to do that for ourselves.
When we learn to congratulate ourselves, we learn to truly believe in ourselves. We believe in ourselves not because someone or something else is allowing us to, but because we are allowing ourselves to. We must place our self-fulfillment first and outside accolades second.
In an environment that is so widely recognized as a bastion of high achievement and success, we have to ask ourselves what success means. These classes, internships, and prestigious positions we strive for are simply moments, points along a greater journey. College is a significant path in the greater journey that is our lives. And in our time here, we owe it to ourselves to look beyond academics to how we view ourselves. It is not accolades that determine how much potential we hold. That power comes from within.
We don’t need to be near perfect to have potential. We can admit that sometimes we’re having a bad week. We can admit that we have personal struggles—with family, friends, or even ourselves. We can admit that we need help.
We can admit that we’re not fine because we don’t always have to be. When we do, we can begin to find true happiness.

Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations spent about $510,000 on lobbying in Washington D.C. in the calendar year of 2012, approximately the same amount as in 2011, according to public records filed with Congress.
Throughout 2012, Harvard lobbied on legislation relating to education, federal research funding, and charitable deductions, among other issues, according to the forms. Their efforts targeted both chambers of Congress, the White House, and the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.
A little more than $100,000 of the money spent by Harvard on lobbying in 2012 went to the law firm O’Neill, Athy, and Casey, which advises and conducts research for the University’s lobbyists.
Harvard’s lobbying expenditures were significantly higher than those of its peer institutions like Princeton University, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Brown University, all of which spent less than $250,000 in 2012, and Dartmouth College, which spent nothing on lobbying. Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania each spent $540,000 and $680,000, respectively.
Harvard’s D.C.-based federal relations office coordinates the University’s lobbying efforts by communicating with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and with members of committees that cover issues of concern to Harvard, such as budget appropriations, science, health, education, and labor.
“When big issues are being discussed by the government, like discretionary spending, [lobbying] shows that we have this really strong partnership,” said Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications. Casey staffs Harvard’s D.C. office with Suzanne Day, director of federal relations.
Casey and Day said that the budget crises over the past couple of years, including last year’s debate over deficit reduction that threatened Harvard’s research funding, has required targeted attention from Harvard’s lobbyists.
“I think there was a certain intensity to the communications with campus at that time,” Casey said. “The timing was unusual, but I wouldn’t say it was at all unpredictable.”
He added that sequestration—non-defense discretionary spending cuts that will take effect if Congress does not agree on a budget by March 1—still poses a threat to Harvard’s research funding. Casey said that in its lobbying efforts, Harvard has tried to convince Congress that supporting education and research facilitates innovation, which is crucial to a thriving economy.
“We’re still hopeful that in the time between now and the sequestration deadline, that some of the arguments about research and education being the solution take hold,” Casey said.
While Harvard has directed far more money towards lobbying at times, Day said that these fluctuations are less a result of economic conditions than a product of the type of issues on which Harvard’s lobby focuses its attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2013, at 11:16 p.m.
Approximately 600 students spilled out of Fong Auditorium on Wednesday for Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature”—nearly twice as many as had shopped the class last year. The overwhelming interest dwarfed Pre-Term Planning expectations, which projected that about 400 students would shop the course. And of those nearly 600, only 45 were accepted after a lottery that left hundreds of students without the chance to take their first-choice class.
As the number of interested students in some already oversubscribed classes continues to grow and Pre-Term Planning data at times fails to accurately predict student interest, professors face the dilemma of how best to accommodate students while still maintaining the quality of their classes.
“It always feels distressing,” Maria Tatar, instructor of Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature, said of having to lottery her course.
“After the lottery, I always get a flood of emails asking to be put on the waitlist. I realize that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter—there are hundreds of other great courses in the catalog—but it’s not a feel-good experience.”
Ryuichi Abe, who teaches Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 36: “Buddhism and Japanese Culture,” wrote in an email that he was able to plan for higher student interest thanks to a notification from the General Education office over winter break indicating potential increases in enrollment.
But even planning in advance was not enough. Abe recruited three teaching fellows to lead six sections and 108 students—a 71.4 percent increase from the year before—but 344 students entered his lottery this week.
English professor Helen Vendler’s Gen Ed course Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 20: “Poems, Poets, Poetry” expected a little over 90 students but saw more than 200 show up at the first lecture.
Pre-Term Planning data and actual student interest do not always align, as evidenced by this semester’s shopping week. But Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen wrote in an email that the Pre-Term Planning process, which was introduced in late 2010, is still evolving.
“We are still learning about how to interpret these numbers while allowing students the freedom to visit courses during shopping week,” Kenen wrote.
She added that Gen Ed courses are often lotteried due to a lack of resources. In other cases, such as when professors are introducing new courses to the curriculum, limiting enrollment can help the teaching staff adjust.
“Often a lottery is the best way to ensure that a course will run smoothly and provide the best learning environment for our students,” Kenen wrote.
The Gen Ed office has a general policy that lotteries be run randomly, she added, although there are certain exceptions. Abe, for example, was granted permission to give preference to students studying East Asian Studies. Similarly, Tatar grants priority to folklore and mythology concentrators and seniors who have been lotteried out of the course twice.
Vendler was able to hire enough teaching fellows to accommodate the unexpectedly high turnout for her Gen Ed course and said she is thankful to have avoided a lottery.
“I know how disappointing a lottery is,” Vendler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen F. Lynch, the longtime Congressman from South Boston, launched his run for Senate Thursday. In his remarks, Lynch, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, spoke of a campaign that will rely on a strong grassroots ground game inspired by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign in her hard-fought victory over incumbent Scott Brown.
“We won’t win this race because of money or endorsements or backdoor deals to clear the field,” Lynch told a crowd of more than 300, assembled in the event room at the Ironworkers Local 7 headquarters in South Boston. “We will win by earning the support of the people of this great state by the way it should be won: by courage, by honesty, and by hard work.”
Lynch enters the race as the clear underdog. His opponent, Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, not only leads in the polls but has also been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who on Friday will vacate the seat now being contested.
Additionally, Markey holds about a four-to-one advantage in cash on hand, according to campaign finance reports.
But Lynch, who worked as an ironworker for 18 years before entering public service in 1996, embraced his status as a party crasher. Channeling Warren, he said that he was happy not to be a part of the Washington establishment in response to opponents who suggested that he would not fit in with the Senate.
“After I thought about it for a few minutes,” Lynch said, pausing for the punchline, “I had to agree, because it’s true. I will not fit in in the United States Senate, but neither would you.”
The crowd, largely composed of card-carrying union members, erupted in raucous applause.
Throughout the event, the Warren inspiration was clear, if subtle. In the office where Lynch paced before he entered the event room, a “WARREN FOR SENATE” sign was taped to the window.
And before Lynch took the stage, Paul F. Lynch, business manager of Ironworkers Local 7, reminded the crowd of the potential of an organized ground game.
“We can do this,” he told them. “We proved it when we put Elizabeth Warren in as a senator. We can do it again.”
After his speech, Lynch was asked if he would target younger voters as Warren did with great success.
“I want everyone,” he said, adding that college campuses would be a priority. “We’ve got to motivate the younger base.”
Seconds later, Lynch shook hands with yet another supporter who offered “anything you need, anything I can do to help.”
Relying on his supporters’ enthusiasm, Lynch was cautiously optimistic. When asked if he thought the loyal supporters from his district could reach voters across the state, Lynch responded positively.
“Yeah, I think so,” he said. “I don’t have the big money, I don’t have the big endorsements. All I got is people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a checkered jacket and with a bright smile, Marion Cotillard—this year’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals Woman of the Year—rode along with the organization’s cast in an annual celebratory parade Thursday.
Cotillard, an Academy Award-winning French actress known for her roles in “Inception” and in the biographical French film “La Vie En Rose,” joins an elite group of actresses who have won the award, including Elizabeth Taylor and Meryl Streep. Last year, Claire Danes received the honor.
After the parade, Cotillard was roasted by Hasty Pudding Threaticals members in Farkas Hall. President Renee E. Rober ’13 and Vice President Benjamin K. Moss ’13 emceed the event.
Cotillard was nagged by the repetitive presence of a cast member portraying Leonardo DiCaprio, who kept reminding Cotillard that she was in a dream within a dream. Before she was presented her award, the Pudding Pot, Leonardo required Cotillard to perform tasks inspired by movies in which she has starred.
Her three tests included demonstrating how to act by reading monologues and performing a death scene, drawing a self portrait, and singing a song from “La Vie En Rose.”
When she had passed all tests, she was presented with her own golden Pudding Pot.
“I loved being roasted,” said Cotillard, who came to Boston for the first time to receive the award. “I had no idea what was going to happen, [but] knew it was going to be fun.”
Cotillard, who won an Academy Award for her performance in “La Vie En Rose” in 2007, said that she had no advice for this year’s nominees but that she was “totally in love with Jennifer Lawrence.”
“The experience is really amazing,” Cotillard said. “You have to have your own experience and just enjoy and have fun.”
Although the weather was cold and windy, J.P. Licks passed out free samples of ice cream as many people crowded around Mass. Ave to get a glimpse of Cotillard.
“It looked like the entire Cambridge police department was there,” Reylon A. Yount ’16 said. Yount said he enjoyed his first time witnessing a Woman of the Year parade, describing it as a “classic Harvard experience.”
The parade and roast drew alumni along with students and professors. Mark P. Szpak ’77, who was president of Hasty Pudding Theatricals when Elizabeth Taylor was named Woman of the Year, came back to see this year’s roast.
“There’s nothing like it anywhere in the U.S. or the world,” Szpak said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Sackler Museum opened its exhibit “In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art” this week, the occasion marked the first time a Harvard art museum has made use of augmented reality, a technology designed to add a digital layer to a real-world experience.
The exhibit utilizes Layar, an app for iOS and Android devices, to allow museum goers to access supplementary digital material about selected objects in the gallery. Exhibit organizers say that the videos, photos, and sound clips made available by the technology are intended to enhance the traditional museum experience for mobile-minded visitors.
“It’s not meant to compete with the works. It’s just meant to augment it,” said Jeff Steward, the programmer behind the exhibit’s Layar technology. “We’re just exploring how we can bring out this content to people.”
The technology can be used with six items in the Calderwood exhibit, which features a collection of ceramics, illustrated manuscripts, and Persian lacquer primarily from the Persianate world. To access the digital materials, visitors can download the app and scan an item in the exhibit using their devices.
The technology works by “solely relying on the uniqueness of the object itself”—that is, by analyzing the item for contrast and unique shapes, Steward said.
Jennifer Novak, the digital communications manager at the Harvard Art Museums and the designer of much of the exhibit’s audio and video content, said that the technology is intended to make works of art “more alive” to museum visitors.
“It just gives you more of a backstory and more of a relationship with the object,” Novak said.
While peering through the glass at a sweetmeats dish, for example, one can use the Layar technology to simultaneously watch a video showing how the dish is made.
Exhibit organizers began discussing using technology to enhance the planned exhibit in April 2012, according to Steward, who is also the Harvard Art Museums’ director of the department of digital infrastructure and emerging technologies.
Organizers tested the technology in collaboration with students in a Graduate School of Education course who were asked to use Layar in one of their class projects.
After early tests proved promising, Steward said, the team moved ahead with integrating the technology into the exhibit in June 2012.
Mary McWilliams, curator of Islamic and Later Indian Art for the Harvard Art Museums, stressed that while the technology has great potential to enhance visitors’ experiences with the exhibit, it remains an experiment.
“We want to know how people use it,” McWilliams said. “We want to know if this is a distraction or if this will become the way people look at art.”
According to Novak, museum administrators have been discussing how to implement this kind of technology in other campus museums.
At the same time, exhibit organizers say that they recognize that the new technology might not be attractive to everyone. They keep magnifying glasses and printed catalogues available for those visitors who might be more comfortable with the traditional museum experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Joseph K. Blitzstein took to the stage of Sanders Theatre Thursday evening for the fourth annual “Harvard Thinks Big,” he was greeted by wolf-whistles and cardboard signs emblazoned with his name. Firing the audience up was the anticipation of a 12-minute speech on how all probability is conditional, laced with humor and data.
Blitzstein, a professor of the practice in statistics, set the tone for an evening of “big ideas” that brought together both the comedic and existential natures of some of Harvard’s top academics. Speaking on topics ranging from Romans to breast milk, six faculty members and Harvard Thinks Big’s first student speaker had a packed crowd, alternatively roaring with laughter and questioning conditions of humanity.
Katherine J. Hinde, assistant professor of Human Evolutionary Biology, began by promising to explain why “mammals suck way better.” She proceeded to outline the advantages of breast milk, ultimately calling for greater research and societal infrastructure to give mothers the choice of breastfeeding.
Classics and history professor Emma Dench took a more interactive approach and asked her spectators to repeat the age-old dictum, “Latin is a language as dead as dead can be/It killed off all the Romans and now it’s killing me.”
She then explored the implications for modern citizens of studying a civilization as distant and complex as Rome—one that created democracy and took fun out of dancing dwarves.
“You begin to see the gaps in logic, the blind spots in our own society,” said Dench said.
Some of the speakers were more contemplative, including Annemarie E. Ryu ’13, who concentrates in Anthropology. She cited many of her ventures, including work she has done to promote the sale of jackfruit in the global market, to urge her audience to “Think big,” and “Act now, not later.”
Professor of Romance Languages and Literature and of African and African American Studies Doris Sommer argued that “culture changes the world.”
She gave the startling example of Antanas Mockus, former mayor of Bogotá, Columbia, who managed to curb traffic deaths by replacing corrupt police with pantomime artists.
“Without pleasure, there is no lasting cultural change, no lasting political change,” she said.
Roberto M. Unger, professor of law, implored humans to delegate more tasks to machines to preserve their most precious resource: time.
Concluding the event with a fervent call to action was Michael Puett, professor of Chinese history. Claiming that his generation mistakenly thought it had “figured things out” after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Puett entreated students to move beyond traditional modes of thinking.
“We have left you with a very foolishly complacent way of thinking about the world,” Puett said. “But the world we left you with—bad as it is—can still be saved.”
Audience members had a chance to reflect on the event in real time throughout the night, tweeting comments tagged #htb4 that were flashed onscreen between speakers. Students said they enjoyed the evening’s diversity of perspectives.
“We tend to have small academic niches here,” said Abigail E. Hook ’13. “This was a great way to broaden our perspectives from professors I never would have taken a class from.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2013, at 11:25 p.m.
Harvard’s administrative structure has come under fire for being overly bureaucratic. But for one Chinese university president, it offers a model for progress.
Speaking to an audience in CGIS Thursday afternoon, Chongqing University President Lin Jianhua argued that an outdated educational model that places too little emphasis on teaching has stunted the progress of Chinese higher education.
Lin, who as the leader of Chongqing University oversees one of China’s top-ranked educational institutions, said he believes that Chinese universities pay too much attention to research and too little to their students.
“China has grown economically, and higher education has also dramatically increased for the past couple of years,” Lin said at the start of his talk. “But we are also facing a very serious problem.”
In his talk, which was sponsored by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, Lin also criticized China’s secondary school system for teaching a curriculum that he said does no more than prepare students for a single entrance examination.
“Values, ethics, responsibility, social services, and practices are ignored in education,” Lin said. “They are not considered important.”
Also problematic, according to Lin, is the obsolete nature of the Chinese system. Lin said China’s current model was initially adopted from the former Soviet Union education system, which emphasized efficiency at the expense of individuality.
“The university generates mass graduates just like in an assembly line,” he said.
In his effort to address these problems, Lin called on China to transform its system immediately.
“We shouldn’t miss the boat,” Lin said. “The whole society is calling for reform of higher education. Now is the time.”
To fix these issues at his own university, Lin said he is establishing two new enhanced engineering programs, a tenure system, and a visiting scholars program.
He is also recruiting two new deans from Hong Kong and the United States and is looking to create an administrative structure similar to Harvard’s.
In response to questions about the feasibility of his plan, Lin emphasized the difficulty of reform.
“Whenever you do a new thing in China, you must be realistic to adapt to the system we have now,” Lin said. “You can’t do everything new. That simply doesn’t work.”
Audience members interviewed after the event voiced doubt about how far Lin’s reforms could go in repairing a broken system.
“There are so many challenges,” said Joseph You Guo Jiang, an independent scholar affiliated with the Fairbank Center. “[In China], they do not focus on the whole, the well-rounded student. It’s tough. I don’t see a big change happening in the next 20 years.”

People can now explore every known inch of the universe with the wave of a hand, according to astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman, who demonstrated Microsoft’s WorldWide Telescope Program at the Harvard Allston Education Portal on Thursday.
Allston-Brighton residents gathered to watch Goodman exhibit the computer program, which allows users to interactively explore and learn about millions of objects in the universe.
As one of the most comprehensive databases of astronomical information, the program was designed to visualize the universe for astrophysical research.
“This is better for [astrophysical] research than any other tools made before,” Goodman said.
Goodman emphasized the WorldWide Telescope Program as a tool for the general public and not just for practicing astronomers.
“[The program] has huge educational potential,” Goodman said, adding that users can go on personalized “tours of the sky” and bring their friends and family along for the ride.
“One of the main educational goals is for people to be able to use it as a story-telling platform,” she said, a point which she illustrated by showing the audience a six-year-old boy’s favorite nebula.     “The way people learn anything is by telling themselves a story they can remember.”
According to Goodman, one Boston-area high school student called the telescope program “cooler than ‘Call of Duty.’”
Luke H. Black, a 12-year-old Allston resident who attended the lecture, said, “It’s cool getting to learn about all the amazing stuff out there.”
The lecture was part of the Ed Portal’s Faculty Speaker Series, which is intended to connect Harvard faculty to the Allston community.
According to Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Ed Portal and professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology, Goodman “takes very seriously the mission to communicate science to as many people as possible, the mission to get people excited about science.”
Lue’s articulation of Goodman’s goals fits the Ed Portal’s mission as expressed on its website, which is to build on “Harvard’s commitment to education beyond the classroom.”
Founded by Harvard in 2008, the Ed Portal offers a variety of tutoring, mentoring, and educational programs for the broader community.

As politicians continue to debate the scope of gun control in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, one Harvard faculty member is suggesting that more funds be dedicated to researching the effects of gun violence on public health.
David Hemenway ’66, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health and a lead researcher in the field of gun control, has been investigating the issue of gun violence for years. His studies suggest that gun violence in this country is caused by more than just simple legislative faults and that its regulation requires changing both public policy and social norms.
“A good approach to try to reduce our gun violence problem is the public health approach, which focuses on prevention and really emphasizes that you don’t have to wait till someone’s pulling the trigger to try to do something about that person,” Hemenway said. His recommendations include bolstering background checks and reinforcing serial numbers on firearms.
And although the Newtown tragedy has ignited recent media exposure, researchers like Hemenway have been debating the issue for years.
“We have a terrible gun problem,” Hemenway said. “In terms of violence, other than gun violence, we’re an average country­...but we have lots more guns and by far the weakest gun laws.”
Studies say that the United States has one of the highest levels of gun related violence in the world.
Prioritizing prevention can be best achieved when new policies are integrated with efforts to understand the social and cultural determinants of gun violence, according to Hemenway. Still, he added that the allocation of funds for research remains inadequate, making it difficult to collect data on the subject.
Hemenway’s sentiment was echoed in a recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled “Silencing the Science on Gun Research.”
“It’s very, very sad when vested interests try to prevent research and science,” Hemenway said. “It’s almost impossible to get funding to do this research.”
Hemenway stressed its urgency.
“If not now, when?” he asked.  “How many people have to die before the society steps up?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 6:08 a.m.
Roughly 70 students, or approximately one percent of Harvard’s undergraduate body, were forced to temporarily withdraw from the College last fall in connection with the massive Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard indicated in an announcement Friday morning.
In an email sent to the Harvard community, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote that “somewhat more than half” of the cases heard by the College’s Administrative Board last fall resulted in forced withdrawals. He did not specify exactly how many students were required to leave.
Smith also wrote that about half of the fall’s remaining cases resulted in disciplinary probation, while the rest resulted in no disciplinary action.
About 125 of the cases heard by the Ad Board last fall were those of students implicated in the scandal, which was unearthed after assistant professor Matthew B. Platt reported suspicious similarities on a handful of take-home exams in his spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
After this initial tip-off, the College launched an investigation that eventually expanded to involve almost half of the 279 students enrolled in the course.
Smith also revealed details about how tuition payments will be calculated for students who were required to withdraw mid-fall semester due to their involvement in the scandal.
Due to a prolonged time frame for the resolution of the cases stretching from late September to December that “had an undesirable interaction with our established schedule for tuition refunds,” the College will adjust tuition charges for all students who eventually withdrew as though they were issued their verdicts on Sept. 30, he wrote.
According to the student handbook, a student who involuntarily or voluntarily withdraws from the College on Sept. 30 must pay $4,697 in tuition, as well as per diem room charges, pro-rated board costs, and a student services fee.
Smith’s email, which represents Harvard’s first substantive announcement about the investigation’s status since it was first announced last August, comes in the midst of harsh criticism of Harvard’s handling of the case from several longtime Harvard insiders.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 voiced his disapproval in several blog posts, and prominent men’s basketball supporter and Staples founder Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 excoriated his alma mater for its response to the scandal in a letter of complaint sent to University President Drew G. Faust last month.
Smith’s email repeatedly alluded to these and other criticisms, at times striking a defensive tone in addressing the amount of time the University took to resolve the cases, concerns about faculty teaching, and the public outing of some accused students.
After both Lewis and Stemberg criticized Harvard for failing to hand out verdicts in a timely manner, Smith attributed the slow turnover of the investigation—which began in the summer but did not wrap up until early December—to “the unprecedented number and complexity of cases.”
Critics of the investigation have also drawn attention to the way Platt organized Government 1310, a factor which both Stemberg and Lewis blamed for the unprecedented scope of the scandal.
“We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so,” Stemberg wrote in his letter to Faust, which was dated Jan. 6.
Stemberg declined to comment on the letter when it was first obtained by The Crimson. Platt has declined or not responded to requests for comment since the scandal broke.
In an interview last month, Lewis echoed Stemberg’s criticisms of the course’s structural problems, which he identified as an ambiguous collaboration policy and the general perception that the course offered students an easy ‘A.’
“How is it that hundreds of students knew the way this course was run, and nobody in the Government department knew? Or if they did know, why didn’t anybody stop it from happening?” Lewis said.
In his email, Smith offered a response to criticisms of this nature by highlighting the efforts of the Committee on Academic Integrity, a group of administrators, faculty, and students that has been meeting since fall 2010.
Smith wrote that this spring the Committee will make recommendations to faculty on how to structure and administer assessments, including the creation of a repository of “well-crafted exams” as a resource for faculty. The committee is also considering the possibility of introducing an honor code devised in collaboration with students.
Smith made clear, however, that both proposals are only “potential recommendations” that will not necessarily be implemented.
Smith also defended Harvard’s decision to publicly announce the scandal as a means of creating a conversation about academic integrity, a decision that some critics say led to the public outing of some accused students.
“It never was, as some have mistakenly assumed, to shine a bright light on any student or other member of our community,” Smith wrote. “Let me be crystal clear: we all can do better.”
Thomas W. Mannix '81, who along with Stemberg co-chairs the alumni fundraising organization Friends of Harvard Basketball, said that many close to the athletic department are unhappy with the way Harvard managed the scandal.
“I don’t know anybody who feels that the University has handled this well—not one former alum, not one former player,” he said in an interview with The Crimson earlier this week.
Mannix said that the focus on individual students throughout the investigation was “unfair,” adding that he is particularly frustrated by the media’s focus on the men’s basketball team’s involvement in the scandal.
Basketball co-captains Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13, who were expected to lead the team to another NCAA tournament appearance, gained widespread media attention after news outlets reported that the star players had chosen to withdraw from the team after being investigated.
“National broadcasts mention Kyle and Brandyn. They pull up pictures of their faces,” said Mannix, who is a former men’s basketball co-captain. “These kids have been singled out, and that’s what stinks to the Friends of Harvard Basketball.”
Mannix said that Harvard should have tried harder to maintain anonymity for investigated athletes and other accused students in its dealings with the media.
“The University could have protected all 125 of these kids,” he said.
Smith’s email, however, said that the University has not commented on any particular student’s case and will continue to adhere to this policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
5,979 days.
That’s the amount of time between the day Matt Birk ’98 first stepped on a collegiate field as a starter and the day he will do so in the game that marks the pinnacle of his sport.
The first of those events, which occurred on September 21, 1996, did not go as Birk would have hoped. Led by senior defensive end Marcellus Wiley, who had a key fourth-quarter field goal block, Columbia earned a 20-13 overtime win over Harvard at Robert K. Kraft Field, where the Crimson had previously been unbeaten for 26 years. 
Wiley would go on to a ten-year career in the NFL and was an All-Pro in 2001. But despite the end’s triumph on that warm fall day, the man tasked with blocking him would go on to have an even more successful career over the subsequent 17 years.
Six Pro Bowls, two All-Pro selections, and two significant leadership awards since, Matt Birk has finally made it to football’s biggest stage.
His journey to that point was as unlikely as it is unprecedented.
THE COLLEGE YEARS
Birk attended Cretin-Derham High School in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he starred in track and field, football, and basketball, achieving All-State honors in the latter two. His 3.8 GPA also earned him Academic All-State recognition, and his score of 34 on the ACT helped him gain admission to Harvard. 
“He was one of my first recruits in our first recruiting class in 1994,” Harvard head coach Tim Murphy recalled. “Because I had been hired late in the recruiting season, we were just scrambling to find out about Matt. I knew he had interest in top academic schools.”
The lineman arrived in college in September of that year but remained raw during his freshman season.
“He wasn’t one of those guys that came to Harvard with NFL ability,” Murphy said.
Slowly but surely, that began to change. After earning sparse playing time as a sophomore backup, Murphy named Birk his starting left tackle before the 1996 campaign. In his first year in the lineup, the undersized economics major had his struggles. But when he came back for his senior season, Birk was a completely different player, physically and talent-wise.
“He started his junior year, had a rocky year, and was probably 6’5”, 275 [pounds],” teammate and blockmate Colby Skelton ’98 told the Crimson last year. “He came back his senior year at 300 pounds and dominated—simply dominated.”
With the senior anchoring the left side of the offensive line, Harvard went undefeated in conference play and finished 9-1 overall.
“He probably improved more from his freshman year to his senior year than any guy I’ve ever been around,” Murphy said. “In his senior year, he became a quiet leader of the offense. He was such a consistent player, such a dominant force on the team and on the football field that everybody on the offense worked a little harder, played a little harder, and certainly believed a little bit more.” 
“I don’t think it’s any coincidence that [1997] ended up being the first perfect Ivy season in Harvard’s history,” Murphy added. “Matt was certainly one of the big reasons for that.”
Birk attributed his rapid improvement to hard work and the help of his coaching staff.
“Once I was able to focus just on football, I was able to improve, to train more, to train smarter, [and] to put more effort into it,” Birk told the Crimson last year. “I was like a hungry dog, and they just kept feeding me.”
THE HOMETOWN KID
After earning All-Ivy honors for his performance, Birk became the first Crimson lineman to be drafted in 14 years when his home state Minnesota Vikings selected him in the sixth round as the 173rd overall pick of the 1998 draft.
Upon arriving in the NFL, the Harvard alum faced a learning curve similar to the one he had experienced when he began his collegiate career.
“When I got [to Minnesota], they weren’t relying on me to play right away,” Birk said. “There were some great offensive linemen who I could learn from—learn the game from, and learn how to be a professional football player.”
That Birk did, and quickly. He appeared in seven games as a rookie, 15 in his second season, and earned the starting center job in 2000. In his first year as a starter, Birk was named to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro team. He started every game for the Vikings over the next three seasons, earning Pro Bowl honors in 2001, 2003, and 2004 (despite missing the final four games of the season with a sports hernia) and was named All-Pro once again in 2003.
“They pulled the center a lot,” Birk said. “For my size, I was fairly athletic. That scheme fit my skillset pretty well.”
After missing the entire 2005 season with a hip injury, Birk picked up right where he left off upon returning, earning Pro Bowl honors again in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, he also won the Ed Block Courage Award, which honors “one player from each of the National Football League teams who, in the eyes of his teammates, best exemplifies and displays courage.”
But during Birk’s tenure in Minnesota, the Vikings fell just short of the Super Bowl twice. In 1998, after going 15-1 during the regular season, they lost to the Falcons by three in overtime in the NFC Championship Game. Two years later, in the same round, Birk’s team suffered an embarrassing 41-0 loss to the Giants.
After an NFC North title was followed by playoff elimination once again in 2008, Birk decided it was time to look for a change of scenery and a better chance to win.
GOOD MORNING BALTIMORE
On March 4, 2009, the center signed a three-year, $12 million deal with the Ravens. He has started all 64 games for the team over the last four years.
After his contract expired following last season, Birk strongly considered retirement. But following another campaign in which his team suffered a heartbreaking loss in a conference championship game—this time it was to the Patriots in the AFC—Birk decided to continue trying to help get his squad over the hump. 
“He feels really good,” Birk’s agent, Joe Linta said at the time. “He had a great year, and him and [quarterback] Joe [Flacco] both know how close they are to getting to the Super Bowl.”
So Birk signed another three-year deal, this time for $8.5 million, and Linta was proven right when Baltimore got revenge on New England in this year’s title game, sending Birk to Super Bowl XLVII.
“I feel very fortunate to be playing this game and to be doing it with this group,” Birk said at media day this week. “It’s a special group of guys all the way around...everything really came together for us.”
In Sunday's championship, he will anchor the middle in front of millions of fans worldwide, protecting Flacco from a 49ers defense that ranked third in the NFL in total defense this year.
“These are two very physical teams, alike in a lot of ways and the physical aspect of football,” Birk said. “Whoever wins the battle in the trenches will go a long way in determining who wins this game.”
Though offensive linemen often fail to earn recognition, Ravens coach John Harbaugh said at media day that the center was vital to his team’s success, just as he had been for Murphy in 1997.
“Matt Birk has been a huge part of this program for the last four years,” Harbaugh said. “To my eye, he is playing the best football that he’s played since he’s been here—right now, at this point.”
IN THE COMMUNITY
While Birk has shined on the field during his long career, it is his off-the-field presence that has come to define him. 
When the lineman first arrived in the league as a rookie, he was sent to volunteer at a local school by Vikings coach Dennis Green as part of the coach’s “Community Tuesdays” program.
“It was just amazing, the response [the kids] gave you because you were a football player,” Birk recalled.
The experience helped inspire him to get more involved in working to educate at-risk minors, and in 2002, he established the HIKE Foundation.
“It focuses [on] providing educational opportunities for underprivileged youth,” Birk said. “I try to tell kids the thing I’m most proud of that I’ve accomplished is my education. It’s not that I played football.”
In 2010, the foundation launched the “Ready, Set, Read!” program in select Baltimore Public Schools, where it works to encourage over 150,000 Baltimore elementary students to read at home. Birk serves as the “Reading Spokesman” for the city’s schools and offers incentives ranging from autographed photos to Ravens tickets for students who do well.
“As NFL players, because of the spotlight that we’re in, it doesn’t take a whole lot of effort for us to go out and do something to put a smile on people’s faces or make a difference,” Birk said. “So I think if you’re in a position to help somebody, why wouldn’t you?”
For his charity work, Birk was named the Vikings’ Man of the Year six consecutive times from 2002 to 2007 and earned the prestigious NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year award in February 2012.
“He’s a world-class football player—clearly that’s what all-pro means,” Murphy said. “[But] as a person he’s even better. He’s just a remarkable human being—extraordinarily loyal, extraordinarily humble, a person who really gets it in the sense that he understands how fortunate he is compared to a lot of people in the world, and he wants to make sure he gives back as much as possible.” 
In 2009, Birk also became one of the first three NFL players to agree to posthumously donate his brain and spinal cord tissue to the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine, where it will be used to study football-related head trauma.
“It's my obligation as a professional football player to try to do my part to make the game as safe as possible for future generations,” Birk explained. 
A WIDESPREAD LEGACY
Birk’s work on and off the field has often meant more to others than it has to him. 
Murphy explained that he routinely points to the center when recruiting as an example that players can have success in the NFL coming out of his program.
Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin, who served as Harvard’s offensive coordinator during Birk’s senior year, said he keeps in touch with the lineman regularly.
“I was able to get a job at the University of Iowa from Harvard because of Matt,” Philbin explained. “During that spring he got drafted, I would have calls from scouts and O-line coaches.... Having coached him certainly helped, no question.”
But when Birk looks back over the course of his career, he notes that he never expected to get where he is today, getting ready to start in football’s biggest game.
“I was just trying to hold on every year,” Birk said. “That's how I've always looked at it....  Everybody has their share of failures in football and in life. Football teaches you that you just keep working, work as hard as you can and get as good as you can. That gives you the best chance of success.”
For Birk’s former coaches, seeing the lineman achieve that success has been extremely rewarding.
“I was there for the recruitment of Matt, and just the kind of guy he is now, the kind of leader he is, the kind of football player he is, the husband, the father he is, the great guy that he is now to be around, working with him again when he’s in his mid-30s, that’s just a great deal,” said Ravens senior offensive assistant Craig Ver Steeg, who worked for Harvard from 1994-95. 
“It’s truly a testament to [Birk’s] desire to be his best at everything he does,” Murphy added. “He’s a very driven guy in a positive way.”
So as retirement rumors swirl around the center once more, Birk is just trying to savor each remaining moment of a career nobody expected him to have when he first arrived in college.
“This is a heck of a way to make a living and it's a heck of a lot of fun,” Birk said. “I just try to enjoy it every day and every year.”

February 1, 1922: Seismograph Records Tremor
An unusually heavy earthquake shock was recorded yesterday morning by the Seismograph Station at the University. The vibrations began shortly after 8:24, and at about 8:40 became so violent that the needles which record them went off the drum on which the record them is made and put the seismograph temporarily out of commission. A rough computation by Professor J. B. Woodworth '94 makes the distance of the earthquakes about 4470 kilometres from Cambridge, or about 2778 miles.

January 30, 1942: President Conant Receives War Letter from England
President James B. Conant received a war message from the borough of Southwark, London, the home of John Harvard, yesterday, welcoming the United States as an ally and declaring that the "fight for freedom and liberty will soon be victorious."
When President Conant visited England last year on a special scientific mission, he was received by the Mayor and Council of Southwark, and invested with the Freedom of the Borough. The Mayor and Town Clerk of the Borough attended the Tercentenary celebration here in 1936.
January 30, 1945: Race Hatreds Hit by Embree 
Claiming that the "white man is offered his last chance at the peace table of the world," Edwin R. Embree, President of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, told last night's joint forum audience at Radcliffe's Agassiz Theatre that "he will not get it if he insists upon the present phantasma-goria of caste and complete superiority over all the colored races."
"The first world war was the partial suicide for the western nations," Embree declared. "This war is the beginning of a new era," he concluded, in stressing the numerical superiority of the world's colored peoples and the need for better understanding between different racial groups.
February 2, 1955: Admissions Report Deplores Drop in Award Acceptance
The annual report of the Admissions Office yesterday confirmed President Pusey's belief that the College has been unaffected by adverse publicity.
But the report goes on to express serious concern over the number of exceptionally promising candidates who refuse Harvard scholarships to attend other institutions.
The report, made by Dean Bender to Dean Bundy, further issues figures to challenge President Pusey's recent message to the Overseers that the interest in the humanities is declining. On the basis of polls taken among the Class of 1958 at the time of admissions, Bender notes a decided upswing of interest in the humanities.
January 29, 1975: A 'Disenchanted' Leontief To Leave Harvard for NYU
Nobel laureate Wassily W. Leontief, Lee Professor of Economics, will leave Harvard at the end of the academic year to take a post as professor of Economics at New York University and work on developing a new Research Institute of Applied Economics.
Leontief, who won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on input-output analysis, last night cited a "lack of moral support" for his work and a general disenchantment with Harvard's Economics Department as the reasons for his move.

Harvard Thinks Big rang in its fourth year on Thursday, featuring seven celebrity/professor speakers with 12 minutes each to present the next—you guessed it—big idea. Although Drew Faust couldn't make it (allegations were made that she was off in LA lobbying the Academy of Motion Pictures for Lincoln), people still packed into Sanders Theatre to attend the event, one of Harvard's newest traditions.
In case you missed it, here is our tl;dr version of the two hour event.
Joseph K. Blitzstein: "The Soul of Statistics"
Professor of the practice of statistics
In 1865, a chocolate maker's longevity was 73.6. A professor's was 66.6 and a student's was 20.2. What this tells us is that chocolate is always the answer, conditioning is the soul of statistics, and without regression towards the mean, the world would be filled with 10 feet giants and 4 inch people.
Doris Sommer: "Cultural Agents All"
Ira Jewell William Professor of Romance Language and Literatures, Professor of African and African American Studies
According to Kant, art can communicate that which doesn't have a name yet. That somehow involves the mayor of Bogota replacing cops with pantomimes to direct traffic, which actually correlated with a decline in traffic accidents and homicide rates. Apparently, the shock value of clowns, and public art, reaches across nations.
Katherine J. Hinde: "Why Mammals Suck"
Assistant professor of Human Evolutionary Biology
Mammals suck (milk) way better. Milk is a magic potion, and is literally filled everything and anything an infant will need. It can prevent obesity, save up to 1.5 million deaths from diarrhea by contributing healthy gut bacteria, save premature babies—essentially everything short of curdling when in contact with lemon.
Roberto M. Unger: "No One Should Have to Do Work That Can Be Done by a Machine"
Roscoe Pound Professor of Law
Unger envisions a world where machines do everything that we can repeat, so we can preserve our supreme resource of time, to focus on what we cannot repeat. And when that happens, we shall achieve what we all desire, which is to die only once. Can you feel the chilling grip of dystopia?
Emma Dench: "Talking to Dead People"
Professor of Classics and of History
Dench loves dead people, and especially Romans, because first of all, they're all dead and spoke Latin, which is a dead language, and secondly, because they are connected to us. The evidence is astounding: the Roman general Cincinnatus inspired the name for the city Cincinnati, the Romans had pet dogs and we have pet dogs, the Romans had pet children for prostitution, and while we don't quite have that, we get the point.
Annemarie E. Ryu '13: "Staying Healthy for Fun"
Harvard College, Class of 2013
After finding the jackfruit, which produces 3 tons of food every year without pesticides and fertilizers, Ryu has set out to make it the next big thing. Thanks to her company, jackfruit will soon hit national supermarkets and a Jackfruit Institute will be established in India. Do you hear that? That's the scream of a dying acai fad.
Michael Puett: "Ritual and Humanity"
Walter C. Klein Professor of Chinese History
Puett hates his generation, berating it as completely complacent, and is sure that within the next few years the fundamental problems ignored by his generation will result in ecological, economic, and psychological disasters that only we—our generation—can fix. So stop looking around, because Puett's looking at you.

Former U.S. Senator Scott Brown will not run in the special election for John F. Kerry's vacated senate seat, according to a report Friday by the Associated Press.
The Republican Brown—who lost his seat in November to former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren—was seen as a favorite to contend for Kerry's seat, which was opened when the 28-year Senate veteran was appointed Secretary of State.
 
Preliminary polls showed Brown with a comfortable lead over both of his potential Democratic opponents, Fifth District Congressman Edward J. Markey and Eighth District Congressman Stephen F. Lynch, in the special election slated for June 25.
But Brown would have faced some risk had he chosen to run. A loss would have been his second statewide defeat in less than a year, a setback that likely would have ended his political career, according to politically connected experts.
 
With Brown out of the running, many have speculated that the Massachusetts Republican Party will turn to former Gov. William F. Weld ’66 as its candidate for the seat. Weld could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
