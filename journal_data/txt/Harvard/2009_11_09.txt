After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year had passed since the new president’s memorable election. His approval rating was hovering precariously over 50 percent. His party held the governorships of both New Jersey and Virginia, but it was becoming increasingly likely that the opposing party would poach both offices in upcoming elections.
The year was 2001, the president was George W. Bush, and Democrats Jim McGreevey and Mark Warner later went on to be elected governors of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, after years of Republican rule. The parallels between McGreevey’s and Warner’s elections and those of Republican governors-elect Chris Christie of New Jersey and Bob McDonnell of Virginia are striking, and yet their respective characterizations in the media have been vastly different.
This year, these two local elections have been portrayed as signs of a sea change in American politics, occurring, miraculously, just a year after the last sea change in American politics. Instead, overzealous political commentators would do well to recall the old adage, “all politics is local.”
In an Oct. 28 column for The Wall Street Journal, former Bush advisor Karl Rove wrote that “Democratic enthusiasm for President Barack Obama’s liberal domestic agenda—particularly for a government-run health insurance program—could wane after the results of the gubernatorial elections next Tuesday in Virginia and New Jersey. GOP victories in either state will tell Democrats in red states and districts that support for Obama’s policies is risky to their political health.”
In light of the House of Representatives’s passage of universal health-care legislation on Nov. 7, Rove’s analysis looks particularly foolish. The notion that the results of two local races constitute a national referendum on the president’s agenda is preposterous and is not in line with the conventional wisdom for off-year elections.
There is no mistaking that the two gubernatorial contests, particularly the race in New Jersey, were defined largely by local issues. In New Jersey, defeated Democratic Governor Jon Corzine carried voters citing health care as their number-one priority 78 percent to Christie’s 19 percent—quite the reverse of the referendum on health care that Rove envisioned. Voters citing parochial issues such as property taxes and corruption, on the other hand, favored Christie more than two to one. The most obvious rebuttal, however, is the fact that President Obama is still popular in New Jersey, with an approval rating of 57 percent.
In neither Virginia nor New Jersey did the Republican candidate run against the president. Christie, in fact, dropped the president’s name frequently, featuring clips of Obama’s most inspirational speeches in his ads and often portraying himself as an ally of Obama on education policy due to their agreement on charter schools and merit pay. After his election, Christie told a crowd in Woodbridge, N.J., that “It’s [his election] not a repudiation of the president. In fact, I said the exact opposite during the campaign,” and McDonnell did the same, saying that he “ran on Virginia issues, kitchen table issues. That’s largely what got people to support our campaign.”
The inordinate emphasis placed on the events in New Jersey and Virginia last week, therefore, is nothing more than the product of a media desperate to turn minor occurrences into events of historic importance and a Republican party desperate for a comeback. The Democrats face many hurdles between now the 2010 midterms, and some opinion polling does suggest that support for their agenda is waning, but the results of two local governors races don’t spell doom for Obama and his party.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent passage of Question One in Maine has struck a blow against gay marriage and against supporters of equal rights. Yet much of the popular acrimony directed at gay marriage could be caused by confusion rather than discrimination. The gay marriage debate is now so tangled in religious terminology that questions of legal equality can get easily lost in the language. Fortunately, there might be a way for gay couples to gain the same legal status as straight couples that sidesteps this incessant fighting in courtrooms and polling booths.
Today it is much too easy to conflate the awarding of rights to gay Americans with a government takeover of religious institutions. One fundamental problem is that our laws employ the religious term “marriage” to define what should be solely a legal concept. From Uncle Sam’s perspective, a union of individuals—gay or straight—should be treated as strictly part of the legal apparatus, and not related to a religious ceremony. If we can divorce religious terminology from our legal system, we can afford gay Americans equal rights—while leaving religious groups the ability to determine the meaning and rules of their own private services.
A government-granted union between two individuals should be recognized as only a civil union, not a marriage, under the law. To use the term “marriage” equates a legal union with a religious one. This skews the debate over same-sex marriage for those who may not be opposed to gay unions but believe in a strict biblical definition of the word marriage. To remedy this, gay and straight couples could be treated as equals under the law in that both could receive a civil union, which has no religious implications.
Redefining the same-sex marriage debate in this way has the potential to separate questions of legal equality from religion. A more clear division will also help to ensure that the status of equality for all Americans is not dictated by religious sensibilities, but rather by civil rights. This simple solution could eliminate some of the current anger surrounding the gay marriage discussion.

For years, the Berlin Wall stood as a symbol of the division between Eastern and Western  Europe. So when East and West Berliners tore it down one night in November of 1989, it seemed as though this division would break down, too. Communist regimes throughout the region were replaced by democratically elected governments, and in 1991 even the mighty Soviet Union broke apart.
Yet, 20 years later, the division in Europe that seemed as if it could be broken down as easily as the wall persists. Although it has moved hundreds of miles eastward, the geographic line between members and non-members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is as divisive as it was when the organization was first formed in 1949. Beyond where NATO’s membership ends in Eastern Europe, a resurgent Russia now tries to assert its influence, with little interference from Western powers.
Cities on both sides of this line are full of modern skyscrapers and designer retailers from the West, but the statues that grace their parks and squares make it clear which side of the line one is on. In Budapest, Lenin can only be found in the kitschy Statue Park outside the city, but he still stands in the center of Simferopol, the capital of the Autonomous Region of Crimea in Ukraine, and his name graces buildings and even the metro system in Moscow.
A country’s treatment of old communist heroes does not, of course, indicate its political stance. Communism was not a foreign imposition in Moscow, unlike in Poland, where the Red Army’s presence there after the Second World War played a large role in installing a communist government. It’s not unreasonable that Russians should look back on their past with mixed feelings, at least. However, the divergent views in East and West about the communist past point to a more significant difference in each region’s dealings with present-day Russia.
Russia can do little more than fuss about actions like the planned missile-defense shield in the Czech Republic and Poland that was recently scrapped by the Obama administration. But it has a much more powerful hand in non-NATO member countries, where the alliance is less willing to intervene directly. It has been suggested that last year’s war between Russia and Georgia, which resulted in Russia’s recognition of the independence of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, was a retaliation against U.S. support of Ukraine and Georgia’s NATO membership bids. And Russian President Dmitri Medvedev apparently has no qualms about stating his displeasure about Ukraine’s overtures toward Western Europe.
Even disregarding Russian policies, the political divide between West and East has barely decreased since 1989. Ukraine is the only non-NATO country to be rated “free” in Freedom House’s most recent analysis of the former Soviet Socialist Republics, and even democratic Ukraine is the focus of Russian attempts to influence its presidential election in January. Although Western brand names are making inroads in many of these countries, opening stores and making goods available that would have been unheard of in communist days, democratic elections and free speech are often still lacking.
There is no doubt that 1989 was a miraculous year. The countries of Eastern Europe that the Soviet Union had held under tight political control, under threat of military invasion, broke free of this yoke, and many went on to join NATO and the European Union. But as we celebrate the anniversary of the fall of communism in Central Europe, we should remember that not every country behind the Iron Curtain followed the path of those that have successfully entered the fold of Western Europe. Joyous Berliners broke down their wall 20 years ago today—but with Russia’s political influence and their own non-democratic governments to contend with, the countries east of NATO’s influence are still not completely free.

The world should be used to the public declarations of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez by now. He simply loves the spotlight so fiercely that serving his country as president, and as a larger-than-life president at that, cannot satisfy. Restless, he meets with celebrities—Sean Penn three times—but when that is not enough, he uses his country as a media pawn. And that is how an unacceptable number of lives repeatedly get jeopardized.
All world leaders have celebrities they admire; from Sarkozy with Johnny Hallyday, to Obama with Willie Mays and Mandela with his Springbok rugby stars, they have dined and congratulated their heroes, often with a civic purpose attached—but not always—in a fashion expected of leaders of nations and leaders of culture. Chavez, however, takes this to levels of absurdity that Sarkozy could not match even with his marriage to Italian pop icon Carla Bruni. Chavez meets with specifically outspoken supporters of himself. With Chavez, the situation is not the mutual respect of respected, recognized individual’s in today’s society. Chavez will meet with anyone who—and this is key—will meet with him: This is how the list ends up headlined by Naomi Campbell, Danny Glover, and Michael Moore. Imagine that group discussing human rights together, or the role of the United States in Latin American affairs.
Such meetings are only harmless so long as they remain in the private sector. Sarkozy, for example, may meet with as many of the popular faces of Europe as he desires, and, while that may fuel tabloid stories, there are no expectations of policy decisions to be reached by such schmoozing. Penn and Chavez, however, meet with the loftiest goals, beyond simply stroking each other’s egos: Penn assured Chavez (publicly, in an attempt to improve its likelihood) that he would soon meet with President Obama to relay any messages from Chavez, and somehow enable private dialogue between the two leaders.
The farce of this notion can only be assuaged if one remembers that Chavez is the world leader who, infamously, cornered President Obama at the Summit of the Americas this spring to give him a book about foreign (read: American) exploitation in the Americas. Chavez, in his personal world, has the right to put the American president on the spot like this. He also was justified, presumably, in writing, “For Obama, with warm regards,” inside the book, because though the two are close enough that Chavez might give him the book uninvited, Obama has not earned the right to address Chavez on a first name basis. Or so Chavez might rationalize—it is dangerous to look too closely into the mind of someone so erratic.
In a better world, we would be able to dismiss these fancies of a mad leader as just that and not give them more attention. Chavez forces us to study them, however, because sometimes he goes further than simply rubbing shoulders with celebrities. Lately, he has returned to using his country as a plaything for attention. The United States’s increasing role in Colombia, Venezuela’s neighbor, maddens Chavez. He lacks a real reason for his ire, besides an apparent obsession with United States imperialist tendencies he believes still alive and active. So Chavez mobilizes his armed forces, sends 15,000 troops to the border, and turns to his greatest megalomaniacal outlet, his state television and radio show, “Alo, Presidente.” On the show, Chavez tells his citizens that their “main aim” is to prepare for war, and many people will inevitably listen and trust their nation’s leader.
Colombia can only watch in angst and appeal to higher bodies such as the UN Security Council and the Organization of American States because it cannot simply back down to Chavez’s displeasure. The United States’s increasing presence in Colombia could not be the consequence of a more serious issue—contesting and fighting drug cartels, and drugs themselves, at one of their primary sources. Such action will provide a major boost to Colombia’s efforts to combat the forces of the drug cartels and increase the odds of reclaiming territories and extraditing cartels’ chiefs to the United States for trial.
Chavez, however, ignores this obvious justification for the United States’s presence. No matter what Colombia says, or does, to placate his displeasure—short of submitting to his ludicrous demands—Colombia will be in danger as a country. And Colombian and Venezuelan lives will potentially pay the price.
Speaking to celebrities and acting in bad taste in the public eye are disappointing, but ultimately acceptable, outlets for Chavez’s oversized ego. Chavez’s thirst to feel famous, however, should stay out of foreign affairs, especially when this fame comes from the threat of armed conflict.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone who has walked from Mather House to Northwest Science in the heart of winter knows that Cambridge is a very windy place. In fact, Boston is the windiest major city in the country. So it makes sense that Harvard announced a plan last week to generate 10 percent of its energy from wind over the next 15 years.
Of course, the wind won’t be generated here—we’ll get it from Maine, which has increasingly positioned itself as a provider of green energy for the region, though not without controversy. It may seem hypocritical for Harvard to go green by pushing the noisy, unsightly turbines out to a poor rural community far away, as if we’ll only help save the planet provided it doesn’t block our view of the Charles. However, the university has little choice but to outsource to the countryside, and though this commitment is short and limited, it should be commended as an important first step.
Boston may be windier than most places, but our planet as a whole is practically covered in wind. It has to be—we’re rotating, after all. It is this natural abundance that makes wind energy such a useful technology—as well as among the cleanest. Wind energy isn’t perfect, however, since wind is somewhat inconsistent and turbines do cause minor ecological damage. Yet, while wind turbines do regularly kill birds, so do glass windows, tall buildings, car exhaust, and coal plants, and all of these in much greater numbers. The newest state-of-the art wind turbines are larger and rotate more slowly so that birds can avoid them more easily, and they’re often intentionally built outside of migratory flight paths.
Wind technology is also more cost-effective than solar, both in terms of production costs and energy produced. Other alternative-energy sources are either too inefficient, such as biomass, impossible to capture in this region, such as geothermal, or too dangerous, such as nuclear.
Harvard’s plan has the potential to transform the way energy is produced in the entire region by helping pave the way for similar institutions to partner with regional farms as well.
The vast majority of local electricity in Massachusetts comes from burning scarce fossil fuels, so swapping out even a small percentage of Harvard’s sizeable consumption may make a significant difference.
But why Maine? Couldn’t Harvard build the wind farm in its own backyard? The so-called “small wind” movement, which advocates putting small-scale wind turbines on homes, office buildings, and family farms, aims to do just that. But the wind in cities is turbulent, the turbines are noisy, and projects suffer from economies of scale.
Harvard seems aware that a confined urban campus is not an ideal site for energy production. The small wind turbines recently installed atop the Holyoke Center and Soldiers Field parking lot have been called a “statement” and “symbolic”—rather than a long-term solution—by professors and spokesmen for the university. Even if we placed turbines on every inch of campus, we couldn’t generate enough power to run the place, although perhaps Harvard should consider putting wind turbines atop the Leverett Towers as an aesthetic improvement.
Harvard’s plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 30 percent below 2006 levels over the next seven years will likely also involve offsets, and local options can be of most use there. Offsets allow an institution to claim carbon neutrality by funding actions that reduce emissions elsewhere, and Harvard can certainly pursue this by funding retrofits of schools and other buildings in Cambridge and Allston. Retrofits could involve providing better insulation, switching to compact-fluorescent light bulbs, or installing motion-sensor lights and more efficient temperature regulators.
In addition to alternative-energy sources and offsets, however, all long-term sustainable solutions require a healthy dose of conservation. If reducing greenhouse gases and foreign imports were as simple as shelling out for a few turbines, we wouldn’t be in this mess today. Harvard and the people who live and work here must continue to find ways to use less energy.
Harvard could easily eke out huge energy savings if it took drastic steps, like limiting regional travel for sports teams, lowering dorm temperatures during winter, or even charging students for energy. But these options remain culturally unpalatable, and many simpler solutions exist.
For instance, even late on weeknights, much of the campus north of the Science  Center is still lit up like a Christmas tree. Some graduate students may study into the late hours, but the majority of lit rooms are empty. Similarly, undergraduates who don’t properly close their windows end up wasting energy through their heaters during the entire winter, and nearly everyone is guilty of charging laptops throughout the night. Certain buildings could implement policies of mandatory outages after midnight, or at the very least install motion sensors.
If nothing else, I’m hoping that every bit of wind converted to energy lowers the miles per hour of gusts rushing between Thayer and Canaday on the way to the Science  Center.

The Harvard Law School Trial Advocacy Team took first place at a national competition held in Puerto Rico by triumphing in the six-hour final round.
Only eight teams qualified for the invitation-only event, held between Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. All had won another national competition in recent years.
As in other trial advocacy competitions, team members simulated criminal trials by playing lawyers and witnesses. In two preliminary rounds, HLS beat law schools well-known for their trial advocacy programs. The team went undefeated by winning against Stetson University in the semifinal round, and against Barry University in the final.
The four-member team consisted of second-year law student Nneka I. Ukpai and third-year students Dominique D. Winters, Julian B. Thompson and John C. Quinn, who is a teaching fellow for Historical Study B-61, “The Warren Court and the Pursuit of Justice.”
The team was coached by Harvard Law School Criminal Justice Institute Deputy Director J. Soffiyah Elijah and Clinical Instructor Dehlia I. Umunna.
The team members credited their advisors for helping them win with just four weeks of preparation. “The coaches are beyond unbelievable,” Quinn said. “They were really good at creating this team environment and team atmosphere.”
Thompson said that the team succeeded because the members complemented one another. “Our team has four different people in the courtroom with distinctive styles and talents,” he said.
When judges score a trial, Thompson said, they are more likely to be impressed by a range of skills rather than a team that focuses on a single aspect, such as technical competence.
Thompson said that he is comfortable in the courtroom, Quinn is technically proficient without being arrogant, Winters is an exceptionally credible witness, and Ukpai is “the one with her game face on the entire time.”
Team members are not resting on their laurels. Their victory in Puerto Rico qualified them for an upcoming national competition in Chicago, according to Quinn. “We’re extremely excited about it and very confident,” he said.
Though three of their four members are graduating in the spring, enough other students have expressed interest that the HLS Trial Advocacy Team plans to continue on to compete in more national championships in the future.

Twenty-three college presidents in America make more than $1 million each year. Harvard’s Drew G. Faust, fifty-sixth overall, is not one of them.
Overall, presidents of major private research universities made a median salary of $627,750, according to a survey released last week by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, topped the list with a salary of $1.6 million. In 2002, no presidents made over $1 million and only four made more than $800,000.
During the 2008 fiscal year, Faust received $693,739 in cash and benefits. Former President Lawrence H. Summers received $611,226 during his last year in office.
“Of all the lists we top, I’m glad Harvard is not number one on this list,” former Dean of Harvard College and Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said.
Faust’s salary is one of the lowest in the Ivy League. Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger, in sixth place among all university presidents, made $1.38 million.
University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann made $1.23 million, and Yale University President Richard C. Levin made $1.18 million.
“I think it is to Harvard’s credit that [Faust] is not paid as much as presidents in other places,” said David E. Kaiser ’69, who was among several alumni who sent a letter to Faust last month criticizing the compensation of the University’s endowment managers.
“If this economy persists, a lot of people will have to be ready to not have any pay increases for some time,” Kaiser said.
During the recession, some college presidents have opted to take pay cuts, including Stanford University President John L. Hennessy and Brown University President Ruth J. Simmons, both of whom continue to earn more than Faust.
The Student Labor Action Movement has advocated for pay cuts for top administrators and faculty in order to retain staff jobs. Even if cuts to administrators’ salaries do not amount to much, the symbolic gesture is important, said SLAM member Remeike J. B. Forbes ’11.
But Lewis disagreed. “I believe in doing real things, not symbolic things,” he said. “The university will lose the people they want to keep if salaries are cut.”
Forbes said that salary cuts might not hurt the quality of Harvard’s faculty. “The thought that certain faculty are rare gems that we have to look after is misleading,” Forbes said.
Johnny F. Bowman ’11, a member of SLAM and a candidate for Undergraduate Council president, proposed that professors take anonymous, voluntary pay cuts of one or two percent. Bowman said that if professors instead of administrators agreed to cuts, the symbolic and monetary impact would be greater.
“Just focusing on salary cuts oversimplifies the issue,” Bowman said. “Administrators have already made huge sacrifices in other ways.”

Harvard Square on Saturday evening for a filming of an upcoming episode of “Friday Night Lights,” a television serious about a high school football team in Texas.
Producer Nan L. Bernstein said that the “FNL” shoot was the last of a series of scenes that took place in a number of colleges in the Boston area, including Boston University, Boston College and Tufts University. Actresses Connie Britton and Aimee Teegarden were present at the set, according to Bernstein.
Saturday’s shoot was not the Square’s first brush with celebrity this fall. Ben Afleck and the cast of the upcoming flick “The Town” took over the Square earlier this fall, and Aaron Sorkin’s flick, “The Social Network,” chronicling the nascent days of Facebook brought bright lights and cameras to the streets of Cambridge.
Despite occasionally disrupting foot traffic, local business leaders say that the influx of production crews has had a positive impact on the area.
According to Berstein, the crew worked at an “aggressive” pace to film the transition scene—with no dialogue—in the Square. “We only have six days to prepare every episode and six days to film them,” he added.
Denise A. Jillson, the Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the recent flurry of activity has been made possible by the City of Cambridge’s Special Events Committee, which works with the production team on filming projects.
She said that for the most part, people have been happy with the crews, who “have done a very good job in reaching out” to the Association.
“We always have to be sensitive to the businesses,” she said. “When you close the street, you impact foot traffic, [but] it draws a lot of people to the square, people who want to be part of the action.”
According to Matthew C. Lichansky, the Director of Operations at Upstairs on the Square, the recent Hollywood visitors have been a boon to the business.
“I think predominantly it’s had an incredibly positive effect on Harvard Square,” said Matthew C. Lichansky, the Director of Operations at Upstairs on the Square. “It gives people the excuse to rediscover [it].”
He added that since Massachusetts law has become more lenient toward film crews, the restaurant—which was partially used for “The Town”—has been scouted out for several other films, including a remake of “The Pink Panther.”
Bill Bartley, the General Manager of Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage, said he was very pleased with “The Social Network” crew that used his store as a set last month.
“It was fantastic,” he said. “They paid for the space, they used the food... [and] I was in the movie.”

Harvard Law School has unveiled a new public service fellowship that will fund legal work in the public interest sector, an addition to the school’s long list of initiatives that encourage students to engage in public service.
This latest initiative, the Holmes Fellowship, will give approximately 12 students up to $35,000 to pursue public interest law in the year immediately following graduation, but only after students demonstrate that they have been unable to secure funding through other means.
In addition to the new program, students who have committed to five years of public interest work upon graduation already do not have to pay tuition for their third year.
In a time when demand for fellowships has been rapidly growing and funding for public interest work has generally been cut, the Holmes Fellowship will serve as a backstop for students interested in public interest work, said Alexa Shabecoff, the Law School’s assistant dean for public service.
“This is supposed to help those who have exhausted all their options,” Shabecoff said.
The approximately $400,000 program will be funded through contributions from the Law School’s internal budget, according to Shabecoff, even though the School is currently undergoing a period of cost-cutting measures.
“In this difficult economic time, we want to support students in every way that we can and we also want to offer legal assistance to those who are most vulnerable,” Law School Dean Martha Minow said in a statement.
The fellowship might mitigate some of the anxiety that Law School graduates have experienced since large law firms—predominant employers of HLS grads—have been particularly hard hit by a sharp fall in demand for legal work in the financial industry during the recent recession.
Although most Law School graduates have successfully found employment, many students have been slapped with deferred start dates as late as a year after graduation.
As a result, some students have chosen to do public interest work at legal aid agencies and non-profit organizations during their year off.
But this latest program will not fund that work since most deferrals include a stipend, though one far below students’ expected salaries.
Shabecoff emphasized in an interview yesterday that this program is geared towards students interested in public interest work but who have been unable to find other sources of funding.
Sameer S. Birring, a second year student at the Law School, praised the new program and said he was encouraged that even in tough economic times, the Law School has remained committed to funding public interest work.
“[Former Dean] Elena Kagan did a lot of things to support public interest work,” Birring said. “It is good to see the Law School supporting it even when funds are tighter.”

This month, Harvard Square will return to its folk roots and celebrate the area’s role in developing of folk music with special events and displays of archival photos in stores fronts around the square.
Joan Baez, best known for her folk hit “Diamonds and Rust,” got her start in the legendary Harvard Square folk venue Club 47, reincarnated as Club Passim. Her early recording of the Child Ballads, a collection of English and Scottish folk songs, is also representative of the area’s long-standing role in the folk music genre—the ballads were compiled by Harvard English professor Francis James Child.
Now, the New England Folk Music Archive (NEFMA) and the Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) are working together to raise awareness for the continued folk tradition in Harvard Square.
Until last year, Club Passim maintained an archive of folk memorabilia, cataloguing photos and videos of the folk music scene in Harvard Square. But when the financial crisis hit and Club Passim could no longer actively support the archive, former executive director Betsy Siggins founded NEFMA, a nonprofit dedicated to keeping the Harvard Square folk tradition alive.
This month is the financial and emotional “kick-start” for the new nonprofit, she said.
Siggins played a large part in the square’s iconic place in the folk revival as a founder of Club 47.
“She likes to call herself the oldest hippie in Harvard Square,” said Denise A. Jillson, the Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “She’s been the go-to figure for all things folk for a long time.”
Local businesses have responded enthusiastically NEFMA, according to Jillson.
“It takes a village to celebrate music,” she said, “And this village is more than willing to step up to the plate.”
Jillson attributes the interest to businesses’ support for Siggins as a prominent community member.
Daedalus Restaurant, the site of the original Club 47, hosted the kick-off event for the celebration on Nov. 1.
Club Passim will be featuring different artists every night this month, and its Executive Director Daniel A. Hogan said that he thinks that the extra publicity has helped the club. He is currently working with the HSBA to create more promotion opportunities.
The HSBA and NEFMA is also sponsoring special events throughout the month, including a workshop for teens on folk song writing at the Coop next Sunday and a special screening of Festival, about the Newport Folk Festival, at the Brattle Theatre on Nov. 22.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Vice President Al Gore ’69 spoke to a packed audience about his latest book “Our Choice: A Plan To Solve the Climate Crisis” at First Parish Church in Harvard Square on Saturday afternoon.
Gore used the venue as an opportunity to warn about impending climate catastrophes if sweeping steps toward an international solution to global warming are not soon taken.
“If we were to decide in the present generation that it was fine for us to take advantage of all of the work and sacrifices [done] by previous generations...that would be the single most immoral act of any generation of human beings to act on this planet,” Gore said. “But that is the decision that we face.”
Unlike his previous book, “An Inconvenient Truth” which focused on the causes and science of climate change,  Gore’s newest book—published on Nov. 3—focused on the steps that would be necessary to reach a solution.
Gore said in his speech that the technology necessary to transition from a carbon-based to a renewable-based economy already exists and that the major impetus to sweeping legislative changes is an American democratic system that is crippled by special interest groups and lobbyists.
“There are special interests that set aside enormous amounts of money every year for the purpose of feeding the political system, I’m talking about a serious defamation of American Democracy,” Gore said. “When the special interests want to stop reform movements in Congress, they have an enormous and unhealthy amount of power to do so.”
Gore added that television advertisements and punditry have “shaped peoples’ political consciousness,” and have convinced large amounts of people in coal-producing states to doubt the scientific claims about global warming.
But Gore said that the Internet could challenge the special interests in D.C. and on television, pointing out the low barriers to entry for ordinary people and the opportunity to freely exchange ideas.
“The internet brings great hope that we will be able to reclaim control of our governance and fulfill the dream of self-governance by the people and for the people,” he said. “The most important reform movements of history have risen from grass roots movements...and in the present political culture it is all the more important for young people all over the country to get active and speak up.”
Gore also framed the climate change issue in economic and security terms, arguing that much of the U.S. economic deficit and military presence in the Middle East can be traced back to “our ridiculous and absurd dependence on oil, coal, and other carbon-based fuels”.
Many audience members said that they were pleased with Gore’s message.
“What this book does and this talk says is that it is a variety of myths that prevents us from acting [on climate change],” said James J. McCarthy, a biology professor who co-chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Myths that the technology is non-existent, myths that the technology is too expensive, myths that somehow the problem will solve itself without the public and political will [Gore] inspires in this book and in his talks.”

A revered storyteller throughout Harvard Square and Boston, Hugh M. Hill ’48, better known as Brother Blue, died from illness in his home last Tuesday. He was 88.
His studies in drama and storytelling fueled his career, in which he portrayed characters and events with a degree of detail that one listener described as coming “from the heart.”
Originally from Ohio, Hill received three degrees from Harvard—from the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Divinity School. He also completed a masters from the Yale School of Drama, and a doctorate in storytelling from Union Graduate School.
“When he told you a story, he told it with so much love, you could imagine yourself being there,” said Gregory H. Daugherty, a vendor for Spare Change News, who met Hill 15 years ago. “He was a great person, and he had a great love of people.”
Hill’s repertoire included folk tales and historical reenactments, as well as childhood memories and his own Shakespeare renditions.
Every Tuesday at 7 p.m., Brother Blue hosted an open mic event at Out of the Blue Gallery in Central Square, where he invited guest storytellers to share the art.
For 30 years, Hill graced the streets dressed from head to toe in different shades of blue dotted with butterflies. He also carefully painted one butterfly on each palm and cheek, making him an unmistakable figure in the Square.
Brother Blue was a familiar name to fellow street performers, shop owners, and even Harvard shuttle operators in addition to passersby.
Musician Dave C. Ylvisaker, who only met Hill once a decade ago, still remembers his “vibe.”
“He has a spiritual ‘upness’ with him,” Ylyvisaker said. “He was always smiling.”
Frankie J, a musician who occasionally plays in Brattle Square, recalled Hill stopping by a performance two months ago, in which Hill took over the microphone briefly.
In addition to cracking a few jokes and recounting a short tale, Hill helped promote Frankie J’s music.
“He appeared like a youngster,” Frankie J said. “He had vibes like he was a young rapper from L.A.”
Hill also joked with Frankie J about his many degrees.
“He told me, ‘Man, you see me now? I’m cuckoo!’” Frankie J said. “‘I went to Harvard, and I studied too much!’”
In 2003, Yellow Moon Press featured Brother Blue in “AHHHH! A Tribute to Brother Blue & Ruth Edmonds Hill.” He also recently appeared in “Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950.”
A service will be held today at 1 p.m. in the Pittsfield Cemetery in Pittsfield, Mass. Hill is survived by his wife Ruth.

The Undergraduate Council announced a major partnership with Harvard Undergraduate Television last night, granting HUTV an unprecedented amount of almost $12,000 that will allow it to support the 12 campus TV shows that it manages.
Of that sum, $9,000 is a one-time grant that will go towards the purchase of new video equipment, which will be shared among all the shows.
Additionally, the legislation stipulates that HUTV will not be eligible to receive significant funds towards equipment for the next five years, based on HUTV’s financial estimates.
The additional $2,000 represents a semesterly grant to HUTV that will cover operating costs for all 12 shows—six of which were newly added to the HUTV roster this year.
According to HUTV President Derek M. Flanzraich ’10, the act will save the UC a substantial sum of money, as HUTV will oversee the sharing of costly technical equipment between the shows. The group will also be able to save costs by coordinating publicity and screenings for the shows.
Finance Committee Chair Amanda Lu ’11 estimated that without the partnership, each of the 12 shows would apply for grants individually at a total cost of about $26,000 over the next three to five years.
UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said that giving HUTV jurisdiction over distributing grants to its 12 shows sets a precedent in the UC’s grant-giving process.
“We have to collaborate with other groups who have a better special knowledge of costs,” she said. “This is one of the greatest UC-student group collaborations I’ve ever seen.”
The legislation also launched the UC Cameras Program, which will allow for the purchase of two camcorders that will be made available to Harvard students at no charge for their own personal use.
HUTV will also be responsible for managing the production UCTV—a new initiative of the Student Relations Committee to televise the UC’s student outreach. Currently, the committee plans to televise all town hall meetings and produce five 2-minute spots that are intended to highlight issues important to the student body.
Flores said that since 2007 the UC has been aware that FiCom routinely spent “exorbitant amounts” of money funding independent shows that were not using their equipment efficiently.
Earlier this semester, the UC approached HUTV, which acts as a central organization for campus televised productions, about the prospect of developing better funding partnership that would be more cost-effective. In response, HUTV submitted a 50-page proposal to the UC at the end of October that detailed the estimated financial needs of the organization and its shows for the next five years.
“This is a very tangible step that the UC has taken to show that students are supporting other students who are creating content for all the students here,” Flanzraich said. He added that the partnership is not only a means of supporting student innovation, but also a major step toward “embracing the future” of the digital world.
In addition, the Student Initiatives Committee passed legislation that partnered the UC with discount company Groupon Inc. and the Harvard Student Agencies to bring Groupon’s discount services to local Cambridge businesses.
Groupon is a company that advertises a discount of up to 90 percent at a local business each day, on the condition that a minimum number of users sign up for the discount.
According to Mallika Khandelwal '11, Groupon would release one Cambridge-based offer on Groupon Boston every week, compared to its daily releases in bigger cities, though that agreement has not yet been finalized.
In addition, Groupon has discussed giving the UC $1.25 for every student that signs up on the Groupon e-mail list. The funds will be returned to the SIC budget which is used to fund programs such as the DAPA grants and the new UC Cameras Program.
“This is the first time that Groupon is working with a college student government,” said Tengbo Li ’12, co-sponsor of the legislation. “It’s great for us.”
HSA is in the process of targeting businesses in the Square such as Oggi Gourmet, which has participated in the program in the past, according to HSA President Meagan N. Hill ’11. She estimates that the program will be ready for launch by end of the November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kicking a soccer ball often causes a throbbing toe and a loss of energy upon impact. But with Soccket—an idea developed by a team of Harvard undergraduates in Engineering Sciences 147, “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences”—that energy can be stored in the soccer ball and later used for anything from powering a lamp to an electronic device.
“We all had experiences in the developing world and were concerned with the energy crisis, so we combined the two,” explained creator Julia C. Silverman ’10.
Soccket was just one of the exhibitions last night at the opening celebration of the Laboratory at Harvard, a new space in Northwest Labs conceived by Biomedical Engineering Professor David A. Edwards that hopes to inspire student ideas bridging the arts and the sciences.
“The heart of this lab is about students and how a forum like this can catalyze idea development in young minds,” said Edwards.
Besides Soccket, the grand opening on the basement level of the Northwest Laboratory Building featured student projects like Gigue, which converts your heartbeat into music, and Streetview, which allows you to experience public spaces by listening to the memories of strangers.
At a colloquium before the projects were unveiled, speakers said that art and science have intersected throughout history. The challenge now, they said, is to foster interdisciplinary creativity in education.
“There was a time in the past when art and science weren’t divided,” said Peter L. Galison, a professor of History of Science. “If you asked Da Vinci if his studies of turbulence were science or art he would have said, ‘You’re nuts!’ It made no sense to make that division then.”
Donald E. Ingber, the director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, recalled how a sculpture he saw in his art class led him to a realization about biological cells.
“The value of creativity lies in exercising your brain to get outside the perspective you’re trained in,” said Ingber.
According to Edwards, the Laboratory will focus on the Harvard campus during the first year by hosting work-in-progress exhibitions and monthly Idea Nights centered on student ideas. In the second and third year, the space will expand to the broader community by hosting events open to the public.
The Laboratory’s partners include the American Repertory Theater, the Wyss Institute, and the Harvard Initiative for Global Health.
Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, former dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and a member of The Laboratory’s Executive Committee, said he hopes the space will function as a “two-way street” that helps “translate ideas into action.”
“I applaud David’s efforts in making a robust experimental atmosphere that allows Harvard students to engage in innovative thinking and problem solving,” said current SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray in an e-mailed statement.
“The notion of what he calls ‘artscience’ is, of course, a metaphor for what engineers do—whether it is tackling global poverty and energy or re-imagining everyday activities like eating a bar of chocolate. Creativity has no borders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adorned in a full-length clerical robe with a Bible in hand, Reverend Robert J. Mark, a McDonald Fellow at Memorial Church, stood in front of the Massachusetts State Legislature two Sundays ago, and spoke to a motley crowd of similarly-attired reverends, climate activists, several Boston Mounted Police that gathered on the lawns of the Boston Common.
The event was the start  off a month-long campaign for climate change, in which affiliates of the Leadership Campaign—a group of student activists—aim to pressure Massachusetts politicians to adopt aggressive renewable energy legislation by camping-out in scattered tents on the Boston Common until the Copenhagen climate conference in December.
“We are taught all creation is sacred and holy,” Mark said, while speaking to the crowd and reading the Creation Psalm from the Book of Genesis. “We have to protect creation and be ‘stewards of God’s creation.’”
Mark had come to keynote the climate campaign, as part of a recent surge of interest among Harvard’s interfaith community in climate change and environmental issues.
Climate change has landed at the top  of many Harvard Christian chapters’ agendas, though the sects and individuals differ in how they frame the issue within Christian theology.
Other participants drawn to the rally for religious reasons included several Harvard-affiliated reverends, Harvard Divinity School students both current and former.
“The number of lives which will be lost and the disproportionate amount of life quality loss will be suffered by people in the more impoverished parts of the world,” said Nicholas C. Hayes ’08, who runs a religious environmental activist group at MIT. “This is a justice issue that we as a Church and we as a country and we as a species face.”
A CALL TO ACTION
Two weeks ago, a large crowd gathered in the Divinity School for similar reasons. Sallie McFague, a renowned feminist and Christian theologian, spoke about the application of Christian doctrine to ecological issues.
“Religion is into the business of forming the imagination and influencing the action of people,” she said. “It can make a significant contribution to the environmental problem.”
To Emma R. Crossen, a third-year in the Master of Divinity program at the HDS, this speech was particularly relevant. Crossen, who had breakfast with McFague earlier that day, is the coordinator of an Eco-Div group at HDS.
Although founded just over a year ago by a group of students focused on making the campus more sustainable Eco-Div is already very active.
She said that the club hosts speakers, coordinates student rallies, and has started a community garden at the Divinity School.
But for Crossen, eco-theology isn’t something new.
“In a way, our need for environmental theology is a statement of how disconnected we’ve become. It’s not a new discovery in theology,” she said. “This is integral to who we are. It’s just this culture has allowed us to forget about it.”
Michael J. Nilon, another third-year HDS student and an Eco-Div member, said that he foresees the eco-theology movement eventually evolving into something that could “potentially redefine the field of theology.”
After graduation. Crossen hopes to continue to bring an ecological perspective to bear on religious life. In addition to joining the month-long camp-out on the Common, Crossen has looked at potential future employers, such as Groundwork Somerville, an organization that strives to bring sustainable living to the community.
SETTING THE STAGE
One HDS student, Christopher J. Ashley, synthesized environmental and religious concerns in his own life after participating in the annual corn harvest in Kenya. For the fourth year in a row, the harvest was blighted with disease.
“Four straight years is not a famine. It’s climate change,” Ashley said.
Ashley’s experience emphasized the far-reaching and indiscriminate effects of environmental degradation, and underscored the importance of global solidarity in combating it.
“The effects of climate change are borne most of all by the most vulnerable people and Christians are called to stand with them in solidarity to protect them,” he said. “I’ve seen people starving and I have a stake in that.”
Ashley also participates in a weekly discussion at Christ Church Cambridge, led by Harvard Reverend Robert M. Tobin.
Tobin’s sermon two weeks ago tail-ended International Day of Climate Action, during which Christ Church rang their bells 350 times as part of a worldwide movement to draw political attention to climate change.
“We have to accept responsibility for not having done more in creating a culture where the natural world is respected,” said Tobin. “We have to repent.”
However, most of the sermon and the subsequent discussion was optimistic. It emphasized the unique ability Christians have to help overcome climate change.
“The language about belonging to something larger, voluntary relinquishment of privilege, and understanding resources and materials in terms of something other than the individual have long been there in the Christian faith,” Tobin said.
A GREENER RELIGION
Traditionally, Evangelical Christians have differed in their interpretation of the Creation Psalm, believing that instead of mandating human stewardship for the environment, Genesis grants human beings ‘dominion’ over it.
But, for one reverend of Harvard’s Memorial Church, Jonathan C. Page ’02, environmental theology isn’t as grounded in eco-stewardship as in morality.
“There’s a long-standing belief that human beings are meant to do whatever they want more or less [with the environment],” Page said. “But in the last fifteen years, there’s been a real change, and Christians have begun to see climate change as a moral issue.”
Page has worked at Harvard to mobilize religious people around climate change issues, including helping organize a Climate Convocation at Memorial Church early last month, which featured multi-faith advocacy for environmental causes and key-note speaker William E. McKibben ’82.
“It’s time for people who do believe in combating climate change to speak up about it,” Page said. “The stakes are very high...it’s an issue [of] death and destruction.”
For Bishop Roy F. “Bud” Cederholm, suffragan bishop of the Massachusetts Diocesis, climate change and environmental degradation is not only definitively linked to Christian theology, but is at its core. It is the “most serious ethical, moral, and justice issue that the church faces today” and should be at the forefront of churches’ agendas, he said.
Cederholm, the acclaimed ‘green’ bishop of Massachusetts, has been active in the past years in getting Anglican churches on board about climate change, encouraging churches to become more energy efficient and network with state-wide groups to pressure politicians to change public policy.
“Creation is a gift from god, it’s an absolute sin to destroy, abuse and harm it in the ways we’ve done,” Cederholm said. “I want my grandchildren to have an earth with the resources and beauty we have all been blessed with. We need to repent, repair, and renew the creation of the earth.”

The Mad Men trend hit two Harvard Square businesses this weekend. Sweet offered cupcakes with the Mad Men logo while playing 1960s music, and Noir at the Charles Hotel offered Draper’s Drink cocktails and Ritz cracker retro snacks to customers watching the season finale.
Sweet, a local cupcake shop that opened in Harvard Square last spring, made special cupcakes with cocktails on the icing.
“The owner is a big fan of Mad Men, and we thought the whole cupcakes and home-baked goods theme worked,” said Ali Clark, Sweet’s assistant manager. “The store has a modern retro twist like the show.”
The vibe at the event was low key, with small signs announcing the Mad Men theme by the counter, and no announcements outside. The store ordered only 12 specialty cupcakes for the promotion, and customers in general did not even know that what the theme was.
When asked whether the occasion had affected his decision to come to Sweet, customer Sheraz A. Choudhary replied, “The cupcakes are the same, so not really.”
At Noir, the production was much larger. By 9:30 p.m., the bar was full of people, many in costumes, all buzzing excitedly about the upcoming showing.
Noir’s event was the culmination of a weekly Mad Men night that has attracted between 5 and 30 people every time.
The commercial breaks featured trivia questions and a costume contest, and the drink menu included Sterling Cooper Cocktails, Betty’s Bubbles, and Madison Avenues.
The customers were noticeably excited by the theme.
“It’s one of my favorite theme nights around town, and Noir is an awesome bar,” said Leaura S. Levine, who won Noir’s Mad Men advertising contest.
As a prize for coming up with the best slogan—“Noir—Because The Best Ideas Happen At Night”—Levine had the opportunity to judge the costume contest.
Blogger Eleanor L. A. Howe has enjoyed the Mad Men nights at Noir so much that she has been chronicling them each week.
She selects one drink from the specialty menu to represent each episode.
“I thought, I don’t have cable and I’m coming here every week, why don’t I work my way through the list of cocktails?” she said.

All students, faculty, and staff who receive coverage from Harvard University Health Services will be able to receive the H1N1 flu vaccine by the end of November, according to Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59.
Rosenthal said that UHS has received a few hundred doses of the vaccine’s weekly shipments, and that another shipment is expected to arrive this week.
“We are very much hopeful that everyone will be able to receive the vaccine,” Rosenthal said. “Governor Patrick said that there should be enough.”
UHS originally ordered 15,000 doses of the vaccine, but it did not receive the original shipment when production was slowed nationwide due to issues with the vaccine’s preparation.
Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced last Friday that vaccines will be available statewide to anyone interested.
Since it received the first batch of vaccinations, UHS has been notifying those eligible for the H1N1 flu shot through e-mail.
In accordance with state public health guidelines, so far UHS has only vaccinated high-risk members of the Harvard community, including pregnant women and children ranging in age from six months to nine years old.
With the new shipment arriving, children under 18 years of age will now be able to receive the vaccine.
After that group has been immunized, the parents of children younger than six months and healthcare workers will be administered the vaccine next.
Once more shipments are received, the vaccine will be administered to individuals 10 to 24 years old with chronic health issues and then people 25 to 64 years old who also have previous health conditions, according to the UHS web-site.
Rosenthal said that UHS will continue to try to prevent the disease from spreading in the meantime.
“We’re making sure that we continue to isolate those who are ill until they are fever free for 24 hours,” he said.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, UHS recommends frequently washing one’s hands with soap or hand sanitizer, avoid coughing or sneezing into one’s hands, and avoid touching one’s eyes, nose and mouth.
“Those currently not able to receive the vaccine should keep up good hygiene and continue to check the HUHS web-site for updates,” Rosenthal said.
Some students did not express concern that they may not be able to receive the vaccine until the end of November.
“It’s not something I’m worried about right now because I feel like as long as I wash my hands and protect myself, I should be fine,” said Shwinn Ricci ’13.
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 9 news article "UHS To Provide H1N1 Vaccines" incorrectly stated the name of a student. The individual's name is Shwinn Ricci, not Ashwin Ricci.

On Friday afternoon, rather than courting a thesis advisor or working on research, Harvard graduate student Nathan Kaplan was watching himself on TV, reviewing his performance on ABC’s “Who Wants to be a Millionaire.”
“It was awesome,” said Nathan, who studies mathematics. “I’ve always wanted to be on a game show. I’ve always loved trivia and random facts.”
Kaplan finished the contest $25,000 richer. “As a starving grad student, it’s nice to earn what you make in a year in twenty minutes,” he said.
“But it will be like half that after taxes,” he added.
Math Professor Noam Elkies, who teaches Kaplan, said he was proud of his pupil but could not take any credit for his success. “He didn’t need my help,” said Elkies. “We looked at some chemistry charts, but he had his own training regiment.”
Elkies, who said he does not watch “Who Wants to be a Millionaire”— or any TV shows—said he was looking forward to viewing the episode that features Kaplan.
Kaplan said he did some strategic preparation for the show and used all of his lifelines. “
I knew one of the questions would be one where it was a disadvantage to be only 24 years old, so I called my father about a ‘Gone With the Wind’ quote,” he said. “He had no idea.”
Kaplan said he especially enjoyed talking with the host, Meredith Viera. “I did a little Google and Wikipedia stalking,” said Kaplan. “She definitely looks good for an older woman.”
According to Elkies, some of the graduate students are planning a viewing party of Kaplan’s episode.
“I would recommend anyone to audition,” said Kaplan, who added that he was open to competing in other game shows.
“It’s a great experience, and it isn’t a hard process,” said Kaplan.
Earlier this year, Kaplan found out about a “Millionaire” audition nearby, and decided to try his luck. Four weeks later, he found himself in the studio, and six weeks after that, his episode aired.
The question that stumped Kaplan was about the origin of a particular textile. “It’s from India,” he said, “but it doesn’t look Indian because it was Anglicized in a weird way,”
Kaplan has one question, however, that hasn’t been answered.
“I haven’t popped the [dissertation] adviser question yet,” said Kaplan.
“I go to the gym with [Noam Elkies], though,” he said. “That’s a great way to court an adviser. First work out with him, then work out with him mentally.”

Raucous applause welcomed Democratic Senate hopeful Alan A. Khazei ’83, into the Upper Common Room of Adams House yesterday afternoon. Amidst a throng of supporters, Khazei entered with a pump of his fists, and as the cheering subsided, made a barely audible comment: “This is awesome. I love this.”
Known for his work with nonprofit organizations such as City Year and Be the Change, Khazei recently announced his candidacy for the position of Senator in the state of Massachusetts, a position left vacant with the recent death of Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. Khazei was consequently endorsed by M. Maxwell T. Kennedy ’87, Edward’s nephew, and the two men made appearances at Harvard and Tufts University yesterday.
Kennedy said that the upcoming election is “absolutely, unquestionably, the most important election in this state in two decades.” Explaining his endorsement of Khazei, he said that he believes Khazei to be the only candidate who will fight for reform “without fear,” and is primed to bring new perspectives to Washington.
One concern spectators raised during the event was Khazei’s lack of political experience. Colin J. Motley ’10, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said, “people who hold state offices...have a step up” in this type of campaign.
During his speech, Khazei addressed issues ranging from his political motivations to the war in Afghanistan, while maintaining a repoire with his audience. When speaking of his grassroots campaign style, he jokingly implored students to “skip some classes” in order to volunteer for his campaign. Accompanied by laughter, he augmented his statement by advising students not to “tell your parents or professors.”
Witty comments aside, Khazei provided those in attendance with an extensive overview of his campaign platform, a platform that he has come to refer to as “Big Citizenship.” Khazei noted that “for too many people, the American dream has become a dream deferred,” and said that community service is the mechanism by which America could recreate itself as a land of opportunity.
At the conclusion of the event, Khazei answered questions posed by some students who were in attendance. After responding to four questions, an aide informed Khazei that he had time for one more question.
Two hands immediately shot into the air.
“We’ll take two more,” Khazei said.

After beating Dartmouth on Halloween, the Harvard women’s soccer team (9-6-1, 6-1 Ivy) knew they had the Ivy League Championship crown, and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, in the bag. But the Crimson wanted more.
Saturday’s 2-1 win against Columbia (7-7-3, 3-3-1 Ivy), the Crimson’s last match of the regular season, was far from a final formality, but rather redemption after sharing the Ancient Eight title last year.
“Because we’ve already clinched the Ivy League and the berth in the NCAA tournament, it would have been easy to come out soft, but it wasn’t like that at all,” said sophomore Melanie Baskind, who scored both of the Crimson’s goals. “It was a question of pride, winning the league outright instead of sharing with Yale.”
“We had that feeling last year obviously winning but also sharing the title which sucked,” senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann added. “There was big motivation going into this to prove that we did deserve to be outright champions.”
A championship game it definitely was. Excitement for an early Harvard win became a whole different emotion when, with 15 seconds left on the clock, Columbia’s Lauren Cook headed in a goal off of a free kick to send it into overtime.
“As soon as that [tying goal] happened, we thought ‘How do we respond to this? What can we do to get it back?’” Baskind said. “We were fired up, and there was no way we were going to go down without a fight after that goal.”
Harvard remained unfazed and with the last remaining seconds Crimson junior Katherine Sheeleigh took a shot that went wide. Five minutes into overtime, the missing goal arrived from Baskind, her fourth of the season.
“I was trying to ask some people after how that actually happened,” Baskind explained. “I know I got the ball from Sheeleigh, and it went in the right side of the goal, but it was all a blur.”
The Crimson’s first goal also came off the foot of Baskind, ten minutes into the first half as she took a pass from sophomore Hana Taiji and ricocheted it behind the hands of Lion goalkeeper Lindsay Danielson.
“Mel’s goal was sick,” Mann said. “It was an amazing goal, and I think the team did well to stick with it and carry it into the second half.”
The middle of the game was especially trying as Harvard and Columbia battled it out for the win.
“It was definitely an end-to-end kind of game; a very emotionally charged game for both teams, and both teams laid it out there,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “That last 20 minutes was unbelievable. Columbia was throwing everything at us and scored a great goal to tie the game up.”
“They kind of threw everything in,” Mann added. “We did really well to keep fighting and hold off the onslaught of attack.”
Despite the barrage, Harvard was impressed with its ability to stay relaxed and confident—helpful traits as the Crimson heads into the NCAA tournament.
“No one had any doubt that we weren’t going to win, it was just a matter of when we were going to score,” Mann said. “Obviously we wanted to score before time even ran out—Sheeleigh took a great chance—but as soon as we went into overtime we knew it was only a matter of time before we got one.”
For the Crimson, winning its ninth Ancient Eight title solidified its place as the premier team in the Ivy League, despite a rough pre-season where Harvard only won one game out of eight.
“I think the key for our team was that we never panicked and turned against each other,” Leone said.
“When it wasn’t going well for us, the not scoring goals the not winning, [we were] just sticking together and trying to improve every day with the big picture in mind. The big picture for us has always been the Ivy League.”
With the Ivy League championship trophy now in its locker room, Harvard looks forward to the NCAA tournament where experience from last year’s first round loss should help the Crimson improve.
“We experienced last year what it was like to be in the tournament,” Leone said. “You can’t buy it. There is nothing like the NCAA tournament, and now that we have this experience, hopefully we will be better this time around.”
Harvard will find out its seeding and first round opponent tonight at 8pm on ESPN.
“Just being consistent, working hard, taking it game-by-game,” Baskind said. “We know that we are a great team, we have the potential to do well in this tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—For the third-straight week, Harvard football came up against an easily-beatable Ivy opponent. And for the third straight week, the Crimson made it clear early who the best team on the field was.
Harvard (6-2, 5-0 Ivy) went down to New York on Saturday and scored on its first two possessions on its way to a 34-14 thrashing of Columbia (2-6, 1-4) at Robert K. Kraft Field.
“Our kids play as hard as anybody in the country,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “And that’s our forte more than anything else. We’ve been far from perfect on any unit, but we’re solid all the way around.”
Though Harvard played far from a perfect game, committing four turnovers and 11 penalties, the outcome of the game was never in doubt.
The Crimson received the opening kickoff and marched down the field, needing just 3:37 to get on the scoreboard.
A long series of rushes from juniors Gino Gordon and Collier Winters and freshman Treavor Scales brought the ball to the one-yard line, where Scales punched it in for a touchdown.
The Lions played a quick three-and-out on their first possession, but when the punt unit came on the field, the team ran into trouble.
Rookie punter Michael Williamson couldn’t corral the snap, and coughed up the ball. Harvard senior linebacker Nick Hasselberg fell on it at the Columbia 12, and it only took seven seconds for Winters to find freshman tight end Kyle Juszczyk in the endzone for another score.
“The snap may have been a bit high, but he’s still responsible to catch the snap and to kick the ball,” Lions coach Norries Wilson said. “And at that point I don’t think he played with enough urgency.”
Another Columbia first-quarter turnover—this time, an easy interception from senior Ryan Barnes—led to another Harvard touchdown.
Winters took to the air, with a 33-yard pass to sophomore Adam Chrissis—the highlight of the 79-yard drive. But once inside the 10, it was Gordon who brought the ball into the endzone nearly untouched.
“Gino is one of those guys you can always depend on,” Murphy said. “What you don’t get an appreciation for until you really spend some time around him is how tough he is, how resilient he is, what a great leader he is. He’s exactly what you need at running back.”
Senior Patrick Long’s extra point was good—part of a perfect afternoon for the kicker—and with two minutes still remaining in the first quarter, the Crimson was sitting on a 21-0 lead.
The next four drives ended in turnovers—two fumbles from the Lions, two interceptions for Winters—and it was not until the final drive of the half that Harvard was able to put another trio of points on the board.
A crucial pair of Columbia penalties totaling 20 free yards enabled the Crimson to drive into field goal position in just 1:07, and Long’s 28-yard field goal made the score 24-0 heading into the half.
Harvard would tack on another 10 points—seven on a three-yard Gordon run in the third, and three on a 29-yard Long field goal in the fourth—before allowing the Lions across midfield for the third time.
The strong defensive performance was once again sparked by senior linebacker Jon Takamura, who finished the day with six solo tackles, two sacks, and the interception that led to the Crimson’s second field goal.
But Harvard was quick to appreciate that it wasn’t facing the Lions’ best lineup. Columbia was without its top two quarterbacks, seniors M. A. Olawale and Shane Kelly, as well as its top running back, senior Ray Rangel.
“Columbia’s offense was really banged up,” Takamura said. “We saw on film what they were capable of, we just prepared for it and came out. [It’s] probably not our best game that we’ve played. We made a lot of mistakes, so we’ve got to correct those before going into next week.”
The Lions finally got on the scoreboard with 6:49 left to play in the game. Junior Marco Iannuzzi fumbled a punt return, giving Columbia the ball on the Crimson 12. Sophomore Jerry Bell, who took over for rookie Sean Brackett midway through the game, completed a nine-yard pass to senior Austin Knowlin—who became the all-time Lions leader in career receiving yards earlier in the game—before junior tailback Zack Kourouma found the endzone on a pair of quick rushes.
Harvard, giving many of its second-stringers playing time, had a quick three-and-out before Bell got back in the driver’s seat. The quarterback orchestrated a 79-yard drive and capped it with a 10-yard pass to junior Andrew Kennedy, the first touchdown pass of Bell’s career.
Though the Lions successfully executed an onsides kick, the Crimson defense stopped them short, with junior Anthony Spadafino picking Bell off to effectively end the game.
“[Columbia’s] extremely well-coached, and you have to earn everything,” Murphy said. “We just have a few more guns right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—Half an hour earlier, only the right upright had prevented freshman Brian Rogers from scoring a wondergoal in front of family and friends. The Bronxville, N.Y.-native fired a rocket with his left foot from 30 yards out in the 48th minute, only to see his shot cannon off the post—the second time in the game that the woodwork had kept him from giving the Harvard men’s soccer team the lead.
Twenty minutes after that, his misery was compounded, when Columbia took the lead courtesy of a looping header against the run of play. The goal put Rogers’ dream of an Ivy League title in serious doubt.
So when Rogers went back to his left foot to hammer the ball into the top left corner in the 79th minute, the striker went straight over to his bench and jumped on his coach, knowing full well that he had just revived the Crimson’s season.
From that moment on, it seemed only a matter of time before Harvard would grab the winner. Also inevitable was the fact that its superstar freshman would be involved.
In the fifth minute of overtime, co-captain Andre Akpan found Rogers behind the Columbia defense on the right side. Rogers beat the Lions’ keeper to the ball and passed it across to junior Alex Chi to finish, sending his entire team into a frenzied celebration.
With the 2-1 comeback win, the Crimson retains its position atop the Ivy League standings with one game to play.
“[Hitting the post] was frustrating, but …to be that close and not have it made me want it more,” Rogers said. “And then [when we went down, Akpan] turned around, and instead of everyone turning on each other, he got everyone to calm down, and then we kept playing our game.”
“Seasons are won and lost in the balance of these games,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “Guys didn’t split up or separate. We all worked together, and that was the best part.”
The frantic ending mirrored a fast start to a match with a late afternoon kickoff in New York. Harvard knew that it needed a win to keep control of its own destiny, and the Crimson came out firing. The first 12 minutes saw senior Desmond Mitchell shoot wide, Rogers hit the post for the first time, and senior Adam Rousmaniere force the Columbia goalie into a save.
In the 34th minute, a cross from the right found Chi, who directed the ball back across goal to Rogers. But the freshman got the ball stuck underneath his feet, and the Lions were able to clear. On the ensuing corner, senior defender Kwaku Nyamekye rose above the Columbia defenders, but his header sailed just over the bar.
Keeping Columbia’s star forward Bayo Adafin at bay for most of the match, Nyamekye continued to exhibit the characteristics that make him arguably the conference’s best defender and a legitimate professional prospect.
When Adafin got a shot off towards the end of the half, sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms was there to ensure that Harvard went into the break level with a double save in the 44th minute.
The Crimson started the second half in a similar fashion to how it had started the first. Two minutes into the period, Rogers blasted his shot against the bar with an attempt that was nearly the goal of the season.
Rousmaniere added a couple of shots on goal, and he nearly picked up an assist in the 59th minute when he crossed to Chi, who was darting across the middle. But some good defending from the Lions forced Chi to shoot wide.
“We were composed all the way up until the final piece, and then it fell away,” Clark said of Harvard’s many chances to open the scoring.
At times, the Crimson seemed like they would only be content walking the ball into the net, often choosing to make an extra pass over taking a shot.
Having been on the attack for most of the game, Harvard’s worst fears were realized when Columbia grabbed the lead in the 66th minute. A counterattack on the left found the head of Lions’ sophomore Mike Mazzullo. The ball was in the air for an eternity before looping over a backpedaling Harms.
The Crimson almost made an immediate response, when freshman Richard Smith went over with a header off a free kick from senior Brian Grimm.
But Harvard’s offense continued to pressure. With 11 minutes to play in regulation, Grimm played a tremendous through ball to Rogers, who once again managed to find space behind the Columbia backline. Rogers took the pass in stride on the left, and launched a powerful left-footed strike that made ripples in the Lions’ net and in the conference standings.
“It was a dream come true,” Rogers said. “I guess I was just up for this game.”
The brilliant play of Rogers continued into overtime, and four-and-a-half minutes into the sudden death period, he helped set up the game-winner.
“It’s magical,” said Akpan, who also picked up an assist on Chi’s goal. “After last season we were heartbroken, and we knew we needed an Ivy League title, or else we’d be totally distraught.”
The disappointment of last year came when the Crimson dropped a 1-0 contest to Penn in the final game of the season, handing the Quakers the league crown. A year later, Harvard finds itself in the same position—needing a win against Penn to clinch the title.
“We’ve got bitter, bitter memories from last year, and we remember it well,” Clark said.
“It’s everything, it’s the whole season,” Akpan said. “It’s revenge for last season, our last home game for the seniors, everyone’s going to be there, so you couldn’t ask for a better environment or a better reason to get up for a title game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having its best start to the season since 2005, the Harvard field hockey team (5-12, 2-5 Ivy League) couldn’t have found a more heart-breaking way to end the season.
After a comeback that fell just short in overtime in its home finale against New Hampshire, the Crimson traveled to New York City to face Columbia (9-8, 3-4) in its Ivy League and season finale. This time, Harvard yet again fell behind early and another comeback couldn’t stop the Crimson from ending its season with two consecutive overtime losses.
“Even though it was a loss, I thought it was a good game to end the season on,” freshman Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “We really went out there and fought our hardest and played a strong game.”
Following a trend Harvard has developed in the latter part of the season, the Crimson fell behind early to the Lions. A Columbia penalty corner shot was blocked, but the Lions’ Maggie O’Connor corralled the rebound and notched her first goal of the season to put Columbia ahead, 1-0, just three minutes into the contest.
Harvard’s defense kept Columbia in check for the rest of the half but failed to convert on several of its own opportunities.
“We came out slow, which has been a problem for us all year long, but I think it showed our character as a team that we were able to take them to overtime and end on a competitive note,” sophomore Allie Kimmel said.
The Crimson was applying pressure midway through the first half and received two penalty corners within twenty seconds during the 22nd minute of play. Harvard failed to cash those chances in, and the Lions followed with a quick timeout and some substitutions that iced the Crimson’s gaining momentum.
Following a clutch save by Tassopoulos, Harvard brought back the pressure late in the first half and earned a penalty corner with 19 seconds left in the first half.  Co-captain Kristin Bannon got the ball to sophomore Carly Dickson, but Dickson’s shot was blocked as time expired, preserving Columbia’s 1-0 lead heading into halftime.
After the Lions’ quick start to the first half, the Crimson would be sure to open the second half with one of its own.
Harvard gained a penalty corner less than two minutes into the second half, but sophomore Georgia McGillivray’s shot was blocked. But McGillivray would soon find redemption as another Crimson penalty corner seven seconds later saw passes from Bannon and Kimmel find McGillivray, who put the shot through to the back of the net to bring Harvard to 1-1.
Following another Dickson shot that was blocked by the Lions’ defense, Columbia would threaten with three consecutive penalty corners within a minute later in the second half, but two Tassopoulos saves preserved the tie for the Crimson.
With ten minutes left in the game, Columbia’s Julia Garrison was able to manage two quick shots on Harvard’s defense. After the first was blocked, Garrison took a pass off a penalty corner and got a clean look at goal, but her shot sailed wide.
Garrison got a green card late in regulation for pushing around some of the Harvard defenders, but she would manage another shot with just over a minute left in regulation. The Crimson weren’t willing to give in so soon, and another Tassopoulos save, her seventh of the game, sent the match into overtime.
The Crimson got the first shot in overtime, but Kimmel’s attempt at the 73:16 mark sailed wide of the goal. After several minutes of fighting for possession, Columbia was awarded a penalty corner, and a pair of passes from the top found its way to the Lions’ Julia Garrison. Garrison made up for her earlier miscues and shot it past Tassopoulos at the 75:02 mark to secure the Lions victory, 2-1.
“We spent a lot of time earlier in the season learning our game strategy as a young team,” Tassopoulos said. “I think over the offseason we will work on individual skills and strength and some of the little things that will turn those closer games into wins next season.”
Both squads entered the game tied in the Ivy League standings, but Harvard finishes the season tied with Penn for sixth in the League while Columbia finishes fifth.
“We have a really young team, and a lot of us were thrown into Division I play really quickly,” Kimmel said. “I’m really excited [in the offseason] to build on our experiences this season, grow as a team, and continue to have the upperclassmen step up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just five games into the season and with a split conference record, Harvard women’s hockey has already reached a historic achievement. The No. 10 Crimson (2-2-0, 2-2-0 ECAC) secured the program’s 500th win against No. 7 St. Lawrence (4-4-3, 2-3-0 ECAC) in a 3-0 decision Saturday afternoon at Bright Hockey Center.
“It’s awesome, there’s been a great tradition in this program from the very beginning,” coach Katey Stone said of reaching the 500 mark. “We’ve got to get after it, and see if we can get to 600 pretty quickly, before I retire. That’d be nice.”
The Harvard program’s storied history is something Stone has become a key part of in her 16 years at the helm. In that time, Stone has become the Division I women’s coach ranked second all-time and first among active coaches in total wins.
This weekend’s milestone victory came after two straight losses in conference play that had hampered team morale, especially Friday’s 2-1 loss to Clarkson.
“Our players know they could have won the game [Friday],” said Stone, “and this just solidifies that.”
Junior forward Ashley Wheeler agreed that the team had made huge improvements over recent play.
“Overall I think we’re a completely different team, especially from last weekend,” Wheeler said. “Tonight was definitely a team effort. We have a really young team, and everyone stepped up.”
The rebound win came in a shutout defined by team play, strong defense, and personal versatility. Junior forward Kate Buesser led the Crimson with two goals and an assist, while Wheeler scored one of her own. Senior keeper Christina Kessler kept Harvard’s net empty with 14 saves.
In the first period, both the Crimson and the Saints went scoreless despite power play opportunities, but Harvard dominated possession, staying in St. Lawrence territory for the majority of the time. The Crimson had a few fast break opportunities, including one by junior forward Katherine Chute, who fired a slap shot heading towards goal but Saints defenseman Britni Smith slid in to get the block. Harvard also edged out St. Lawrence in shots and faceoffs during the period but it wasn’t enough to pick up a lead.
The Crimson continued to play hard in the second period, and this time it saw results. Following a successful penalty kill, Harvard took control of the puck and co-captain defenseman Cori Bassett moved it towards the opponent’s goal. She made a quick drop to Buesser who fired on goal.
“I’m pretty sure I hit the goalie right in the chest,” Buesser said, “which is usually not a great area for rebounds, but it somehow popped out.”
Wheeler was in perfect position on the opposite side of the net to capitalize on the rebound, and she slammed it home for her first goal of her college career.
“It was unbelievable,” Wheeler said. “I’ve never honestly felt anything like that. And having my roommate, basically my best friend on the team, Kate Buesser, get the assist was so cool.”
The goal was even more impressive considering Wheeler has been a defenseman for the Crimson until Friday night’s game. The transition, in place due to of Harvard’s relatively short bench, proved to be a success against the Saints.
“She has very good instincts, so she can play anywhere,” Stone said of the new forward. “She did a great job and it was awesome to see her get that goal.”
Wheeler is also fond of her new position on the team.
“It’s like seeing the ice in a completely different way. It’s so much more of a rush than on D” she said. “As a forward, honestly I don’t really know how to play the position all that well, but it’s more about just going as hard as you can.”
The Crimson continued the powerful offensive play and kept the puck on St. Lawrence’s side of the ice for over three minutes following the goal. In the final minute of the period the Saints got a good look at the goal, but the shot bounced of Harvard’s side post to preserve the 1-0 score.
In the final frame, the speed of play picked up and the Crimson and the Saints made it a more back-and-forth game. But Harvard still held the lead and seven minutes into the period the Crimson struck again. Sophomore forward Alisa Baumgartner made a pass to Buesser who put it past St. Lawrence’s goalie Maxie Weisz and into the top right corner of the goal to make it a 2-0 game.
With five minutes left to play, the Crimson found itself in risky territory. After a pair of penalties, Harvard was facing a dangerous powerplay opportunity for its opponent, and the Saints even pulled the goalie to make it a 6-on-3 situation. But the Crimson defense held strong and stopped St. Lawrence from getting even a single shot during the penalty kill.
The good defense paid off and when the puck popped out into open space, Buesser was there to take it in for an open-net goal with just 30 seconds left on the clock to finalize the 3-0 victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being the underdog is a position Harvard women’s hockey isn’t terribly familiar with. But when No. 2 Clarkson (10-1-1, 4-0-0) came to Bright Hockey Center on Friday night, that’s what the No. 10 Crimson was.
Harvard stuck with the Golden Knights, scoring first, but couldn’t hold on as Clarkson rallied to hand the Crimson a 2-1 defeat in its home opener.
“I thought it was a hard-fought game,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played hard, we just hurt ourselves in situations.”
It was a third-period powerplay goal from Golden Knight assistant captain Carlee Eusepi that proved the difference. Senior forward Dominique Thibault, a recent transfer from Connecticut, won a faceoff in the Harvard zone and passed the puck to Eusepi, who launched a high slapshot through a screen that found the top left corner of the net.
“That second goal, we weren’t ready,” Stone said. “They were on their toes on that faceoff. They dominated that faceoff, the play after that.”
But the Crimson didn’t back down—a theme throughout the night, as Harvard kept pace with the more-seasoned Golden Knights.
It took both teams a period to find their footing, with each squad generating only six shots in the first frame.
The Crimson had its best opportunity midway through the frame, when consecutive checking penalties on Clarkson’s Gabrielle Kosziwka and Courtney Olson gave it more than three straight minutes of power play. But Harvard failed to create chances in front of the net, relying on long shots that couldn’t find their way through traffic.
“We played their style of game, definitely, for the first period,” senior goaltender Christina Kessler said.
The Golden Knights nearly got on the board just minutes into the second frame, when rookie Danielle Skirrow skated around the back of the net and flipped the puck inside the right post. But the referees declined the goal, as the net had come off its moorings.
With six minutes gone in the second, Harvard’s third line capitalized on a chance in transition.
Senior Randi Griffin found freshman Kaitlin Spurling streaking up the left side, and the rookie went top-shelf from long range for her first collegiate goal.
“It was pretty cool,” Spurling said. “I’ve always dreamed about playing college hockey, so getting my first goal was a pretty big deal.”
Spurling is tied for first on the team in points, with four through four games.
“She’s getting better every weekend, and stronger—understanding how to use her body to her advantage,” Stone said. “She’s got a good shot—I mean, she ripped that…She was one of those kids on the ice at the end of the game. That’s what you want.”
Clarkson leveled the score less than seven minutes later.
Thibault, who is leading her new team in points, took a pass from sophomore Juana Baribeau and put a shot on net. Kessler made the initial save, but despite her acrobatic attempt at a split save, Thibault’s rebound lit the lamp.
Tied 1-1 to begin the third frame, junior Kate Buesser was whistled for cross-checking just 2:30 into the period, giving the Golden Knights the power play that led to Eusepi’s game-winning goal.
“We had some costly penalties, and we just talked about the fact that we’re not a young team,” Stone said. “As soon as everybody in the locker room recognizes that and starts playing like they’re capable of playing, then we’re going to be in good shape.”
For the last 17:12 of the game, Harvard dominated play, outshooting Clarkson 12-5 in the third.
The Golden Knights were called for too many men on the ice with four minutes to play, and the Crimson generated a number of shots on net—including a long shot from co-captain Cori Bassett that hit the pipe before skirting wide—but couldn’t capitalize.
And with 45 seconds to play, Harvard made the move to pull Kessler off the ice in favor of an extra skater. But the sixth skater hit the ice before Kessler was off, and the Crimson had to finish the game on the penalty kill.
“We definitely dominated the third and we got our chances, but unfortunately the bounces didn’t go our way today,” Kessler said. “It’s always tough losing the home opener, but I think we definitely learned a lot from this game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two games, same story.
Although the Harvard men’s hockey team (1-2, 1-2 ECAC, 1-1 Ivy) took a 3-1 lead in the first two periods against the Big Red (3-0, 3-0 ECAC, 2-0 Ivy), the Crimson yielded four goals in the final frame, ultimately succumbing to long-time rivals No. 5 Cornell, 6-3. Saturday’s defeat at Lynah Rink was Harvard’s second loss of the weekend in which the team held an early advantage.
“We didn’t play 60 minutes—we played 40,” captain Alex Biega said. “That’s the difference between us winning and losing. But I’d rather learn these lessons now than have it happen later on down the road.”
Although the Crimson led 3-2 upon entering the third period, Cornell slammed in three goals in the first ten minutes of the final frame, pulling ahead of the Crimson, 5-3. The Big Red’s Joe Devin struck twice, putting the puck past Crimson netminder Ryan Carroll at 2:27 and 5:59 into the period.
Forward Blake Gallagher followed up with a powerplay goal minutes later, and Cornell newcomer Greg Miller sealed the deal with the Big Red’s final goal of the night with 6:31 left in the game.
The Crimson tried to rally in the remainder of the period when Cornell’s Sean Collins was sent to the box for boarding. But Harvard failed to convert on the power play, handing a 6-3 victory to the Ithaca squad as time ran out.
“I’d attribute [the defensive breakdown in the final frame] to it being early in the year,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “Playing team defense is a kind of a problem you have early on...I thought we played them well, but we’ve got to tighten up our third period.”
Carroll, who replaced junior Kyle Richter in net after Friday’s 5-4 loss to Colgate, notched 24 saves in his season debut against the Big Red.
“Both goalies played great [this weekend],” Biega said. “It was unfortunate the way things turned out with the result, but it wasn’t like they gave up bad goals or had bad games. They were very sharp and focused for us, and made some key stops at different points in the game.”
While the Crimson lost focus in the last period, Harvard’s rookies generated some solid offense at the beginning of the game. Freshman Louis Leblanc, who launched a team-leading five shots, slammed in his second goal of the year off of a pass from junior Michael Biega, putting the Crimson on the board with 5:30 left in the opening frame. The Big Red tied it up at the beginning of the second, but Harvard regained the lead only 74 seconds later, as sophomore Ryan Grimshaw launched a pass to freshman Conor Morrison, who put the puck behind Cornell netminder Ben Scrivens for a 2-1 Crimson lead. The goal was Morrison’s first this season.
Halfway through the second period, freshman Alex Fallstrom followed up on an assist from Rogers to boost Harvard’s lead to 3-1. And while none of rookie Marshall Everson’s attempts made it in, the Minnesotan freshman tallied two shots against Scrivens.
“I think [the freshmen] showed that they have the ability to score goals for us,” Rogers said. “All have the ability to play at a high speed and they’re smart players.”
“We brought in a tremendous class in the freshmen,” Alex Biega said, “who’ve been immediate impact players for us and add a valuable aspect of the team up front.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Skating off the ice Friday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team must have been in disbelief. The Crimson had built a 4-1 lead over Colgate through two periods and looked poised for an easy win. But in the final frame, the Raiders surged back and Harvard watched its advantage quickly disintegrate. Colgate (4-2-3, 2-0) notched four goals in the third period to capture a 5-4 victory.
“I think we got away from our gameplan and were a little too satisfied being up 4-1,” captain Alex Biega said.
“For lack of a better term, we had a little downfall,” he added.
At the start of the contest, Harvard was decidedly in control. Seven minutes into the first period, junior defenseman Chris Huxley netted a power play goal off assists from sophomores Ryan Grimshaw and Alex Killorn. Five minutes later, Killorn scored one himself, and two minutes after that, sophomore Eric Kroshus made the score 3-0 when he snuck the puck past Raider goaltender Alex Evin. Evin was pulled in favor of a new goalie, Charlie Long, immediately following the third goal. By the end of the first period, Harvard had built a sizeable lead and looked to be firing on all cylinders.
“I think, offensively, we moved the puck really well,” senior Doug Rogers said. “We’re very effective when we transition fast. Our combination of speed and puck movement has really caught teams off guard and led to goals.”
In the second period, Colgate inched back into the game with an even-strength goal midway through the frame. But Harvard freshman Marshall Everson responded with a power play lamp lighter just a minute later to reclaim the three-score lead. The goal was assisted by freshmen Alex Fallstrom and Louis Leblanc, who had two assists on the night. The freshman class, which has accounted for six of the Crimson’s 12 goals this season, has added some much needed fire to the Harvard attack.
“Years past we’ve only had one to two scoring lines,” Biega said. “This year we only lost three forwards up front and we brought in a tremendous class in the freshmen, who’ve been immediate impact players for us and add a valuable aspect of the team up front.”
Up 4-1 going into the third period, it looked as if Harvard was on its way to an easy victory. But Colgate had other plans.
The Raiders beat Crimson senior goaltender Kyle Richter 30 seconds into the frame to close the gap to two. Then Raider forward Austin Smith brought his team even closer with a goal at the 10-minute mark. Just two minutes later, Smith tallied another, tying up the game at four. With four minutes remaining, Colgate freshman Robbie Bourdon broke the deadlock, giving the Raiders a 5-4 edge. A late-game Crimson power play and other attempts on goal were unsuccessful.
The loss was Harvard’s first of the season, and ought to be a memorable one.
“We need to learn a little how to play with the lead,” Rogers said. “And I think that will come with experience. I think we had some defensive breakdowns, but I think you can expect that at the beginning of the year.”
The Crimson’s porous defense overshadowed some dynamic play from its offense.
“I think we showed that we have a very explosive offense,” Rogers said of the first period surge. “We scored goals in patches.”
The Crimson also took advantage of its power plays, scoring two times on four opportunities. The penalty kill was effective, as Harvard limited the Raiders to just one goal on seven attempts. Overall, Colgate outshot the Crimson, 40-29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—If there has been a theme in the Ivy League this year, it has been that perseverance triumphs over talent. With projected stars such as M.A Olawale and Jordan Culbreath sidelined by injuries, Ancient Eight contests have been decided in hard-nosed fashion—by gutting it out in the trenches.
And this year, no one has battled more fiercely than Harvard.
“We’ve been a very resilient team,” said Crimson coach Tim Murphy after Saturday’s win at Columbia. “We didn’t necessarily finish pretty [today], but the number one thing we do best is play extremely hard.”
This physical toughness has translated to domination on both sides of the line of scrimmage—a spectacle made clear with each gaping hole or run-stuffing blitz.
Harvard had established its running game entering Saturday’s contest, with junior Gino Gordon scampering for over 100 yards against Dartmouth, and the trip to New York proved no different. The Crimson offensive linemen punished their counterparts on the Lions’ defensive front, using pull-blocks to open huge lanes for Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales. The duo finished the day with 99 net yards on the ground and three touchdowns.
“My success goes to the play of the offensive linemen and the downfield blocking by the wide receivers,” Gordon said. “Treavor’s and [my] touchdowns are usually more happenstance and good execution than our skills. We just run to the holes.”
Gordon’s humble interpretation aside, the fact remains that the Crimson offensive front is simply mauling its opponents to create that space.
Murphy, who has coached more than a few solid linemen in his 16-year career with Harvard, added his own praise to the stalwart group of seniors—James Williams, Ben Sessions, Alex Spisak, and John Paris.
“I think there’s something to be said that we’ve got one of the best offensive lines we’ve ever had in our time here,” Murphy said. “When you’re playing with four seniors—and those kids, a lot of them have been three-year starters—that [sort of dominance] is the result.”
But if the offense is pushing around Ivy opponents, the defense has made its own statement on the other side of the ball. Despite injuries to multiple defensive ends, the front seven has shown that it can be dominant by relying on a number of different playmakers. Most notably, Murphy credited another group of seniors—Jon Takamura, Nick Hasselberg, and Sean Hayes—for their stellar effort.
“Really the core of [our defense] has been, just like the senior offensive linemen, the senior linebackers,” Murphy said. “It’s just been a very tough...group with great leadership skills. They’ve been the glue.”
This unit has helped stabilize a constantly shifting defensive front and turn it into a formidable wall against the ground attack. Takamura notched six solo tackles Saturday to lead the swarming pack of linebackers, who frequently shot gaps and created pressure to stop rushing attempts in their tracks. The Crimson literally forced Columbia backwards, holding the Lions to -18 net yards on the ground, and running back Leon Ivery posted a meager 1.3 yards per attempt in place of injured starter Ray Rangel.
Although Columbia did manage to outgain Harvard through the air, the pass rush also forced Lions’ quarterbacks Sean Brackett and Jerry Bell into three interceptions, while Hasselberg and Hayes each recovered a fumble.
But despite these consistently strong efforts at the line of scrimmage, the Crimson will need to continue its dominance if it hopes to claim a third-consecutive Ivy crown. The highly-touted offensive line faces the top rushing and passing defense in the league next week against Penn, and the defense draws a similar challenge against the Quakers’ second-ranked rushing offense. Game plans, gimmicks, and all the hype surrounding the de facto Ivy championship game may garner much of the attention this coming week, but, as has been the case all season, the battle will be won or lost in the trenches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—As The Crimson indicated in Friday’s Around the Ivies column, Harvard football couldn’t rest on its laurels Saturday against Columbia. In the early weeks of the season, the Lions embarrassed their opponents and positioned themselves in the Ancient Eight’s upper echelon. This weekend, the Crimson answered the call.
“You think they can become a little emotionally fragile, so you’d love to get off to a good start and jump on them,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We got some breaks…and were in a good position in the first half.”
For the Crimson, the ability to strike early bodes well, as it takes on the league-leading defense in Penn next weekend.
For Columbia, it exposed the problems plaguing a program beleaguered by injuries.
“I thought that we played about 45 minutes of football. I didn’t think we played very well at all the first 15 minutes of the game,” Lions coach Norries Wilson said. “We are still unfortunately growing into that and haven’t learned enough from our mistakes of turning the football over and not tackling well and understanding that although it’s a team sport, as an individual you have to take care of your responsibility, because you’re responsible to the other ten guys on the field at the time and the remaining of the team that’s on the sideline.”
In those first 15 minutes, Harvard ran all over the Lions to the tune of 146 total offensive yards and 21 points, while shutting out the Columbia offense.
AIRING OUT
Saturday’s contest featured two of the top wide receivers in the league: the Lions’ Austin Knowlin and the Crimson’s Matt Luft.
Both have inspiring career numbers. With his 64 yards on Saturday, Knowlin set a new Columbia record for career receiving yardage—previously held by Bill Reggio ’84—of 2,417 yards.
Though his totals on Saturday were relatively tame, Knowlin was far from willing to attribute that to tight coverage from the Harvard secondary.
“I didn’t think they were any different from any other secondary that we’ve seen all year, to be honest,” Knowlin said. “Sizing them up, we watched film on them all week and we weren’t really that impressed. We’ve seen better secondaries from Harvard.”
For his part, Luft made his first reception since the Princeton game two weeks ago. He’s only managed 148 yards this season, partly because the opposition generally tends to double cover him and partly because he runs the deep route in an offense geared towards short passes.
The Lions put man coverage on Luft, and Crimson junior quarterback Collier Winters exploited that. The two connected on two passes for 40 yards.
“Anytime you can get Matt one-on-one or try and get him the ball, we try to,” Winters said. “This week we had some situations where the corner played man-on-man, so we had some playcalls where we tried to get the ball to Matt. I have all the confidence in him, and you know these last two games, I’m sure he’ll be a big part of the offense.”
JUMPING THE GUN
As well as Harvard played Saturday, the one aspect that needs to be fixed heading into the final two weeks is penalties.
The Crimson got flagged four times for false starts, twice for illegal procedure, and three times for offsides—one of which got declined.
All told, Harvard accrued 11 penalties for 78 yards.
“I’m still looking for that game where I come into this media conference and say, ‘We really played a perfect game,’” Murphy said. “We’re solid on special teams, not perfect, very solid on defense, and pretty solid on offense. If you do those things and try to eliminate mistakes, we feel like we have a chance against anybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Malkin Athletic Center was an eventful place this weekend.
During the two Harvard women’s volleyball games, a record was broken, one contest required overtime, another ended in a shutout, and a German accordion player performed the American national anthem on Saturday night.
For the crowd of almost 400 that gathered in the Malkin Athletic Center, both the American flag and the team’s veterans, in their last home game ever, provided reason to be proud on Senior Night.
Fittingly, Harvard’s (11-12, 7-5 Ivy) four four-year veterans contributed noteworthy performances against the Bears in a dominant 3-0 victory that came less than 24 hours after a 3-2 overtime loss to Yale.
Co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn and her fellow seniors Katherine Kocurek, Lily Durwood, and Alissa Flescher all made a mark in their final game at the MAC, contributing five kills, four aces, 30 assists, and six more kills, respectively, on Saturday.
Kocurek also made noise the night before, becoming Harvard’s all-time leader in digs.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 0
Brown (5-17, 1-10), the bottom feeder of the Ivy League, appeared to have the Crimson’s number at the start of the contest on Saturday.
Harvard stumbled to a 3-0 deficit out of the gate due to some jitters on defense in the back row.
Shifting back into gear, powerful kills from sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll and junior Mikaelle Comrie put the Crimson within striking distance of the lead at 8-7.
Brown held on to its slim advantage until Comrie blasted one through the block en route to tying the score at 18. Harvard took a late lead at 21-19 off of Brown attack errors and held on to grab a 25-22 victory.
After the previous night’s intense matchup with Yale, Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss was impressed to see her team maintain a strong tempo.
“To come in [Saturday] and be able to keep it up was wonderful,” Weiss said. ‘The seniors did great.  All four of them had a wonderful career.”
Two seniors in particular showed off their veteran wiles in the second set. At 4-4, Durwood put the Crimson up 5-4 with a trick shot.
Later, Kocurek made a key one-handed dig to help boost Harvard’s 5-0 advantage at 19-14. Back-to-back aces from Kocurek put the crowd on its feet and closed out the second frame for the Crimson, 25-14.
Harvard received strong support from the bleachers all night, where a crowd of boisterous fans had gathered to celebrate senior night.
“The crowd amps us up,” Ono Horn said. “We always play well under pressure.”
Kocurek continued to baffle the Bears defense with her serving entering the third, contributing another ace during the early rounds of the frame.
Brown had trouble returning the serve all night, allowing Harvard to rack up 10 aces.
“We served aggressively [on Friday], and we continued to [Saturday],” Weiss said.
The Crimson maintained a healthy lead throughout the final frame in part thanks to the duo of Durwood and Ingersoll—the pair generated five kills off of just as many assists.
Providing an appropriate finish to the night, Flescher closed out the shutout 25-17 on a strike from the right that ricocheted off a Brown defender.
“You have to focus that much harder on the simple things, and they did a nice job,” Weiss said.
YALE 3, HARVARD 2
Two hours and two minutes of volleyball were decided by one point Friday night.
In a fifth-set overtime situation that seemed to be stretching into the length of a normal set, Yale’s Cat Dailey lined up and drove in a final kill to end the frame, 19-17, and give the Bulldogs (18-4, 8-3) a 3-2 victory.
Dailey’s kill—her third in overtime and 21st of the night—ended a long struggle in which Harvard nearly pulled off the upset of the second-ranked team in the Ancient Eight.
Four Crimson players, led by Comrie, hit for double-digit kills.
But Harvard’s defense was probably the most important factor that allowed the Crimson to keep pace with Yale.
Although Dailey and Yale’s Alexis Crusey both hit for more than 20 kills, Harvard’s block rejected plenty more. Relative to the Bulldog’s eight blocks, Harvard posted 15 blocks–nine of which came from Ingersoll.
“Some losses are better than some wins,” Ono Horn said. “That was a good loss.”
The Crimson wraps up Ivy League play next weekend with a two-game set against the “Killer P’s” tandem of Penn and Princeton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson knew it would have to leave everything in the pool at the Northern Division Championships. The squad did just that, but it was MIT that got the last laugh. The Engineers prevented Harvard water polo from advancing in the postseason for the second straight year.
The Crimson (7-17, 3-3 CWPA Northern Division) hosted the divisional championships at Blodgett Pool this weekend and needed a top-four finish to advance to the Eastern Conference Championships. Unfortunately for Harvard, a 7-5 opening round loss eliminated this possibility. After falling to MIT, the Crimson rallied for two victories and a fifth-place finish—but found itself once again on the outside looking in.
“It’s disappointing not to qualify for Easterns,” co-captain Egen Atkinson said. “There’s no way to sugarcoat it, the season’s over, and it definitely stings.”
Harvard did notch two solid performances after elimination, topping Connecticut College, 20-6, and Queens, 15-8.
“We just had the mentality, ‘Look these are our last two games, let’s play our hearts out,’ and I think we did that,” junior Jeff Lee said. “For the seniors, these were their last collegiate games, and we felt like we needed to send them off on a good note.”
Indeed, for the four seniors—Atkinson, Dan Furman, Nikhil Balaraman, and Thomas Bailey—the championships marked a bittersweet ending, but Atkinson asserted that the squad has begun moving in the right direction.
“It’s disappointing to end this way, but I can only hope that my legacy and the legacy of the seniors continues in other ways,” he said. “My consolation is that I do believe the program is better in some ways now as I leave than it was when I came in.”
HARVARD 15, QUEENS 8
In the Crimson’s final contest of the season, Harvard steamrolled to a win against the Knights (3-13, 1-6) on Sunday morning. Junior co-captain Bret Voith netted a game-high four goals, and also stepped up on the defensive end with five steals. A number of Crimson competitors chipped in to support Voith’s effort, including rookie Max Eliot and Lee, with a hat trick and pair of goals, respectively.
Balaraman posted eight saves in his final collegiate game, but Harvard rarely found itself threatened. With goals from six different players, including Furman, the Crimson built an early lead and never looked back. Although Queens kept the score to 10-7 through three quarters, Harvard exploded in the final frame for a 5-1 edge to put the game out of reach.
HARVARD 20, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 6
Junior Alex Thompson enjoyed another outstanding performance for the Crimson, netting six of his seven weekend goals against the Camels. Despite returning to the pool Saturday afternoon following the devastating defeat at the hands of MIT, Harvard roared out of the gate against Connecticut College (3-16) and exacted a measure of retribution through its dominant performance.
“It’s always difficult to play after a loss, especially a season-ending loss, but these guys have a lot of pride,” Crimson coach Erik Farrar said. “It was our home pool, and we’re Harvard water polo.”
The Crimson rode an early 6-1 cushion for the remainder of the contest, relying on a hat trick from Lee and junior Veselin Kulev’s first two career collegiate goals to put the Camels away. Junior John Kolb, sophomores Luka Babic, Kevin DiSilvestro, Evan Zepfel, and freshman Antone Martinho also notched scores in the lopsided contest.
MIT 7, HARVARD 5
The Crimson opened the weekend with high hopes for its Saturday morning matchup with the fifth-seeded Engineers, but left the pool dissatisfied. Despite having defeated MIT, 9-6, on Sept. 16th, Harvard faced a much more prepared squad than it did two months ago.
In atypical fashion, the pivotal contest evolved into a defensive struggle, with MIT (8-14, 3-3) taking only a 3-1 edge into the locker room at halftime.
“Both defenses clamped down, and everybody was in championship mode,” Farrar said.
Yet, after back-and-forth exchanges, it was the Engineers that broke through more often, riding their two-goal lead to a 7-5 victory. Although Atkinson could not pinpoint specific differences between the playoff contest and the regular season meeting between the squads, he credited MIT for peaking at the right time.
“I honestly felt that we played and fought harder in this second game [against the Engineers], but hats off to them for bringing it,” he said. “The truth is, they improved more over the season than we did.”
While all Crimson players and coaches expressed disappointment over the loss, the squad signaled its future potential as a slew of young players contributed offensively. Eliot scored twice, while DiSilvestro, Babic, and fellow sophomore Mike Katzer each added a tally. With a number of strong returning players, Harvard will look to build on the work of its graduating class and overcome some of the challenges of the 2009 season.
“We faced a lot of adversity this season ,and I feel that we got a lot tougher,” Lee said. “Things didn’t turn out [this season], but I feel like next year these experiences, and what the seniors have helped us to achieve, will really come in handy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson women’s tennis team hosted the Harvard Invitational this weekend, while sophomore Holly Cao traveled to New Haven to play in the ITA National Indoor Championships.
Cao, who qualified for the national tournament after winning the ITA Northeast Regional two weeks ago, faced off against some of the nation’s top competition. In the first round, Cao challenged Marina Cossou of California, but fell 7-5, 6-4. The sophomore was impressive in her consolation match, but ultimately lost, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5, to Nadine Fahoum of Old Dominion.
“I felt like I could have come away with the win for both of my matches,” Cao said. “They were tough both mentally and physically.”
“I play a very aggressive game,” she added. “Both the girls are just very consistent, strong mentally. There were a couple crucial games where I loosened up, and that’s where I lost the matches.”
Though her fall season ends in two losses, Cao has been one of the most impressive Crimson players this semester. Winning the regional tournament to advance to nationals was itself a major accomplishment.
“Holly lost tough matches to top-ranked players,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Holly played very solid tennis. She had a great fall, and I’m very excited to see her out there on the court in the spring.”
While Cao competed by herself, the rest of the team remained in Cambridge for the Harvard Invitational, the final fall tournament of the year.
In the Singles 1 draw, sophomore Sam Gridley lost her first match, but won three times in the consolation draw. She topped off her weekend with a 4-6, 6-3, 10-4 victory over Jenny Lee of Brown.
Also in the Singles 1 draw, freshman Alexandra Lehman went 2-1 on the weekend, playing three sets in each match. In the Singles 2 draw, sophomore Caroline Davis went 0-2, and junior Agnes Sibilski went 1-1.
In the Singles 3 draw, sophomore Louise Laciny finished with a 2-1 record. She beat Leah Seyburn of Cornell, 6-3, 6-0, and Sloane Mathis of LSU, 6-2, 7-6.
“People are a little bit banged up and tired from the semester,” Green said of the squad. “But our team really showed a lot of good things out there.”
In the Doubles A draw, Lehman and freshman Hideko Tachibana paired up and won two of their three matches.
“Their doubles performances really impressed me the most,” Green said. “Just because of a matter of improvement from their first matches this fall to the last match this fall.”
Tachibana and Lehman beat a team from Brown, 9-7, and a team from Cornell, 8-1. The two fell, 8-6, to a tandem from LSU.
“I think everybody on the team has really improved both in singles and doubles play, and that made a huge difference in the last few tournaments,” Cao said. “I feel like our doubles has improved a lot.”
In other doubles action, the team of Sibilski and Davis went 0-3 and the pair of Laciny and Gridley went 2-1.
“Our biggest accomplishment this semester, I believe, was our doubles,” Green said. “Everyone mixed up their partners, however, I think we improved our doubles formations and overall aggressiveness. They were afraid of the ball early in the semester. Now they’re hitting Pete Sampras overheads.”
With the conclusion of the Harvard Invitational comes the conclusion of the fall season. The Crimson will begin non-conference play in January and will start the Ivy League schedule in April.
“Although the Ivy season is far away, our team has taken small steps to prepare for the grueling weeks in April,” Green said. “The biggest obstacle—we have a young team. We’re still in search of people to step up.”

Is it true? Can you really get hot breakfast as part of your meal plan again (without going to Annenberg)? Why, yes! But is there a catch? Of course. Get the details after the jump.
This week, Quincy Grille is offering a trial run of its hot breakfast menu. On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., you can once again start your day with eggs, bacon, and all those other warm breakfast goodies that you’ve been missing. If enough people show interest, this may soon become a permanent fixture at the Grille.
But here’s the best part: starting on Monday, the Grille will now accept Board Plus! (Question for Pfoho Grille—will you soon be following suit?) So if you haven’t already squandered your Board Plus at Greenhouse or Lamont Café, and you happen to pass Quincy on your daily route to class, you’re in luck.
For the rest of us (including this FlyBy correspondent), guess we’ll just have to stick with the yogurt and muffins from HUDS. Sigh.

Harvard carries clout, not just on a resume but in matters of actual importance–and the school is going to do something good with it.
Along with Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Boston University–the latter three of which Bloomberg News did not deem worthy of including in the headline of its article today–Harvard is releasing a set of provisions that will dictate how drugs developed on campus will be marketed.
Read more after the jump.
