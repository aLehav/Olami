After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What kind of community do we want to be? Student activists and the University administration have offered competing visions to answer this essential question. These conflicting views have been at the center of tensions on a variety of issues on campus this spring, not for the first time.
Fifty years ago this month, the famous protests in front of University Hall rocked this campus, fostered by deep divisions over the Vietnam War and a generational chasm that precluded good-faith engagement on the issues. Today, student activists may feel compelled to move to similar scales of protest — including the recent disruption of University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s divestment forum — by similar feelings.
But it doesn’t have to be that way. If both sides are willing to depart from their standard practices to engage one another, we can have a different, better kind of dialogue. Rather than affirming in words alone the right of students to dissent as long as it has no meaningful impact on policy, Bacow and University administrators should recognize the depth of moral conviction felt by protestors and invite them to seriously present their case.
This cannot simply take the form of a meeting where protestors present a list of demands. The University should invite them to draw up proposals, solicit advice and work from sympathetic economists, philosophers, and other professionals to help make a comprehensive case for their point of view. To truly pay respect to the gravity of the protests, the administration must invite activists to present their requests for policy changes by the same procedures the administration uses to make these decisions itself.
But the onus for better dialogue falls on student activists, too. While their frustration at being ignored and desire to stage a protest that demands acknowledgement are understandable feelings, this kind of protest only gives the administration political cover to maintain its disregard for the issues in question and the students who raise them. If given the opportunity to propose and advocate for policy changes through established channels, activists must work to present the best case possible in the spirit of good-faith dialogue. Not only can this foster trust for future cooperation and understanding, but it is also more likely to achieve meaningful change.
The gridlock and frustration surrounding the divestment protests has extended beyond the specific policy debates on divestment to friction between students and faculty on a whole host of issues this semester. The refusal to grant tenure to Divinity School professor Ahmed Ragab, the departure of two tenure-track professors specializing in Asian-American studies, and ongoing issues surrounding Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent Harvey Weinstein and associated fallout are just a few such areas of contention.
The debates over the arbitration process for harassment and discrimination claims between Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the administration have become emblematic of this gridlock. Even when the concerns at issue are as grave and vital as these, airing advertisements on national television intended to put political pressure on the University will not make negotiating on the rest of the HGSU-UAW’s priorities any easier. But the University has, at least in the eyes of graduate students, dragged its feet. University administrators must work to come to a rapid resolution, recognizing that delays in this process have real effects on real people. Further delays will only perpetuate the view that the University has no actual commitment to taking HGSU-UAW’s concerns seriously.
When so many different kinds of situations are causing conflict between students and administration, we have to look beyond the specifics of each controversy to find the root of the problem.
This root is the disconnect between what Harvard teaches us and how it expects us to behave with regard to its own policies. We are taught to question authority. To think critically about the structures of power that surround and define our lives. To be ambitious in our desire to excel in our various fields, lifting up the downtrodden and combating unfairness and discrimination along the way. To speak out when we see injustice and to call on ourselves and the institutions we inhabit to live up to their highest ideals and affirm their morals in everyday practice, no matter how hard that may seem.
Reasonable people can disagree on questions of divestment, on HGSU-UAW negotiations, on the particulars of a few tenure and appointments decisions, and on the behavior of a faculty dean. But it is contrary to the nature of our education to expect students to apply those principles only outside the institution where we live and work eight months a year and where our minds, friendships, and futures are shaped. In fact, the very acts of protest and requests for reform must be seen as affirmations of those principles, and the University should understand engagement with students on the substantive questions as a vital pedagogic tool — after all, how can we transform the institutions we will come to inhabit later in life without learning to do so here?
So we return to the question: What kind of community do we want to be?
To give an answer, we first have to agree on how to get to one. The University must offer a formalized channel through which students can engage in real, meaningful policy debate with the administration. The administration must take this process seriously, and engage in rigorous reason-giving and debate in the spirit of an educational institution to defend its choices, or else accept the recommendations of student activists. Yes, this process requires considerable effort from both students and administrators. But the hard work of debate that is not reduced to mere disagreement requires real commitment. If student activists and administrators are willing to give it, they can make our campus a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, exactly one year after the passage of a referendum on graduate student unionization, the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers aired a 30-second video advertisement on national television during prime-time, criticizing the University’s response to sexual harassment complaints. The ad, which was broadcast on channels including CNN and MSNBC, reflects HGSU-UAW’s currently unmet demand for a contract provision that would allow members to access a third-party grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
We are sympathetic to the frustrations of the graduate students, and we laud the intent behind their effort to put pressure on the University to recognize and grapple with the severity of the problem of sexual assault on campus. There are real, serious deficiencies in the processes currently available to victims of sexual assault and harassment. As we have opined in the past, Harvard’s internal processes alone have not demonstrated the capacity to impartially investigate affiliates of the University in discrimination and sexual misconduct cases. The need for a neutral arbitration procedure is clear, especially considering Harvard’s dubious history of handling past cases of sexual assault and harassment, which continues to affect our campus in the present.
While we share the concerns that the advertisement raises, we are skeptical that this media strategy will be most effective in helping the graduate students achieve their ultimate aim: The successful negotiation of a contract that guarantees them the best working conditions possible.  The reality is that putting external pressure on the University by appealing to the prime-time television audience does not eliminate the need to sit at the negotiating table across from Harvard representatives to actually conclude the negotiating process. Negotiations have already taken place between the union and the University for six months, with few agreements to show for it. We are unsure if this advertisement, and the ensuing media campaign, which also involves billboards, radio, and digital media, will engender progress on these hoped-for fronts. We recognize the UAW is well-versed in negotiating contracts and executing media strategies, but also hope that the graduate students have taken this step out of a genuine belief in its ability to improve their standing in negotiations, rather than for any less constructive end.
Furthermore, while we broadly agree with the union’s goal, we hope that this advertisement does not make this ongoing contract negotiating process more arduous, as we wish to see both sides come to an agreement in as timely a manner as possible to improve graduate students’ quality of life.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As this column rapidly approaches its conclusion (relax or groan, there’s one more), I find myself having stepped over the threshold into a newly repurposed and reinvigorated life. I was finally received into full membership in the Catholic Church this Easter weekend, and I see not just a finale to this collegiate chapter, but the beginning of a life lived in full communion with Christ and His Church.
I’ve been blessed to be and do many wonderful things here at Harvard. I’ve been on a varsity sports team, won an Ivy Championship with that team, went on many a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps adventure in the woods and beyond, written a mildly interesting senior thesis, and of course, waxed non-poetic in these pages for the past two and a half years. These were all rewarding and excellent things, but they are dust blown away in the wind compared to the magnitude and majesty of becoming Catholic here.
As Jesus teaches his disciples in the Gospel according to St. Mark, “For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?” Harvard arguably gave me the world in what I’ve been able to do here, but only He could give me my life. Looking back now over the last four years, though, I shudder to see how easily I might have rejected this outpouring of divine mercy.
Ardent secularists and pessimistic religionists are not wrong when they point out how the university environment often discourages or dismantles the faith of some of its students. I would disagree with those who might argue that enlightened knowledge and reason unfetter students from backwards religious belief (faith and reason are certainly not incompatible), and with those who claim bureaucratic campus machines are on the warpath against religion. But in the fierce competition for student time, energy, zeal, and passions, religion does not often come in first.
The battle for faith on college campuses is less a matter of contention or conflict than a comparatively more pedestrian function of the routines and rituals we participate in every day. Faith flourishes or flounders not necessarily in dramatic declarations or singular decision points (though those can and often happen), but in the long-term formation of daily habits and practices.
I’ve written briefly before how each one of us, regardless of creed, is religious. I’ve also written about how formative our daily habits are to our innermost identities. The heart of religion is worship, and the heart of worship is sacrifice. Insofar as we all find some cause, calling, or community to sacrifice our time and resources to, we are all religious, and we all have rituals.
I can unfortunately attest to how easy it was to sacrifice my time and my very self to the false gods of work or athletics at Harvard, and how easy it became, week after week, not attend church services or participate in the faith community. Next to no one explicitly challenged my beliefs to my face or tried to lead me to reject the Christian Gospel; instead I was choosing not to live out those truths in my early days here. While I would have never dreamed of completely renouncing my Christian faith, there was next to nothing about my life that would even suggest I was a Christian.
Thankfully though, I can also attest to how patterns and habits can change. Whether by my conscious effort, the mentorship of beloved friends and spiritual directors, or by the far more efficacious guidance and grace of God, I did learn how to walk more authentically in the Christian faith. Faith became less and less a mere part of my life and more and more my life itself, and I came to believe that the fullest truth of the Christian life is lived out in the Catholic tradition.
Authentic faith, of most orthodox varieties, cries out to be lived boldly, intentionally, unquietly, and holistically. Religion and spirituality, I believe, is not often meant to be a slice of the “generic wellbeing” pie, or just one box out of many in our cluttered lives. Perhaps part of our societal tendency to compartmentalize or condemn religion stems from the weighty prospect of confronting difficult questions about who we are and what we were made for.
Most religions, after all, take seriously ideas of right and wrong, the brokenness and triumph of human nature, morality, and truth itself. Faith dares to deal in the universal, and often does so by permeating through the particular, the microcosms of our lives. Our daily lives proclaim, in small but significant ways, what we believe to be true about ourselves and the world. If I am willing to pay but one moment more acknowledging God’s presence even in my most mundane, routine activities at Harvard, “Veritas” becomes much more than a motto; it becomes a reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53 said he was insulted after being disinvited to speak at a gala at Concordia Liberal Arts College in Canada because of his self-declared “conservative” views on gender and sexuality.
Concordia Liberal Arts College Principal Mark A. Russell invited Mansfield in December to deliver the keynote address at the college’s 40th anniversary gala this May, according to emails provided by Mansfield. Russell wrote in his invitation that the college was “honored” to host Mansfield.
But in February, Russell wrote in an email to Mansfield that after debate arose among faculty and alumni, he and the college’s other seven faculty members decided to cancel the event altogether.
“The committee charged with finding a speaker, including myself, acted in good faith, but rather precipitously,” Russell wrote. “As we moved forward with plans for our celebrations - as an entire faculty and in conversation with representatives of our alumni - we were unable to achieve consensus as to what we wished to achieve with this event.”
Russell’s email did not provide further explanation for the cancellation, but Mansfield said in an interview Sunday that roughly a dozen alumni approached members of the faculty to voice concerns about his historical stances on women and people who identify as BGLTQ — opinions which he described as “conservative” but “nothing outlandish.”
In a landmark 1996 Colorado court case, Mansfield served as an expert witness in support of a state amendment preventing protected status based on sexual orientation. In 2006, he published a book entitled “Manliness” which defended traditional gender roles. In 2014, he wrote an op-ed in the Weekly Standard criticizing feminist students’ views on sexual assault, arguing that the prevalence of “rape culture” on college campuses is actually a “hook-up culture” stemming from a lack of “feminine modesty.”
The news agency Canadian Press reported that Russell confirmed in an email that a majority of the college’s faculty agreed to disinvite Mansfield after hearing alumni concerns.
“We heard from many that they would not attend the event because they objected to the views he has expressed publicly on women and homosexuals,” Russell is said to have written.
Russell did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Crimson.
Mansfield called being disinvited “an insult.”
“It’s a form of intolerance, I would say an aggressive form of intolerance,” Mansfield said. “It’s a part of the culture war that’s going on, and also our political polarization.”
He compared the incident to what he perceives as a dearth of conservative voices at Harvard’s commencement exercises each year, which he said achieve “quiet and unity” by inviting speakers without controversial views.
“They got unity by suppressing the other side, and the same thing happens at the Harvard commencement when they never have a conservative, because a conservative would be protested,” Mansfield said. “That gives the protesters a veto over who speaks.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not respond to requests for comment about Harvard’s commencement speaker selection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2019 at 7:28 a.m.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow disclosed that Harvard’s total financial holdings in companies tied to the prison industry amount to roughly $18,000, according to two members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and a press release issued Thursday.
HPDC members and Divinity School students Megan B. Lee and Joseph M. Pinto met with Bacow during his official office hours last week. In addition to divulging Harvard’s $18,000 investments, Bacow also said the University does not have direct holdings in businesses that operate private prisons, per the release.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on this figure and for this story.
Bacow’s disclosure of Harvard’s holdings marks a shift in his rhetoric surrounding divestment. In line with past University Presidents, Bacow has thus far never provided details about individual aspects of the school’s endowment portfolio. Harvard’s administrators have rarely if ever provided specific insights into the University’s nearly $40 billion endowment holdings.
Lee said Bacow “refused” to provide evidence backing up the figure he presented at the meeting.
“We went to his office hours to meet him where he’s at this point and to see if we can continue the conversation that seems to have started,” Lee said. “And it seems like we cannot actually start that conversation or continue it.”
In recent months, activists from HPDC and Divest Harvard — a student group promoting fossil fuel divestment — have ramped up their calls for divestment. The groups have circulated petitions, met privately with Bacow, and rallied outside of Massachusetts Hall in Harvard Yard to advocate for their cause. Bacow met with more activists from the Prison Divestment Campaign in March, a meeting during which he said he did not respond to “demands,” but rather to “reason.”
Earlier this month, protestors from both groups interrupted an event at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum where Bacow was slated to speak, forcing the talk continue after moving to a classroom. Bacow also participated in an hour-long forum this month about fossil fuel divestment where he argued that withdrawing Harvard’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry was not a feasible method for resolving climate issues. At the forum, Bacow said he would be willing to meet with HPDC members again about prison industry divestment.
In their Thursday press release, HPDC refuted the sum Bacow indicated Harvard had invested in prison industry-related companies. The group said their research indicates that the University has $2 million invested in the “prison-industrial complex” as of February. Of that $2 million, HPDC said that roughly $100,000 of that sum is “associated with private prisons alone.” HPDC also said the basis for their numbers accounts for 1 percent of the endowment.
Some companies HPDC cited with ties to the “prison industrial complex” include banks, food servicers, and weapons producers.
“All I can say is that they actually have uncovered evidence that shows that more of the endowment is invested in the prison industrial complex than President Bacow said in this meeting,” Pinto said.
Bacow also proposed a meeting between members of HPDC and the Harvard Management Company — which manages Harvard’s endowment — according to the release.
Thursday’s meetings comes ahead of Divest Harvard’s “Heat Week” campaign set to take place this Monday through Friday. “Heat Week” originally began as week-long protest organized by Divest Harvard in April 2015.
Pinto said HPDC plans to participate in Heat Week and extend their efforts beyond.
“I think it's our job to just kind of keep it up because we expected this. He has said in the past that he listen to, or he responds to, reason not demand,” Pinto said. “We're aware of that, and we're in it for the long haul.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives contested the ability of the president and vice president to vote as representatives of the council on legislation at the UC’s general meeting Sunday, interrupting the normal agenda several times.
In an interview after the meeting, Elm Yard representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who chairs the Rules Committee, said the UC’s constitution is ambiguous regarding whether or not the duo can vote in regular procedure. The fact that the president and vice president are not representatives of the Council, but rather executive officers, might suggest they should not vote, but there is also no language that explicitly prevents the president and vice president from voting, according to Cheng.
Members elected from upperclassman houses or freshman Yard districts are considered representatives. When the entire student body elects the president and vice president every fall, the duo forgoes their seats in their respective houses and are subsequently considered executive officers, according to the UC’s constitution.
The issue remained unresolved at the conclusion of the meeting, and current President Sruthi Palaniappan and Vice President Julia M. Huesa participated in normal voting procedures throughout the duration of the meeting.
Past UC presidents and vice presidents have voted on legislation in recent memory, however, according to Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, who is also a former Crimson sports chair.
The UC president also has the power to break ties on votes. Some representatives said they are concerned that the president could vote normally and then also break a tie, essentially giving that person two votes.
Lowell House representative Jungyeon Park ’20 said she thinks the constitution implies that the president should not be eligible to vote on standard bills.
“Not only the president, but the chairs, because they have to remain impartial, is not supposed to vote in regular times, and that’s why they’re allowed to break ties by giving a vote,” Park said. “They’re not usually supposed to vote because if they're allowed to vote and also break ties that means their vote is being counted twice, which is not allowed.”
Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22 disagreed with this reading of the UC’s constitution. He said that Robert’s Rules of Order, a manual of parliamentary procedure that the UC defaults to when its constitution does not specify a particular situation, allows the chair and vice chair of a group — in this case, the president and vice president of the UC — to vote on legislation.
During the meeting, the UC voted unanimously to pass a statement of solidarity for the Harvard Wears Denim event on Apr. 24. Hosted by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response and Consent Advocates Relationship Educators, this Denim Day event observes the end of Sexual Assault Awareness month, with events including a speaker series and restorative yoga.
The legislation, which was co-sponsored by Mather House representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 and Dunster House representative Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20, states the UC is responsible for supporting students and organizations who promote “dismantling sexual and gender-based violence on campus.”
“We, the Harvard Undergraduate Council, wear denim in solidarity with survivors to reinforce our commitment to fighting sexual violence on campus and to addressing the needs of survivors and allies, today and every day,” the statement reads.
The UC also declined to consider a statement of support for Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20, which the Council failed to pass last week. Mudannayake was previously involved in a confrontation with two Winthrop tutors in Winthrop dining hall. She alleges that one of the tutors, Carl L. Miller, took photos and videos of her; Miller alleges Mudannayake harassed him and his family. Two-thirds are required to consider the statement as new business, but only 60 percent of representatives voted in favor.

The Harvard Crimson objected to a subpoena issued by two Winthrop House tutors commanding a Crimson reporter testify in a deposition and give up reporting materials.
Winthrop House tutors Carl L. Miller and Valencia Miller issued the subpoena to Crimson news and multimedia editor Shera S. Avi-Yonah ’21 on April 10 via their attorney George J. Leontire. The subpoena requests testimony and documents related to the Millers’ defamation lawsuit against Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe. The Crimson refers to members of its staff as “editors.”
The Millers’ lawsuit, filed April 11, includes two counts of defamation — one for statements made in a private text, the other for an email sent over the Eliot House listserv. Avi-Yonah reported on the email and the lawsuit, which referenced the text.
Robert A. Bertsche, an attorney for The Crimson, sent Leontire a written objection to the subpoena on April 19, indicating that Avi-Yonah will not appear at the scheduled deposition or provide the materials requested except by a court order.
Leontire wrote in an emailed statement on behalf of the Millers Sunday that he plans to bring a motion to compel Avi-Yonah’s testimony over the objection.
“The court will decide if the deposition will go forward as a it [sic] does on a routine bases [sic] in many civil cases,” he wrote.
The subpoena requires Avi-Yonah to testify and provide documents at a May 14 deposition at Leontire’s Boston office.
Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume ’20 wrote in an emailed statement on behalf of Avi-Yonah that The Crimson will resist the subpoena because Avi-Yonah is “not a party to the dispute between the Millers and O’Keefe.”
“Under the First Amendment, the media have traditionally — and properly — opposed efforts to turn reporters into agents of discovery for one side or the other in a civil suit,” Guillaume wrote. “We see no basis for deviating from that practice here.”
The subpoena issued to Avi-Yonah is one of five the Millers have served as part of their lawsuit, according to Leontire. He added that he anticipates issuing “numerous other subpoenas.”
“If I believe other individuals at the Crimson have relevant or probative information relative to Dean Gale O’keefe’s [sic] defamation of the Millers I will seek to subpoena such individuals,” he wrote.
The subpoena specifically requests all of Avi-Yonah’s recent communications and documents “concerning” the Millers, as well as communications and documents related to Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. “sent to or received from” O’Keefe and Eliot resident Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20.
Sullivan announced in January that he would represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces multiple accusations of sexual assault. Sullivan’s decision has sparked backlash from students who say his representation of Weinstein is incompatible with his duties as a faculty dean.
Mudannayake, who is also a Crimson design editor, has made international headlines for her activism related to the controversy. She has organized several campaigns calling for Sullivan to step down from his faculty dean position.
Communications — as requested by the subpoena — include emails, texts, social media posts, or other communications. Documents include any information stored in any medium, according to civil laws cited by the subpoena.
The Millers’ suit alleges that O’Keefe “disparaged and defamed” their reputation in the wake of Sullivan’s decision. They are seeking monetary damages and “such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable,” according to the lawsuit.
The first count of defamation stems from a text O’Keefe wrote to Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers in March stating that the Millers were “asked to leave” Eliot House in 2012.
The Millers wrote that O’Keefe “maliciously targeted” them because of her “perception that [the Millers] supported Dean Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein.”
The second count concerns an email O’Keefe sent to all Eliot affiliates on April 9 defending Mudannayake’s account of a confrontation that had taken place between her and the Millers. On April 3, Mudannayake and the Millers filed conflicting reports with the Harvard University Police Department about an incident that took place in Winthrop’s dining hall. Mudannayake said that she questioned Carl Miller after he appeared to film and take photos of her. Carl Miller stated that Mudannayake harassed and provoked him as he ate with his family.
O’Keefe’s email upheld Mudannayake’s account of the events, and stated that the tutors acted “totally unprofessionally and dishonestly.”
O’Keefe declined to comment for this story.
Avi-Yonah worked on stories about Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein, the Millers’ interactions with Mudannayake, and the statements made by O’Keefe. She also worked on stories about another client of Leontire’s, Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., who faces allegations of sexual harassment.
Other reporters also worked on the stories about Leontire’s clients with Avi-Yonah, but were not subpoenaed.
Leontire alleged in his statement Sunday that The Crimson had denied the Millers their “right to due process” through its “campaign of disinformation and bias.”
He pointed out Mudannayake’s position as a Crimson design editor, and stated that The Crimson’s “consistent biased reporting and editorializing” and “incestuous relationships” have “delegitimized” its reporting.
“The Crimson, as is the case with many institutions and individuals today, is loyal only to its political and social group above all else including the truth,” he wrote. “Fortunately, the court and a jury will be the final arbiter of this matter of tribal allegiances.”
Leontire’s remarks come as the press faces increasing attacks questioning news sources’ objectivity. For example, President Donald Trump has repeatedly called various publications “fake news” and alleged political biases influence their reporting.
Guillaume wrote in a statement that The Crimson’s reporting has been accurate and free of bias.
“The Crimson strives to fulfill our obligation to our readers by reporting with accuracy, integrity, and objectivity,” she wrote. “Our reporters and editors have done their due diligence in reporting and providing balanced coverage on this subject and all others.”
The Crimson was last subpoenaed in 2015, when law enforcement investigators — looking into an email sent to a Crimson reporter referencing an unfounded bomb threat in Harvard Yard — requested a portion of traffic logs to The Crimson’s website. In that instance, the newspaper complied with the subpoena, though the request did not relate to any information concerning sources or reporting.

Senator Michael K. Braun (R-Ind.) wrote that he hopes Harvard “reconsiders” its sanctions on single-gender social organizations in an open letter to the University earlier this month, writing that the policy constitutes a “senseless decision” that is “harming” students.
The letter — dated April 9 and addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow — comes in response to the College’s controversial sanctions policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021. The policy bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving College endorsements for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes, and from holding certain campus leadership positions and athletic team captaincies.
“Federal law recognizes the positive role that such organizations can take at universities,” Braun wrote. “Indeed, under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination in higher education, Congress specifically exempts ‘the membership practices of a social fraternity or social sorority.’”
Braun’s missive arrived in Cambridge amid persistent lobbying efforts from single-gender social organizations nationwide to prevent Harvard from enforcing its penalties against social groups, according to North-American Interfraternity Conference spokesperson Todd Shelton.
Hundreds of fraternity and sorority members from across the country traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier this month to lobby Congress to protect affiliates of single-gender groups, Shelton said. He said the group met with more than 450 Congressional offices — representing roughly 80 percent of voting members — to present their case during the second week of April.
Three Harvard undergraduates who are members of unrecognized single-gender social groups joined this lobbying effort, according to Shelton and two sources close to the North-American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference.
Braun argued in his letter that single-sex fraternities and sororities can help students build friendships and professional networks. He added that women’s organizations have been unfairly impacted by the College’s policies.
“Women’s organizations have been collateral damage and have been forced to integrate or, in some cases, close,” Braun wrote.
All but one formerly all-female social group at Harvard have committed to going gender-neutral, while several all-male groups have refused to go co-ed. In August 2018, Alpha Phi was the last sorority to go co-ed and become a Recognized Social Organization, but some of its former members re-established the group on campus in December as an all-female club.
In his letter, Braun wrote he believes that the sanctions are “a superficial solution” to the problem of sexual assault on campus because such assaults can occur outside of single-gender organizations. When the University first unveiled its social group policy, it cited a 2015 University report that said women who are involved with final clubs are more likely to experience sexual assault.
Braun also wrote he is concerned that Harvard’s social group policy may pave the way for future “social engineering” efforts by the University.
“At what point will Harvard interfere in student membership in religious or political organizations it deems undesirable?” Braun wrote.
Braun’s letter comes amidst parallel federal and state lawsuits alleging that Harvard’s social group penalties constitute sex-based discrimination and violate students’ freedom of association. Like Braun, the plaintiffs for the federal suit — which include Greek organizations and Harvard undergraduates — claim the sanctions infringe upon Title IX, which is part of federal civil rights law.
Bacow responded to Braun’s arguments in a letter delivered to the senator’s Washington, D.C., office Friday morning. Bacow wrote that faculty, students, and alumni have worked to develop the sanctions policy and ensure that it reflects Harvard’s values.
“Harvard is not banning these social groups, nor is it prohibiting membership in them. The policy is about institutional prerogatives,” Bacow wrote. “Students may choose to join unrecognized, single-gender social organizations, but the University has chosen to adopt a policy regarding student eligibility for leadership positions in Harvard-recognized organizations or Harvard endorsements that is aligned with our core values of non-discrimination and inclusion.”
Bacow’s letter to Braun reflected legal arguments made by University attorneys that students have full knowledge of the social group penalties when they enroll at the College.
“Harvard’s policy was adopted on a prospective basis only, ensuring that any students who would be covered by the policy were on notice before they decided to matriculate,” Bacow wrote.
Braun’s communications staff did not respond to several requests for comment on what motivated the senator to write the letter, what legislative action he might consider, or whether or not Bacow’s letter assuages his concerns.
The threat of Congressional intervention in reaction to the sanctions has loomed over Massachusetts Hall for several years — since eight days after the Corporation voted to approve the penalties in December 2017, to be exact. At the time, the House of Representatives began considering a rewrite of the PROSPER Act, a higher education bill that could include language barring universities that receive federal funding from penalizing undergraduates who join certain single-gender social organizations.
Consortia of Harvard final clubs and the parent organizations for many Greek groups have hired prominent lobbying firm Arnold & Porter to represent their interests, and a constituent PAC has donated thousands of dollars to the legislation’s most vocal supporters.
Over the past year, some of these groups have traveled to the nation’s capital to lobby Congress to pass legislation that could imperil Harvard’s social group policy.
Dani Weatherford — CEO of the National Panhellenic Conference, an umbrella organization for 26 sororities — wrote in an emailed statement that it is a “critical time” for lobbying because Congress may reauthorize the Higher Education Act soon.
“Part of our focus is on ensuring that we protect freedom of association rights for college students. And we particularly want lawmakers to understand that threats to free association have had real consequences for women’s organizations and women’s spaces at Harvard,” Weatherford wrote. “Whether it’s at Harvard or on any other campus, we will always advocate for freedom of association.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain did not say whether or not Bacow has received other letters from members of Congress who oppose the sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two weeks, all four of the Crimson’s crews took to the water to partake in tenacious battles of physical exertion and mental fortitude. Through high tides and low tides, all displayed a competitiveness indicative of the immense training that has propelled them to the solid teams they are today. With the large regattas of the postseason looming near, the warmer weather signals the heating up of this spring’s competition.
The No. 3 men’s heavyweight team displayed its prowess on the water this weekend. The crew traveled to northeast Princeton, N.J., where it settled down to compete on Lake Carnegie of the Millstone River for the Compton Cup.
From the very beginning, Harvard’s 1V took a comfortable lead, which it maintained for the entire race. The boat crossed the line in 5:25.3, a margin of victory of seven seconds over the Tigers. The Crimson also took the second and fifth varsity eight. The victory in the 1V was Harvard’s 11th in the past 13th contests.

“Princeton is a tough opponent; they’re generally a strong team all the way through,” Corrigan said. “Speaking for the 1V, which is the race that decides the Compton Cup, we just got a really good rhythm really early in the race; we beat them by seven seconds and I think set the course record, so we felt pretty happy with that.”
Last week, the Crimson suppressed a late surge by No. 5 Brown to take the Stein Cup on the Charles River. Harvard took the first, third, and fourth varsity eights. The 1V finished in 5:45.3 to Brown’s 5:46.6.
“You’re always giving your max effort, but sometimes you’re not working as efficiently and that was one of those races where we were all going pretty hard, and going for it, but we weren’t working very efficiently, and we weren’t able to move smoothly and get as much of a lead on them in any point of the race,” Corrigan said. “With Princeton we were able to work efficiently and very hard at the same time, and it’s a lot more fun and boats go faster when that happens.”
The No. 4 men’s lightweight crew dominated the Charles River in the Haines Cup. Blustery winds did not impede Harvard from besting both No. 7 Navy and Delaware in three races, the 1V, 2V, and 4V. The team’s victory in the 1V secured the Cup. The Crimson’s boat outlasted Navy by just over a second in 6:20.38; Delaware finished more than seven seconds behind.
Last weekend, Harvard traveled to Dartmouth to face the Big Green in the Biglin Bowl. Coming in to the race, the Crimson had not ceded a victory in the regatta since 2009. This year’s match-up proved no different, as Harvard took both the 1V and 2V/3V races, including a 5:28.4 finish in the 1V, six seconds ahead of the Big Green.
Senior Jack Stone, who coxed the 1V in both races, noted that the Navy race showcased the team’s depth and also praised the crew’s efforts against Dartmouth in a race that was delayed a couple of hours due to the mist.
“This team so far has had a successful dual season, but we also realize that we lost our first race and that no one is just going to be giving away their shirts or giving away their medals at Sprints of the IRAs this year,” Stone said. “We know it’s a very competitive league and we already have two teams that have beaten us, so we’re really hungry to compete and ready to prove ourselves.”
The No. 15 Radcliffe heavyweight team was also in action this weekend and traveled to Providence, R.I., to face No. 8 Brown on the Seekonk River. Conditions were subpar, with winds up to 15 miles per hour. The Bears bested the Black and White in the 1V with a time of 7:09.40. Radcliffe did secure a victory in the B4/C4 race with a seven second margin of victory.
The No. 4 Radcliffe lightweight crew did not take to the water this weekend after a flurry of races last week at the Knecht Cup, which took place on the Cooper River in Cherry Hill, N.J. The Black and White sent four boats to the Grand Finals on that Sunday. In the varsity quad, Radcliffe took second to UMass in 7:37.80. The crew took fourth in the lightweight four and lightweight eight grand final events, which were won by Princeton and Stanford, respectively. In the varsity eight, Radcliffe took sixth; Stanford won in 6:39.23.
Moving forward, Corrigan noted that it is imperative that his team does not become complacent in preparation for races against tougher opponents moving forward, including Yale, Washington, and Cal. His crew, along with the other three, has its sights both on the Harvard-Yale race and the National Championships at the end of the season.
“You show up to these races against Brown and Princeton and Cornell and you want to win and you hope to win, and coming away with a win is good, but for instance next week Yale is racing Princeton and you can compare the margins across weeks,” Corrigan said. “We won by seven seconds; did Yale win by eight?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after one of the toughest losses of the year against No. 7/6 Penn (8-3, 6-0 Ivy League), tri-captain and junior attacker Kyle Anderson came out and tied his career high with seven goals in a stellar performance against Princeton in an effort to keep playoff hopes alive for the Crimson.
With just two games left in the 2019 regular season, Harvard traveled to Princeton, New Jersey to take on the Tigers (7-6, 2-3 Ivy League) in its final away game of the year. The team knew that it needed a win in order to have a shot at the NCAA tournament, which meant that players would have to step up in order to force the issue.
The first quarter was relatively calm until around the 9:30 mark, when an explosion of scoring took hold of the game. Unfortunately, the frenzy did not swing in Harvard’s favor, and by the end of the quarter, with more goals scored than minutes played in the last half of the first, the Crimson found itself in a 7-4 hole. Leading the team at this point was freshmen attacker Austin Madronic, who was able to notch two early goals.
However, in the second quarter, Anderson began to catch fire. Having already scored one in the first, Anderson went on to add another five goals in the second quarter, but he was not done there. Madronic also added another goal in the quarter, as well as an assist, giving him a hat trick on the day. Yet, Princeton had a response to every Harvard offensive, and the Crimson went into the half still trailing by the same margin as in the first, now down 13-7. “I thought we picked up some good momentum offensively in the second quarter, and even though we were down three going into halftime, we still felt that game was well within reach,” said Anderson.
Harvard came out of the half determined and was well aware that its season was on the line. Despite going down 15-10 early, the Crimson battled its way back, led in a valiant effort by sophomore attacker Myles Hamm, who recorded a hat trick with three goals in the quarter.
As the fourth quarter began, it was now or never for the Crimson, who was down 16-13. Anderson followed up an early goal by junior midfielder Jeremy Magno with one of his own. The goal tied Anderson's single-game record for goals (seven) and points (eight). “I was just trying to do everything I could to get a win,” said Anderson. “We all knew we needed to win that game to keep our playoff hopes alive, so it was just a feeling of desperation.” The goal also brought the Crimson within two (down 17-15), which was the closest margin since 6:28 left in the second quarter.
The team fought as hard as it could and gave its all, but eventually fell 19-15. No words could do justice in describing the emotions surrounding the team at the cry of the final whistle. After working and pushing each other all year, knowing that Harvard was no longer eligible to make the NCAA tournament was not an easy pill for the team to swallow.
Although he had a great game, Anderson was still much more focused on the team. “It was really tough to lose that one and to realize that our season could no longer be extended outside of the regular season. I know it was especially tough for our seniors who have all given so much to this program,” he said.
While the team may not make the NCAA tournament this year, there is still one game left on the schedule. The Crimson have an opportunity to end the year on a positive note, as it will take on rival and No. 4 Yale next Saturday in Harvard stadium.
“The Harvard–Yale rivalry has so much history behind it and it is exciting to be a part of this rivalry,” said Madronic. “I know that we will come out and play as hard as ever, regardless of our standing in the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a busy weekend for Harvard golf, the women’s team continued its recent dominance of the Ivy League. The group captured its sixth Ivy League Championship in the last eight years, bringing the program’s tally to eight titles overall.
This result is not one that would’ve been predicted following the first of three rounds. After shooting a combined score of 309, the Crimson found itself 12 strokes back of Pennsylvania who led the field with a score of 297.
However, the team rebounded quickly, not allowing the sluggish start get the better of it. This is a testament to Harvard’s grit and perseverance as it would’ve been easy to get discouraged. Instead, the group dug down deep and improved its score every round.
A respectable 302 in the second round was completely overshadowed by the scorching-hot score of 290 that the Crimson put up in the final round. This mark was seven strokes better than the next closest single round team score (which was Pennsylvania’s aforementioned first round score).
This effort gave Harvard a total of 901 over the three days, which proved to be enough to lift it over its competitors. Dartmouth was the next closest, coming in second place with 907, while Columbia rounded out the top three with 913.
In the fall, Harvard welcomed three freshmen to its ranks, and all three showed up in the top 10 of the tournament individual leaderboard. Chloe Royston and Anina Ku both used single round scores of 73 to propel them to 7th and 10th respectively.
That being said, it was the final member of this first-year trio that stole the show. Elizabeth Wang was not only the top Harvard performer, but the top golfer in the event overall. The San Marino, Calif. native had nine birdies and 36 pars en route to a three day score of 218. This was highlighted by a tournament-best score of 69 in the third round.
This is not all that surprising, as Wang has been performing at a high level all year. In the fall she led the Crimson with a stroke average of 71.57 over seven rounds of play. Furthermore, she went undefeated in her head to head matchups at the team’s recent match play event.
Wang’s victory marks the second consecutive year that a Harvard golfer has taken the top spot on the individual leaderboard at the Ivy League Championships. Despite falling to Princeton, current senior and captain Michelle Xie was awarded the honor in 2018 after carding rounds of 77, 71, and 72. This year Xie was the fourth Harvard golfer to appear in the top 10. A final round 71 left her with a combined score of 229, which was tied for 10th best at the tournament.
The Harvard men’s golf team did not fare as well as its counterpart, placing sixth at the Ivy League Championships. Only two strokes separated the top three schools, as Princeton narrowly held off Columbia and Yale for the title. Columbia recorded a tournament best score of 283 in the final round which nearly capped off an incredible comeback, but fell just short.
For the Crimson, the result was not what the team had hoped for, but there was certainly a silver lining to the situation. It played very consistent golf and improved its score every round. Also, there was not a whole lot of separation in the standings.
“Usually the Ivy League Championship is not this close between six teams,” junior Rij Patel said. “Columbia was pretty much where we were [heading into the last round] and ended up almost winning, so it was just super close… I thought it was a really good week [for us].”
In terms of individual performances, sophomore Grant Fairbairn and Patel led the way with scores of 220 and 222 respectively. Patel accomplished this with eight birdies and 30 pars while Fairbairn poured in 33 pars and seven birdies.
This event wraps up the team’s spring campaign. Throughout the year, Harvard truly emphasized the process of improving one step at a time. Thus, it is fitting that the group is already looking to use what its learned going forward.
“Coming back [from the tournament] we’re reflecting on some of the things we did really well this year, some of the things we can improve upon, and some strategies going into the next year,” Patel said. “Making sure we’re staying healthy and making sure we’re practicing in the right ways over the summer [are very important]. We’re thinking of ways to improve.”
On the other hand, the women’s golf team has yet to conclude its journey. This Ivy League title secures the Crimson a spot in one of four NCAA Regional tournaments, giving it a chance to continue its already successful season.

Love It: Sorry Autumn, This is the Best Season of the Year — Rachel L. Reynolds
The time has finally come to put away those psets and papers, and pick up your fancy dresses and bowties. Formal season has come to pull you out of that deep midterm season funk and let you dance your cares away before finals. With some bopping music, fun themes, and great pals, there really is something for everyone to enjoy.
Are you the friend who shows up to class every day dressed to the nines? Get ready for the perfect opportunity to get even more dolled up than usual. We all love a chance to do some online shopping in order to procrastinate, and this is truly no exception! Do you thrive as the mom of the group in any situation? Get ready to hype up all of your best pals and capture their best angles as the designated photographer a la “Mean Girls.” And even if you’re just there to see your dhall crush looking even better than usual or maybe to get that perfect post for your Instagram, you can’t go wrong here. More than anything, formal szn is the time to live out all those classic teen movies of your dreams!
Hate It: You’re Bad at Dancing Anyway — Michelle C. Lara
Ah, yes! Let us go ahead and buy four different formal dresses that we won’t use again until next year, if at all. That’s money that could’ve gone to a Tatte sandwich or a Felipe’s burrito.
Like bears, college students tend to hibernate and gain weight during winter, meaning that your fun and frilly dress from last summer will be a no-go for formal season. As a college student, you’ll also have to venture a little further for the cute but still affordable clothes out there, since the few clothing stores in Harvard Square don’t exactly offer our idea of a sustainable price point (Anthropology and Ann Taylor, we’re looking at you).
Plus, there’s really no reason to be excited about spending three hours listening to incredibly mediocre music while awkwardly standing around and making accidental eye contact with people from work or who you forgot were in your class. Do you really want to “get low” in front of your comp director? And when the occasional good song does come on, your stomach will probably hurt too much to dance — all thanks to the cold and greasy food you ate beforehand.
Oh, and let’s not forget that you still haven’t started studying for finals. Ask yourself: Is failing your exams really worth the Instagram picture that everyone else is also posting?

By Cindy Li
Now that you’re at Harvard, let’s discuss the burning question that has been on all of your minds: Where will I eat when the dining hall just isn’t doing it for me? From late night to date night eats, Flyby has you covered. Read on for a comprehensive list of which restaurants to cram into your busy Visitas weekend.
Early Bird Gets the Worm
Zinneken’s
Since you won’t get to experience the long-awaited Veritaffle until Sunday brunch, a Zinneken’s waffle is the only suitable alternative. Small and cozy, Zinneken’s offers authentic Belgian waffles and a list of delicious toppings to choose from. Keep it sweet and simple with nutella and strawberry, or test your limits with cookie butter, bananas, dark chocolate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Pro tip: Grab Zinneken’s again for lunch at the Zinneken’s food truck in the plaza outside the Science Center, and then take advantage of the restaurant’s late hours (9 a.m. to midnight Friday-Saturday and 9 a.m.-9 p.m. on Sunday) for a sweet dinner. After all, who needs a break(fast) from Zinneken’s?
Black Sheep Bagel Cafe
Are you a true bagel connoisseur already lamenting your lack of a real New York or New Jersey bagel? Want to show off your bagel expertise to your new Visitas friends? Maybe you just want to take a break from all the Visitas hubbub and get some work done in a laid back, productive environment? With its aesthetic decor and extensive bagel options, Black Sheep will have you running baaaa-ck for more.
Lunch Break!
Hokkaido Santouka Ramen
We all know that ramen is a rite of passage for college students, so what better meal to have at Visitas than delicious authentic ramen from Santouka? The long lines are worth the wait, but make sure to use Yelp to get a spot on the waitlist if you’re running short on time. Warning: After a Santouka experience, stirring hot water into styrofoam cups will never quite satisfy your ramen cravings.
Border Cafe
Large portions of Mexican food at very affordable prices? Sign us up. As a Harvard student, you’ll spend countless evenings at Border for friend’s birthdays, get-togethers, and other events, so you might as well get a preview of it now. While you might not be a broke college student just yet, take our word for it. No matter what Mexican dish you’re fantasizing about, Border will satisfy your every craving.
Late Night Eats
El Jefe’s
Ending the night at Jefe’s is a tradition that begins at Visitas and will persist through your four years at Harvard. Nothing wraps up the night like watching the Jefe’s employee wrap your overly stuffed burrito (and not charge you extra for guac). Feeling something a little lighter? This sounds cheesy, but Jefe’s cheese quesadillas are bound to have you feeling warm and fuzzy.
Pinocchio's Pizza
Of course, you can’t come to Visitas and not try Pinocchio’s (or Noch’s, as students lovingly refer to it). They say that this is where the Zucc — otherwise known as Mark Zuckerberg — frequented. With its affordable square slices of Sicilian pizza, we promise we’re telling the truth when we say that this will not be your last time rolling through to grab a quick slice.
We know it’s called the Freshman 15, but with this guide, why not use Visitas weekend to get a head start?
