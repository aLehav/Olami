After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates called for greater student and alumni involvement in the search for the University’s next president at a panel discussion held Tuesday at the Harvard Faculty Club.
The event comes roughly five months into Harvard’s ongoing search for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust, who plans to step down in June 2018. The panel was hosted by the Harvard India Student Group and the Elephant Society, an “alumni hub that supports people who want to become leaders,” according to member and Harvard Extension School alumnus Anthony P. Sylvester, who helped organize the panel.
Four speakers sat on the panel: Sylvester, Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung, Harvard Divinity School graduate Willie Bodrick II, and Martin Bernstein ’20, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student-run anti-sexual assault advocacy organization.
At the event, attended by roughly 80 Harvard students and alumni, panelists discussed a wide range of topics including sexual assault and student social life. But much of the conversation focused on issues of transparency—both in the search process itself and regarding the backgrounds of potential candidates.
All four panelists said they wished the famously secretive search process—historically conducted behind closed doors—were more transparent. Specifically, panelists called on the presidential search committee, which is made up of all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers, to publish a list of potential candidates.
Cheung added, though, that he thinks a certain level of opacity is necessary to conduct the search properly.
“Having been on search committees myself, there are reasons you can’t put that list out there,” he said. “The transparency that we’d like isn’t necessarily possible for legitimate reasons.”
In lieu of making the process more open, panelists argued Harvard students and alumni should voice their opinions about the search more frequently to ensure the search committee understands what University affiliates want to see in the 29th president.
Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee '72, who is leading the search committee, said in an interview last month that the committee has received over 700 suggestions for candidates.
Sylvester also urged attendees to examine the backgrounds of potential presidential candidates so they can give better-informed opinions to the search committee. He particularly suggested students look into Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, whom several prominent donors and professors have named a likely contender for the presidency.
Lee has repeatedly declined to comment on the number or identity of candidates the committee is considering.
In addition to discussing the search process, panelists debated likely challenges the next president will face. In particular, Cheung mentioned the College’s controversial policy penalizing members of unrecognized single-gender social groups.
The Corporation voted last week to uphold the sanctions, which bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships. But the policy may be under fire—Republican legislation currently before the U.S. House of Representatives could bar Harvard from enforcing its penalties.
“Harvard needs to take responsibility making sure that these students conform to the morals of the society,” Cheung said at the panel. “I think that’s a big challenge the next president going forward faces."
Bernstein also listed the University’s sexual assault policy and issues of sexual harassment on campus as items he hopes the next president will prioritize. Harvard’s annual report on sexual harassment prevention and response, released Tuesday, showed that the number of formal complaints of sexual harassment Harvard affiliates filed increased by 65 percent during the 2016-2017 academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 14, 2017 at 9:43 p.m.
University President Drew G. Faust on Tuesday joined over two dozen university presidents in the new Presidents’ Alliance of Higher Education and Immigration, a coalition that pledges to support undocumented and international students on campuses across the United States.
The group announced its launch in a press release Tuesday, citing the “urgent threat” recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals currently face. The alliance also called on Congress to pass legislation protecting undocumented students after President Donald Trump’s Sept. 2017 decision to repeal DACA, an Obama-era program that allowed undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States.
“The Alliance will support adoption of best practices on campuses, and work in a unified manner to communicate the need for federal and state policies that create a welcoming environment for immigrant, undocumented, and international students,” the statement reads.
The Alliance unites university presidents from across the country, including Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia, and President Emeritus of Pomona College David W. Oxtoby.  In Tuesday’s press release, Oxtoby wrote that pushing for protecting undocumented students "with permanent legislation” is the Alliance’s first priority.
Faust emphasized the importance of American higher education remaining open to immigrants and international students in an emailed statement Wednesday. Roughly 65 DACA recipients currently attend the College.
“Members of the Presidents’ Alliance have long understood that our ability to attract energetic and talented individuals regardless of their origin is critical to our success, and I am eager to work together with them to advance a national conversation around the extraordinary value of international exchange and immigration,” Faust wrote.
Faust’s membership in the Alliance follows her outspoken opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, which have created a sense of crisis for undocumented students on Harvard’s campus. Shortly after Trump announced the repeal of DACA, Faust denounced the decision as “cruel.” Since then, Faust has advocated on behalf of undocumented students by signing letters, appearing on national television, and joining the “Dream Coalition”—an organization of business leaders and politicians pushing for legislation to protect undocumented students.
Faust sent a letter to Trump in August before the repeal of DACA, urging him to consider preserving protections for undocumented students. After the repeal, she met with South Carolina Senator Lindsey O. Graham on Oct. 23 during his visit to campus. Faust and Graham discussed finding permanent solutions or promoting the BRIDGE Act, a piece of legislation that would temporarily protect undocumented students, she said in an interview last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 2,000 Harvard affiliates stopped by El Jefe’s Taqueria Tuesday to munch on tacos and burritos as part of a fundraiser for a freshman football player who remains paralyzed after suffering a serious injury, ultimately raising $27,000 over the course of the day.
The fundraiser ran from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m.; throughout, El Jefe’s donated all revenue to The Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, which—named after freshman linebacker Abercrombie, who suffered the injury—will provide financial help to the Abercrombie family. In addition to helping the Abercrombie family, the Fund is meant to financially assist any athlete who “incurs a severe or catastrophic injury” during competition.
Abercrombie suffered a major cervical injury on Sept. 16 in a game against Rhode Island. After spending two months at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta GA, he is still unable to move his limbs or breathe on his own.
The Harvard Varsity Club started the Abercrombie Fund roughly two weeks after Abercrombie’s injury on Oct. 4. To date, the trust has garnered over $266,000.
El Jefe’s owner John Schall announced Tuesday’s fundraiser on Nov. 29. Roughly $20,000 of Tuesday’s proceeds came from food sales, while an additional $7,000 came from donations made both at the restaurant and online.
Members of the Harvard football team stayed at the restaurant from 8 a.m. Tuesday to 4 a.m. Wednesday morning, keeping the crowd energized and collecting donations. Despite freezing temperatures, by 6 p.m. the line was out the door. Members of the football team wiled away the hours blasting music on the sidewalk and occasionally dancing with customers in line.
Jerrica H. Li ’20, a student who participated in the fundraiser, said she was surprised by the length of the line.
“I thought that the turnout was really, really amazing,” Li said. “The line when I got there was not quite out the door but I think by the time dinner started hitting, yeah, that line went down the block.”
Senior safety Tanner J. Lee ’18, though, said the turnout is exactly what he expected from Harvard affiliates.
“That’s what I expected. I mean the Harvard community is really connected, especially the football team,” Lee said. “I didn’t know we were going to raise [nearly] $30,000, that’s a crazy milestone. We were thinking we might, our highest guess was like $20,000.”
Alyssa C. Saldaña ’21, a member of the softball team, wrote in an email that she also thinks the high turnout underscores the strength of the Harvard athletic community.
“As you walked in, there were members from not only the football team but the entire athletic and Crimson community greeting and welcoming people in,” Saldaña wrote. “It was truly something special to see so many people come together to rally behind Ben and the cause he is standing for.“
Andrew D. Chesebro, Assistant Director of Marketing and Communications for the Harvard Varsity Club, wrote in an email that Tuesday’s fundraiser would not have been possible without generous donations from Schall and El Jefe’s.
“We would like to say a special thank you to John Schall, whose leadership drove this effort from day one,” Chesebro wrote. “This was a very personal day for John, and we cannot thank him enough for his incredible generosity and friendship.”
Abercrombie tweeted his gratitude to everyone who came out to the fundraiser, writing that he felt “thankful and appreciative” for attendees and for El Jefe’s.
Lee, who visited Abercrombie over Thanksgiving break, said he thinks Abercrombie has remained positive throughout the ordeal.
“From talking to him I think his spirits are high as they’ve always been and I think he’s definitely going to fight this again and I hope he can regain everything,” Lee said.
