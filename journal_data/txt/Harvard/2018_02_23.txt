After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Claudia Rankine is not just a creative jill of all trades, but a master of every single one. It comes as no surprise, then, that when the poet, playwright, essayist, editor, and professor took the stage Feb. 15 at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, the room, filled to capacity, erupted in thunderous applause. The applause faded to attentive listening as Rankine introduced her talk, “The Racial Imaginary and American Poetry,” focusing on the received neutrality and cultural dominance of whiteness.
Rankine, the author of “Citizen: An American Lyric,” examined the way whiteness pervades American culture, and how this dominance is so often ignored by canonical white writers. “To write about race in the mind of many white writers has little to do with investigating whiteness,” she said. Further, Rankine discussed how the people in these authors’ works are presumed to be white simply because they are people. She added, “Whiteness as universal, nonpartisan, neutral, and normal is an equation that rules journalism, non-fiction, and creative writing, which is to say it rules the culture.” In this way, whiteness persists as the cultural standard.
Rankine blended her discussion of the urgently timely topic with quotes from other prominent racial thinkers, particularly one from James Baldwin about the danger of silence. She delivered the final words of Baldwin’s quote saying, “It takes no time at all before we cannot talk about anything, before absolute silence descends.” Then she gave the audience a command: “Now think about people’s hesitation to talk about race in this country.” Rankine directed her gaze forward and stopped speaking, creating space for contemplation, and coyly slipped on her glasses to punctuate the effect of her request.
In 2016, Rankine, along with a group of other creatives and activists, founded The Racial Imaginary Institute, or TRII, to engage with and demystify whiteness in American culture. The “cultural laboratory,” as the poet calls it, sponsors programming that includes art exhibitions, readings, and dialogues in cooperation with other groups and artists. TRII seeks to counteract the feeling of white endangerment in America that came to a head in 2016, despite continual white dominance. In the spirit of the mission of her organization, Rankine went on to discuss a number of mainstream, American poets with a disclaimer: “My ulterior motive here is partially an open invitation to consider both what you produce and how you read and critique within the frame of white dominance.”
To illustrate both the execution and the importance of this work, Rankine examined pieces by prominent poets including Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Robert Lowell, and Allen Ginsberg. Rankine used history, research, and literary selections to contextualize and expose both explicit and implicit racism within the American poetic canon. Beginning with Whitman, Rankine used analysis of the writer’s personal racism to preface her discussion of race in one of his most popular works, “Song of Myself.” She revealed the contradiction in Whitman’s advocacy of abolition alongside his desire to see the black race eradicated. His motivations in supporting abolition were not in the interest of human rights, but rather in the interest of eliminating the “black tide” taking jobs from working white men. Rankine used this context to frame the lack of racial awareness in Whitman’s work and the work of other writers.
“I really enjoyed the way she walked us through these kind of case studies of poets,” said audience member Caitlin E. Gianniny. “I don’t have a background in poetry, but doing that kind of breaking down of those kind of small shifts in language is a really interesting way to come at looking at that.” Gianniny said she is trying to write and to think more on whiteness herself.
“I love Claudia Rankine, I love ‘Citizen,’ and I really appreciated the kind of deep dive into the language of poetry and how white supremacy is evident in poetry,” said Bostonian Mardi J. Fuller. “It’s not something that I looked into before. It’s really provocative.”
Rankine closed her talk with a viewing of the opening of Stanley Kubrick’s 1999 film “Eyes Wide Shut,” with a recording of Tracie Morris’s book “eyes wide shut: a not neo-benshi read,” superimposed over the audio. The piece analyzes the racial and power dynamics of the movie in the form of clipped, repetitive sentences–the first one, eight repetitions of the phrase, “The scariest people in the world are not Black.” Rankine did not speak further, letting the work speak for itself.

The title of MIT List Visual Arts Center’s new exhibition, “Before Projection: Video Sculpture 1974-1995,” invites the viewers to see the works on display with historical context in mind. They are objects in the past tense, inevitably seen in comparison to the present tense—video installations that have been shaking up the art world since it became possible to put projectors in galleries. Among other things, the show serves as a reminder of the close relationship between artistic practice and technological advancement.
“In this world of glossy black screens, it is hard to remember that not so long ago watching television meant sitting in front of a boxy set on an appointed day and at a specific time,” wrote Henriette Huldisch, curator of the List Center, in the program notes. It should not be surprising, then, that many of the installations explore the relationship between the space and time in- and outside of the television set. Ernst Caramelle’s “Video-Ping-Pong,” for instance, puts two monitors on both sides of a table tennis table showing footage of a ping pong match, with the players’ heads displayed in life-size and in the same position as if they stood by the actual table. Another piece, Mary Lucier’s “Equinox,” is the result of her camera sensor getting increasingly burned with extended exposure to the sun. It displays damaged footage of sunrises on seven television sets.
Another thread in the exhibition is the materiality of the television set. The black cubic TV boxes have a natural sculptural quality, and the show examines the different ways artists explore this potential. For example, Takahiko Iimura’s “TV FOR TV” puts two monitors face to face, with a mere centimeter between them, making it hard for the audience to figure out what the screens are showing each other. However, several other artists explored the material nature of their medium without focusing on the black box. Shigeko Kubota’s “River” features the reflection of monitor images in water, making a remark on their artificiality as they get distorted when the water is stirred.
“We used to try to hide the television set [from galleries]. It was so difficult to figure out what to do with it, and people like Mary Lucier decided, wait a minute, this is the device of a new age medium,” said Joseph Ketner, chair in Contemporary Art Theory and Practice at Emerson College. “A young person today looks at one of those things, and they don’t think it’s television. They think it’s a monitor. But for our generation that was what the television came through, and for artworks to be on it was a completely radical notion,” he added. He later emphasized how the video sculpture movement was both a response to the technological changes of the time, and a challenge to look at these changes from a different angle.
The organizers made an effort to juxtapose canonical video art pieces with those little known in the United States, both to draw attention to underappreciated artists and to present a full picture of the artistic movement. The curator also reflected on the speed with which video sculptures went out of fashion once projectors came into the gallery. The exhibition raises the issue of how we should reevaluate art works once the technology that defines it becomes irrelevant.
“Before Projection: Video Sculpture 1974-1995” will be on view at MIT List Visual Arts Center from Feb. 8 to Apr 15.

“I’m teaching my daughters to be rude,” Danielle Lazarin said to listeners of her talk. On Feb. 13, Lazarin visited the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge to discuss her debut short story collection, “Back Talk,” and sign books afterward. The talk, hosted by Laura van den Berg, Briggs-Copeland Lecturer at Harvard University and author of the novel “Find Me,” traced Lazarin’s journey producing her new book.
Lazarin began by reading an excerpt from “Floor Plans,” a story she introduced as a key piece that guided her collection. The story follows a narrator in the process of selling her apartment after her husband asks for a divorce. Rather than focusing on the divorce, however, the story centers on the narrator’s newfound friendship with another woman who lives in the apartment next door. This relationship between women serves as the foundation for the rest of Lazarin’s collection.
Lazarin’s unembellished reading captured the essence of her book, which she noted revolves around women’s conversations with one another. “I’ve had so many conversations with friends, family, and, quite frankly, strangers,” she said, “One of the things I love about women is how quickly we get intimate with one other and how much we share with each other, just in the service of making other women not feel alone in the world.”
Lazarin said finding a voice to tell a story was a natural process. She explained that she began her stories while thinking of an image or a perspective. If she felt compelled to continue, she would find a voice to carry on the story. “Maybe it is a little bit like a spectral visit,” she said as the audience laughed. But she said the process of fleshing out a voice isn’t always easy. When complimented for giving the characters in each of her stories such distinctive voices—especially those written in first person—Lazarin revealed that she found writing in first person to be particularly challenging. “You don’t want it to sound like yourself,” she said.
Lazarin gave an honest assessment of her writing style: “I’m not a landscape writer.” With time, Lazarin found that she was able to better describe settings in her stories, which often take place in New York City. Influenced by her childhood in the Bronx, Lazarin became interested in writing about the outskirts of the city. Lazarin chose to set her stories in the less glamorous parts of New York to better connect with her readers, whom she felt might feel alienated from reading a “New York story.”
Lazarin’s own age also shaped the fabric of her stories. Lazarin wrote the first story for the collection in 2002 and the last in 2016. Lazarin noted that her life completely changed in 2009 when she moved back to New York with her one-year-old child, and that she could characterize her stories into two chunks: Those before and those after the move. Before 2009, Lazarin based many of her stories on mothers and children. On returning to New York in 2009, Lazarin revisited her stories from a new perspective as a mother herself.
Regarding the title of her collection, Lazarin recalled a moment from her childhood when a friend from California called her opinionated, a quality which others she knew deemed undesirable in a woman. “When I was a teenager, I was freer with my ideas and less afraid,” she said. Lazarin noted that, when she was in her 20s, she learned to tone down her “unbridled feelings, anger, and opinion” and noticed that many other women were doing the same. Drawing from these observations, Lazarin wrote about women who, instead of unleashing their inner turmoil, often chose to internalize it. In her stories, Lazarin explored this internal conversation within women living in a world that tells them to “stop talking and apologize for existing.”
Lazarin concluded with some thoughts on the power of choosing when to be vocal: “I published an essay on not conditioning girls to respond to compliments,” she said. In response to compliments like, “You’re pretty,” Lazarin chooses to remain silent. On thanking people for these compliments, Lazarin said, “It’s actually unnecessary.”
After the talk, audience members formed a line for the book signing. “I love that they’re doing this here. I think this event brings new ideas and people to Boston,” Cambridge resident Helena Turner said. “It’s my first time meeting her in real life. We’ve been Twitter friends for a while—I’ve enjoyed her presence on social media for a long time. I bought three copies of her book,” Lindsay Hatton, another Cambridge resident who attended Lazarin’s talk, said.
The event also attracted those unfamiliar with Lazarin and her work. “I didn’t know anything about the book—I’m excited to read it. I liked the way she talked about her process and how she wrote her stories over such a long period of time,” Lauren E. Cortese, a Cambridge resident, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1994, The Crimson published a letter to the editor from a conservative student from Indiana whose freshman year had been difficult because of his political views. He wrote about having to endure “the punches, scratches and cries of ‘Die, Republican dog.’” But Jose Mauricio Padilla ’97 was not like most conservatives on campus at the time because he is Latino.
Padilla is the son of two Honduran immigrants and was the only conservative among approximately fifty “Other Hispanics,” the category the College used at the time to refer to Latinos who were not of Mexican or Puerto Rican descent. The assumption from his classmates was that, because of his race and ethnicity, he’d be a liberal. This led to, in his own words, a series of “ethno-political struggles.”
Because of his political ideology, he sometimes found himself “feeling lonely and paranoid,” and unable to turn to other Latino students for support. “Sitting with conservative Anglos is supposed to deny me true Hispanic hood,” he wrote, “but sitting with other Latinos usually ends up in political discussion when I just want to eat.” While Padilla wore his Harvard Republican Club shirt at the Coop, “[a] sales person asked a couple of Hispanic girls if they required assistance, to which one answered, ‘No but you can help that sell-out over there.’”
Over the past two decades, instances of students of color contradicting the politics expected of them have become more common. The idea that certain ethnicities have to subscribe to certain politics have persisted, and voices contradicting that notion have followed. In 2016, Dan A. Valenzuela ’17-’18, the son of a Guatemalan cook and a Salvadoran housekeeper, wrote against identity politics. Last summer, Natalie Bao Tram Le penned a Crimson op-ed outlining why she, as a minority female at Harvard, was against PC culture.
As non-white students constitute a larger and larger percentage of the College, conservative students of color are sure to become an even more noticeable presence on campus. They, like Padilla did in 1994, will likely find themselves in a precarious position. Conservative students of color may be shunned in a cultural organization where the majority of members lean liberal. Seeking out organizations that speak to their race, ethnicity, culture, or upbringing becomes a challenge precisely because of their politics.
Belonging is a difficult thing to fully feel at Harvard. Conservatives of color should have a place where they can belong, and cultural groups should be that space. Not all Latinx students are involved with Fuerza Latina, and not all black students are involved in the Black Students Association. But cultural organizations do play a positive role in making many students of color feel accepted on campus. If a conservative student wants to be involved in a cultural group to find sense of belonging, they should be able to do so.
The central question then becomes how to make these organizations as open as possible—including to students who have right-leaning beliefs—while also respecting the collective needs of communities of color. This is where conservative students of color have to own the fact that their views lead to policies that actively hurt the communities of which they seek to be a part.
Ronald Reagan is the poster-child of conservatism, on this campus and elsewhere, but his presidency was disastrous for communities of color. The war on drugs escalated under his administration, sharply increasing the amount of people imprisoned in the United States. There were ten times as many people in prison for drug offenses in 2015 than there were in 1980. Black and Latinx people continue to be prosecuted for drug offenses more frequently than white people because of the campaign Reagan started.
On immigration, conservative lawmakers further hurt communities of color. In 2010, Republican senators blocked a DREAM Act that would have helped up to 500,000 young people of color. Obama was no angel when it came to immigration, but the Trump administration has been much worse. Deportations have increased, arrests of “non-criminal” immigrants have more than doubled, and immigrant families have been ripped apart by an ICE reenergized under Trump.
Conservatives of color belong in any space that they feel they have a stake in, including among communities of color. But to be accepted by those communities, they have to respect the way their ideology has informed damaging legislation and practices that disproportionately hurt those very groups. There are versions of conservatism that focus on an abstract desire for “smaller government” and “individualism,” but too often conservatism manifests in a way harmful to the communities from which black and brown Harvard students come.
Conservative policies often take communities of color as collateral. Conservative students of color at Harvard have to engage with that reality, especially when navigating the liminal space between their politics and the racial and ethnic communities of which they are a part.
Padilla was the only Latinx person in the town in Indiana where he grew up. Maybe that was precisely why he did not consider the link between his beliefs and their negative effects on Latinx communities. But the political landscape has changed dramatically since 1994. We now have a conservative president who does not hide his racism or vitriol. He is comfortable disparaging  Mexicans (they’re “rapists” and “criminals”), Muslims (“total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”), and poor black and Latinx Americans (“carnage” in “inner cities”). Now, more than ever, conservative students of color must explain what separates their politics from those damaging the communities that look, sound, and share multitudes with them.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was the Harvard Foundation’s 2016 Humanitarian of the Year. Currently, she oversees the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority in her country of Myanmar.
If Suu Kyi had received the Humanitarian Award a decade ago, Harvard could not have been faulted. In fact, when she came to the Institute of Politics in 2012 to deliver the prestigious Godkin Lecture, she was enthusiastically welcomed as an inspirational dissident and a champion of democracy who had just risen from years of imprisonment to political power. But it is extraordinarily difficult to reconcile Suu Kyi’s admirable history with her recent actions.
Who is she today?
Even in 2016, the Foundation’s selection of Suu Kyi as the Humanitarian of the Year was controversial. She had already been criticized by human rights advocates for refusing to even use the term “Rohingya” at all (the government maintains they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh). The New York Times had published an editorial earlier that year condemning her “cowardly stance” as she “continued an utterly unacceptable policy of the military rulers she succeeded.” Just three months after she received the honor, activists, including 13 fellow Nobel laureates (among them former Humanitarian Award recipients Malala Yousafzai and Desmond Tutu), published an open letter criticizing Suu Kyi for remaining silent on the persecution of the Rohingya, which “[amount] to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.”
While the Rohingya have been persecuted for years, the last several months have been especially horrific. The death toll in this recent span is likely over 10,000, and almost two-thirds of Myanmar’s one million Rohingya population have been forced to flee their homes as government soldiers kill those remaining and burn entire villages to the ground. The Associated Press has found evidence of mass graves and the systematic use of rape by Myanmar’s armed forces, which the United Nations has called a “calculated tool of terror.” The U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has called the conflict a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and could not rule out “elements of genocide.”
And journalist Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 has characterized Suu Kyi as the “chief apologist for this ethnic cleansing.” It isn’t her silence so much as her active defense of the military and her efforts to discredit documented atrocities. She has accused international aid groups of contributing to a “huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to [promote] the interests of the terrorists,” continuing to frame the campaign against the Rohingya as chiefly an anti-terrorist one. Her Facebook page has responded to widespread evidence of sexual violence with propaganda that these reports are “fake rape.”
Suu Kyi’s situation is complicated, as journalist Roger Cohen carefully analyzes. She is not the commander-in-chief of the military, with which she only shares power. Speaking out would alienate Buddhist nationalists, the military, and the general public which remains unsympathetic to the Rohingya. Given the circumstances, Cohen articulates the most sympathetic reading of her motivations: As a leader of a country that is not quite yet a unified nation, she is “playing a long game for real democratic change,” perhaps too cautiously but not indifferently.
Perhaps. Cohen quotes former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who says that with Suu Kyi, “the saint has become a politician.” Perhaps in the future her people will even remember her as a great one. Great, in the way nation builders are often revered, like Lee Kuan Yew, Atatürk, Simón Bolivár—that is to say, with relief that their turbulent works are in the past and a readiness to leave the complications behind with them.
Aung San Suu Kyi. A potential legacy as a tenacious nationalist then, but a humanitarian? No, not anymore, not for the Rohingya people suffering here and now.
This Tuesday, almost a year and a half after her selection, the Harvard Foundation released a statement urging Suu Kyi “to uphold her legacy as someone who was once a trailblazing proponent of peace and human rights in Myanmar.” While the Foundation’s statement is welcome, it is much too little, much too late. The time for light admonishment is long past.
Paranoid cries of “fake news” and blanket categorizations of people as illegal immigrants or terrorists should sound familiar to us. It is remarkable that, especially in this day—when we boycott the wrong fast food restaurant, refuse to watch the wrong director’s work, and campaign to divest from the wrong companies—we equivocate on what is tantamount to genocide.
Suu Kyi has faced and continues to face decisions that we do not. But her calculus does not need to be ours. Former Governor Bill Richardson, a long-time friend of Suu Kyi, resigned from her advisory board last month, calling it a “whitewash.” Students at institutions like Oxford and London School of Economics have revoked her past honors because they too understand the patina of respectability such endorsements lend. Harvard should join them in unequivocally rescinding ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past September, the religious group Harvard College Faith and Action pressured a bisexual assistant Bible course leader to step down from that leadership position following her decision to date another woman. This decision—in rationale, execution, and aftermath—reflects a series of deeply troubling actions on the part of the organization, including and especially by its leaders.
The decision to press the woman to leave her role was a direct violation of the Harvard College Student Handbook policy that dictates nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Despite HCFA’s denial that it had violated the handbook’s policy, there was no reason why its leadership should not have expected the College to see differently and mete out penalties, which ultimately came in the form of a year-long “administrative probation” for the club. The decision to pressure the student in question to step down from her role therefore most likely had perverse, existential consequences for HCFA, jeopardizing benefits that students of faith derive from the organization.
Furthermore, the relationship between HCFA and Christian Union—an umbrella organization that offers HCFA, in the words of HCFA’s co-presidents, “pastoral, spiritual, and financial support”—merits further investigation. In fact, it was one of HCFA’s ministry fellows—an employee of Christian Union—that learned of the same-sex relationship in question and played a significant role in setting in motion the process of removing the woman from leadership. While HCFA’s undergraduate leaders claim that all decisions made by the group are fully their own, this dynamic necessitates investigation as to whether Christian Union impedes the “local autonomy” HCFA must exhibit, per the student handbook.
Ultimately, issues of College policy aside, HCFA’s decision to remove a leader for being in a same-sex relationship is nothing short of morally egregious. That said, the College has meted out penalties, and an analysis of the situation must turn to the specificities of the punishment itself and the changes that HCFA must make.
As a start, HCFA must come clean in explaining their rationale. In its statement to The Crimson, its leadership cited “theological disagreement” over “extramarital sex,” and not the same-sex relationship specifically, as the grounds for asking the leader in question to step down. However, given The Crimson’s recent reporting—in which several current and former members of HCFA indicated that the woman was removed for her same-sex relationship—we find HCFA’s explanation holds little water. We believe that the rehabilitation of HCFA needs to start with honesty and full disclosure.
That said, the College itself also owes HCFA and the student body clarity. Thus far, Harvard has been vague about the details of the year-long “probation.” Frankness on the policy’s specifics is vital, especially given that this is reportedly the first time such a probation has been imposed and that the College has been thus far opaque regarding which privileges are being stripped. The College should be fully transparent about the ramifications for HCFA’s actions.
Of course, external judgement must be met with internal reform if HCFA is to persist. The club should be prompt, honest, and public in its apology to the woman who was asked to leave her role. The comments made by the leadership of HCFA do not publicly express anywhere near the remorse warranted by their actions.
As Christian Union itself asserts, the only way to change a culture is from the top down. Especially given that HCFA only has a year to come into compliance with the College’s rules and standards, we believe any real change in culture necessitates a change in leadership. Thus, we believe that everyone in the club involved in this decision should step down as part of their apology and their commitment to creating a Christian group where all students of faith feel welcome.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences saw a 2 percent increase in applications from abroad this year, bucking a downward trend in international applications at graduate schools across the country.
A survey released last month by the Council of Graduate Schools—which examined Fall 2017 admissions numbers from 175 American graduate schools, including Harvard—showed a three percent decline in international applications since Fall 2016. It marks the first time in more than a decade that overseas interest has dropped.
Applications from the Middle East and North Africa declined sharply across the country for the second year, a decrease that comes after Trump administration travel bans aimed at foreign nationals from several countries in the region.
“Since the issuance of the travel ban, the graduate education community has carefully monitored changes in the flow of international graduate students from the Middle East and North Africa region,” the report read. “The 175 institutions contributing data for both Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 reported, in aggregate, a decline in both final applications (-17%) and first-time graduate enrollment (-5%) from this region.”
In Jan. 2017, Harvard affiliates from countries affected by the first ban faced uncertainty over their immigration status, and a group of graduate students petitioned Faust to provide additional support for international students. Harvard has provided legal resources and offered to extend the graduate students' G-clocks—a measurement of the number of years students have been studying towards a PhD—among other measures.
Since GSAS does not release data on the regional makeup of students or applicants, it is unclear whether Harvard has experienced a decline in interest from the region. International applications overall, though, are up slightly, according to GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall. Currently, 30 percent of the school's roughly 4,200 students come from outside the U.S.
Hall attributed GSAS’s success in attracting international applicants to a new master’s program in data science, which the school announced last March.
“GSAS saw a two percent increase in the number of international applicants during the 2017–2018 admissions season, in part due to strong interest from international applicants in a new master’s degree program in data science,” Hall wrote in an email.
David-Maximilian “Max” Vani, who represents GSAS on the Harvard Graduate Council, praised GSAS’s efforts to aid prospective international students.
“Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences remains an attractive place for international students due to a variety of factors,” Vani said. “The school administrators have pledged to show some flexibility for admitted students who may be facing problems due to recent travel restrictions and natural disasters. I think this appeals to the school's international audience.”

The unprecedented federal tax on university  endowments will likely have a "pretty significant" impact on Harvard's ability to fund certain initiatives, though it is unlikely to change Harvard's investment strategy, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview earlier this month.
The new tax—passed by Congress in December—requires universities with endowments greater than $500,000 per full-time student to pay 1.4 percent on investment gains. Harvard is among the 35 schools that could pay tens of millions in total taxes per year. According to an estimate by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 last November, Harvard would have paid $43 million if the tax was in effect in 2017.
According to some business professors, the Harvard Management Company—stewards of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—is  unlikely to alter its investment strategy given the relatively low tax rate. While Faust said she didn’t expect the tax to have a “gigantic impact” on the University’s investment strategy, she said the tax will “have a big impact on what those investments are able to fund."
“What [the endowment tax] will do is put constraints on our ability to fund the variety of undertakings that are central to our mission—financial aid and research, public programs, the variety of endeavors across the University," Faust said. “Its ultimate impact will be on limiting the growth in the endowment, and the growth in the endowment is what funds the programs.”
In 2017, the University gave over $561 million in total scholarships and other student awards.
Faust said that since each of the University's schools have "differential dependence on the endowment," the excise tax will impact each school differently.
Faust said the Divinity School, which relies heavily on the endowment, would be most affected. The School of Public Health—whose operating budget depends more on annual grants from NIH and other government agencies than on the endowment— would be among the least affected schools.
According to the University financial report for fiscal year 2017, 73 percent of the Divinity School’s operating budget comes from endowment income, compared to only 16 percent for the School of Public Health. In 2017, Divinity School expenses totaled $41.7 million.
Faust said the effect of the tax on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—which includes Harvard College—would also be “significant.” In 2017, 52 percent of the operating revenue for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was funded by the endowment.
In an interview last month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he is wary of committing to long-term projects while the full impact of the tax is still unknown.
“It will have an impact on us,” Smith said. “It is taking money we could’ve used for academic programs, could've used for financial aid, could've used for a bunch of other things we try to accomplish here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will install side guards on large trucks to increase cyclist and pedestrian safety, according to a University announcement Wednesday. The guards will be installed on both Harvard-owned trucks as well as those owned by outside vendors.
Without side guards, bikers and pedestrians can end up in the space between the front and rear wheels of a truck during a side collision before being swept beneath the rear wheels. Side guards prevent this from happening by covering this exposed space.
Harvard’s Office for Sustainability led the initiative in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe Center and other University departments. The program was developed over the past year to align with the Volpe Side Guard Standard, which provides technical specifications for the guards depending on the size of the vehicle.
In the past six years, 10 of 16 bicyclist deaths in the Boston and Cambridge area have involved large trucks. According to Volpe, the national side guard mandate in the United Kingdom decreased cyclist fatalities initiated by a side collision with a large truck by 61 percent and decreased pedestrian fatalities by 20 percent.
Harvard is the second higher education institution in the United States to install side guards on large vehicles. The University of Washington implemented a similar program in 2015.

Amid turmoil in Washington over immigration reform, Harvard administrators are doing “everything we can possibly think of” to push for legislation securing legal protections for undocumented students and staff, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview earlier this month.
“We are committed to our undocumented students and their security and safety and their ability to continue with their programs of study and likewise, the TPS individuals—many of whom are employees—have for the most part been in the United States for a very long time,” Faust said.
Faust said earlier this month the University planned to communicate with the Massachusetts congressional delegation about the importance of passing definitive legislation on immigration. She pointed to an open letter penned by four Harvard Medical School students protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama era program that provides protections for undocumented youth—last month as a piece of “data and information” that the University can give to the delegation.
The letter was “good ammunition for our delegation to use as examples of kinds of positive contributions that undocumented individuals are making,” she said.
Faust has been an outspoken advocate for undocumented students and immigrants at Harvard and in higher education broadly. She has signed letters, appeared on national television, and met with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to voice her support for immigration reform.
Her activism around Temporary Protected Status—a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters—is more recent. After the Trump administration rescinded protections for individuals from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Sudan in recent months, 50 University affiliates rallied last month to petition Faust to take more decisive action on the issue. TPS-holding workers at Harvard submitted a letter to Faust, writing that the change in federal policy could have ramifications for dozens of University employees.
The following day, Faust penned a letter to House and Senate leadership, urging lawmakers pass legislation protecting TPS-holders.
In the interview, Faust also said she has provided advice to Senate Minority Whip Richard “Dick” J. Durbin that he has “used in Senate speeches” on immigration legislation.
“I also have worked closely for many years now with Senator Dick Durbin, asking him what he would advise in terms of political strategy on the Hill,” Faust said.
Durbin visited campus in January to discuss immigration reform at the Institute of Politics, where around 100 University affiliates confronted him in protest. Protesters said they rallied against what they called Senate Democrats’ eagerness to reopen the government without a deal on immigration after a three-day shutdown last month. Durbin was one of the 33 Democrats who voted to end the shutdown.
In addition to immigration legislation, Faust has also raised concerns about the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, specifically its potential impacts on the affordability of higher education.
“There are a lot of elements in the act right now that are concerning, elements that have to do with student financial aid, Federal Work Study, a number of measures that I think would have a negative impact on higher education and student affordability so we are very concerned about those,” Faust said.
The Higher Education Act, originally passed in 1965, authorizes the federal student financial aid program, and includes provisions for programs such as Pell Grants, the Federal Work Study Program, and loan repayment plans for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.
Republican House lawmakers’ proposed overhaul, called the PROSPER Act, would restructure loan repayment plans and eliminate Federal Work Study and public service loan forgiveness for graduate and professional students, among other changes. The legislation passed a House committee 23-17 in December but has yet to move to the full House or Senate for a vote.
In a Faculty meeting earlier this month, Faust expressed her concerns about the legislation as it currently stands, but said many of the aforementioned provisions may face challenges in the Senate.
“There’s a lot of stuff being put into this bill that may or may not survive, so we’d like to see how it unfolds,” Faust said in an interview.
Faust said she has had conversations over the years with Senator Lamar Alexander about earlier versions of proposals to reauthorize the Act. Alexander, who is the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said he hopes to have a Senate version of the current reauthorization “by early spring.”
Alexander has expressed a desire to pass bipartisan legislation through an approach that would differ from that of House Republicans, who passed their version of the bill despite dissent from Democrats, who complained of being shut out of the process. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who is also on the committee, has warned of streamlining loans and grants without preserving the total amount of aid.
Faust said earlier this month, though, that her advocacy efforts have recently focused more on the Republican tax overhaul, which instituted an“unprecedented” endowment tax in December. Faust said in early February that after that legislation became law, she has focused on its impact on the University’s $37.1 billion endowment.
“I’ve been so focused on the tax bill that I really haven’t done much so far on the Higher Education bill at this iteration,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: February 24, 2018 at 9:30 p.m.
David W. Miliband, president and CEO of the International Refugee Committee, discussed the global refugee crisis with Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns at an Institute of Politics event Thursday evening.
At the event, entitled “The Refugee Crisis and What Can Be Done About It,” Miliband and Burns, who served as the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs during the Bush administration, discussed ongoing humanitarian challenges in Syria, connecting the issue to a broader “forgotten crisis” of global population displacement.
Miliband, the former foreign secretary for the United Kingdom, also discussed areas of concern for the International Rescue Committee, as well as shifting public opinion and political rhetoric on refugees in United States and Europe.
“The most striking thing about the refugee crisis is not its size, but its nature. Sixty percent of refugees are in urban areas, not in camps,” Miliband said. “The figures show that once you’ve been a refugee for five years, the average is 21 years of displacement, defying again the assumption that the job of a refugee or humanitarian system is to just keep you alive until you go home. Less than two percent of the world’s refugees went home last year.”
Burns—who moderated the event—focused his questions on Syria, emphasizing the role of the U.S. and the U.K. in reducing the impact of the country’s ongoing civil war.
“It is important for the community to recognize the crisis,” Burns said. “We can do a lot, but we’re doing very little.”
In an interview before the event, Burns noted domestic and immigration policies in the U.S. can have a significant impact on refugees.
“We’re an immigrant nation. E pluribus unum. That’s who we are,” Burns said.
A large part of the event involved a question and answer period, during which Miliband and Burns fielded queries from members of the audience.
In response to a question on the International Rescue Committee’s resources and the scope of the crisis, Miliband said part of his organization’s work involves de-emphasizing statistics and focusing on individuals.
“The question is, do we owe them anything, to people who are different from us or in need? If you have the capacity to help someone, and you don’t, what does it say about you?” Miliband said.
One attendee, Raphaelle Soffe ’21, commented on Miliband’s passion for the issue.
“He’s very practically-minded in identifying what’s wrong with the refugee crisis, but he’s also providing solutions. He’s very knowledgeable in the different areas and is really aware of the concerns that are facing different countries, different cultures, different situations, and different political climates,” Soffe said.

Harvard School of Dental Medicine Dean R. Bruce Donoff jokes that his biggest accomplishment is making 80 percent of the University aware his school exists.
With just 240 total students, the Dental School boasts a much lower enrollment than the majority of Harvard’s other professional schools—and many other dental schools. The school graduates 35 D.M.D.s per year, a number smaller than the graduating classes at many American high schools.
The school also has a small physical footprint, occupying just two buildings in the shadow of the Harvard Medical School, located in Longwood, Mass.
But despite his school’s diminutive size and relatively low profile, Donoff is himself a Harvard fixture. He can claim one of the longest tenures of any current dean of Harvard’s twelve schools.
From his spacious office overlooking Longwood Avenue in Boston, Donoff—who became dean in 1991—looks back on nearly three decades at the helm of one of Harvard’s smallest schools. He has seen thousands of students pass through campus to earn D.M.D. degrees across the years.
Donoff has also guided the Dental School through the tenures of three Harvard presidents, groundswell shifts in how dentistry is taught, and, most recently, a successful capital campaign. Throughout these changes, colleagues and friends say he has remained committed to his core priorities: education, research, and care.
Donoff grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he graduated from Brooklyn College with a chemistry degree in 1963.  He came to Harvard, earning a D.M.D. from the Dental School in 1967 and an M.D. from the Medical School in 1973.
Donoff said he found Harvard attractive because of its integration of dentistry and medicine—dental students spend a substantial part of their time on campus taking classes at the Medical School.
While he was studying at Harvard, Donoff chose to specialize in oral and maxillofacial surgery, participating in a then-pilot program that sought to combine general and oral surgery. Donoff said this program has since inspired 60 similar initiatives across the country.
“Harvard has that ability to develop programs that might be of benefit in a more general way,” he said.
After completing his residency, Donoff rose through the ranks of the Dental School faculty—and all the way to the deanship. On the way, he also served a decade as chief of service for oral and maxillofacial surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he continues to accept new patients.
One of Donoff’s major projects as dean involved the 2000s-era construction of the new Research and Education Building at the Dental School, completed during Lawrence H. Summers’s time as University President. Donoff says the building doubled the school’s size.
“I remember going and launching the new building, breaking ground on the new building for the Dental School,” Summers said in an interview Wednesday. “During my time as president, Dean Donoff did a great job as dean of the Dental School.”
Even now, as he approaches the third decade of his deanship, Donoff continues to stay very actively involved in the school’s day-to-day operations.
For the last two years, Donoff has served on the admissions committee at the Dental School. The school receives nearly a thousand applications each year, according to the 2016 dean’s report.
As dean of the Dental School, Donoff said one of his foremost priorities has been the integration of oral and general medicine.
Jane R. Barrow, associate dean for global and community health at the Dental School, said she returned to the Dental School from another position at Harvard at Donoff’s request in order to help bring together oral health and primary care.
“I thought that he had a very unique perspective on oral health and how it fits into overall health and medicine,” she said.
The school’s “Initiative to Integrate Oral Health and Medicine” was established in 2014. It aims to “fully integrate oral health into health care education, delivery and financing,” according to the initiative’s website. Early corporate supporters include Colgate-Palmolive, Philips Oral Healthcare, and insurance company DentaQuest.
“Our vision is to break down barriers between dental health and general health,” Donoff said.
The initiative’s research has found that investments in oral health can reduce primary care costs significantly by keeping chronic illnesses at bay, according to Donoff.
Chloe A. Wong, a fourth-year student at the Dental School, said Donoff’s desire to merge dental and general health positively affects students’ experiences at the school.
“His philosophy has trickled into how we learn dentistry, what dentistry means, and how to practice it in the future,” she said.
The school’s newly redesigned “Pathways” curriculum exhibits this philosophy. It also includes a move from lecture-based instruction to hands-on and virtual learning.
“We added some early rotations in hospital-based programs, like oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral medicine, [and] pediatric dentistry,” Donoff said.
Donoff has been at the Dental School for nearly his entire professional career. People who know him well, though, say he has not changed—he has remained committed to helping students and advancing dental education generally.
Donoff’s colleagues say the dean is accessible to students and devoted to their success.
“He has a very open-door policy. My impression and belief is that the students feel comfortable going into see him and telling him what’s on their minds,” Barrow said.
Vice Dean of the Dental School John Da Silva said he first met Donoff in the 1980s, when Da Silva was a Harvard dental student training at Massachusetts General Hospital.
“He was very student-centric. I mean, he really was interested in making sure that when we there as students at the hospital, that we had a chance to see and do things,” Da Silva said.
Barrow particularly pointed to daily afternoon teas at the dental school as an example of the dean’s willingness to mingle with students on a regular basis.
Donoff himself also said the Dental School’s “community-oriented” nature sets it apart from other institutions.
“It’s a very special place,” he said.
And Donoff seems to have no plans to leave it.
Instead, Donoff is looking toward the incipient tenure of the University’s 29th president, Lawrence S. Bacow. Bacow, a member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—will take office in July 2018 after current President Drew G. Faust steps down.
Donoff said he is broadly confident in Bacow’s ability to lead Harvard across the next several years. During Bacow’s time on the Corporation, he was assigned to particularly focus on the Dental and Medical schools, Donoff said.
“He exhibited the kind of qualities that I think epitomize good leadership: He listened, he was humble, he asked good questions, he was interested in students,” Donoff said.
The dean said he recommended Bacow as a potential president to the Board of Overseers last fall.
Donoff identified funding and budgetary issues as among the biggest challenges Harvard’s next president will face. Last year, Congress passed an endowment tax that would have cost the University $43 million if it had been in place in fiscal year 2017, and President Trump has proposed deep cuts to research funding.
Still, Donoff said he is optimistic about Bacow’s ability to surmount these hurdles.
“He’s going to have the challenge of maintaining Harvard as the leader in so many areas, but in a way that is humble, understanding, and presents opportunities rather than separation,” he said. “And I think he’ll do that.”
If history is any indication, Donoff will be there to see it.

Amid traffic congestion concerns, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is considering a trial run of a designated bus lane connecting West and South Allston.
The proposed bus lane was announced at an Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee meeting two weeks ago. Steve A. Borne, a Boston police officer from District 14, said at the event that the MBTA will spearhead a trial “zip lane” for buses on Brighton Ave. The lane would extend between the Jackson-Mann school to Harvard Ave.
Traffic and transit issues have been a common theme at Allston community meetings over the past several months. Allston residents have asked Harvard to support incorporating more open space and bike paths to the University’s development plans in the neighborhood.
Harvard’s proposals for its properties in Allston include building an “enterprise research” campus to promote entrepreneurship. The University first proposed developing a 36-acre lot of land in Allston to an innovation hub in 2011. In Dec. 2017, Harvard officially filed plans for the entire campus with the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the city’s urban planning body.
Monica Tibbits-Nutt, a freshman proctor and a member of the MBTA’s Fiscal and Management Control Board, said she believes having designated bus lanes in Allston could reduce traffic congestion in the area.
“Not only do [designated bus lanes] obviously speed up the commute of the buses, but it actually speeds up the traffic itself, because you’re removing the amount of weaving in and out,” she said. “What creates congestion is the weaving in and out of traffic—the more lanes you add the worse the congestion actually gets.”
Tibbits-Nutt added these bus lanes would create a safer environment on the roads.
“From a safety standpoint, having less of this merging in and out just makes our roadways significantly safer, and I think the residents would benefit from it, whether you’re on the bus or in your car,” she said.
Tibbits-Nutt noted that the MBTA would like to implement designated bus lanes throughout the Commonwealth, but for now, designated bus lanes in Allston, at least, were still “just a suggestion.”
“It has not come before the board,” she said. “We’re probably just going to have a boatload full of questions, and it’s going to be a lot of back and forth before we would ever have it come to a vote.”
“If we can do it from an engineering standpoint and we can do it from a safety standpoint, I’m going to push for it because I think it’s the best decision we can make to make that interchange a lot better,” Tibbits-Nutt added, noting she planned to support the proposal.
University representatives declined to comment on the possible bus-only lane.

Responding to an increased number of virtual learners, the Extension School has grown its online course catalog significantly over the past few years, according to the dean of the Division of Continuing Education.
Just four years ago, the Extension School offered 200 online courses, a number that has since tripled to 600, according to Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the Division of Continuing Education. The Extension School offers a total of roughly 900 courses and is part of the Division of Continuing Education, which serves roughly 20,000 students annually.
“Online education certainly is here to stay, it's not going away,” said Harry R. Lewis ’67, a Computer Science professor. “And, it creates great opportunities.”
The Division of Continuing Education first began offering online courses in 1997, but those were restricted to computer science classes. The division is housed under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“Encouraged by the response to these courses, we started to expand into [other] subject areas: humanities, social science subjects,” said Henry H. Leitner, a Computer Science professor.
Each year, over 14,000 of the division’s 20,000 students study at the Extension School, with approximately 65 percent taking courses online, according to Lambert. The increased number of online courses has allowed the Extension School to expand both to part-time adult learners and remote students.
“I really consider the DCE to be a very important part of Harvard because Harvard is regarded by most of the world as a pretty inaccessible place,” Lewis said, referring to the Division of Continuing Education.
“The Extension School not only opens the doors of Harvard to an audience of people who because of their life circumstances never even had the opportunity to even consider going to Harvard, but it also brings the Harvard education to a large and diverse population.”
But the Division of Continuing Education is not the only arm of Harvard to offer online courses. HarvardX, a University-wide initiative launched in 2012, enables faculty members to develop online courses for distance learners. A report released in December 2016 found that students taking courses on Harvard and MIT’s edX platform took less time to complete courses than students enrolled in the on-campus equivalents.
Lewis said the Extension School also allows Harvard as a whole to connect with the local community.
“It’s valuable in the interest in distance education, but I think it’s equally important that adults in the city of Cambridge, the city of Boston, and the immediate surrounding communities, are physically able to come to Harvard at night when they’re not working and be taught by Harvard faculty and faculty who are offering instruction of Harvard quality,” Lewis said.
However, virtual education still brings unique new challenges. Leitner said one that comes with online courses is the social detachment some students face.
“You can walk out with them and talk about what just happened, which was a very natural way of communicating. Whereas online it's different,” Leitner said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sean Miyashiro, the founder of media entertainment company 88rising, and Chinese hip-hop group Higher Brothers visited campus Thursday afternoon to discuss Asian hip-hop, cultural appropriation, and 88rising’s future.
The event, hosted by the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association and Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, drew hundreds of students from universities across the Boston area, including Harvard, Northeastern University, Wellesley College, MIT, and Berklee College of Music.
88rising, a media entertainment company founded in 2015, initially sought to fill a cultural gap and “bridge East and West to celebrate Asian youth culture,” Miyashiro said.
“For Asians and Asian Americans and just Asian youth globally, there’s no real home on the Internet, or a company consistently putting out things that either include Asian talent or Asian viewpoints in stories,” he said. “That was just the inception of everything.”
VICE News culture correspondent Dexter Thomas moderated the event.
“It’s really infrequent that you have somebody who knows about Asian culture and somebody who knows about black culture in the same room at the same time,” Thomas said, referring to Miyashiro and himself. “This is just rare, I think.”
“Harvard exclusive,” Miyashiro quipped.
The Higher Brothers, a group of four rappers from Chengdu, China, said they had been looking forward to touring in the U.S. for a long time.
“We love hip hop. We love rap music. It’s from here, so we need to be here,” MaSiWei, one of the group members, said. “We need to tour here, take a look around here so we can know the culture. We should learn the history.”
The Higher Brothers answered audience questions—some in English, some in Mandarin—about their increasing popularity, touching upon their experiences as rappers in a nation that recently banned television programs featuring any hip-hop content.
The Higher Brothers said they would continue in the spirit of Chinese hip-hop, which focuses on themes of chasing dreams and pursuing their lifestyle of choice.
Despite censorship abroad, artists affiliated with 88rising continue to make a splash both domestically and internationally, Miyashiro said, pointing to 18-year-old Indonesian rapper Rich Brian as an example.
“Brian’s content is not filtered,” Miyashiro said. “But somehow, and I don’t know why, but it’s something that exists and isn’t being taken down [in China]. And I think that a lot of American music is still being streamed out there too.”
Miyashiro said 88rising has never sought to limit itself to an Asian American audience.
“When somebody comes on to our YouTube channel, we never want to give the feeling that it’s not for somebody. Or like ‘Hey, I don’t belong here, because this is so Asian,’” Miyashiro said.
“I think it’s an interesting space that 88rising occupies,” said Alexander Zhang ’20, one of the co-presidents of CSA, who helped organize the event.  “It’s at the intersection of a lot of different cultures, and not a lot of people know about it yet. But they’re obviously getting bigger.”
This intersection of cultures was an important focal point for the discussion, especially as it shifted to issues of cultural appropriation in Asian hip-hop music.
“Love for any music will obviously inspire passion, and passion inspires people to create,” Miyashiro said. “It’s the intent that I think can be scrutinized. For us, it all stems from a place of true love.”
Several students said they appreciated the time the event devoted to discussing cultural appropriation.
“That’s what caught my attention—that integration between China and mainstream hip-hop there, and mainstream hip-hop here,” Sami Kebede, a senior at MIT, said. “I wanted to see how they thought, and see how they bridged the gap.”
Miyashiro said 88rising tries to remain conscious of the cultural implications of its work.
“So much of what I’ve seen from 88rising is just the content,” Sun-Ui Yum ’18 said. Yum said he appreciated the opportunity to hear the driving forces behind the final products.

UPDATED: March 20, 2018 at 2:05 a.m.
Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira said in an interview earlier this month he thinks students don’t fully understand their health insurance options.
He explained that students have access to different services depending on whether they are enrolled in Harvard’s Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance or use their parent’s insurance and just pay a student health fee.
“Students often forget that Health Services is both an insurance program and a clinic delivering clinical care,” he said.
According to Barreira, HUHS has five locations, including facilities for both primary care and more specialized services like dermatology and gynecology.
“We’re a multi-speciality, out-patient practice meaning besides primary care we have all kinds of speciality services here. Dermatology, eye services, GI services, neurology services, OBGYN services,” Barreira said.
The reason HUHS is able to provide so much support is because it, unlike most other universities, supports both faculty and students, Barreira said.
According to Barreira, 60 percent of students at the College stay on their parents insurance, rather than partaking in Harvard insurance. But the student health fee, without additionally purchasing insurance,  does not cover any non-HUHS visits. Ninety-five percent of the services provided by HUHS, though, are covered by the student health fee alone, Barreira said.
Barreira added that HUHS has increased the number of mental health-related visits that a student who is on the Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance can have from 10-12 to 40 mental health-related visits a year without a review.
“So nobody’s calling and saying justify the fact that you’re seeing this person weekly, essentially, while they’re on college campus,” Barreira said.
Barreira also said Blue Cross Blue Shield’s amount of visits permitted is rather unique, noting for other insurance companies “20 would be generous.”
“You have to take my word for it there’s no insurance company that gives you 40 visits a year without a review,” he said.
Barreira said this change will substantially benefit students and help more students receive counseling than the University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services alone can provide; even with 40 counselors and psychiatrists, he said, CAMHS has to create capacity in creative ways.
Additionally, as of two years ago, UHS no longer charges students who are on Harvard’s insurance a $35 co-pay fee for the first eight counseling visits at clinics anywhere in the U.S. This change has lead to a 300 percent increase.
“We realized that the co-pay could be a barrier for some students,” Barreira said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:
CORRECTION: March 20, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that HUHS's policy of not charging students for their first eight counseling visits only applies to local clinics. In fact, this policy applies to clinics anywhere in the U.S.
CLARIFICATION: March 20, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated HUHS has increased the number of visits a student who is on Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance can have per year without a review. To clarify, HUHS has increased the number of mental health-related visits a student who is on Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance can have per year without a review.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hidden in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last year is a change in the way taxes are calculated for nonprofits that could lead to increased expenses for Harvard.
The act slapped a 1.4 percent tax on some university endowments, a impost which administrators have estimated would have cost Harvard $43 million in fiscal year 2017. The tax, which University President Drew G. Faust has called “unprecedented,” saw widespread media coverage.
But Congress also mandated a less-noticed change in the way Unrelated Business Income Tax is calculated that could mean more expense and paperwork for Harvard.
UBIT imposes a tax, similar to those imposed on for-profit companies, on trades or businesses of a nonprofit deemed “unrelated” to that organization’s purpose. These unrelated businesses could include hotels, bookstores, and food courts.
Tax-exempt organizations are required to file publicly available Internal Revenue Service forms that detail the organization’s unrelated businesses. Harvard’s 2014 list of unrelated business activities—a list filed in 2016—includes hotel operations, partnerships managed by Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm, and parking lots.
Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed, universities could offset gains and losses from different lines of business to reduce their taxable income under UBIT.
In fiscal years ending in 2015 and 2014, forms Harvard filed with the IRS show more than $30 million in unrelated business income. But, after incorporating deductions, unrelated business taxable income dwindled to $0.
With the new law, each unrelated business will be taxed individually, which will prevent Harvard from offsetting losses between unrelated businesses.
Elizabeth L. Clark, senior director of federal affairs for the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said she thinks the change in the law could burden universities.
“Colleges and universities not only will perhaps see some new tax liability, they also face a completely new paperwork regime when it comes to tracking activities,” Clark said.
Harvey P. Dale, a New York University Law School professor, said the original purpose of UBIT was to treat tax-exempt and taxed institutions equivalently in businesses in which they might compete.
“The purpose of the law, everybody said, was to level the playing field,” said Dale, “but that has eroded over time.”
Dale said he thinks this justification for UBIT is flawed. He specifically cited the fact that the IRS reporting requirement of UBIT does not apply to for-profit organizations. He said he thinks the new law widens the gap between nonprofit and for-profit groups.
“This change just adds to the disparity, because for-profit corporations can indeed, and by all means do, offset their losses from one business against the profits from another business,” Dale said.
It remains unclear exactly how the new law will affect nonprofits, and the IRS has yet to release official guidelines.
“I think we will see guidance emerge from the IRS and the Treasury over the coming weeks and months, but I think there’s no way to predict what kind of timeline they’re on,” Clark said.
Ofer Lion, a partner at a Los Angeles law firm who specializes in tax-exempt organizations, said there are lingering questions regarding how universities will be allowed to group different lines of businesses to reduce taxes.
University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is still assessing the impact of the change to UBIT.
“The University is aware of the UBIT siloing issue and we are assessing its potential impact as we await IRS guidance,” Jackson said.

In over 14 seasons in the NBA, Bryan Doo had experienced it all. Winning an NBA Championship in 2008. Sitting directly behind Doc Rivers on the Celtics bench. Working side-by-side with Hall of Famers like Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.
A new calling came, however, for the long-time strength coach and mainstay within the Celtics organization this past summer. After the front office made some structural changes, Doo decided to move on from Boston and embrace a new challenge in his career.
Shortly after, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker reached out.
Doo had known the 11-year Crimson coach “from a bunch of years” and had also been contacted separately by Harvard Assistant Director of Strength & Conditioning, Luke Osberg. Clearly, interest was high within Harvard Athletics for Bryan’s services and experience working at the highest level of professional basketball.
Despite likely offers elsewhere, Doo soon accepted a role in the men’s basketball program as an assistant strength coach and program mentor.
“To me, Harvard is always an elite program,” Doo said. “If you are thinking about being associated with anything—especially from the pro level—something like Harvard, you always want your name associated with Harvard.”

Doo’s presence around the young Crimson team has been invaluable, earning him praise from coaches and players alike. Although Doo credits Osberg for being the lead man in organizing schedules and workout routines, his advising role has nevertheless left a noticeable mark on the program.
“I love B-Doo!” sophomore wing Justin Bassey said. “Coach Doo has been amazing to have on the team. He brings such great insight and he’s been around a lot of professional teams. He has so much experience and so many novel workouts or stretches, anything that he brings to the table is completely new to me and really helpful in recovery and preparing for games, strength, and training.”
Although “B-Doo” gained widespread notoriety in those Celtics years for his signature pre-game handshakes and PB&J sandwiches, the strength coach has made an impact in more subtle ways while on campus. In describing his new role, Doo used words like “sniper” and “street cred”.
“Luke [Osberg] has to think about the general picture of the team,” Doo said. “I can be that little sniper coming from side-to-side just picking up stuff. In the whole is it going to make a huge difference? Maybe not. But if I can help a guy maybe five percent, that to me is a big deal, long-term.”
Doo’s mentorship of Osberg was another important reason why Amaker brought him into the ranks. Entering his fourth year with Harvard Athletics, the Bridgewater State graduate noted how having Doo as an “extra pair of eyes” has helped tremendously in his overall professional development.
With Osberg also managing the workout programs of five other varsity sports, having that ability to turn to someone like Doo has been instrumental in controlling some of the “organized chaos” that comes with the job.
“Balancing out all my teams, I kind of have to rely on my co-workers and Bryan to help,” Osberg said. “Our interns as well, we have a great number of interns that help out with our program. I rely on them a lot. I am pretty thankful for all my help that I get here to balance out my teams. There is a method to the madness and everything, but I have my roles that I have and everyone else is helping me out a great amount.”
Aside from his technical support, Doo’s infectious enthusiasm and NBA experience has made him particularly popular in the weight room as a source for interesting stories. Although most in the program were reticent in giving detailed narratives, Amaker spoke to the big-picture value of having a character like Doo around the team.
“They probably have egged him on for stories and things like that,” Amaker said. “That’s part of the greatness of having him around. Being able to impart the wisdom and stories and fun things that he can bring to our basketball program so we are very pleased and happy to have him onboard.”
Bassey, in particular, noted his intrigue in Doo’s popularity across the American sports landscape and his deep-rooted connections to former Celtics players. Kevin Garnett, for example, was a close compatriot of Doo and arranged offseason trips to Italy and China with his long-time strength coach. Celtics fans who arrived early to games at TD Garden may also recall Doo’s spirited warm-up drills, including band sprints with guards like Rajon Rondo.
“We have one off stories here and there, times spent just hanging out with Kevin Garnett or Paul Pierce and their work ethics,” Bassey said. “But the dude is just awesome, he just disappears for a weekend, next thing I know he is at the Super Bowl. He is well-versed, well-known. He has a shout-out on 2K. If you play with the ’08 Celtics, Kevin Garnett gives him a shoutout.”
Despite his familiarity working with professional athletes, Doo noted he has been extremely selective in making comparisons to past players.
“I don’t try to compare them to other players when they are doing bad things,” Doo said. “But I compare them when they are doing good things. To me I don’t want them to think ‘Oh, Bryan just thinks I should be like this guy.’ I’m not just saying that. For instance, Seth did some good things in the game, I said, ‘The nice thing about that is you did this well...The speed at which you did that was impressive.’ That means a lot to them.”

However, Doo also admitted to having to open up at times and embrace his unique role as a storyteller.
“They look at me like hey, tell me a story.... What kind of story you want?” Doo jokingly stated. “It’s like my children. You want a funny story or you want a horror story?”
This range of serious to comical insight has given Doo increased credibility when it comes to evaluating players on Amaker’s squad. Freshman guard Rio Haskett, who Amaker stated was recruited specifically for his athleticism and defensive prowess, was particularly lauded by Doo.
“I test a lot of combine guys,” Doo stated. “We had eight draft picks [with the Celtics] two years ago and we had 225 college kids. [Rio] would test top 10 percent, easily, no questions asked.”
In the Feb. 17 win against Yale, Haskett intercepted a career-high four steals in 12 minutes of action. Despite not being an offensive threat so far in his first year, Haskett’s gritty defensive play and on-court energy has earned him a consistent role in Amaker’s rotation.
“He can really be that kind of defensive stopper, or he can change the rhythm or pace of a game with plays that he can make with his athleticism.” Amaker added.

Doo has also worked extensively with sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken, oftentimes accompanying Aiken near the exercise bike in his injury-prone season. Nursing a left knee ailment for much of the 2018 calendar year, Aiken has turned to Doo in building back his mental confidence.
“He’s felt confident that we have dealt with stuff like this and so...you will feel like this, don’t be alarmed,” Doo said. “That’s why you can push through this, don’t push through that. Just giving him the in’s and out’s of having to deal with injury, how to manage it, how to feel things through it, I think that’s what our role is.”
Moving forward, Doo stated that he hopes he can bring along some of his former Celtics players to workouts and continue to collaborate with Osberg in refining an already-demanding exercise  program. Under Osberg’s management, the team works out four times a week during the offseason and lifts two times a week during the playing schedule. This is in addition to practices Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday to complement its weekend slate of back-to-back games.
“Offseason is their main time to get bigger, get faster, get stronger, jump higher,” Osberg said. “They are still shooting around, playing pick-up. But it is predominantly focused on strength and conditioning and their injury reduction and on-court performance.”
One feature that Doo and Osberg have emphasized is increased attention to the body movements and biomechanics of daily life, ranging from when athletes are sitting in class to walking back to their dorms. In this fashion, Doo hopes players will be better suited when it comes time to cross the Charles and lace up for practice and games.
“I think we as a staff do a good job of working on biomechanics,” Doo said. “That everyday walking around, body mechanics are correct. Getting them ready for each practice is like aligning a car. We try to realign their car before we go to practice. We make practice safer and obviously preparing them for games.”
From both a professional and personal angle, Doo’s expertise—as Amaker attested— has been simply “tremendous”. Although Doo himself expressed uncertainty over whether he will continue to be the “car re-aligner” for Harvard Basketball, one defining contribution is certain.
“I think he really speaks to the culture that we want to have here at Harvard.” Bassey concluded.
In the same year that Lavietes Pavilion was revamped, the team which calls it home has received a jolt of energy from the newest addition at the end of the bench.

“Grit, I think, is when challenged, how strong can you be to get through it?”
This is softball coach Jenny Allard’s best approximation of what is perhaps her team’s most popular term. Rather than fleshing out the semantics, however, both Allard and junior shortstop Rhianna Rich pointed to a series of games two seasons ago as the best explanation of the team’s grit.
The situation was almost too good to be true: Harvard and Dartmouth, two competitors in Ivy League softball’s North Division, were slated for a four-game series at the very end of the 2016 regular season. The Crimson entered with a 13-3 record, one game behind the Big Green. All Dartmouth had to do was win two games to advance to the Ivy League Championship Series, where South Division winner Princeton laid in wait.
It was a home-and-home series, so the first two contests took place at the very end of April at Harvard’s Soldiers Field. The Crimson, perhaps drawing on momentum from its existing six-game winning streak, walked away that Saturday with two one-run wins. All of a sudden, Harvard had flipped the script—one more win was all it needed.
The first game of the doubleheader in Hanover, N.H., also ended with a one-run margin, but this time in the Big Green’s favor. The next, and final, game became an all-important winner-take-all.
Entering the final inning of the final game, the Crimson’s season was hanging by a thread. Down 5-4 after squandering a 4-2 lead, Harvard sent junior Catherine Callaway up to lead off, and she promptly singled to kick off the comeback bid. A bunt single and a walk loaded the bases for then-sophomore Maddy Kaplan. As the balance of pressure shifted in the Crimson’s favor, Kaplan laced a double into left field to reclaim Harvard’s advantage. All told, the visitors hung four runs on the scoreboard, and pitcher Morgan Groom slammed the door in the bottom half of the frame to secure the victory and a postseason appearance.
“I think that was definitely a lot of people’s favorite moment because it showed that even though we were down going into our last inning, we were still able to push through that…,” Rich said. “It was about just being able to give it all you had.”
After the final out, the visitors jumped around on Dartmouth’s home field, rejoicing in having extended their season, but perhaps more importantly celebrating the team’s resolve, its refusal to give in to pressure, its tenacity. In other words, its grit.
In spite of a loss to Princeton in the best-of-three championship series, the Crimson had clearly made considerable strides. It further established itself as one of the perennial top teams in the Ancient Eight, and it proved that even against the odds it would not bow out easily.
This upcoming season marks Allard’s 24th season of managing the Harvard softball team. The team has been through ups and downs (but mostly ups) throughout her tenure, from a 6-8 league record in 2006 to a championship just a year later in 2007, one of six titles secured under her watch.
During the lengthy time Allard has spent at the helm, one will notice grit is one of the team’s ever-present themes, from preseason practices in the bubble, to the grind of the regular season, to postseason play.
Grit, like other sports buzzwords, is difficult to universally define. However, words are not always so important when Allard attempts to instill this mentality in her players.
“I think we talk about kind of grinding it out and working hard and doing those things, but...it’s not as conscious when you’re just putting them through challenges,” Allard remarked. “You don’t have to say, ‘Hey, we’re trying to develop grit in all of you.’”
Despite the fact that grit does not always need to be verbally explained, the team appears to have embraced the philosophy and has built a foundation of hard work and dedication upon it.
“I think grit really has been our word because throughout preseason and Ivies we go through a lot of ups and downs,” Rich noted. “Grit really explains that we dig deep within ourselves, that we’re playing for each other, and we’re able to come out on top of any obstacle that we face so we can get the job done. We don’t back down to failure.”
Given the demanding travel early on in the season, it seems impossible for the entire team’s roster to perform at peak capacity during the tournaments, especially since they will still be shaking off winter rust. But Allard says she tries to motivate her players to get as close to that benchmark as possible.
“In order to be successful, you’ve got to grind out a lot of work and a lot of time in these games,” Allard noted. “We’re going to go to Florida, [and] we’re going to play five games in a weekend. I mean that’s a lot of mental grit.”
The sheer length of the schedule is also a factor in the team’s adoption of the grit philosophy. This year, the Crimson is slated to play 42 games in just over two months, as the regular season spans from Feb. 23 to April 29.
“You take one game in softball—it may not be as physically challenging with the running as lacrosse, soccer, basketball, hockey, the constant skating—but the mental stamina you have to have to play two games in a day is extraordinary,” Allard added. “So I feel like we really focus, and the team has focused on, really being in the best physical shape because you break down and you make mistakes when you get tired. I think they’ve really embraced this idea of kind of grinding it out.”
Typically across sports, grit is attributed to individuals—those players who seem to give maximum effort in every competition, who scrape and claw for wins, who go above and beyond their sometimes middling abilities to contend with the best of the best. For Harvard softball, though, grit is simply a team concept.
Neither Allard nor Rich would rush to point to any individuals who stood out as more gritty than the rest, instead opting to describe the entire team as a group which embodied that concept. Rich noted that each individual functions as her own leader, so instead of depending on others to get the job done in a tight spot, each member of the team is capable of producing in any situation.
“Over my 24 years? Yeah there’s a lot of gritty players,” Allard said. “Some of them came in pretty gritty, some of them developed that grit in college. One of the things that they’re embracing this year is finding a way—finding a way when it’s hard, finding a way when you’re challenged, finding a way when you’re down, finding a way when you’re tired. You’re calling upon the grit that you have to be strong in those situations.”
One gritty individual moment that Allard settled on, however, was then-sophomore Katie Duncan’s performance in the circle against Princeton in last year’s championship series.
After scoring 32 runs in four games to close out the regular season, the Crimson advanced to the championship series for the second consecutive season. Princeton pitcher Claire Klausner completely silenced Harvard’s hot bats in the opening game, posting a shutout with eight strikeouts.
Though the offense could not get anything going against Klausner, Duncan and the defense behind her kept the Crimson in the game until the final frame. Despite allowing 13 baserunners, Duncan threw six shutout innings to match Klausner frame by frame. Only in the seventh did she falter slightly, allowing a walkoff single after recording one out.
Duncan was up against no lightweight that day. Last season, the Tigers paced the conference in runs scored with 205. Columbia tied them for that mark, but Princeton reached it in five fewer games. The Tigers were also the only team with a collective batting average above .300, and their 134 strikeouts were the fewest among Ivy teams.
“We ran a defense to shut down their offense and we lost, 1-0,” Allard recalled. “That was a gritty game by Katie Duncan. She threw extraordinary.”
In 2018, it appears as though grit will be at the forefront of Harvard softball’s mentality once again. Several key contributors are getting their bearings after returning from lengthy injury rehabilitations, and a schedule makeover means that the Crimson plays a handful of extra games.
“I’m sure there will be things that we haven’t seen before with the new schedule, and…[making] sure that we’re giving it all we have is going to be really important,” Rich said. “And not give into the failures that we encounter.”
Coming off consecutive seasons of losing in the Ancient Eight playoffs, Harvard has set a high bar for itself, especially considering its limited roster turnover compared to other top teams in the conference. Sometimes top teams can become complacent, expecting past impressive performances to continue unabated. However, it seems apparent that the Crimson will continue to exhibit grit in each and every game in pursuit of its ultimate goal: an Ivy League title and a trip to the NCAA Regionals.

The long-term trajectory of Harvard baseball can be defined by two facts.
First, the Crimson has not won an Ivy League championship since 2005 and has not finished above .500 overall since 2006.
Second, since head coach Bill Decker inherited a 12-30 team at the start of the 2013 season, Harvard has witnessed a slow and steady climb up to a 19-23 overall record in 2017.
Sum these two details together and here the team stands, on the cusp of the 2018 baseball season. It’s hard to say that the Crimson has sky-high expectations for this spring, but it’s also hard to say that the team doesn’t expect to build upon the upwards trajectory that has been years in the making. Will Harvard continue its slow, methodical momentum, finally passing .500 overall, or will it have a breakout year, perhaps smashing its way back into Ivy League relevance?
Taking precedence over answering that question, however, is the team’s focus on its daily operations—things it can control.
“Everybody’s goal, across the country, is to try to be in a position to compete in your conference tournament,” Decker said. “We just want to make sure that we continue to train and compete the right way, day in and day out—and if you do those things, then you can be in that position.”
Every team wants to jockey at the top of its conference each season, but it’s much easier said than done. Yale won the Ivy League last year with a 16-4 conference record, while Harvard finished sixth at 7-13. Here are some things that need to happen in order for the Crimson to surprise in 2018:
1. Success in the summer leagues of 2017 needs to carry over into the spring 2018 season. Of the 20 Harvard players participating in summer league play, four earned All-Star recognition—junior RHP Simon Rosenblum-Larson, senior 3B Matt Rothenberg, junior RHP Kevin Stone, and sophomore OF Jake Suddleson.
The stats back up the awards. Come summer’s end, Rosenblum-Larson had posted a 1.53 ERA over 52.2 innings, Rothenberg led the entire South Florida Collegiate League with a .434 batting average and a 1.140 OPS, Stone went 3-0 while holding opposing hitters to a .194 BAA, and Suddleson hit for .300+ and 1.000+ for much of the season before cooling off towards the end.
Notably, senior pitcher Noah Zavolas also dazzled for the Wareham Gatemen, posting a sparkling 0.64 ERA while pitching the fourth-most innings on the team.
The next step is to sustain the success through the spring.
“The bottom line is, when you’re wearing a Harvard uniform, we want to have that kind of success,” Decker said. “We need to take that to O’Donnell Field, then League play, and just play—have some fun, have some energy. The guys had some good summers, and that’s the way you grow as a ballplayer.”
2. Harvard needs to get off to a fast start in both regular season and Ivy League play. Last season, the Crimson began 7-3 in non-conference games, but when it came to Ancient Eight play, it tumbled into a 1-10 conference start.
The inauspicious start immediately cut off any hope to contend for the title. As it turned out, Yale, the eventual 2017 Ivy champion, was Harvard’s inverse by launching to a 10-1 conference record.
“Our expectations are to do a little bit of a better job, specifically, [of] getting off to a good start,” Decker said. “We’re going to have 18 games under our belt [by Ivy League play], as we usually do, still trying to figure some things out. There’ll be some competition within positions, which is great.”
That competition needs to yield energy and a focused squad when it visits Princeton for the team’s Ancient Eight opener on March 24. Last year, the Tigers finished tied with the Crimson for 6th-7th in the conference with a 7-13 Ivy record, so the Ivy-opener will be a chance for Harvard to get ahead in 2018.
3. The Crimson needs to get healthy and stay healthy for the duration of the spring. Not only that, but when players are absent due to injury, the next man should be able to step up.
Several key contributors won’t be in the lineup for at least some time due to injury. Trusty sophomore second baseman Quinn Hoffman, who led the team last year in plate appearances, is coming back from shoulder surgery. Senior captain and infielder John Fallon won’t play the first weekend. Senior RHP Ian Miller, who pitched the most innings as a starter last year, will miss extended time due to hip surgery.
“I wish we were a little bit healthier, but that’s just the way it is,” Decker said. “It’s next man up.”
The rest of the roster needs to find a way to step up and plug the holes left by injury. Which leads to point number four….
4. The core of upperclassmen who carried Harvard last season, and especially in its run of six wins in nine games to close out the season, needs to sustain that level of production.
Junior outfielder P.J. Robinson, the Crimson’s Male Breakout Athlete of the Year last season, led the team in nearly every offensive category, hitting for a .373 average and a 1.174 OPS. Junior first baseman Pat McColl also had a stellar year at the plate, hitting for .355 and drawing a team-best 18 walks, which  added to his team-best .459 on-base percentage.
McColl and Robinson drove in 36 and 34 runs, respectively, to plate more than one-third of Harvard’s total runs scored last season. The ball club is in a good place if that kind of two-man RBI machine shows up again in 2018.
“We got back a week before school started in January, and we’ve been here ever since,” McColl said. “We’re pretty excited for this year…We’ve got a lot of talent coming in and a lot of returners.”
The outfield platoon of Austin Black, Trent Bryan, Suddleson, John MacLean, and Ben Skinner will also look to make the transition from valuable underclassmen to veritable impact players. The re-emergence of Rothenberg, who had a down year last season but blistered his summer league, will also mean good things for the squad.
The Crimson only graduated three seniors last year, so the squad has veteran experience on its side. That being said, the contributions made by the incoming class of 2021—nine freshmen, five of whom are righty hurlers—will always be welcome additions. Point number three concerning health is especially important—several rookies aren’t yet at 100 percent, which will hinder their playing time.
Which leaves it to the upperclassmen, and the second-year players who look to make performance jumps, to carry the weight.
5. Above Harvard in the 2017 season-end Ivy standings were five teams—Yale, Penn, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Cornell. Overtaking these teams, if only a few of them, will require more than just going through the motions.
Indeed, in the first ever Ivy League Preseason Poll, made up of votes by media members from each institution, sports information directors, and the national media, the Crimson was picked to finish fifth in this year’s conference, as was announced on Feb. 14. The Bulldogs held the top spot as expected.
As Decker preaches, energy, focus, consistency, and sustaining success will be key to any sort of long-term achievements for the program. These attitude-centered tenets will apply to both the diamond during games that count and during practice inside the bubble.
“Since the guys have been back in the middle of January, they’ve given a good effort,” Decker said. “The thing that we’ve talked is about is just sustaining that effort, day in and day out…the effort’s been there, the focus has been there. We can always try to be a little better with our consistency, but they’ve come to decide to train the right way.”
Even if the Crimson succeeds in achieving these things, factors beyond the team’s  control could  still derail its season. That’s not a focus of the team, however. While still being cognizant of the work ahead, Harvard can still look forward to having a fun, intensive season, and the results will follow.
“We’ve been doing a lot of scrimmages in the bubble,” McColl said. “A lot of our guys had positive summer experiences…. We’re pretty excited for this year.”
The Crimson starts its season on the road with a four-game weekend set at Samford starting on Friday, Feb. 23.

For the first time in Ivy League softball history, the conference released a preseason poll, voted upon by each institution’s media members, sports information directors, and the national media. Not surprisingly, the top spots went to the pair of teams who have scrapped each of the past two seasons in the Ivy League Championship Series. Princeton earned the highest perch with 10 first-place votes, while Harvard garnered five top votes of its own to come in second in the poll.
“I think it was interesting because obviously we didn’t know that they came out with that poll until we saw it,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “I don’t think in any way that alters our mindset. we’re not going to let the results or outsiders’ opinions kind of dictate how we’re going to play.”
In addition to ignoring the outside noise, the Crimson is also avoiding prematurely setting its sights on the Tigers in 2018 (if Princeton does manage to win the South Division, that is). Instead, Harvard is simply trusting the process.
“I think this season our big strength is that we’re taking a lot of time to focus on our mental preparation,” Rich said. “We’d really been refining our skills, but this year we know that we have the skills. We know that we have everything we need to win. It’s just a matter of coming mentally prepared.”
Each of the past two seasons, Crimson softball has fallen just shy of claiming the Ivy League title. Both times, Harvard made a spirited, late-season effort to clinch a place in the Ivy League Championship Series, only to run into the Tigers’ buzzsaw.
In recent years, Princeton has quickly surged to the top of the Ancient Eight. The Tigers went 14-6 in 2016, only to improve upon that mark with a 15-5 record the following year. Between its league championship in 2008 and 2015, however, Princeton mustered an unremarkable 60-79 record.
“Obviously the past two years we’ve faced them in the championship and fell short, and I would say this season we’re going to try not to focus on that fact when we face them during the Ivy League games or during the championship series possibly,” Rich said. “They always have a good team, a strong team, and they’ll definitely be a hard team to beat, but if we just focus on our game then I have full confidence that we’ll be able to pull it off.”
This time around, the Tigers remain the standard by which all other Ivy teams are measured. Princeton returns Megan Donahey and Allison Harvey, who teamed up for 100 hits last season. However, the Tigers lost top slugger Marissa Reynolds, who racked up eight long balls and hit .457 with an .886 slugging percentage. The defending champions also graduated both of their top pitchers, Erica Nori and Claire Klausner.
In the North Division, Dartmouth and Yale figure to be the Crimson’s major roadblocks in returning to the best-of-three championship round. Brown was picked seventh in the preseason poll and has been mired in a rebuilding phase after winning the league in 2004. The Big Green and the Bulldogs tied for second in the North with 10-10 records in 2017.
Harvard softball kicks off its 2018 season with a trip down to Orlando, Fla., to compete in the Citrus Classic. Every season begins with several tournaments far afield from the harsh conditions of New England in late February and early March. Generally, competition at these invitationals is fierce, and the schedule of games is unrelenting.
“Our preseason schedule is really tough,” Rich said. “We face a couple top-50 teams and a couple top-100 teams, and just being able to see that level of play will really prepare us to go into Ivies with better skills and with an overall better mental outlook.”
Perhaps the most important theme of the regular season after the conclusion of the non-conference trips is the parity within the Ancient Eight.
Allard remarked that she began to see a sharp increase in competitiveness within the conference about three years ago. Last season, Princeton paced the league with 15 wins, but no other team had more than 13 or fewer than six. Four out of eight schools settled within two games of a .500 record.
“I mean everyone’s more competitive,” Allard said. “You can’t take a weekend off and think that you’re just going to skate through a series. There’s none of that.”
Most years, the beginning of the season would lend itself to a detailed look at the incoming freshman class. However, this time around, there are just three new athletes donning Harvard’s uniform. Morgan Melito, Aubree Muse, and Alyssa Saldana comprise the entirety of coach Jenny Allard’s newest recruiting class. The veteran skipper of 24 years decided not to overload her team’s roster, with 18 players remaining from her 2017 squad.
“I think they’re adding the depth that we need,” Allard said. “We needed another corner player and strong hitter which we have in Morgan Melito, and then we have [utility player] Aubree Muse and [outfielder] Alyssa Saldana.”
Looking closer at the Crimson’s roster, it appears as though one of the major issues with the 2018 lineup will be a good problem to have. Junior Meagan Lantz, junior Erin Lockhart, and sophomore Olivia Giaquinto will all vie for at-bats at the two corner infield spots.
Lantz had an outstanding rookie campaign, batting .323/.375/.577 with seven home runs and 37 RBI. However, she suffered a season-ending ACL injury last preseason, leading to the emergence of Lockhart. Lockhart crushed seven homers in 2017 to go along with a .507 on-base percentage and a .619 slugging mark. Giaquinto also flashed a powerful bat as a freshman last season—in just 87 at bats, she launched seven home runs.
One potential remedy to this situation would be to deploy one of the trio as the team’s designated player, who could bat for any other player in the lineup. Though not all of this powerful core will be able to play the field, Allard will have to get each of them into the lineup to establish Harvard as a premier power-hitting team within the conference.
“We’ll figure it out,” Allard said. “All three of them have a lot of power, and if they’re hitting well we’ll figure out how to fit them all in.”
Rich and co-captain Maddy Kaplan figure to complement the above trio’s power with a more on-base heavy focus. Rich has tallied 120 hits in just two years, and last year she also experienced a marked defensive improvement at shortstop. Kaplan has already cemented her place as one of the best contact hitters in Harvard history with a .394 career batting average (fifth all-time) and a .454 OBP (tied for third all-time).
In the circle, Allard looks forward to the team’s increasing depth due to the recovery of a pair of hurlers from injuries that plagued the team in 2017. Both junior Sarah Smith and sophomore Alissa Hiener are ready to bolster the Crimson’s pitching, slotting in alongside junior Katie Duncan and Giaquinto, who will split time between hitting and pitching once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After competing in several regattas in the fall, Harvard, a national force in crew, sets its sights on a successful dual meet and championship season in the spring.
Last year, the No. 18 Radcliffe women’s heavyweight crew, under head coach Liz O’Leary, finished fifth at the Ivy League Championships, capturing bronze medals in the 3V8+A and varsity four B events in 6:39.168 and 7:27.956. At the Eastern Sprints Championships last April, the team dominated the field, winning five of six races, including the first varsity eight, second varsity eight, third varsity eight, varsity four B, and varsity four C.
In this year’s Head of the Charles, the team’s Club 8+ boat finished in first with a time of 16:27.044, while the Radcliffe A finished 11th among collegiate teams in 15:42.537.
At the 2017 IRA National Championships, the No. 4 Radcliffe women’s lightweight crew team, under the reigns of head coach Sarah Baker, took fifth in 6:36.444. The team also had strong performances in other races throughout the year.
“Highlights from last year were we got first at Head of the Charles, which we haven’t done for four years I want to say,” senior captain Alanah Anderson said. “We won Sprints, which is the biggest race on the East Coast that we had last year. That’s against four out of the five teams that we race for our championship race. Then, we went to England last summer and we raced at Women’s Henley, which we travel to every four years.”
At Eastern Sprints, the 1V8 won its fourth gold medal in five years, outpacing Princeton and Wisconsin in 6:43.423. The second varsity boat also took first in its race. In a dual race against then No. 3 ranked Tigers, the heavyweight squad took all three varsity races, giving it the Class of 1999 cup. This fall, the first varsity boat finished  third at the Head of the Charles, also medaling at the Head of the Housatonic.
After a strenuous training regimen, which included a winter break trip to Florida, the team has its eyes set on key races in the spring. One of these is the Knecht Cup, which will feature some of the strongest rowing programs in the nation. Anderson said that the team has several strong, young rowers who will elevate the team.
“We have a lot of fast freshmen this year, so that really helps with other members of the team wanting to go faster because you don’t want to be beaten by a freshman,” Anderson said. “That’s normally how it goes, a sense of pride. But I think we’re going to end up with a decent number of freshmen in the upper boats, which is good moving forward. They’ll be able to bring up the freshman next year with them and continuing to make the team as a whole faster.”
The Harvard men’s heavyweight crew took third overall at the most recent Head of the Charles. Led by head coach Charley Butt, the No. 3 ranked team in the nation last year fell to No. 1 Yale in the 152nd Regatta as the Bulldogs swept all three varsity races. At the IRA Championships, the varsity eight took bronze in 5:33.455 while the third varsity took second. The team also took the Smith Cup for the 20th straight year, beating out Northeastern by more than seven seconds in the varsity eight.
This year, senior Alexander Richards was selected to the US Rowing World Championships roster, where he will compete in the coxswain-less four with three other collegiate rowers.
The Harvard men’s lightweight crew, ranked second in the nation last year, hopes to continue the success that made then-first-year coach Billy Boyce’s season so special. At the Ivy League Championships, the team won the overall points title, the Jope Cup, with the JV8+ winning gold, the V8+ and 5V8+ winning silver, and the 3V8+ winning bronze.
“I think the dual season is always fun just because there’s a lot of traditions there,” senior captain Andre Dupuis said. “There’s shirt betting, which I think is pretty unique to the sport. Looking forward to Springs, which is our Ivy League Championships. That’s where our whole team participates, which is really exciting because we have all our boats going for the Jope Cup and going for victories in all the individual events.”
Last year, the team also took the points title at last year’s IRA National Championships. The coxswain-less varsity four took gold in 6:06.700, while the varsity four took second and the varsity eight took fourth. In last year’s Goldthwait Cup, the team beat both No.1 Yale and No. 4 Princeton to win the cup for the first time in three years. The lightweight crew took bronze at last fall’s Head of the Charles in 14:05.276.
“Hard work is the building blocks of speed, and I think we have a pretty deep squadron,” Dupuis said. “Overall, it’s pretty young. I think Billy Boyce, the head coach, and Ian Accomando, the assistant coach, are really hitting their stride under the reigns of the program, so I look forward to the spring.”

The No. 1 Harvard men’s fencing team continues to dominate the rest of the field, a point proven by its near impeccable record, with only a close loss against New York University in December at the Tradition Tournament. Since that loss, the Crimson has only continued to grow and clear away all teams that cross its path, registering two major wins at the Beanpot and at the Ivy League Championship.
“We try to have a trajectory of intensity,” junior Milo Davidson said. “In practice, that prepares us most effectively, so we spend the month before Ivies ramping up until we reach peak intensity the week before we leave.”
The hard work all paid off during the Ivy League Championships on Feb. 10 and 11, where Harvard finished with a 4-1 record over the two day tournament and shared the title with Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. The win was the men’s team’s 10th title, and the first since 2015. The championship finish secured the Crimson its best record in multiple years, with a 14-1 overall record and a 4-1 record in the Ivy League.
“Ivies definitely is a very draining competition both physically and mentally, and our team did an amazing job preparing for it,” co-captain Eric Zhao said. “We had a really solid few weeks of practice, so that everyone was in peak physical shape before the tournament and mentally, we were focused on the goal at hand, keeping a positive attitude through the tournament's inevitable ups and downs. In addition, for the upperclassmen on the team, everyone remembered our disappointment at Ivies last year and we used that feeling to keep us hungry throughout the entirety of the weekend.”
The team also secured two individual titles, with freshman Geoffrey Tourette sweeping the field for an untarnished 15-0 record and a plus-46 touch differential, taking an individual title in the foil category. Junior co-captain Eli Dershwitz secured an individual win in the sabre category, where he secured a 14-1 record and a plus-47 touch differential. Dershwitz will chase his second consecutive NCAA Championships individual title in March. Sophomores Duncan Rheingans-Yoo and Erwin Cai both secured top three finishes as well, with Rheingans-Yoo securing a 10-5 record and a plus-15 touch variance in the foil category and Cai ending with a 13-2 and plus-36 for second place in the sabre category.
Saturday’s tournament started with a emphatic 23-4 win over Brown University, including 7-1 wins in the foil and sabre categories. However, Harvard was unable to power past Penn, losing 15-12, for its only defeat in the entire Ivy tournament.
“During the tournament itself,” said Zhao, “especially at a competition like Ivies that is full of ups and downs, as a captain I envision myself as the mental backbone of the team. What that entails is always being and keeping the team positive, no matter how the day is going, making sure the overall team energy is high, and looking out to see that everyone is focused and channeling their effort in the correct manner.”
Refusing to let the close defeat discourage it, the Crimson pushed forward and secured a 19-8 win over Yale, featuring the team’s sabre category’s 8-1 record. On Sunday, the last day of the Ivies, Harvard faced No. 4 Columbia in a hard-fought battle, with the Crimson pushing past the Lions in a 16-11 win. The Ivies ended in a share of the Ivy League Championship for Harvard after defeating No. 6 Princeton in a 18-9 victory.
The Crimson brought the championship energy to MIT on February 14, where it faced off against the hosts, Boston College and Brandeis University, in the Beanpot Tournament. At the end of the night, the team won its 11th consecutive Beanpot championship title, the only team to ever win the trophy since its inception in 2007.
“We had a lot of freshmen this year,” Davidson said, “and the hardest part of that is always getting them adjusted to college fencing from what they’re used to. It can sometimes take a few events for them to be able to shift over to a much more team-oriented version of the sport.”
The successful transition to collegiate fencing was more than evident in freshman epee fencer Adrian Thein-Sandler and freshman foil fencer Tourette. Thein-Sandler left the Beanpot with the best record of the entire team, recording a flawless 9-0 match total, and a plus-35 touch differential, a career high. Tourette left the tournament with an equally impeccable 7-0 record in the foil category.
From a team perspective, the tournament kicked off for Harvard with a 19-8 win against Boston College, with a 8-1 record in the foil category, 6-3 in the epee category, and 5-4 in the sabre category. The margins of victory only widened as the Beanpot continued, with the Crimson emerging victorious against MIT in a 20-7 win, featuring a full 9-0 sweep in the foil category. Harvard sealed its Beanpot title with a dominant 21-6 win against Brandeis.
On the other hand, the No. 6 Harvard women’s fencing team has been on the rise since a tumultuous performance at the St. John’s Invitational in January. Following a thorough 21-6 win against NYU on February 4, the team continued to excel at the Ivy League Championships and the Beanpot Tournament. At the Ivies, the Crimson secured a third place finish with a 4-2 record over February 10-11, for an overall season record of 13-6.
The championships opened with a decisive 19-8 win over Brown, featuring a 6-3 win in the sabre category and a complete 9-0 shutout in the epee category led by freshmen Cindy Gao and Saanchi Kukadia. The wins continued with a 14-13 defeat of Yale. However, Harvard was unable to battle past No. 2 Columbia in a 19-8 loss. Despite suffering a loss, the team refused to relent, securing a 17-10 victory against Cornell featuring a 8-1 epee category record. The Ivies closed for the Crimson in a 18-9 loss to No. 5 Princeton.
Harvard left the Ivies with a third place finish and two All-Ivy individual honors. Gao and junior epee fencer Shawn Wallace were both named All-Ivy first team, a first-time honor for both fencers. Gao, the Toronto, Ontario, native, finished third in the Ivy epee category at the tournament with a 15-3 record, and new season-high plus-42 touch differential. Wallace finished the Ivies in second place in the epee category, with a 16-2 record and a season-high plus-42 touch differential. He leads the Crimson’s team in wins, with 51 total victories this year.
The title run was led by junior sabre fencer Gabrielle Tartakovsky, who earned a 6-0 record. The rest of the Harvard squad was not far behind, with six records secured with only one loss each. The Beanpot began against Boston College in a 21-6 win before a thrilling 19-8 victory against host team MIT, featuring an 9-0 sweep in the foil category. The Crimson’s energy seemed limitless as it closed out the tournament and title run with an emphatic 20-7 triumph over Brandeis, featuring a 8-1 record in the epee category.
“Looking at our record, we have maintained the strong, solid performances we had in previous years at our NYU meet, Wellesley & Tufts meet, Sacred Heart, and Beanpot," senior co-captain MacKenzie Lawrence said. “We also saw a lot of amazing individual performances at Penn State and at Ivies [where two members of the team won first team All-Ivy recognition for their stellar records]. While we didn’t quite achieve the Ivy League title this year, we, as a team, have been consistent in pushing ourselves at practices, supporting one another on and off the strip, and giving it our all at each and every competition.”

The days are getting longer and the sun is finally out. For most Harvard students, this means spring break is just around the corner. For the Crimson track and field teams however, this means that the covered domes and bubbles are being replaced with the open stadiums of the outdoor season.
The men’s and women’s track and field teams will wrap up the indoor season this weekend with the Ivy League indoor heptagonal championship meet.
“I personally prefer outdoor significantly more,” said junior women’s co-captain and sprinter Gabby Thomas. “Indoor [season] is a good training opportunity looking forward to outdoor.”
If that is the case, then both the men’s and women’s teams are poised for an excellent outdoor season. Both teams accomplished many feats this indoor season. On the team side, the Harvard men had several top finishes, including a win in the Crimson Elite Meet. Individually, members of the team shattered records. The men’s 4x400 meter relay team of senior Matt Hurst, Junior Myles Marshall, and freshmen  Jovahn Williamson and Rodney Agyare-May ran the second fastest time in program history with a time of 3:12.35. Newcomer Williamson also set the program mark of 33.96 in the 300-meter dash.
The women’s side did their fair share of record breaking as well. The women’s 4x400-meter relay team of Thomas and sophomores Karina Joiner, Maya Miklos and Zoe Hughes posted the second-best mark in Ancient Eight history at 3:38.45. Thomas also set a new Harvard mark in the 300-meter dash with a time of 37.47, in addition to an Ivy League record of 7.26 in the 60-meter dash. Joiner and Miklos each posted the third best times in program history in the 60-meter hurdles and the 500-meter runs, respectively.
The women’s team as a whole grabbed great finishes of second and third in the Beantown meet and the Crimson Elite meet. Even with a bevy of accomplishments from both teams in the past two months, members insist there is still room for improvement. Getting healthy has been a common trend for both teams, as several members are recovering from injuries and are looking to rebound in the coming outdoor season.
“A lot of the girls on our team have really bounced back from injuries,” Thomas said. “There’s a lot of good resilience and mental toughness going on within our women’s team right now, so I think we’re in a really good shape to come back and have a really good outdoor season.e’re really focused on getting healthy.”
Both teams have also gained some much-needed experience through the indoor season.
“We’ve got a really young group,” Herbert said. “[There are] a lot of freshman and sophomores that are still getting the hang of things…having them gone through a season so everyone knows what a college meet is like… and take that knowledge into the outdoor season is great.”
An already young team added a lot of fresh talent this year. Sprinters Williamson and Agyare-May, distance runner freshman Ryan Thrush, freshman thrower Jason Judge, and freshman sprinter and pole vaulter freshman Eric Duffy are some new names to look out for on the men’s side in the upcoming season. Co-captains Herbert and Marshall as well as Hurst are some established names looking to make their marks on the record books this season.
“[We’re] being more attentive to the process,” Herbert said. “Its allowed people to grow more and be more positive.”
On the women’s side, freshman sprinter Olivia Okoli and freshman jumper Louise Estberg are some names to add to the likes of sprinters Thomas, Joiner, sophomore Livia Gauntlett and junior Ngozi Musa as well as junior distance runner Kathryn Gillespie.
The men’s and women’s teams come into this season with a new mentality that will start with the Cougar Spring Break Invitational on March 15th. “Making sure that everyone’s on the same page and we’re all working towards the same goals,” Thomas said. “[We need to be] holding each other accountable. Everything you do sets the tone on how the team is.”

Heading into the 2018 season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team returns the bulk of its squad from last year, having graduated only five seniors. In comparison, 15 seniors will be bidding farewell to Cambridge at the end of the current campaign. But despite the small size of last year’s graduating class, the Crimson lost a great deal more than two starters and three reserves.
With the departure of 2017 team captains Matt Ryan and Ryan Norton, as well as Colin Delea, Luke Mendola, and Jamie White, Harvard now has no players on its roster who were a part of the 2014 squad, the most successful in the program’s recent memory. In fact, that group was the only one in the past 20 years to win the Ivy League title, and the only one in the past 10 to advance to the NCAA tournament.
“Matt and Ryan were two voices that we’ll definitely miss this season, on the field and in the locker room,” new co-captain Joe Lang said. “But having a lot of the guys come back does help with the transition and keeping up our style of play.
Into the shoes of Ryan and Norton step Sean Coleman and Lang, two seniors who may not have the NCAA tournament experience but are nonetheless well-versed in the program’s values and goals. Both players also captained their high school teams in their senior years, and both will be entering their fourth seasons in significant roles for the Crimson.
Lang will be expected to hold down his usual role as an attack-minded midfielder. His production from the position over the last few years, including multi-point performances in 12 out of 13 games in 2017, earned him a spot on the New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (NEILA) Preseason First Team for the second straight year. Ahead of him in attack, Coleman and fellow senior Morgan Cheek will also look to provide a scoring punch for Harvard.
Cheek is another NEILA Preseason First Team selection whom the Crimson will lean on this year. After leading the team in points last season with 67, a total which put him at a career total of 141 points, Cheek begins the push into the top-10 all time for points in program history, only needing 30 more points to place him in the top five.
“There are a couple of seniors who have clearly already accomplished a lot in their time here,” said head coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “But the depth of the class is just as important to us, letting us play a lot of guys and keep everyone fresh.”
Speaking of depth, the sophomore class, with one full year of experience under its belt, is also ready to contribute in a big way. Two years after Cheek broke out in his sophomore season with 60 points, several talented sophomore attackers will hope to do the same. In particular, Ryan Graff, a starter alongside Cheek on the front line, will aim to build on a stellar 20-goal freshman campaign.
“We have young guys who are very hungry to improve, always down there practicing,” Lang said. “Even though we have a big senior class, there’s a lot of younger guys we’re going to need production from if we’re going to have a good year.”
On the other side, virtually the entire Harvard defense returns. With only Norton’s minutes to replace, senior Joe Kearney, junior Jonathan Butler, and sophomore David Strupp will look to continue building strong chemistry in front of returning senior goalie Robert Shaw.
Shaw was the third and final Crimson player to be named to a NEILA preseason team when he earned a spot on the second team. Like Cheek, the Canton, Mass., native will be climbing the team’s record books this season. He enters his third season as a starter only 12 saves shy of a spot in the top-10 for all time saves.
With so many returning players, the freshmen on the squad will have more time than usual to learn the ropes. Still, with two Inside Lacrosse top-50 recruits, defenseman Frankie Tangredi and midfielder Bryn Evans, Wojcik certainly has talented newcomers at his disposal.
“The freshman have impressed us so far with their preparation, and they’ll contribute this season, no doubt,” Wojcik said. “We’ll need everyone to play their role if we want to accomplish what we want to accomplish.”

Roughly 70 million college basketball brackets are filled out every year. More brackets will be completed than ballots have been cast for an individual presidential candidate in a single election.
The first step of many amateur and professional bracketologists is to pencil in the one seeds for victory over the lowly 16 seeds. The tiny David taking down a heavily favored Goliath, in the men’s or women’s tournament, has happened only once. It is practically impossible. On March 14, 1998, however, the impossible occurred.
That year, the Stanford Cardinal prepared for its first-round game heavily favored against a team which was expected to be a soon-forgotten underdog. Stanford had not missed the NCAA tournament in 11 years, and it usually dominated. Six of its last eight seasons resulted in a Final Four appearance, including two national titles. The Cardinal had reached the Final Four in three straight seasons leading up to its 1998 matchup against a seemingly overmatched 16-seed from the Ivy League.
“We didn’t feel like terrible underdogs going in,” then-senior guard Alison Seanor said. “But I think the entire country thought we were underdogs.”
In 1998, before she became the winningest coach in Ivy League basketball history and led the USA national team, Kathy Delaney-Smith was a young coach in Cambridge for an overlooked team that had never won the Ivy League, let alone made the NCAA Tournament. Delaney-Smith took her first college job at Harvard in 1982 and has been there ever since.
That season, the Crimson rose to the top of the conference, recording its third straight conference title and tournament appearance in the 1997-1998 season. However, Harvard had yet to win a single game in the tournament. A forgotten 16-seed, the Crimson was determined to rewrite history against Stanford.
“I don’t think we got the respect we should’ve gotten,” Delaney-Smith said. “Getting the 16-seed was the last straw.”
For Harvard, being underrated was nothing new. In spite of its  impressive 22-4 record, the Crimson was relegated to the bowels of the tournament.
“We were very upset about where we were seeded,” recalled Dr. Suzie Miller, then a junior guard on the team. “It was a slap in the face to be seeded 16…so we came in with a bit of a chip on our shoulder.”
In order to earn the respect it felt it deserved, Harvard would have to take on one of the giants of college basketball in a hostile environment. The Crimson prepared for the intensity of Maples Pavilion, where Stanford had compiled a 59-game home winning streak that stretched back to 1994.
“Together, the coaches came up with this practice plan to make the gym incredibly noisy,” Miller said.
Delaney-Smith elaborated on the details of the preparation, saying, “We had prepared for that, doing a lot of gimmicky things leading up to the game, like playing loud music in the gym, and I had to use signs to call the offenses because it was that loud. That wasn’t anything we had done all year.”
Harvard refused to allow the Cardinal’s reputation or court to frighten it early in the game, jumping out to an quick lead behind senior captain Allison Feaster. The nation’s leading scorer racked up 35 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in the huge upset.
“She could score on the block and she could nail the three,” Delaney-Smith said. “Back in 1998,  there were not a lot of inside players that were doing that.”
Feaster, who averaged a double-double in each of her four seasons for the Crimson, would go on to finish her illustrious career with the second-most points (2,312), third-most rebounds (1,157), and third-most steals (290) in conference history.
“Allison Feaster was one of those superstars whose greatest strength was that she made all of her teammates better,” Delaney-Smith said. “That doesn’t always happen with your star.”
Stanford, playing without starters Vanessa Nygaard and Kristin Folkl, had no answer for Feaster. At the half, Harvard shockingly led the Cardinal 43-34.
“It was the perfect storm for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were better than everyone thought we were, and that was not a fluke.”
Early into the second half, Harvard kept up the intensity, taking a double-digit lead. The underdogs had complete control of the game, but one of the best teams of the decade would not go down without a fight. Stanford roared back, tying the game with just under 10 minutes to play and taking a 65-62 lead with only a few minutes remaining on the clock.
“We did not go into it thinking we’re going to try to keep it close,” Seanor said. “We went into it thinking we’re going to win.”
Following a layup by Feaster and jump shot from Miller, the Crimson would retake the lead 66-65 with just over a minute and a half to play.
“We changed from man to zone, and that’s a risk,” Delaney-Smith said. “It shocked them, they weren’t ready for the zone… that risk worked.”
Not long after, Miller would effectively ice the game with a three-pointer from the corner to give Harvard a four-point lead. When the final buzzer sounded, the Crimson had secured a 71-67 decision for its first ever Women’s NCAA Tournament victory in program history.
“It was tremendously exciting to be in the tournament, even as a 16-seed,” recalled Professor Harry Lewis, then the dean of Harvard College. “It was really a moment of extraordinary pride… I got inspired and had to go down and meet the coach and the team at the airport on their return with a dozen red roses.”
For the players, the experience returning to campus was surreal.
“It was absolutely fantastic to come home,” Miller said. “People were taking pictures, cheering, and I thought, ‘Wow, how cool is this?’”

Harvard’s run would not last for long, however. The Crimson’s starting center, junior Rose Janowski, was rushed to the hospital the night before Harvard’s second-round matchup with Arkansas. Without its only player taller than  six feet, Harvard fell to the Razorbacks, 82-64. Arkansas took over the Cinderella story from the Crimson, miraculously reaching the Final Four as a nine-seed, the lowest to reach the semifinals in the Women’s NCAA Tournament.
For Harvard, however, history had been achieved. Even twenty years later, no other 16-seed has claimed victory. Only once in college basketball has the elusive feat ever been achieved, and the Crimson will never forget its spectacular accomplishment.
“I was proud of giving the Harvard community something to rally around,” Miller said. “And that’s what sports are all about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday night, the Harvard women’s softball team boarded a plane to Orlando, Fla., where they will start their season in the Citrus Classic tournament. All of the teams that the Crimson will face this weekend come from competitive Division I leagues including the ACC, the Big Ten, and the SEC.
While many of the Crimson’s opponents have already started their seasons, Harvard is starting this weekend with a fresh slate. Its hope as a team, though, is to play to the best of its abilities for the entirety of the season.
“So the goal of the team this year is what I think the goal of the team is every year, which is reach our full potential,” junior Katie Duncan said. “What makes each year different is what each and every individual on the team and the group as a unit might need to focus in on in order to grow.”
The Crimson’s first game is against Purdue on Friday at 12:30 p.m. Purdue is coming off an overall record of 20-36 from its 2017 season and a 1-8 record on their current season. The only game that the Boilermakers have won this season is against South Dakota in the Kajikawa Classic in Arizona earlier in February.
On Friday at 3 p.m., the Crimson is set to take on the University of Miami, Ohio, which is 1-4 at this point in the season.
On the second day of the tournament Harvard plays Duke at 3 p.m. and the University of Kentucky at 5:30 p.m. Both teams have impressive records so far. Duke is going into the Citrus Classic with a 6-3 record and one of its players, freshman pitcher Katherine Huey, was named ESPNW’s National Player of the Week after winning two games with 10 strikeouts and recording a 1.167 slugging percentage at the plate against Penn State and Purdue. Kentucky is off to a strong start as well, coming off a five game winning streak, which gives the Wildcats a 5-2 record overall.
The Crimsons’ last game of the weekend, which takes place on 9 a.m. Sunday against the University of Louisville, will not be an easy match up either. The Cardinals started off their 2018 season with a 6-3 record.
As far as the Ivy League goes, Harvard is predicted to come in second according to the preseason ranking, which was announced on Feb. 15. It is the first year that the Ancient Eight decided to have a preseason ranking—these predictions are made by a vote from the media, sports information directors, and national media.
Last season the Crimson had seven of its members earn All-Ivy honors. Current junior  shortstop Rhianna Rich and senior outfielder Maddy Kaplan both received first-team honors. In addition, junior pitcher Katie Duncan, junior catcher Elizabeth Shively, and sophomore first baseman/pitcher Olivia Giaquinto all earned second-team honors at the end of last season. Junior Outfielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer and junior third baseman Erin Lockhart collected honorable mentions as well. Six out of seven of these players are returning for at least another two seasons.
“We’re returning the bulk of our lineup from last year so there is a lot of experience one through nine,” Lockhart said. “Everyone’s been here before and we know the challenges ahead of us. We just need to go out and get the job done.”
Princeton came in first place in the Ivy League last year and was predicted to win the title again in 2018. The Crimson lost to the Tigers in the championship tournament at the end of the 2017 season in which Harvard fell to Princeton twice in the three game series.
With the high number of returners and the cohesion of this group of players, the Crimson feels confident leading up to its first game against Purdue.
“In terms of this weekend, we are definitely less experienced than our competition who have already begun to play games. However, we expect to be competitive and are excited for not only the first game against Purdue but this entire weekend and preseason, which will push us to work hard, hone in our skills, and be ready for Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

There are many things in Ivy League basketball this season that haven’t made a lot of sense—Harvard’s strong play despite an injury to star point guard Bryce Aiken, the parity that has consumed the middle tier of the conference, and Columbia’s decision to host 90’s Greek Night at its game last weekend—but perhaps the most perplexing has been the performance of Mitch Henderson’s Princeton Tigers.
We’ll be the first to admit, we got this one very wrong. Entering the season, Princeton looked like it would be right back at the top of the conference, jockeying for the Ivy’s at-large bid with Harvard, Yale, and maybe Penn. With just two weekends left to play before the Ivy League Tournament, the Tigers are sitting alone. In seventh place. Princeton is in freefall after losing its last six games, including a 16-point loss to lowly Dartmouth, a 25-point shellacking at the hands of Columbia, and two contests in which it conceded more than 100 points.
‘Why is this so unusual?’, you might ask. Well, whatever the opposite of a wildcard is, Princeton typically fits that bill. The Tigers have been a model of consistency in the Ivy League since Henderson arrived back at his alma mater in 2011. The team has finished above .500 in Ancient Eight play in each of Henderson’s six seasons at the helm (and its last nine overall), winning 10 or more conference games four times in that span.
For the last several years, the Tigers have prided themselves on its balance and playing within itself. While Princeton wasn’t always the flashiest or most talented team in the league, it was rarely going to beat itself or take games off. Entering the season, the Tigers had gone 13-6 in its last 19 Ivy League contests that were determined by five or fewer points, and had not lost a conference home game since Valentine’s Day in 2015. Even though Princeton graduated one of the most accomplished senior classes in recent history after last season, the 2017-2018 campaign was not supposed to be one characterized by rebuilding.
The Tigers entered the season returning their three best guards from a team that ran the table in the Ivy League and nearly upset Notre Dame in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Amir Bell, Devin Cannady, and Myles Stephens each logged over 23 minutes per game while the latter two each posted double-digit scoring averages a season ago. In addition to his success on the offensive end, Stephens was also last year’s Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year.
Fast-forward eight months and the 2017-2018 campaign started off about as well as Princeton fans thought it could. It topped USC on the road and had close losses to BYU and Butler in nonconference play. After losing to Penn to kick off its Ancient Eight slate, the Tigers then rattled off convincing wins at home over Columbia and Cornell before topping Yale in overtime.
Scoring? Check. Perimeter defense? Check. Experience? Check. Good coaching? Check.
However, the train really started coming off the tracks a few weeks ago and some of the individual statistics are pretty wild. Princeton’s three musketeers are certainly getting theirs. Cannady is third in the conference in scoring and is shooting nearly four percentage points better from the field than he did a season ago. Stephens has remained a steady hand on the defensive end while also shooting over 50 percent from the field. Bell has been scoring more in 2017-2018 while also averaging over five rebounds a game to go with almost four assists. You would think that the Tigers would be able to put a few big men and role players in place and then let Bell, Cannady, and Stephens do their thing. You would be dead wrong.
Sure, there have been surprises this season in conference—Yale has struggled at times, but a lot of it can be attributed to injuries and youth, Penn and Harvard have jumped to the top of the conference earlier than experts may have expected, but Princeton, we’re not really sure what happened. You put Bell, Cannady, and Stephens on literally any other Ivy League team and they’re a top four club in the conference for sure.
To say that Bell, Cannady, and Stephens have not gotten much help is the textbook definition of understatement. All three of the upperclassmen average over 33 minutes per game—no other Princeton player logs more than 20 per night. Bell, Cannady, and Stephens account for 58 percent of the Tigers’ points, 51 percent of its rebounds (despite all being guards), and 53 percent of its assists. For context, every guard on Harvard’s roster has combined for 44.1 percent of the Crimsons points and, as is the case for most teams, the forwards for Tommy Amaker’s team take care of the majority of the team’s rebounding needs.
But it’s not like the other 14 players have to do very much. Normally when your big men can’t score, they can at least rebound or block shots or take up space on defense. Princeton’s big men don’t really do any of those things. A year after holding its opponents to 61.4 points per game, the Tigers are conceding 72.3 points per contest. Princeton is dead last in the Ivy League in offensive rebounds and second-to-last in defensive rebounds.
Here are some more stats for you: freshman forward Sebastian Much is 6’8” but has almost as many rebounds (45 in 25 games) as he does turnovers (43). Henderson’s starting forwards average just 4.1 rebounds per contest and its entire frontcourt has attempted just 110 free throw attempts all season. For context, Harvard sophomore guard Bryce Aiken attempted 83 free throws on his own in just 14 games. The Tigers’ forwards literally stand under the basket but can barely corral a rebound or draw contact when attempting a layup.
While we completely disagree with the fact that Spencer Weisz (fourth on his team in scoring, 21st in the conference; 12th in the conference in rebounding, second in assists) was named Ivy League Player of the Year a season ago, Weisz is was a perfect encapsulation of everything that makes Princeton basketball Princeton basketball. He was consistent, didn’t do anything exceptionally well but did a little bit of everything to help his team win. Right now, Bell, Cannady, and Stephens sure wish someone could score or pass or rebound half as well as Weisz and his classmates could.
Now to the picks:
YALE at CORNELL
In a turn of events likely not atypical for those who call New Haven their campus, WYBCx, Yale’s student radio station, recently discovered that it did not have licensing agreements for any of the music it had been airing.
The president of the organization, Emma Keyes, went so far as to write in an email, “Seriously, we have been operating illegally since 2008.”
You couldn’t make this stuff up.
While the radio is shutting down operations for the time being, in a positive turn of events for Yale, senior guard Makai Mason is up and running for the Bulldogs—he had in fact not been operating illegally since 2008, but instead had a stress fracture in his foot.
Mason’s return to the hardwood would be drowned in chants of “safety school” here in Cambridge last Saturday as Yale scored a season-low 49 points in a loss, but his return bodes well for the Bulldogs. Sitting at 5-5 in conference with a wide open race for the third and fourth seeds, Yale could really use this win.
And maybe a licensing agreement, too.
Pick: Yale
BROWN at COLUMBIA
It would be difficult to underestimate the impact of the Columbia University Marching Band on this matchup.
The Lions' band might be among the best in the conference coming into Friday night’s contests—not only do they play the most harmonically offensive version of Taylor Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble” but they also do this strange thing where they kind of speak the words to Mr. Brightside really fast as an opposing player takes a free throw.
The numbers speak for themselves—as it stands Harvard and Penn lead the conference with a single loss each. Penn’s loss is to Harvard and the Crimson’s lone loss is to Columbia on the road.
The band was undoubtedly the culprit of that road loss for Harvard.
In anticipation of the matchup, it would be important to take a look at the band’s scouting report on Brown. Notably in Article Eight and Seven-Eighths of its constitution, the Columbia band notes, “Brown is a bunch of letter-writing cowards.”
We’ll take their word for it.
Pick: Columbia
DARTMOUTH at PENN
Brutal.
Pick: Penn
HARVARD at PRINCETON
You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.
That seems to be the mantra not only for a struggling Princeton team, but for the state of New Jersey as a whole. Following Oregon’s decision to let consumers pump their own gas this January, the state of New Jersey is now the only state in the U.S. where you aren’t allowed to pump your own gas.
It’s a tradition almost as archaic as Princeton is.
As we write this, the Tigers sit in an uncontested seventh place spot in conference despite being picked as the preseason favorite to finish third.
Just a year ago, this matchup came down to a buzzer-beater from Amir Bell in front of a sold-out crowd at Jadwin. If it is as close this year, we’ll swallow our pride and take back everything we said about Jersey.
Pick: Harvard
BROWN at CORNELL
Ah, the perennial battle for four-seed at the Ivy League tournament.
Not really—at least not the perennial part.
For those of you stuck under a rock, the Ivy League became the last in Division I conference to add a conference tournament last year. Two years ago, this would have been a meaningless game between two teams that enter the weekend with 4-6 records. Now, this might be one of the most important contests of the year. It’s great, really.
For its part, Cornell has about two and a quarter players who can score on its roster. Brown, meanwhile, takes the award for the worst combined shooting form amongst its starters. This one will be a nail biter for sure.
Pick: Cornell
DARTMOUTH at PRINCETON
Last week, we mentioned that in what was likely a defining moment for the Dartmouth community, a Domino’s was set to open in Hanover.
Given that the Big Green is on the road though, and probably without its now steady diet of $5.99 large two-topping pizzas and cinnamon sticks, we’re going to have to give the home team a slight advantage.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD at PENN
This one is just for pride at this point. Both teams have clinched the top two seeds in the conference tournament and, to be quite honest,  there likely isn’t too much of a difference between Yale and any of the other teams duking it out for the four-seed these last two weeks.
But it matters just enough.
Last year, the Crimson rode a two-game losing streak into the inaugural conference tournament. Both came courtesy of the Killer P’s and both came on buzzer-beaters. While this may not be the final act of the conference season, this one matters.
This game will more than likely be the conference championship game and we’ll bet neither team wants to lose it.
Pick: Harvard
YALE at COLUMBIA
Behind Harvard and Penn, one of us thinks that these are probably the next best teams in the conference. Sure, Brown has played well and Princeton might just be unlucky, but of the bottom-feeding bunch, these are probably two teams that could beat any team in the conference on a given day. Unlike the Harvard-Penn game, this one does have playoff implications.
For its part, Yale has a guy with a cool name in Makai Mason. Columbia has a great marching band.
We take the band every time.
Pick: Columbia

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Despite leading for a mere 37 seconds in regulation, the Harvard men's basketball team staged a gutsy, come-from-behind effort to stun Princeton, 72-66, on Friday night at Jadwin Arena.
After jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the contest’s opening minute, the Crimson did not hold an advantage again until sophomore forward Chris Lewis made a layup to kick off the extra session and put his team up 62-60. Harvard (15-11, 10-1 Ivy League) would not trail the rest of the way, putting the Tigers (11-15, 3-8) to bed with a dominant final five minutes of basketball.
With just over 15 minutes to play in the contest, Princeton’s lead mushroomed to 10—the largest that it would get all evening—on a night when easy baskets were at a premium. As Lewis sat on the bench in foul trouble and classmate Seth Towns struggled to find his stroke, Harvard went on a 13-4 run over the next eight minutes to get to within one and set the stage for the game’s home stretch. A balanced offensive attack proved to be just what the doctor ordered for the guests.
“It is a difficult challenge to come back here against a really good Princeton team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I know they have had some struggles and they are better than their record and I think we know that. It was critical that we answered. The only way we do that is if you show some toughness and togetherness. I thought our kids did that tremendously well.”
In overtime, it was all Crimson. The guests closed the game on a 10-4 run, stymying the Tigers on both ends. Freshmen Danilo Djuricic and Mario Haskett and sophomore Henry Welsh—who replaced Lewis after he fouled out—combined for eight of those points. Not bad for a trio that entered the contest averaging a combined 3.1 points per game. Harvard made four of its six field goal attempts and four of its five tries from the charity stripe in the extra session.
“I thought they got a lot of nice minutes out of the kid Welsh,” Princeton coach Mitch Henderson said. “Djuricic made two really big shots, Haskett got to the rim. They’ve got a nice, balanced team.”
Rebounding and balance proved to be the difference as both teams extended their streaks—the Crimson has now won six in a row while the Tigers’ skid stands at seven. The strength of Princeton’s Ivy League championship team from a season ago was its balance and its experience. This year, Henderson relies on a trio of guards—senior Amir Bell and juniors Devin Cannady and Myles Stephens—for almost everything. Harvard was able to capitalize on the inexperience and physical ineptitude of Princeton’s frontcourt on Friday, outrebounding the Tigers by an egregious 38-24 margin.
“[It’s] always been for our program to play inside out and that’s obviously on both ends of the floor for us,” Amaker said. “Tremendous job from our kids on the backboard tonight.”
As it did during the first matchup with the Tigers, the Crimson received breakout performances from players not normally known for their offense. Two weeks after sophomore guard Christian Juzang reached the 20-point mark for the first time, fellow second-year Justin Bassey gave Amaker a spark, finishing with a career-high 18 points to go along with eight rebounds in 36 minutes. Djuricic and Haskett played huge roles down the stretch for Harvard as well. Djuricic connected on two key three-pointers and played the five on several occasions as Lewis battled foul trouble. Haskett tied a career-high with nine points and was a force penetrating the Princeton defense, especially in overtime.
The trio of underclassmen helped to will the Crimson on a night when it bent but did not break. Whenever it seemed that the Tigers were bound to put the game out of reach, Harvard had an answer. Princeton led by as many as eight in the first half—holding an edge of some sort for nearly 18 minutes in the frame—but the Crimson went into the locker room trailing by just three.
“At the half, we talked about how we were lucky to be in the position we were in,” Amaker said. “We were fortunate based on how we played offensively just to be down by one possession at the half. I thought that if we could continue to keep our heads up and get quality shots, we liked our chances.”
After Stephens scored 9 of Princeton’s 13 points to start the second half and put his team up nine, Harvard answered by holding the Tigers scoreless for nearly two and a half minutes. The Crimson was back within one with five minutes remaining after Towns calmly sunk three attempts from the charity stripe.
“We knew that they weren’t going to go away,” Stephens said. “We knew that they were going to make some big shots and they did. We knew overtime was going to be a fight but we’ve played in overtime games this year and we’ve just gotta figure out a way to come out on top in those games.”
The most exciting offensive stretch of the evening began with just under four minutes to play in regulation. Bell drove through contact in the Harvard zone for two but Bassey knocked down a three the next time down. Princeton freshman forward Jerome Desrosiers brought the home crowd back to its feet and pushed the Tigers’ advantage back to three only to see Bassey drill another triple from almost the exact same spot. Bell capped the stretch the same way that he started it. His team took timeout and everyone in attendance braced for the final 2:32 of regulation.
“I thought Bassey’s back-to-back threes were critical baskets,” Amaker said. “We just got great production from different people. Rio Haskett gave us amazing minutes. Henry Welsh off the bench, Danilo off the bench, second half, I thought the difference for us was off the bench.”
The Crimson trailed by no more than six points over the final 14 minutes of regulation but did not secure a lead at all during that stretch. Despite the 13 combined points over the span of 1:17, the teams combined for just two more points (a layup by Towns with 1:27 to play) in regulation. Princeton missed four free throws in the final four minutes of regulation and bricked four more in overtime on a night when Stephens was the only Tiger who could consistently score. The junior finished with 33 of his team’s 66 points. He was an efficient 11-of-14 from the field to set a career-high while the rest of his team shot just 13-of-38.
“We obviously didn’t defend him,” Amaker said. “He is very difficult to match up with. He shoots the three-point shot, he posts up, he can drive it in, a terrific ball-handler. He’s good enough to go by our players so there is nothing that he can’t do on the offensive end and plays with a toughness and passion that I think becomes contagious for their team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team (13-10-4, 11-6-3 ECAC) hits the road after finishing up its home portion of regular season play last weekend, logging decisive wins over then-No. 7 Clarkson and St. Lawrence. The fruitful weekend helped the Crimson clinch a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament.
But Harvard must play out its final weekend of regular season action against two hungry rivals still jockeying for position in the conference standings. Tonight, the Crimson battle Brown (6-17-4, 5-14-1), looking to complete the season sweep.

The Winter Olympics are in full swing, and there have been some spectacular moments in all the events. But not all performances are created equal. Meet Elizabeth "Liz" Swaney (MDes '09), an Olympic freestyle skier. She went viral recently after a half-pipe run in which she performed almost no tricks, ultimately finishing last in the 24-woman field. With that skillset, how did Swaney ever manage to qualify for the Olympics? Here’s how, with classic Harvard finesse.
Find the gem class—er, event
In order to qualify for an Olympic competition, the contender must finish in the top 30 of the corresponding World Cup events. It seems that the half-pipe doesn’t even attract 30 entries most of the time, so Swaney was able to make the cut by consistently showing up to these unfilled events.
Exploit the loopholes
Interestingly, Swaney was representing Hungary during this Olympics. It turns out that there is a special Hungarian team rule that reapportions spots on the team in order to balance the number of men and women. With this provision, Swaney was able to get a spot on the team.
Do the bare minimum
Without doing any tricks apart from an occasional 180 degree spin, Swaney did manage to complete all clean runs. After coming in last with a whopping 31.40 out of 100, she told the Associated Press that she “didn’t qualify for finals so [she is] really disappointed.”
Some say that Swaney did not take the Olympics seriously, while others praised her for her perseverance in qualifying for a huge event. Whatever the case, she took this challenge on with true Harvard spirit, and Flyby wishes her the best of luck on her future endeavors.

Don't squash it 'til you try it. While the sport's title doesn't sound too badass, winning a national championship for the fourth  year straight is.
This week was marked by not one, but two anti-LGBTQ controversies centering on Harvard College Faith and Action. On Saturday, protesters silently stood up against an "ex-gay" speaker invited to campus by the religious group.
Wednesday brought unseasonably high temperatures, enjoyed by Harvard rowers, and at least 52 sundress-wearers.

...And Thursday brought snow. All of New England let out a collective sigh after getting hot-and-bothered by the previous day's tease.
The sun sets on a whirlwind week, which (thankfully) went by quickly following Monday's holiday.
