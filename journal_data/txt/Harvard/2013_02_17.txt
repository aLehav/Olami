After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a battle for late-season momentum, the Harvard men’s hockey team skated to a 2-2 draw against historic rival Cornell (9-13-3, 5-10-3) Saturday night at a crowded Bright Hockey Center.
Usually one of the most highly touted games of the year, of flying fish and Love Story fame, this contest is rarely one between the bottom-dwellers of the ECAC. But that was the story this year, with the Crimson (7-15-3, 4-12-2 ECAC) sitting in last and the Big Red entering Saturday ahead of Harvard by just three points.
Nevertheless, both teams had hopes of building on some recent success to spark a late surge. Cornell had snapped a seven-game losing streak with a win over No. 17 Dartmouth the night before, and the Crimson had snapped a nine-game winless streak earlier in the week in the consolation game of the Beanpot against No. 13 Boston University.
The two Ivy League teams traded leads over the first two periods, with the Big Red going ahead 1-0 early in the first and Harvard taking a 2-1 lead in the second, but regulation ended with the teams knotted at two.
Despite being outshot, 40-23, the Crimson had several chances to take two points on the night.
With around 20 seconds remaining in regulation, sophomore Tommy O’Regan passed the puck to senior Luke Greiner on a two-on-one. Greiner wristed a one-timer towards the left side of the Cornell net, but Big Red netminder Andy Iles dove to the left and blocked the forward’s shot.
The two teams were unable to capitalize in the five-minute overtime period, and each team left the 141st meeting between the two with one point.
With four games in the last six days, the Crimson was unable to muster enough energy to win in the end, but finished the weekend with three out of a possible four points.
“To me energy wise I thought we ran out of gas,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “A lot of that goes to giving credit to Cornell—I think they did a good job of getting the pucks deep and holding on to it and when we needed it [junior Raphael Girard] came up with some good saves.”
Girard finished with 38 saves on the night in front of a crowd filled primarily by Cornell fans.
“It’s always nice to kind of silence the crowd a little bit at times,” Girard said.
Cornell opened up the scoring early in the first period, with senior Greg Miller scoring on a redirect of a pass from freshman defenseman Reece Wilcox from the left point.
Miller, having scored 15 points in his last 16 games, now leads the Big Red in scoring and is aiming to be the first three-time points leader for Cornell since Matt Moulson, who currently plays for the NHL’s New York Islanders.
The score remained 1-0 for most of the first before the home team responded with a power-play goal with less than thirty seconds left in the opening frame. assistant captain Alex Fallstrom was able to put a rebound into the net after the Crimson initially won a fight along the boards.
The two teams traded goals in the second period, with Harvard first taking the lead with an opportunistic goal.
After a lengthy set up by Cornell, captain Nick D’Agostino skated up the left side from behind the Big Red net, tripped and fell, and lost the puck. Harvard freshman Kyle Criscuolo took the puck from the defenseman, skated back towards the Cornell goal, and sent the puck across the left to senior Marshall Everson, who fired the puck past Iles.
The Big Red was able to tie the game at two with an even-strength goal by D’Agostino. Freshman forward Joel Lowry cut back along the left side, sent the puck behind the net to teammate Brian Ferlin, who curled back up to the right side of the net and passed the puck to the captain, who one-timed it past Girard.
With two more goals tonight, the senior class has scored 11 of the last 13 goals, and entering the game, the Crimson had 11 goals in the previous two games compared to 11 goals in the nine before that.
“I think our senior group has really elevated its game,” Donato said. “They are the catalysts for us and with their improved play our power play has become better and they’ve given us a real lift emotionally as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night when most of the Ivy basketball world was looking ahead to Saturday, the Harvard men’s basketball team made sure it took care of business at home on Friday night first.
The Crimson (14-7, 6-1 Ivy) cruised to an easy victory over Penn (5-18, 2-4) at Lavietes Pavilion—its first stress-free win of conference play thus far—to set up a much-anticipated contest against Princeton on Saturday that will place one of those two teams alone atop Ivy standings midway through the conference season.
To get to that point unscathed, Harvard was led by an unlikely hero. Making his first start since a Nov. 27 loss to Vermont, sophomore center Kenyatta Smith turned in a career night, registering 20 points, 10 blocks—a program record—and nine rebounds.
“I was a little nervous, having not started since the beginning of the season,” Smith said. “Ever since [finding out], I’ve just been trying to calm myself down, just focus on playing my game.”
After Smith only registered an average of 7.5 minutes in the 15 contests between his November benching and Friday’s contest, Amaker—hoping for more size against the Quakers’ taller big men—surprisingly turned to his largest interior presence to replace the smaller Jonah Travis at the five.
“I mentioned to Jonah that we weren’t down on him,” Amaker said. “We just felt this was a moment we needed to make an adjustment and see where it would take us.”
What the coach never could have expected was that his decision would result in the performance turned in by Smith, who was seven-of-eight from the field in 31 minutes.
“He was really brilliant when it came to making shots,” Amaker said. “Inside-out is how we always want to play, and we haven’t been able to do that as well [this season].... Hopefully Kenyatta’s going to be the answer for that as we continue to move forward.”
Along with sophomore wing Wesley Saunders—who had a game-high 23 points Friday—Smith was the significant piece of Amaker’s recruiting class of 2015. Named the 13th best center in the country by Rivals, Smith chose the Crimson over fellow finalists Vanderbilt and Penn.
After struggling to get off the bench behind Kyle Casey and Keith Wright ’12 as a rookie and losing his starting job early this season, it took a match-up with the Quakers, a team he turned down, for Smith to finally be the player Amaker hoped he could be.
“I said to him, ‘This is why you’re here,’” Amaker said. “It was time for him step forward in this program. We needed him to give us what we recruited him to do.”
“[Amaker] had a lot of faith in me,” Smith added. “He told me he was counting on me and I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let the team down.”
With 1:59 left in the blowout, the coach decided to pull his starters, including his center, who exited just shy of a triple-double.
“You have to have a post presence,” Amaker said. “He’s our best option when it comes to that, and I was incredibly impressed with the way he handled it tonight.”
CARTWRIGHT CONTAINED
Coming into Friday night’s contest, Penn guard Miles Cartwright was fourth in the Ivy League in scoring at 14.0 points per game and was coming off a season-high 28 points against Brown.
But Harvard was able to contain the junior throughout the night, holding him to just eight points on three-of-11 shooting.
“[It’s] not that we shut Cartwright down, but we certainly made life difficult for a very good player,” Amaker said.
Amaker gave much of the credit to Saunders, who the coach has often tasked with defending the opponent’s best perimeter player this season.
“Wesley’s a hard guy for guards, especially smaller guards, to score against,” Amaker said. “He’s big, he’s strong, [and] he has the ability to stay in front of them.”
EASIER SAID THAN DONE
Friday marked the first comfortable victory in Ancient Eight play for the Crimson, which had blown large advantages or needed dramatic comebacks in its previous five conference wins.
Those victories had come by an average of 5.4 points, but Harvard never had much trouble with the Quakers.
After Penn tied the game at nine early on, the Crimson outscored the Quakers by 10 for the rest of the first half. In the second period, the advantaged ballooned to as large as 22 with 7:41 to go, and unlike in its previous games against Yale, Brown, and Cornell, the victory was never in question.
“We had been able to play hard for about 20 minutes, a half at most before it starts to fall apart,” Smith said. “We just tried to break that chain tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Princeton came into Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night, the game not only featured a matchup of the two top teams in the league, but also the conference’s two top players—Harvard’s Wesley Saunders and the Tigers’ Ian Hummer.
Entering the weekend’s contests, the Ivies were led in scoring by those two, with the former holding a 1.4-point advantage at 17.0 points per game. And while Saunders, a sophomore, is ranked fourth in conference in field goal percentage, Hummer, a senior, trails him at the number five position. The two are separated by only one other player in assists per game as well, and have comparable statistics in many other categories.
So, on Saturday, when their two squads stepped on the floor, it was no surprise to see Saunders match up against Hummer on the first possession of the evening.
The first two interactions between the two seemed to illustrate their close standing, as Saunders first forced a Hummer turnover and Hummer returned the favor with a made jump shot the next time he touched the ball.
“Hummer is a nightmare of a matchup and a warrior…. He is a very tough guy to guard,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s physical; he’s always on the move. He’s very active. You can’t let your guard down for one second on the defensive end. Wesley did as well as anyone could do.”
Following a Princeton adjustment that placed Hummer further inside, a strategy that took advantage of his size relative to Saunders, the latter was moved off of the bigger Hummer, and the assignment was given instead to Crimson bigs, namely sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi.
Hummer ended up with 18 points and seven rebounds on the night, shooting 7-of-14 from the field and four-of-four from the charity stripe. Saunders notched 11 points, only two-thirds of his normal output, but tallied five assists along with two steals.
TWO BIGS/TOO BIG
With 7:16 remaining in the second half, an unusual lineup appeared for Harvard. After Saunders picked up his fourth foul, he was subbed out in favor of Mondou-Missi. With sophomore big Kenyatta Smith already on the court, the Crimson then featured a lineup with two players who log time at the center position.
“Different guys have been able to step in and step forward,” said Amaker, referring to his team’s adaptation to this lineup. “It’s been a good calling card for this group…. We thought we could get [Saunders] out and preserve that last foul as long as we could. Our kids did a good job of playing without [him].”
The two-big lineup lasted a total of three minutes and 36 seconds, during which time Harvard went on a 10-4 run to take a double-digit lead, 62-48. Mondou-Missi and Smith combined for half of those Crimson points, five of their total 28 points for the game. The two amassed seven rebounds apiece, and Smith collected six blocks.
“I’ve mentioned to our players that Kenyatta was ready for an opportunity, and he embraced it…” Amaker explained. “[And] Steve, his energy and effort off the bench, he’s a sixth starter and has been sacrificing himself to do whatever we need for our team.”
Saturday night’s game marked the second consecutive start for Smith, over which period he has shot 94.5 percent from the field, put up 34 points, and swatted 16 blocks.
“I always knew he was a great player,” Mondou-Missi said of Smith. “I always believed in him, the team believed in him, Coach believed in him. He’s done a great job…. He’s a great player, [and] he’s shown it the last two games.”
CHARITY GIVING
In a game that often comes down to inches, the measurement of 15-feet was more important for Harvard against the Tigers. For the first 33 minutes and seven seconds of the night, the Crimson did not miss a single shot from the free throw line, going a perfect eight-for-eight thanks to shots from both Smith and Saunders. While Mondou-Missi eventually broke the streak, his four-for-six from the charity stripe was almost 10 percent better than his in-conference average for the season.
The importance of free throws down the stretch was accentuated by several late Harvard mistakes—in the final 8:30 of the contest, Harvard hit eight out of 10 of its free takes, while turning the ball over four times.
And, when Princeton employed a strategy of intentionally fouling Mondou-Missi, hitting from the charity stripe became the Crimson’s only offensive option. Fortunately for Harvard, it ended the game shooting 16-of-18 from the line, good for 88.9 percent—its best performance thus far in Ivy play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of the crowd at Jadwin Gymnasium, Harvard women’s basketball dropped an early lead to Princeton on Saturday night and fell in the Tigers’ territory for the fourth consecutive year.
The home team took advantage of the Crimson’s (13-8, 4-3 Ivy) inability to maintain momentum, which led to Harvard’s second-straight loss of the weekend, 67-51. Suffering from a high number of turnovers, the team could not push past the Tigers and fell to third place in the Ivy League standings behind Princeton (16-5, 7-0) and Penn.
“We took great shots and they didn’t fall for us,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t have any criticism for [our team]. I thought we played hard, I thought we played confidently. I guess Princeton, because of their history, has more confidence than we do.”
With twelve minutes to go in the first half, the Tigers stepped on the gas to overtake Harvard. Leading the rush, guard Niveen Rasheed broke from Harvard’s defense to capitalize on a fast-break opportunity.  The Crimson then coughed up the ball twice, opening the door for Princeton guards Blake Dietrick and Michelle Miller to sink four treys in quick succession. In a minute and a half, the Tigers went on a 14-2 run that gave them a seven-point lead, one that they would keep for the rest of the game.
“There are shifts in momentum in every game,” Delaney-Smith said. “To have a seven point lead, then tie it up, and stay close for a while, that’s normal basketball. I don’t think there was any overwhelming factor [as to] why that happened.”
Harvard turnovers thwarted what should have been strong drives for the team all night. The Crimson lost the ball 23 times, almost twice the number of carries that Princeton surrendered. The team’s twelve fouls further burdened its momentum, undercutting Harvard’s efforts.
“Princeton is the best team in the league at capitalizing on mistakes and turning them into baskets,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re really good at capitalizing on turnovers.”
The visiting squad stayed on the Tigers’ heels until the end of the first half, cutting Princeton’s lead to four points. With one minute remaining, the Tigers made two free throws and followed up on a turnover for a lay-up, closing out the half eight points up on the Crimson.
“We felt we played them well for the most part and discussed adjustments [at halftime that] we needed to make in the second half,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “We were confident if we made those adjustments we would win.”
But Harvard continued to forfeit drives to turnovers, recording 10 in the second half while Princeton pulled ahead with consistent scoring. The Crimson found itself trailing by 18 points with seven minutes remaining in the game, its largest deficit. A six-two run begun by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle with 6:24 remaining allowed Harvard to narrow the Tiger’s lead to 16 points. Christine Clark tallied the final points for the Crimson and the team finished both halves with the same margin of deficit.
Harvard took an early lead over Princeton with consistent drives to the net. Clark opened the scoring at the minute mark, followed quickly by a lay-up by senior forward Victoria Lippert, the Crimson’s top scorer for the game. Two more buckets and two free throws gave Harvard a six-point advantage.
“We were confident,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we were well prepared. We kept the discipline [after] dropping Penn the night before. I loved how we started, I think we started strong.”
The Crimson was in foul trouble all night, notching 20 fouls to send the Tigers to the charity stripe 21 times. Although Harvard went a perfect six for six on free throws, Princeton outdid the Crimson by sheer number of trips to the line.
Lippert, Fagbenle, and sophomore forward Erin McDonnell led Harvard offensively, netting 13, 10, and 9 points—McDonnell’s career high—respectively. Rasheed joined Dietrick in double figures, chipping in a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Co-captain Miriam Rutzen supported the Crimson with good returns on rebounds, pulling down eight boards.
The Tigers won the game on three pointers, an aspect of play that Harvard couldn’t get going. Dietrick went five for nine from downtown, while the Crimson only converted on three of 13 attempts. Despite not starting the game, Dietrick was on the court for 30 minutes and led Princeton scoring with a career high 19 points. Headed by Dietrick, the Tiger bench contributed 35 points to the 19 put up by Harvard’s reserves.

Just over three minutes into the game, the Harvard women’s hockey team had already netted two goals and set the tone for its match against Colgate (9-19-3, 4-13-3 ECAC) Saturday night at Starr Arena. The Crimson (19-4-2, 15-2-1) bounced back from a Friday night loss against league rival Cornell to top the Raiders, 5-2.
“I think we had good balance [and] good shots in the net,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They worked hard and created penalties off of speed.”
Freshman Mary Parker capitalized on a Colgate cross checking penalty 21 seconds into the contest. The forward’s score was assisted by senior Kaitlin Spurling, who followed up less than two minutes later with a goal of her own.
A Raider hooking penalty led to another power play opportunity for Harvard. Spurling found the back of the net off of a rebounding shot from sophomore Michelle Picard. The senior forward has had just two other matches in her career with multiple goals.
“The second power play unit has really stepped it up [by] putting pucks in the net,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “And I think it’s just because of us moving the puck really well.”
The first period of play included a Colgate goal from Brittany Phillips, assisted by Megan Wickens. The Crimson suffered two penalties at the end of the frame, but Harvard was able to shut out the Raiders’ power play for the two minutes that stretched into the second stanza.
The Crimson widened its lead when sophomore defender Sarah Edney rocketed a puck past Colgate’s rookie goaltender Ashlynne Rando. Spurling notched her second goal of the day minutes later with a pass from sophomore forward Samantha Reber.
“One of the key things we wanted to do was get to the net [and] get in the goalie’s face, put pressure on her, [and] create rebounds,” Dempsey said.
Harvard more than doubled the number of shots on goal attempted by the Raiders, 35-16.
“We have a pretty potent offense and it’s a matter of getting there,” Stone said. “We did a better job of that, getting on the goaltender and taking some shots. We’re trying to improve our game and not [make] too many changes.”
The Crimson was called for two consecutive penalties at the end of the second frame, giving Colgate a five-on-three opportunity. The Raiders were able to convert on their final power play, when Katie Case used a rebound to put the puck in the back of the net.
Colgate was able to connect on only one of six power play opportunities.
Junior Kalley Armstrong potted the last goal of the match off of a feed up the middle from sophomore forward Hillary Crowe, marking Crowe’s fourth consecutive game with a point. Armstrong’s shot brought the final score to 5-2 seven minutes into the third period.
“We made [it] a focus right away, to get pucks in the net and get going,” Dempsey said. “ We don’t like losing, and so we had that extra fire going right off the bat.”
The Raiders were unable to get any shots off throughout the entire third frame. Co-captain Laura Bellamy produced 15 saves in the game and gained her tenth straight win, bringing the goaltender’s record to 11-1-1 on the season. Bellamy and the rest of Harvard’s seniors have never dropped a game to Colgate throughout their Crimson careers.
Harvard is facing its final four regular season conference games at home at Bright Hockey Center. Both Dempsey and Stone have the potential to set personal records in the season’s homestretch. Dempsey remains one point away from breaking into the Crimson’s top 10 career point scorers and Stone needs only three wins to reach the 400 mark of her career.
“We’re looking forward to being home,” Stone said. “We’re hoping that we’re going to have a good fan base in the building because we’re certainly going to need it. It feels like we haven’t been home in a long time.”
Harvard, which hosts Brown this Tuesday, can earn home ice for the entirety of the ECAC tournament if it wins out.
“I can’t believe that it’s already at this point being a senior,” Dempsey said. “I’m looking to just go out there, work extremely hard, make the most of it, and savor these moments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard co-captain Steven Keith tallied his 100th career win after a 7-2 decision over Brown’s Cortlandt Choate at the Malkin Athletic Center Saturday afternoon. The senior went undefeated for the day, securing his 101st victory a few hours later against Boston University’s Tyler Scotton. Keith now joins the ranks of teammate and co-captain Walter Peppelman in the 100-win club. Keith’s squad ended up winning both of Saturday’s contests, handily taking care of each opponent.
HARVARD 31, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 6
Harvard (7-5, 4-4 EIWA) traveled just down the road to take on the Terriers (7-9) after beating Brown on Saturday.
Freshman Jeffrey Ott opened the match with a 14-0 major decision, going undefeated for the day. Senior Shay Warren continued the Crimson lead after registering a takedown in overtime, securing a 4-2 decision in the 133 weight class.
Keith racked in a third victory for Harvard as well as his 101st career win after defeating his opponent, 4-0.
“Steven went out and did what Steven does,” Peppelman said. “He won a good match against a tough opponent.”
Freshman Todd Preston also went undefeated for the day after clinching a close 8-6 victory over Boston University’s Nick Tourville.
“Preston really shined and beat a top competitor, a junior who’s been in the lineup for the past two years for BU,” Peppelman said. “Todd stepped it up and won there, and that was really big for Todd and good for the team as well.”
At 157, Peppelman pinned his opponent in the opening period. The senior has yet to lose a match in a dual meet this season.
“Luckily I was able to secure a pin, which was good for me,” Peppelman said. “It was a personal victory having lost to that guy before, so that was kind of exciting.”
The Terriers snagged their first decision in the 165 weight class, but the Crimson answered with a takedown by junior Cameron Croy, who secured a 6-1 win.
Freshman Michael Mocco hit the mat for his second college match but this time was able to walk away with a victory.
“Mocco did a really great job responding to injuries,” Peppelman said. “Michael broke his neck in the beginning of the year, and this weekend was his first time back wrestling in competition, so for him to be the winner over a tough competitor in a high pressure situation was phenomenal.”
Boston University picked up the two final bouts, but Harvard ended the meet with a definitive 31-6 victory.
“I’d really like to point out that the freshmen did a really good job,” Peppelman said. “Half of the wrestlers competing against BU were freshmen, so it’s really good to get that big win with such a young team.”
HARVARD 21, BROWN 11
The Crimson took down the Bears (8-8, 2-6), 21-11, winning seven out of ten bouts on the day.
The lineup began with Ott wrestling at 125 against William Waterson. Ott secured a 6-0 decision for Harvard, his fourth straight win over the past two weekends.
“I knew 125 was a big match with Jeff Ott,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I wanted him wrestling first, and he wrestled awesome, so that was a big one for us… he’s a fire plug. He goes hard all the time.”
After falling to Brown in a close 3-2 decision at 133, Harvard took back the lead after Keith registered his 100th win at 141.
“I mean [Keith] always controls bouts,” Weiss said. “He did a great job…it’s his 100th win, you know that’s pretty special. That’s a lot. To get 100 wins in college, that’s a lot. Walter and Steven doing it this year, that was tremendous.”
Preston extended the Crimson lead, 9-3, with a strong 11-5 win over the Bears’ Zach Rees.
Peppelman secured a 9-2 decision at 157, bringing his season record to 12-2.
“Walter, obviously he’s a leader,” Weiss said. “He did a great job and went and got a good win.”
Brown responded with a major decision over freshman Devon Gobbo, decreasing the scoring gap to a five-point difference.
When Croy snagged another win for Harvard, the Bears answered with a decision of their own over Mocco. The bout was Mocco’s first college match.
“Mocco at 184, he’s not our starter,” Weiss said. “[It’s the] first time he’s wrestled all year…he wanted to jump out, and he asked to wrestle, and I couldn’t ask for anything better going up against their best guy. He did a nice job and he hung in there.”
Sophomore James Fox and freshman Nick Gajdzik rounded out the Crimson victory, each securing decisions against his respective opponent. Fox’s match came down to the final seconds, but the sophomore was able to finish out the bout with a win, 3-2. Gajdzik’s 5-2 decision brought the final score to 21-11.
