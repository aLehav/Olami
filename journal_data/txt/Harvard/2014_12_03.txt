After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We at The Harvard Crimson acknowledge the evolving nature of language, and as such we recognise the necessity of updating our comprehensive Style Guide to accommodate questions that have arisen over the past few years. This supplement should be seen as The Harvard Crimson’s official position on all matters of grammar, and it must be utilised by all throughout the building.
Pronouns: In this evolving world, two singular pronouns simply are not enough. To obviate all potential confusion, we have elected to anticipate the rise of various new words to describe various identities and will henceforth refer to every human mentioned in a Crimson article by the gender-neutral pronoun ze. All instances of “he” and “she” will be diligently Ctrl-R’ed by the managing editor.
Spelling: In response to confusion regarding the correct spelling of “theatre,” The Harvard Crimson has decided that we will from this point utilise only the British spelling in all of our published material. “Color” is now “colour,” “center” is “centre,” and, of course, we never, never, ever write “theater.” I think I lost a bit of class just typing that.
Vernacular: Words commonly used in modern parlance are frequently inappropriate for our hallowed pages, but there has been significant confusion in the past about which words fall into this category. Compiling a list of such words would be a great deal of work however; fortunately, Time Magazine has anticipated our need and conveniently published a “Which Word Should Be Banned in 2015” poll. No Crimson editor may henceforth ever use any word on this list in any writing whatsoever. No longer shall our newspaper be tarnished by slang like “basic,” “kale,” and, of course, “feminist.”
Apostrophes: Every time a writer utilises a forward single quotation mark instead of a proper apostrophe before an abbreviated year, the managing editor loses as little bit more of zer soul. We at The Harvard Crimson all know better than Microsoft Word, now and forever.
Opinion pieces: Some readers have noted an apparent incongruity between the opinion pieces that The Crimson Staff publishes and the ostensible views of several thousand highly educated young adults living in Cambridge, Mass. In order to achieve the highest possible consistency in our editorials, we have therefore abolished the practice of inviting all Crimson editors to Editorial meetings and determining the staff opinion based on the votes of the four people who actually show up. Instead, we will just ask Alan M. Dershowitz what ze thinks.
Italics: The Harvard Crimson never uses italics. We just don’t like them. If Arts needs to make the title of a film, book, album, or theatre show possessive, they can go fuck themselves.

I
Among 20 warring urbane film critics,
The only thing agreed on
Was the bliss of the truly bad movie.
II
In three classes I was behind,
Like a movie marathon
In which there are three bad movies.
III
The bad movie moaned in the autumn winds.
It was an orgasmic mirror of the times.
IV
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a bad movie date
Are done.
V
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of Renoir the elder
Or the beauty of his son,
The bad movie opening
Or just after.
VI
Lonely watchers filled the long theater
With barbaric laughs.
The shadow of the bad movie
Crossed it, to and fro.
They all
Traced in the shadow
An improbable joy.
VII
O film critics of America,
Why do you imagine Oscar birds?
Do you not see how the bad movie
Bleats into the ears
Of the pedestrians about you?
VIII
I know noble actors
And lucid, inescapable moments;
But I know, too,
That the bad movie is involved
In what I know.
IX
When the bad movie flew out of sight
It missed the edge
Of one of many circles.
X
At the sight of bad movies
Winning on the red carpet night,
Even the gods of ultra-kitsch
Would cry out sharply.
XI
Hitchcock rode over Hollywood
In a limousine.
Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his mother-in-law
For a bad movie.
XII
The earth is shaking.
The bad movie must be finishing.
XIII
The director didn’t have money for realistic sets.
It was showing
And it was going to show.
The bad movie sat
On its plutonic throne.

Dear members of the Crimson community,
As you may know, at the end of each year The Crimson’s executives meet to elect their successors. While a little bit late to the game, I would like to humbly submit my candidacy for the position of president of The Harvard Crimson. Below are some of my policy proposals for the coming year.
–WRITER RETENTION: Retain writers. Detain writers. Lock them inside the building and do not let them escape. While they claw desperately at the windowpanes and call out for help to the unhearing passersby outside, release an odorless tranquilizing gas that will slowly suffuse the air. As the writers lose consciousness, stroke their heads gently and reassure them that it will all be over soon. And when they awaken, they will find themselves in a room lit only by the warm glow of a computer screen, the cursor of a word document blinking insistently, impelling them to write. And they shall write. Ceaselessly, ceaselessly, they shall write. And they shall never leave us. Ever.
–LIBEL: I understand just how important it is to make sure that our paper is free of libel. That’s why as president, I will randomly insert libellous content into every daily issue to ensure maximum vigilance on the part of the Managing Editor. Madeline R. Conway ’16, you have been warned.
–MULTIMEDIA CONTENT: Thoughtful, thorough multimedia content should be paired with every piece we publish. As president, I will push to make sure that all of our articles are accompanied by photography, video, epic poetry, a seasonal and locally sourced apéritif, a Soviet-inspired montage film depicting everyday life in the city of Odessa, and a complimentary lemon-scented moist towelette.
–BOARD MERGERS: Combine sports and business. Combine news and design. Combine all boards to create a super dense mass pulsating with the heat of a thousand suns. And we shall explode outwards, engulfing planets and stars and the emptiest reaches of the known and unknown universe. And then we shall forge a new universe, one governed by our laws and our desires. And ours shall be a harsh justice, and we shall show no mercy.
–Something something interboard collaboration
–WEB PRESENCE: As the importance of digital media grows, we need to be asking ourselves, “What is the role of The Crimson’s website?” And really, what is a website? What is the internet? What is a computer? If your grandmother asked you these questions, how far would you actually be able to get before pointing dumbly at a wall socket, pawing at the air, and just barely restraining yourself from making some sort of tubes-based analogy? How the hell is it that you spend umpteen hours a day hooked up to a device that you cannot even begin to explain? My God, if an asteroid hit Earth today and civilization was wiped out, would you even be able to feed yourself? These are the questions I will be answering during my presidency.
Respectfully submitted,
Erica X Eisen

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the post-modern approach to art has delegated the importance of narrative to the proverbial back burner, “The Arts Board” is a torch-bearer of that new school, a veritable Statue of Liberty to whose crown an ensemble cast of executive editors cling, much as a newborn babe clutches its mother’s fingers. In the interest of linear narrative, little in the 525,949-minute runtime of “The Arts Board” makes any sort of sense; in the interest of misplaced one-liners, arresting visuals, and a soundtrack that bewilders, “The Arts Board” is revolutionary, visionary.
Greedily engulfing every artistic genre known to man, “The Arts Board” dons drama, comedy, satire, tragedy, romance, and animated children’s film intermittently: it provokes you to laugh and weep at alternate turns, to both condemn and sympathize with its characters as they fall and redeem themselves in near-Biblical majesty. Yes, Campus Arts Executive Tree A. Palmedo ’16 (played with remarkable poise by Tree Palmedo) descends into drunken madness during a moment of stress and weakness, but are we not elevated, in the presence of the divine, even, when the following day he appears in drag specifically to lighten the spirits of his co-characters? When incoming Film Executive Jude D. Russo ’16 (Jude Russo) claims that poetry should have ended with Milton, do we not forgive him when he martyrs himself for the collective, clutching a bloodied copy of Dickinson’s works to his chest?
However, that character development is sometimes muddled by the film’s overwhelmingly meta self-referentiality: directors Natalie T. Chang ’15 and Erica X Eisen ’16 make frequent cameos that are clearly moments of narcissism rather than motif, providing little more than an overarching sense of inevitable doom. The heavy-handed treatment of their appearances drowns the film in predictable foreshadowing: Chang appears, and without fail someone is fired. Eisen appears, and someone’s German pronunciation is corrected. Outgoing Film Executive Alan R. Xie ’16 (Alan Xie) appears, and the audience is subjected to a tale of horrific weekend dalliances.
This simple-minded repetitiveness may have been due in part to the obviously inadequate budgeting of “The Arts Board”: in another turn of unappealing breaks of the fourth wall, there are constant references to low funding and the poor quality of props ranging from beer to computers. One would think that the computers, at least, could be given the appearance of functionality: alas, such details seem to have gone unnoticed by the crew. In their place are nonsensical allusions to both a mysterious prequel and a similarly nonlinear sequel. If such a sequel is green-lighted, this critic can only hope that it shakes the chains of its predecessor and, blinking against the bright light of a new day, leads a fresh-faced cast in a successful exodus across the Red Sea. Or perhaps…a Crimson Sea.
—Natalie T. Chang is the outgoing Arts Chair and incoming nuclear missile. She hasn't slept in 40 hours.

“No, you may not record this interview,” says Tree A. Palmedo ’16. He’s sitting in the newsroom of The Crimson, wearing a “St. Vincent” t-shirt and sipping a red solo cup filled to the brim with cheap wine. Palmedo, an incredibly amazing musician, writer, poet, entrepreneur, part-time drag queen, and active Crimson Arts editor, has received more than seven awards, including third place at the National Trumpet Competition, fifth place in the Oregon high school choir competition, and a “Certificate of Participation” from the Portland T-Ball Little League. Palmedo will be on campus until 2016, taking classes at Harvard College and writing for The Crimson sometimes. Though we weren’t allowed to record this interview, we promise we took the best notes we could.
The Harvard Crimson: So first of all, what kind of a name is Tree? Is it a nickname or something?
Tree A. Palmedo: Actually, Tree is my real name.
THC: Seriously? That’s kind of dumb. Why is that your name?
TAP: It’s a long story. Basically, I was born in the rainforests of Costa Rica. The first thing my mother saw when I was born was a humongous kapok tree. I was but a newborn babe, but I marched right over to that tree, climbed up to the highest branch, and leapt on the back of a toucan that I then rode into the clouds. I’ve been known as “Tree” ever since.
THC: Hmm, I’m having a hard time believing that.
TAP: Good luck fact-checking. I bet you can’t disprove it.
THC: So who are your greatest influences?
TAP: Well, as a journalist, I basically just look up to the greats. You can’t really beat the work of Erica X Eisen; I mean, that girl knows how to use a comma! As far as my Snapchat game goes, I pretty much take all my cues from Natalie T. Chang, who’s taught me to infuse my work with an ever-present sense of despair. It’s great! I also hear Adela H. Kim sends good snaps, but we’re not friends yet. As far as critics go, I always trust the judgment of Alan R. Xie. I didn’t like “Interstellar” too much when it first came out, but his four-and-a-half star review really turned me around. On a side note, I really think that guy Se-Ho B. Kim is overrated. I mean, the dude obviously knows nothing about hip-hop. And of course, my biggest influence would be William Holub-Moorman, who is probably my best friend in the whole wide world.
THC: How long can high literature continue to fetishize the impenetrable?
TAP: You know...Foucault said that...pistachios [I had a hard time reading my notes here, but I didn’t really get what he was saying anyway].
THC: What’s next on your agenda?
TAP: I’ve got a new project out soon, but I can’t tell you about it. However, I can let you know that it will blow your mind. It’s some real next level stuff. To quote a popular phrase, it’s gonna be “ultra ultra.”
THC: Anything else you’d like to add?
TAP: I always like to mention Miles Davis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a truth universally acknowledged that an aimless college student in possession of great doubt must be in want of some meaning to her life. Where else to better find that meaning than from the most sensational works of art known to man? Here is a selection of themes I extracted that may or may not be applicable to my life.
“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” —F. Scott Fitzgerald, “The Great Gatsby”
Fitzgerald’s novel focuses on the devastating results that occur when the past and present collide. In particular, it reflects the futility of discovering a brighter future when past desires exist—represented by the final image of the current drawing the boats back while they ceaselessly row forward.
“When the light turns green, you go. When the light turns red, you stop. But what do you do when the light turns blue with orange and lavender spots?” —Shel Silverstein, “A Light in the Attic”
This poem expresses the folly of upholding dichotomies in both our perceptions and reactions to the world. The world is not simply black and white (or for Silverstein, red and green), and thus we cannot act narrow-mindedly.
“You’re still here? It’s over. Go home. Go.”  — Ferris, “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”
After the credits, Ferris breaks the fourth wall to say these very words. The question is not what he means but why we, the audience, are even there to hear it. Why do we force a DVD/VHS player or laptop to muster all its energy to roll past that list of names? Are we hanging onto the last vestiges of the movie and all it stands for—to continually embrace that taste of adventure and reckless cheer? Is that not the entire film’s theme?
“My anaconda don’t want none unless you got buns hun.” —Nicki Minaj, “Anaconda”
In a literal sense, this line is about Nicki’s pet anaconda that prefers bread to classic snake cuisine. In a socially metaphorical sense, this line represents a new wave in body image—namely the growing appreciation for bodies similar to the female rapper’s. In a lesser-known zoological sense, this line reflects the snake’s continual struggle to derail its reputation as a man-eater (see J. Lo, Owen Wilson, and Ice Cube’s 1997 horror film “Anaconda”): the “buns” symbolize the unconventional perception of the anaconda as a gentle reptile, and the snake’s refusal of anything except buns signifies its desires for this more positive opinion. In all three senses, the line proclaims liberation—liberation of a snake’s nutritional choices, liberation of the female body, liberation of a species’s repute.
“I just talked to Jesus / He said, ‘What up Yeezus?’ / I said, ‘Shit I’m chilling / Trying to stack these millions.’ / I know he the most high / But I am a close high / Mi casa, su casa / That’s that cosa nostra / I am a god”  — Kanye West, “I Am A God”
No analysis needed.

“If Nicki Minaj releases a new single and it isn’t reviewed by Crimson Arts, does it actually exist?” So ponders Brian B. Kim ’15, an active Crimson Arts editor and the current music executive for the Arts section of The Harvard Crimson. Crimson Arts, which will run from now until the death of Art, has carved out a unique niche on campus, according to Arts Chair Natalie T. Chang ’15, an active Crimson Arts chair. “My life is falling apart,” Chang says. 
Chang’s co-chair, Erica X Eisen ’16, an active Crimson Arts Chair, agrees. “Crimson Arts’ uniqueness asks all kinds of questions about art, and brings to Harvard’s campus a new awareness of the indisputable grammatical fact that there’s no need for a comma before the ‘and’ in this quote. Good lord, Will, how many times?” Eisen says.
Since its start as a syndicalist samizdat produced by three seniors living in the Dudley Co-op, Crimson Arts has become, if anything, more mysterious and insular, according to members of other boards of The Crimson. “Honestly, at first, I thought [Crimson] Arts was just a group of people who sat around at the other end of the newsroom and listened to someone talk about Marvel movies,” says Cooper, an active Crimson managing editor whose name was changed due to “fear of Jude.” Jaden, an active FM chair and ex-Arts chair who also spoke on the condition that his name be changed, calls Crimson Arts a “hydra,” whatever that means.
However, Crimson Arts represents a unique voice on campus, according to Campus Arts Executive Tree A. Palmedo ’16. “The Office for the Arts calendar isn’t going to just replicate itself,” says Palmedo, an active Crimson Arts executive. “Artists visiting campus aren’t just going to talk about their artistic process without being prompted. We have a critical role in Harvard’s ecosystem of art.”
Palmedo’s co-Campus Arts executive, Will Holub-Moorman ’16, an active Crimson Arts executive and the author of this article, concurs with Palmedo: “Imagine art as a whale. A whale needs a lot of krill in order to survive. You do the math,” Holub-Moorman says. And thus the article ended.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I wrote a column this past semester, “Catwalk Society,” which lampooned various issues in the fashion industry, with a focus on those concerning modeling. The problems I described were pretty serious, I thought, and would require a total overhaul of our society’s way of thinking about race, body, gender, etc.
They would also be easily ameliorated by substituting runway models with actual cats. Aside from raising potential controversy over breed-ism as more elegant breeds like the Turkish Angora gain prominence over, say, the British Shorthair, which is chunky and grumpy-looking (and thus representatively British), I think it’s a pretty solid solution. 
Problem 1: Lack of racial diversity
Cats have fur. Fur masks skin tone. What color is cat skin, anyway? Do cats have skin, or are they just skinless, boneless, soulless masses of fur quietly plotting our demise? All coat colors are welcome as well to fend off any possible allegations of discrimination.
Problem 2: Promotion of unhealthy body image
When I first took my cat home from the Humane Society, I was told that we didn’t need to worry about portion control because cats will stop eating when they’re full. Ne’er hath a greater lie fallen upon the ears of man, I found, as my cat’s cheeks swelled to alarming proportions before my mother found it in herself to take away the kibble bowl. No worries about body image here.
Problem 3: Use of “plus-size” to mean “size 8 and above”
Thanks to the siren call of Fancy Feast, my once-sleek orange tabby now weighs as much as a small child despite being just half the size of one. Enter the era of the gloriously rotund model, in which the integrity of designer clothing is determined not by its critical reception from the fashion industry greats but by its ability to contain the well-fed bellies of the felines that are wearing it.
Problem 4: Commercial exploitation of androgynous and transgender models
If you’re close enough to a cat to see its genitalia, you’re too close. Step away from the cat. You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?

"You'll never be new money," he said, slicked-back dark hair glistening in the sunlight. "You want to make it in this city? Where you end up in your best case scenario—I was born there." Then he cocked his gun back and lodged a bullet in my brain. **When I first moved into a sprawling mansion in the Hamptons, my neighbors were kind enough to send me a gift basket. They were a nice couple: retired, whittling away the infinity of their incorporeal existence living by the sea. There's really not much you can do as a ghost. Read Descartes or Schopenhauer, I guess. **It was lovely seeing my in-laws at the wedding. Their family was from a small farming town out in the Midwest before an accidental fire burned down their house one night while they were all asleep. I think they've adjusted quite well to life in the big city. **I think I was profiled the other day. These other ghosts think they're hot stuff because they're less transparent. I didn't choose my opacity setting, assholes. I've got a bullet wound to hide. **Today I became a hitman. It's quite lucrative, though there's a lot of travel involved. Some wise-ass lifer with a Ouija board is making a killing assassinating people with our help. The victims are usually quite cheery when they first see me afterward. I always bring a gift basket. ** I've been secretly following my wife around. I suspect she's been having an affair: somebody told me they saw her in Dubai last month when she said she was in Fargo on business. I finally found the other woman today. Oh my God. Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy.

The scene: An indistinguishable room in Kirkland in dim light. The camera pans to reveal a floor and tables littered with PBR cans, empty boxes of wine, and sleeping writers who simply cannot hang. The camera finds Alan R. Xie ’16, who sits staring dejectedly out of the window, wearing a bro tank.
ALAN: I've been drinking, I've been drinking.
POV shot of Alan’s phone screen. He is on Tinder and swipes right on every photo. A single teardrop falls onto the screen.
ALAN: I get filthy when that liquor get into me.
Cut to Natalie T. Chang ’15, who is seated on the Throne. She is holding a cigarette that appears to have gone out some time ago in one hand. She is staring at her other hand, which holds a can of PBR. She looks up at the camera.
NATALIE: I've been thinking, I've been thinking.
She looks back down at the can and squeezes it, crushing it.
NATALIE: Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na na.
She raises the crushed can into the air. But then lowers her hand, defeated, and begins to gulp the PBR. This is the closest she’ll ever come to kicking any of her habits.
Cut to Jude D. Russo ’16. He is lying on his side atop a table, holding a copy of “Paradise Lost,” and looking down with scorn like a god at the cooler full of ice and beer below him.
JUDE: PBR on ice, PBR on ice. I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,                                 Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down, The dark descent, and up to reascend.
The camera pans to David J. Kurlander ’17, who is sprawled on the floor. He opens a Snapchat from Adela and begins to take one in return, only to realize that someone has drawn a penis and the words “pastiche this” on his forehead in black Sharpie.
DAVID: We woke up in the Sanctum saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Cut to Abby L. Noyes ’16. She is holding a baby but does not seem to know where it came from. It does bear a striking resemblance to—
ABBY: Oh, baby?
She shrugs and opens the nozzle on a bottle of boxed wine, guzzling it between her words.
ABBY: Drunk in—hiccup—we be all night.
Cut to Tree A. Palmedo ’16 and Will Holub-Moorman ’16. They are sitting alone in a corner, going through photos on Will’s phone and speaking in hushed nervous tones, trying to put the events of the night together.
TREE: Last thing I remember is—
WILL: Our beautiful bodies... grinding up in the club?
They quickly look over their shoulders to make sure they have not been overheard but only see Neha Mehrotra ’15, asleep next to someone with a sticker reading “Hello. My name is Chris.”
Pan to Brian B. Kim ’15, Grace E. Huckins ’16, Emma R. Adler ’16, and Erica X Eisen ’16 who are coming to the party after a long night of production. They take in the scene and shake their heads in disdain.
BRIAN, GRACE, EMMA, and ERICA: Arts boart.
Fade to black.

I’m a simple girl with simple tastes. There are two things I love in this world: men named Chris and superhero films. Join me as I rank and objectify the various Chrises who have graced the silver screen as superheroes with their wonderfully inappropriate spandex, beautifully coiffed hair, and muscles that make bodybuilders weep in joy. I’ll try to factor in the quality of performance. No promises, though.
6) Chris Evans (Johnny Storm aka Human Torch): Before he was Captain America, he was the annoying hot guy/playboy who could light himself on fire. Yawn. It was a bad role in a bad movie (can Marvel please get the rights for “Fantastic Four” back?), saved only by the eighth wonder of the world that is Chris Evans half-naked.
5) Chris(tian) Bale (Bruce Wayne aka Batman): Yes, arguably, Bale is the best actor of the lot. He helped elevate the Batman movies from simple comic book fodder to genuinely amazing films and resurrected the franchise from its sad death by plastic nipple suits in the 1997 film “Batman & Robin.”  I don’t know, though. I’m not convinced. Guttural sounds and brooding sad-faces just don’t do it for me. Sometimes, however, when Bale incoherently growls, “I’m Batman,” I feel like being a bad girl for a bad boy.
4) Chris Hemsworth (Thor): Don’t get me wrong. I would allow Hemsworth to play his didgeridoo for me anytime, anywhere. I just can’t get over the putrid mess that was “Thor 2: The Dark World” (what was the villain's motive again? Something about light and dark and destroying the universe. I can’t remember clearly since my eyes glazed over from boredom.). Regardless, People’s Sexiest Man Alive is still a tall drink of water, so he places firmly in the middle of the pack.
3) Chris(topher) Reeve (Clark Kent aka Superman): You have to appreciate your classics, friends. The original tall, dark, and handsome, Reeve propelled Superman to super stardom while looking good doing it. Like a glass of red wine, Reeve’s performance (and sexiness) becomes even greater with time. Henry Cavill who?
2) Chris Pratt (Peter Quill aka Star-Lord): How can you not love Pratt when he’s J-Lawing it up on the media circuit? Pratt—injecting a dose of quirkiness and Indiana-Jones-lite hotness into Peter Quill—and his 50-pack have become a bona-fide action stars. Let’s be real. The best scene of “Guardians of the Galaxy” is when Pratt get hosed down. Those still thirsty for Pratt can watch him ride with raptors (literally—watch the trailer) next summer in “Jurassic World,” where he will continue to destroy the ovaries of women everywhere.
1) Chris Evans (Steve Rogers aka Captain America): Oh Captain, my Captain. Evans has come a long way (like 20 pounds of muscle away) from his “Fantastic Four” days. I could talk about how “Winter Soldier” was the best standalone Marvel film since “Iron Man,” thanks in part to Evans’s phenomenal performance as Steve Rogers, but I’ll just say this: God bless America, and God bless the cinematographer that appreciates Chris Evans’s ass(ets) as much as I do.

“Pop is insipid,” they said. “The Top 40 has no soul,” they said. “These lyrics don’t even mean anything,” they said.
Well, they were wrong. Think Selena Gomez doesn’t understand the depth of conflict in the Middle East? Think again, for the artists of today’s Top 40 hits are victims of cruel, cruel mischaracterization. Their songs, while perhaps veiled in the language of poor relationship choices, are in truth brilliantly perceptive, cutting analyses of the state of the world today. Don’t believe it? Here are the top current events of 2014 paired with the best Top 40 hits written about them.
Big Sean’s satirical ode to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s not-so-secret fomenting of discord in the eastern regions of Ukraine is currently sitting at #26 on the charts. The chorus of “I don’t fuck with you / Little stupid ass bitch / I ain’t fucking with you” is an unusually insightful take on the condescension and outright denial Putin has expressed to the Western world in the wake of his seizure of Crimea.
Back in March when the first Ebola cases were spreading, the disease was on the front pages of almost every major newspaper. But the news “can’t stop, won’t stop moving,” as Ms. Swift poignantly observes. “Shake It Off” details how Western media have been “getting down and out about the liars / And the dirty dirty cheats of the world” (shoutout to you, el-Sisi!) at the cost of “getting down to this sick beat.” We all owe Ms. Swift a debt for drawing attention to this shameful lapse.
Democracy spoke this year! And we, like Hozier, are infinitely grateful for the opportunity to see the great American values of liberty, free speech, and petty deceptiveness in action once more. “I was born sick / But I love it” Hozier repeats in a particularly mantric moment, clearly trying to make the best of the fact that he will soon have no health insurance due to his preexisting medical conditions. Take us to church, Republicans.
“The Heart Wants What It Wants” is an astute summation of the Middle East’s troubled political history and current state of upheaval. “You got me scattered in pieces,” sings Ms. Gomez, subtly referring to the dissolution of federal structures within Iraq and Syria and the ongoing devastation wrought by intranational conflict. The chorus runs, “There’s a million reasons I should give you up / But the heart wants what it wants,” providing possibly the most accurate depiction of intractable ethnic and religious violence ever found in an American news source. Hats off to you, Ms. Gomez.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After another Undergraduate Council election in which over 50 percent of students failed to cast their votes, the UC took a moment last week to reflect on how it might increase interest in the Council and its activities. With the UC’s limited powers, however, the Council will find itself hard-pressed to overcome inevitable student apathy with the new initiatives that received attention during last month’s election. Instead, the UC should focus on the issues it can influence directly, particularly student group funding. Ultimately, any more substantive student input will depend on the University offering more avenues through which students can influence University policy.
The UC’s most successful proposals are rarely those advocated most noticeably during presidential campaigns. This year, for instance, the winning ticket promised an end to midterms on housing day and proposed soliciting donations from alumni to increase UC funding, while the second place ticket made building a student multicultural space a key part of their platform. While ambition is laudable, none of these goals is particularly likely and may even distract from the UC’s core responsibilities.
Chief among these responsibilities is funding for student groups, one of the few areas in which the UC has some sway. As UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 have shown this year, concerted effort towards increasing student group funding can yield results. Though the 250k Campaign did not reach its goal, the College looks likely to free up $36,000 in the UC budget, an achievement that, as Goffard put it, will lead to “more money for students and student groups.” Given that the UC has little official ability to influence academic policy or building priorities, such funding victories are the best way for the body to play a positive role on campus.
A long-term strategy for increasing student engagement in issues of University policy, however, must move beyond a focus on finances. Without more influence on administrative decisions that affect student life, the UC will continue to have a hard time making a case for its relevance, and students will be largely right in viewing the UC as a body with limited potential. But as the recent furor over the closing of Stillman Infirmary demonstrated, the University would often benefit from more consultation with students. More substantive interaction between the University and the UC would attune policy changes more closely with student views, and give students a reason to take an interest in the UC.
Given its constraints, the UC should focus on issues of funding where it has a mandate to advocate on behalf of students, and where its voice can influence policy. The University, however, would do well to include the UC in policy discussions, and give the Council a more appreciable say in policy decisions.  More student voice will ultimately lead to both more student engagement and better initiatives.

Black rage is founded on dreaming and draining Threatening your freedom To stop your complainingPoisoning your water While they say it's raining Then call you mad For complaining, complaining
—Ms. Lauryn Hill, Black Rage
“We need to have a national conversation about race.” I’ve read it in op-eds all over the Internet and in print, I’ve heard it from every pundit on MSNBC, and I’ve definitely said it more than a few times myself. But what does this “national conversation” look like? Does it begin with the words of our melanin-deficient Congress? Does it start with President Obama telling blacks to stop looting in Ferguson? Either situation would be problematic.
Logistically, where does it happen? Do we build a table of unprecedented size and unfold it across the middle of our country and add a seat, nametag, and complimentary snackie for every citizen?  Or, more realistically, does it take place in our school curriculums, through a better discussion of Black History, slavery’s legacy, and white privilege? I see neither situation.
I’m not sure how many black bodies it will take for our government to seriously address racial inequities in America. But, while we wait for an officially sanctioned conversation (whatever that even means), there is already a national conversation about race rattling the edges of my Google Chrome browser, giving life to my Twitter and tumbling down my Facebook News Feed.
I see my friends writing eloquent Facebook statuses and deftly handling the comments and posts of those who just don’t get it yet. And then there’s Black Twitter, the incredible place where biting wit and humor fuse with a poetic and emotional discussion about what it means to be black in America. Black Twitter is a place for solidarity, which is easily expressed through hashtags that instantly link one’s tweets to a whole community. It is also a place for comic relief—Black Twitter responded with equal parts humor and disgust to the ridiculousness of Don Lemon’s gas mask-wearing, marijuana-sniffing CNN reporting. And this collection of 140-character musings is so much more than older generations might initially consider it to be. These posts and tweets and hashtags, in their own quirky way, carry on the legacy of profound pieces of culture: the haunting beauty of slave songs, the gorgeous resistance of both jazz and hip-hop, the spirituality of gospel music, and the realness of spoken word. There is an amazing poignancy to hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter because they show once again that, even as America has told blacks that they are somehow less than human, black people have steadily and consistently flaunted the strength and depth of their connection to the human spirit.
I also see a network of white allyship forming in the Internet. Because, even though it is pretty crazy that this is the first time some of my white friends are getting angry enough about race to take it to their Facebook walls, it is most certainly better late then never.
Large quantities of content also end up carrying large quantities of ugliness. A long time ago, my brother told me that if I ever needed a reminder that racism is alive and well in America, I should just look at the comments on any ESPN article. The Internet also carries and broadcasts voices of resistance to change. In the comments sections of op-eds, I see the same combination of white economic insecurity and racism that has occurred throughout this country’s history. I see apathy, disrespect, and flat-out cruelty.
The worry with protest through social media is that people end up using their tweets and posts as a substitute for other forms of activism instead of a supplement to more substantive efforts. This concern is legitimate, but I fear that it distracts us from the positive value of the unprecedented discussions that are happening on Twitter and Facebook. They may feed our preference of sound bytes over larger and more complete sets of information and make face-to-face conversation easier to avoid, but they are also facilitating engagement with the issue of race on an impressive scale.
Baratunde Thurston wrote on his Facebook wall:
"It is the season for gifts and gratitude and so I am grateful for this Public Display of Apathy and Indifference by The State because it triggers the auto-immune response of The People who react with equal parts rage and love. The Systemic Indifference is a feature, not a bug. But here's the thing about systems: they are designed and can be undone, rebooted, re-wired…let us be filled with Rage and Love. For they are both equal and essential antidotes to that which ails us and fails us."
Our response to the Grand Jury’s non-indictment of Darren Wilson has been divided between on-the-ground space and cyberspace. People are both taking to the streets and taking to their Twitter accounts, and sometimes it’s hard to know whether these acts are completely futile or deeply influential. But I’m leaning towards the latter, because they are the expression of national Rage and Love that Baratunde was talking about. And because I know that Michael and Tamir and Trayvon and countless others are dead, and doing nothing is most certainly not an option.

In 1930, in a little essay titled “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” John Maynard Keynes predicted that the “economic problem” could be solved within 100 years. Given steady growth, the standard of living in the developed world would be “between four and eight times” higher than in 1930. With this new wealth, human beings would be free from the Malthusian struggle for survival for the first time in the history. People could afford to work only three hours a day. The love of money would become passé. Homo economicus could be packed away and economics could become a harmless profession like dentistry.
For a piece written as the Great Depression was beginning, Keynes’s optimistic vision of economic growth was remarkably accurate. Real incomes in the United States are now more than eight times what it was in 1930. But Keynes’s intriguing predictions about how we would occupy ourselves once we became rich fell wide of the mark. Only eight percent of full-time US workers work fewer than 40 hours a week and last I checked, the pursuit of money was still in vogue.
Like many good ideas, Keynes’s utopian view was wrong but perceptive. It gets at a question that economists too often ignore: What is the end of all this economic striving?
Keynes thought that the ultimate goal of most economic institutions was their own irrelevance. Greed and avarice were only necessary evils that humanity would outgrow once the economic problem was solved. In the future of plenty, people would “value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful.” The love of money would be acknowledged as a “disgusting morbidity.” Instead of engineering credit default swaps and selling ShamWows, people could be free to pursue the arts and sciences at their own leisure.
If this all sounds a little utopian for the economist who made his name during the Great Depression, it probably is. Today, for the billion in the Third World who still live in abject poverty, the solution to the economic problem remains out of reach. Even in developed countries, it is hard to see an end to the economic rat race: As the hysteria of Black Friday can attest, even in a land of plenty people feel the need to fight over flat screen TVs. The economic problem may simply be an inextinguishable feature of human nature. As a descriptive theory, Keynes’s thesis is a failure.
But I am partial to the normative side of Keynes’s vision. The end goal of the economic project should not be the endless accumulation of wealth, but the furthering of human freedom. Determining the ideal post-scarcity existence is above my pay grade (and the pay grade of any economist), but my field has taught me to be suspicious of any command-and-control dictum directing people’s lives. Once the economic problem is solved, people should have the liberty to experiment with how to live—in Keynes’s words, to “cultivate…the art of life”.
I began this column this semester on a note of humility. Economics is a young field, and after over two hundred years of formal research there is still much we cannot explain. But good economic ideas—including Keynes’s—have done much to advance a solution to the economic problem. In the past (and, for the most part, in the present), contemplating how best to live was a privilege reserved for the rich. Aristotle thought that eudaemonia—human flourishing—was only possible if one had the material resources to support it. Extending that opportunity to all seems like a noble project.
Solving the economic problem is comparatively easy. Figuring out how we should live will be hard.

UPDATED: December 2, 2014, at 6:10 p.m.
Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 will be the interim Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences beginning on January 1, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced on Tuesday.
Lewis will step in as the school’s head for Cherry A. Murray, who announced her resignation in late October, until Smith names a permanent replacement for the post.
On Tuesday, Lewis said he was honored, surprised, and pleased by Smith’s pick.
“It’s not anything that I was running for or anything like that. I am quite happy doing my teaching and writing and speaking and so on, but I was honored to think that Harvard would put confidence in me,” he said.
Lewis previously served as Dean of the College from 1995 to 2003 and has participated in several FAS committees including the Educational Policy Committee, the Committee on Undergraduate Education, the Committee on Graduate Education, and the Committee on College Life.
When asked if his experience as Dean of the College would help him in his new post, Lewis said, “There must be some people who thought it was not disqualifying, so I’ll just leave it at that.”
Lewis has, at times, been a vocal critic of University policies since leaving University Hall a decade ago, maintaining a blog addressing campus issues and frequently entering the fray of Faculty politics.
Environmental Science and Engineering Area Dean Steven C. Wofsy, who sits on Smith’s search advisory committee, said that Lewis’s experience as an administrator would serve him well in the position.
“The governance of Harvard is very complex, and in order to be effective you need to know how things work,” Wofsy said. “Harry knows how things work.”
Smith appointed Lewis after consulting with area deans within SEAS, gathering their suggestions for Murray’s interim replacement, Wofsy said.
Murray wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson Tuesday afternoon that she is pleased about Lewis’s appointment as interim dean.
“Prof. Lewis will bring keen insight, a valuable historical perspective, and strong focus to this role,” Murray wrote. “He is an extraordinary ambassador for SEAS and an experienced and effective fundraiser.”
Smith’s announcement comes amid the School’s $450 million capital campaign and several other major initiatives, including a planned move across the river into Allston, a dramatic increase in faculty, and the expansion of the popular introductory class Computer Science 50 to Yale.
While Lewis said it was too early to speculate on what his main initiatives might be, he noted some challenges he expects to face.
“We have big dreams for development in Allston, and it requires a lot of teamwork, developing a shared vision of what’s going to happen over there, and some very specific planning that is going on,” Lewis said. “There are significant challenges in finding the resources to make it all possible.”
According to Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur, Lewis’s interim deanship represents “a phenomenal opportunity to continue to move the school into the exciting direction it’s going.”
“He is somebody who has I think devoted his life to Harvard,” Mazur said. “He cares deeply about the institution.”
Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal echoed Mazur’s statements, praising Lewis due to his past experience as dean of the College and his knowledge of SEAS.
“For him to be acting dean during the time that it takes to find a long-term dean is a fantastic choice,” Habbal said. “Harry knows the place.”
Habbal said that he anticipated that a large part of Lewis’ time as Dean would be spent focused on Allston due to the planned relocation of a large portion of the School there in 2019.
Smith will continue the search for a permanent SEAS dean along with a search advisory committee composed of 15 faculty members from the school.

Harvard Square restaurant and deluxe dessert shop Finale suddenly shuttered its location in the Smith Campus Center on Saturday, posting a note on its doors thanking customers for their patronage throughout “12 great years here.”
Finale’s CEO did not return requests for comment by press time on Tuesday night. Karla Mehilli, the general manager at Finale’s Park Plaza location in Boston, said that she believed the closing of the Harvard Square location was due to planned construction for the Smith Center, but would not elaborate.
The establishment, located at 30 Dunster St., was a popular dessert choice for students and student groups. In addition to the Boston Park Plaza location, Finale also operates a pastry kitchen near Harvard Business School, according to its website.
Mehilli said that she has not heard of any plans to open another Finale restaurant as a replacement.
Though administrators announced planned renovations for the Smith Center over a year ago, details have yet to be revealed about how local businesses housed in the building will be affected.
For Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the store’s departure was foreshadowed by their decision not to renew membership in HSBA this past year.
“They didn’t renew membership which we thought was strange, they were very active,” Jillson said. “They had an amazing business. Several years ago you couldn’t get in, it was impossible to find a seat. It’s kind of sad that they’re not here anymore.”

For Michael C. George ’14-’15 and Anna A. Hagen ’15, two of this year’s Harvard recipients of Marshall Scholarships, the chance for post-graduate studies in the United Kingdom is both surprising and humbling.
George, a Quincy House government concentrator and an inactive Crimson News Editor, plans to pursue graduate studies in comparative social policy at the University of Oxford and the economic history of development at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Hagen, a Lowell House English concentrator, intends to study contemporary English literature at the University of Cambridge and will likely study directing at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.
Created after World War II by the British Parliament, the Marshall Scholarship is awarded to around 40 American students each year to fund post-graduate study in the United Kingdom.
George, who was born in Honolulu and raised in the Philippines before moving to Malaysia to attend high school, said his work with several professors and mentors and various extracurricular experiences helped him discover a passion for development policy. During his time at Harvard, he took a semester off to work at the National Economic Council at the White House.
“I’m very interested in social mobility and inequality in the United States,” George said. “Trying to figure out what innovative policy can do to try to fix this eternal problem [of poverty in the United States] is fascinating to me.”
For Brooklyn native Hagen, life at Harvard has centered around delving into the English language. On campus, Hagen directs plays and has pursued a love for storytelling through her senior thesis, which will be a collection of short stories.
“The whole time I’ve been here, it’s all been about doing what I love to do,” Hagen said.
To Hagen, who hopes to eventually direct theater and write fiction, the Marshall Scholarship is an opportunity to continue that work.
“This scholarship gives me a chance to keep on thinking in a rigorous way for the next couple years, and also to have the space and the time to keep exploring fiction,” she said.
Hagen is quick to point out the impact that Harvard has had on her success.
“I’m so indebted to the English department faculty and to my friends here. There are some people who have really changed my life by showing me these beautiful pieces of literature that have changed me forever,” she said.
Reflecting on his selection for the scholarship, George is still in awe.
“When you think about the fact that you’re selected as a group of 31 out of 1,000 applicants, you feel really blessed and honestly overwhelmed,” he said.
“I feel so lucky,” echoed Hagen.

University Professor Paul E. Farmer named infrastructural failures, rather than the disease itself, as the main obstacles to addressing West Africa’s Ebola epidemic during an event at the Harvard Medical School Tuesday afternoon.
Farmer is the founder of the multinational nonprofit Partners In Health, which is associated with a club at Harvard College, and recently returned from Ebola-stricken Liberia. On Tuesday, he described what he feels is the optimal technique for approaching the current outbreak: healthcare providers must implement the “4 S’s,” staff, stuff, space, and supplies. The region’s weak healthcare systems, he said, are a major hurdle to that implementation.
Lipi Roy, a staff physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who attended the event, agreed, saying that Farmer accurately illustrated the big picture of Ebola.
“He is absolutely correct: the 4 S’s are vital,” Roy said.
According to Farmer, a big problem associated with Ebola is that caregivers to the sick are at great risk of contracting the illness themselves. However, Farmer said that aggressive and careful treatments can be an effective cure.
“There’s not a lot of evidence...that would suggest that this illness cannot be treated in a great majority of cases,” he said. “When Ebola has collided with Western medicine, which has not occurred in West Africa, most patients survive.”
Specifically, Farmer advocated for hiring more volunteers to aid the effort, especially intravenous therapy nurses.
“We need vital signs, we need electrolytes, we need the basics you would find in an emergency room,” he said.
Edward A. Nardell, an associate physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a lung specialist with PIH, said Farmer’s talk changed his perspective on the outbreak.
“What I learned was that people are dying not because of irreversible pathology but rather lack of care,” Nardell said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, the 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history. The infection causes diarrhea and internal bleeding and has a mortality rate estimated in September by the World Health Organization at 70 percent.
Farmer said PIH has been a significant force in the Ebola outbreak, particularly in southeast Liberia and Sierra Leone. By teaming up with nonprofit distributors, PIH has provided medical supplies to the areas strongly affected by the disease, he said.
Meissa Jones, a senior clinical research coordinator for the Crimson Care Collaborative who attended the talk, said that PIH’s efforts represent a “greatly important initiative.”

Hundreds of Harvard affiliates and local residents gathered Tuesday in Memorial Church to hear United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Humanitarian of the Year, call on Harvard faculty members and students to help solve several global issues.
“This is a great day for Harvard,” said Harvard Foundation director S. Allen Counter, who presented Ban with the award. “The United Nations can be seen as a ship of hope.”
Counter recognized Ban as the captain of this ship—a pioneer on issues of conflict resolution in areas such as nuclear non-proliferation, human trafficking, and sustainable energy reform.
Ban began his remarks by joking that he was not the most famous Korean to visit the University after learning that pop star Psy had delivered a speech there last year, adding that he would keep his speech short because he remembered the stress of December exams.
Quickly, however, Ban took on a more serious tone. Ban argued that the world has made progress on several pressing issues, but he called for increased cooperation between nations to address them further. He repeatedly called on Harvard students and faculty to actively engage in conversations about those issues through means such as research.
“You are not the only ones being tested in this world,” he said.
Specifically, Ban encouraged Harvard students and faculty to use their research skills and the institution’s prestigious reputation to put the issue of climate change and nuclear development at the forefront of academic debate.
“We are the last generation that can stop global warming before it’s too late,” he warned, praising President Barack Obama’s recent deal with Chinese leaders on the issue, but also urging faster action.
On the issue of nuclear disarmament, Ban said, “The world remains over-armed, and peace remains underfunded.”
Addressing other global issues, Ban argued that millions of people still live in “deprivation” today, while human trafficking, violence against women, and discrimination remain pervasive. He criticized, for example, international leaders’ reactions to the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s; world leaders said that such a tragedy would happen “never again,” he argued, but have since gone on to ignore other atrocities today.
“There are still huge gaps between people in peril and actions taken to protect them,” he said.
Ban addressed other topics as well, including the recent Ebola outbreak. He again urged Harvard faculty and students to continue their research efforts, this time to understand and study the virus. He also said that international cooperation is essential to end its transmission.
Ban’s remarks, which were received with a standing ovation, ended with yet another call on Harvard to help address the global issues he had discussed.

Former Harvard professor Ashton B. Carter will be tapped by President Barack Obama to be the next Secretary of Defense, the Associated Press and The New York Times reported Tuesday.
Carter, a physicist and a former professor of science and international affairs, once oversaw the Pentagon’s budget and the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia” initiative and is a veteran public servant. Carter served in top posts under Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel from 2009-2013.
Hagel, a Republican who has led the Department of Defense since early 2013, announced his resignation in late November.
Carter, who is a Democrat, is expected to be officially nominated by the president in the next few days, according to media reports. Once nominated, Carter will then need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Colleagues from the Kennedy School of Government and Department of Defense said Carter was an excellent candidate to lead the U.S. military because of his administrative skills and deep understanding of policy.
“He’s the perfect choice for the president to make,” said John M. Deutch, a friend of Carter’s and a former deputy secretary of defense.
Deutch said that in addition to facing conflicts in the Middle East and tension with Russia, Carter will also have to negotiate a smaller defense budget and more prevalent cyber security threats.
Joseph S. Nye Jr., who worked with Carter both at the Department of Defense and as dean of the Kennedy School, also praised Carter’s experience in policy.
“Ash has a great ability to combine technical issues; he is trained as a physicist [along with experience in] policy analysis,” Nye said. “He knows his way around the department and knows his way around Washington.”
Carter has remained involved with the Kennedy School since he left for Washington D.C. and has served on the board of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, from which he is currently on leave.
Gary S. Samore, the Belfer Center’s executive director, said that Carter’s expertise as a “master of the budget” will aid him in case Congress reduces the defense budget.
“Ash is a very smart choice in terms of being experienced,” Samore said. “When I see him with the president I think they have a good relationship.”
Though Carter’s nomination was only reported on Tuesday, Carter’s colleagues said they were not surprised in the president’s choice. Samore said that he had immediately thought of Carter after current secretary Hagel announced his resignation.
“As soon as I heard that Hagel was leaving, my first thought was that Ash would be a logical replacement because he’s known to the president and his team,” Samore said. “He’s a very safe pair of hands, and I think that’s what Obama needs now.”
Deutch predicted that Carter’s Senate confirmation “will go very smoothly because he’s a known quantity for the committee.”
However, not everyone predicted a straightforward confirmation process. Samore said he thought that there was potential for the confirmation hearings to be used to “air other issues” regarding the administration’s current campaign against Islamic extremism.
Former HKS lecturer and Obama administration colleague Juliette N. Kayyem said that Carter’s potential appointment would come with added responsibility to bring stability to the defense bureaucracy, given that Carter would be Obama’s fourth defense secretary.
“There’s issues about wars, there’s issues about integrating women, but I think the most important thing is stabilizing the ship,” Kayyem said, adding that Carter is able to avoid getting bogged down in day-to-day decisions.
“Ash uniquely has the ability to look past the tyranny of the inbox...and think about the department and position it for the next 20 to 30 years,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences heard recommendations for FAS’s revised sexual harassment policy and procedures as well as a proposal for a new Ph.D. program in “Population Health Sciences” at the body’s final meeting of the semester on Tuesday.
History professor Alison F. Johnson, who chaired the committee that produced the proposed changes to the interim measures, called attention in particular to a change from the current policy that, if the recommendations are approved, would put faculty and staff cases of sexual misconduct under the jurisdiction of the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the same new body that oversees investigations of student misconduct cases.
In the earlier version of the policy, the Office for Faculty Affairs, an internal FAS body, conducted the investigations.
After Tuesday’s meeting, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith called the change “great,” saying, “it’s perfect that we have one mechanism to gather facts.”
Earlier this fall, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides and Smith both said that faculty and staff procedures had not been moved under ODR because the office had to prioritize student cases.
In addition to the transfer of investigatory authority to the ODR, Johnson called a number of her committee’s other changes “striking,” including the absolute prohibition of relationships between faculty members and undergraduates. Cases of quid pro quo sexual assault—when sexual acts are requested in exchange for some benefit—within extracurricular student organizations would be subject to the FAS policy, as would cases of sexual assault against individuals outside of the Harvard community.
Johnson said her committee spent about 40 hours throughout the semester collecting community feedback before making its changes. There was no discussion of the policy following Johnson’s presentation. She said that she has yet to send final recommendations to Smith.
Tuesday’s meeting also featured a presentation on a potential new Ph.D. program in population health sciences, a vote on which is expected at the next Faculty meeting, scheduled for February.
The new degree would unite five doctorate of science programs within the School of Public Health in the departments of Environmental Health, Epidemiology, Global Health and Population, Nutrition, and Social and Behavioral Sciences into a single, Ph.D.-awarding program.
Several professors spoke at Tuesday’s meeting, stressing the value of the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed degree.
The Faculty also unanimously approved a change to legislation regarding student expulsions, establishing a requirement of a two-thirds vote of the members of the Faculty Council who are present at a given meeting as the threshold for dismissal or expulsion. The line “who are present” was absent from the previous language.
Smith also told Faculty that he had convened a “leadership group” to oversee the “detailed design” planning of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences building in Allston, moving forward from the conceptual stage. SEAS professors Robert D. Howe and David C. Parkes will spearhead the planning.
The meeting also included Faculty approval of preliminary courses for the 2015 Harvard Summer School.

The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Kennedy School of Government was filled with laughter Tuesday evening when actor and comedian Seth Rogen and The Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead sat down for a talk about politics and humor. The event was the final Institute of Politics forum of the semester.
Rogen is in Boston to promote his upcoming movie, “The Interview,” in which he plays the producer of a celebrity talk show who, along with the show’s host, played by James Franco, is contracted by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Rogen addressed recent threats made by the North Korean government alleging “decisive and merciless countermeasure” if the movie is released.
“When [North Korea] ultimately came out with this rhetoric, it wasn’t ultimately that surprising,” Rogen said.
“I don’t think the movie is being released in North Korea. I expect low box office revenue there,” he added.
The conversation was moderated by Alexis C. Wilkinson ’15, the president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Wilkinson began the conversation on a more serious note, asking Rogen about his role as an activist for Alzheimer’s disease awareness.
Rogen, whose mother-in-law was diagnosed with the disease, said he capitalized on his celebrity status to spread his messages.
“What was very startling was how quickly I was going to become the most well-known advocate for the disease because there was no competition, it was really mine to take,” Rogen said.
The two comedians also addressed their ideologies of pushing boundaries with humor and satire and defending their own opinions.
“I personally don’t feel like that there’s some political correct squad that’s trying to prevent me from doing my job in the best way I can,” Rogen said. “If anything, I’m shocked by what I can get away with.”
Before opening up the floor to the audience for questions, Wilkinson asked a series of rapid fire questions to Rogen and Winstead about a variety of topics, including which state would grow the best marijuana if it was legal in all 50 states.
Many of Winstead’s responses to audience questions focused on her views on feminism and advocacy for women's reproductive rights.
“When someone says to me, ‘How dare you laugh at killing babies?’ I say, ‘I don’t buy your premise, medical science does not say that is what this is,’” Winstead said.
Winstead ended by explaining how she incorporates humor when discussing feminist topics with those of dissenting opinions.
“They don’t know what to do with me because I don’t back down, I’m relentless,” Winstead said. “They’ll say why can’t women shut their legs and I’ll say, ‘Why should they?”’

The Harvard Business Review published the results of a survey-based study this month indicating that limited correlation exists between the career expectations of Harvard Business School graduates and the gender gap in senior management positions. The study concluded that corporate structures, rather than mothers’ choices, leave women with limited options to balance home and work lives.
The study was conducted by HBS Professor Robin J. Ely, Pamela Stone of Hunter College, and HBS Gender Initiative Assistant Director Colleen C. Ammerman. The researchers found that, of the 25,000 surveyed HBS alumni, men and women had similar career ambitions when joining the workforce. Male respondents, however, were more likely to feel as though their goals were met than their female counterparts, the study found.
“We wanted to understand how our women graduates are faring, especially in light of other research showing that women are under-represented in leadership positions,” Ely wrote in an email. “We were especially interested in how alumni navigate the complexities of work and the rest of life.”
Contrary to what the study called “conventional wisdom,” most of the surveyed women’s careers were not sidetracked because they prioritized family over advancing in the workplace, the study found. Instead, women who left their jobs after having children did so because “they [found] themselves in unfulfilling roles with dim prospects for advancement” or otherwise limited in their career options.
“Both men and women need to participate equally at home,” said Kathleen L. McGinn, an HBS professor who focuses on the role of gender in the workplace and in negotiations. “Women and men want the same thing…[but] organizations are set up for high-level positions [occupied by] people who have a whole family support structure, which is more likely to be men than women.”
McGinn added that this study was particularly relevant because it pulled from a large body of evidence and corroborated smaller studies and generally accepted anecdotes.
Ely wrote that the researchers hope their study will inform public understanding and shift focus from women’s individual decisions regarding family to how gender stereotypes reinforce structural hurdles women face in the workplace.
“Our women alums are less satisfied with their careers than men are, but we would say that workplace disappointments and shortcomings are…to blame,” Ely wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s good to be home.
Playing at Bright-Landry Hockey Center for the first time in over a month, the No. 10/10 Harvard women’s ice hockey team returned to its winning ways on home ice Tuesday night. In the team’s first Ivy League matchup of the year, the Crimson cruised to a 4-1 win over conference rival Dartmouth.
Harvard scored three unanswered goals in the second and third periods while Crimson junior forward Miye D’Oench led all scorers with a goal an assist.
After starting off the year with three straight home wins, Harvard (4-2-2, 3-1-1 ECAC) has struggled to find its form early this season, notching only one win in its five-game road stint leading up its matchup against the Big Green. The Crimson found itself sixth in the ECAC heading into Tuesday night’s contest, with the visitors just one point behind in the standings.
Dartmouth (4-4-0, 2-3-0 ECAC) has similarly struggled of late, having registered three straight losses heading into the matchup at Bright-Landry.
“We don’t have the record that we wanted,” D’Oench said after the game. “But the great thing about hockey is that it’s a fresh start every game. There’s always time to turn over a new leaf, and that’s exactly what we did tonight.”
Harvard got off to a quick start, outshooting the Big Green, 9-3, in the first ten minutes of the period.
D’Oench put the Crimson on the board first, finding the back of the net less than eight minutes into the contest. A penalty on Dartmouth senior Samantha Zeiss gave Harvard the man advantage, and the junior capitalized on a rebound off an outside shot from tri-captain defender Michelle Picard to give the Crimson the 1-0 edge.
Despite outshooting the Big Green, 15-8, on the period, Harvard couldn’t keep the lead through the first 20 minutes of play. Dartmouth was quick to bounce back from the early deficit, as freshman Brooke Ahbe scored her first collegiate goal to tie it up at one apiece with 8:30 left in the frame.
Things became heated on the ice as the two Ivy League rivals played for the first time this season. Harvard had two roughing penalties on the night, but the Crimson defense killed both Big Green power play opportunities.
“It’s always a tough battle between Dartmouth and Harvard,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.
“It’s a spirited rivalry, and that’s a good thing, as long as it doesn’t get out of hand. Things got a little carried away early on, but then they settled down. And our kids handled it really well.”
Coming off the first break, Harvard laid down the pressure in the second period, keeping most of the scoring chances in the Big Green’s zone.
“Our kids knew they were playing well,” Stone said of the team’s second frame spark. “That was giving them confidence. All three lines were flying.”
Halfway through the middle frame, the Crimson had a bevy of good looks, rallying off nine straight shots in front of the net before senior forward Hillary Crowe finally split the pipes off a feed from tri-captain forward Samantha Reber, giving Harvard the 2-1 edge.
The Crimson continued to mount the offensive pressure in the third. Freshman Haley Mullins deflected a shot from junior forward Mary Parker into the goal at 4:49 in the period to give Harvard a two-goal cushion. The assist was Parker’s second of the night.
With three minutes left to play, senior defender Sarah Edney added one last goal to seal the Crimson’s victory, beating Dartmouth goaltender Robyn Chemago glove-side from long range.
“This was one of the first times we played a full 60 minutes of Harvard hockey,” D’Oench said. “We were relentless, we pressured them all over the ice and didn’t give them room to breathe.”
Junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer was solid for Harvard between the pipes, with 27 saves on the nice. Chemago put up 38 saves, but the Crimson offense overpowered the Big Green with 42 shots.
After falling to No. 1/1 Boston College in a 10-2 blowout on the road last weekend, Harvard has bounced back with a pair of wins. Stone has seen positives in the team’s response to its early season setbacks.
“We’ve played a tough schedule at the beginning of the year here,” Stone said. “We’ve taken our lumps a little bit, but we’ve learned a lot. We keep building our confidence, and things keep getting better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 1 Crimson men’s squash team (1-0, 1-0 Ivy) opened its official start of the season at the Murr Center on Tuesday with a win against No. 11 Dartmouth. While the overall score of the game showed a decisive Harvard victory, the individual match scores showed how difficult it was for players to best their Big Green opponents.
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 2.
“We didn’t play our best,” captain Tyler Olson said. “I think everyone else sort of had their B-game this time. From a captain’s point of view, it was motivation to prepare and train harder for two really tough matches this weekend.”
After having lost a number of seniors in top positions last year, the Crimson has added three freshmen who are expected to play at the top of the ladder this year. In Tuesday’s game, freshman Madhav Dhingra and classmate Bradley Smith competed at the number one and two spots, respectively, and swept their opponents, 3-0.
“When Madhav put it together, he played very well with only a few mental lapses, and Bradley Smith played a very clinical game that went very smoothly,” Harvard coach
Michael Way said. “These young freshmen have all had a lot of tournament experience in the junior level. They’ve all shown their mettle and their maturity, and they’ve earned those spots in many challenge matches with upperclassmen on the team.”
Junior Sam Goldberg played at the seventh spot on the ladder, besting Dartmouth opponent Brian Giegerich in four games. Olson also notched another victory for Harvard in the sixth seed by beating his opponent in five games.
“In the huddle before the match, we were telling the guys to stick to their game plans and not to take this game too lightly,” Olson said. “We knew we were better than who we were playing, but it was just a matter of not being too confident.”
Sophomores Dylan Murray, Bryan Koh, and junior Matt Roberts won their matches in three games, but Murray and Koh’s first games were decided by tiebreakers.
The two Crimson losses came from the eighth and ninth spots. Dartmouth sophomore Glen Brickman and freshman John Harvey secured Dartmouth’s only matches on the evening. Harvard is currently missing two or three players who would have played Tuesday if not for injuries.
“A number of matches went very long today,” Way said. “Nearly every guy was down either in the whole match or in one game, and that was a big wake-up call. The coaches are very happy that we had this tight match today, and Dartmouth pushed our guys very hard until the end. Today we got a good result when we weren’t playing our best, but tomorrow we’ll wake up and play better to prepare for the next time around.”
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 0
After dropping a 5-4 decision to Princeton last month in the Ivy Scrimmages, the No. 1 Crimson women’s squash team (1-0, 1-0 Ivy) came back strong on Tuesday night, sweeping all Dartmouth opponents in a 9-0 victory at the Murr Center.
“For the women, it was business-like in their approach,” Way said. “They went about their work in a very methodical way. They weren’t overconfident, and they were prepared for their matches. They were disciplined and mentally clear, which showed in the ending score.”
With 3-0 wins in all nine spots, the Crimson handled No. 11 Dartmouth efficiently.
Captain Megan Murray won her match in the seventh spot, 11-2, 11-2, 11-7.
While senior Amanda Sobhy played the number one spot last year, sophomore Katherine Tutrone made quick work Dartmouth’s top seed, Helena Darling, quickly after a close first game. Sobhy did not play.
Freshman Alyssa Mehta and classmate Sue Ann Yong both made official season debuts at the second and fourth seeds, respectively.
Mehta allowed Big Green junior Lydie McKenzie only two points total, with a shutout, 11-0, in the last game.
Yong, meanwhile, surrendered only 11 points  over three games, closing out her match with Big Green senior Oona Morris with a pair of 11-4 wins.
“[The freshman players] both played really well,” Way said. “There wasn’t a bad match from our perspective on the women’s side. They all stayed disciplined and they were prepared.”

As if you weren’t eating enough Felipe’s in the middle of the night.
DoorDash may have the potential to revolutionize your late-night snacking during reading period. Whether you’ve been working in Lamont for the past nine hours or Netflix is asking you if you’re still there, you deserve that burrito.
DoorDash is a service that employs people to deliver food to their clients from restaurants that don’t offer delivery services of their own. Imagine Uber, but instead of someone driving you home, they bring you food from your favorite nearby restaurant. A small selection of restaurants in Cambridge that are partnering with this beautiful venture: 9 Tastes Thai Cuisine, O Sushi, Le's Vietnamese, Pinocchio's Pizza, Felipe's Taqueria, and The Cheesecake Factory.
Between this and the end of “mandatory” section, you’ll probably never need to leave your house or dorm again. At least until reading period ends and you realize you never prepared for that final you promised yourself would save your grade from those not too impressive midterms.
Sections
Reading period is nearly upon us, and with it, the largest span of “unstructured” time since Opening Days and the birth of a new generation of Lamonsters.
But with great power comes great responsibility and we’re here to provide the information you need. If you’re wondering where to go for your daily cup of coffee (or, let’s be honest—your hourly caffeine dose by semester’s end), or if you’re just looking for a good place to make solid progress on papers and final projects, there’s no need to fear—Flyby is here for you, with a rundown of the four main options around the Yard.
(All locations accept BoardPlus or Crimson Cash.)
Lamont Café
Location: Lamont Library (really?)
Hours: Monday-Thursday, 9 a.m. - 2 a.m., Friday, 9 a.m. - 8 p.m., Saturday, 3 p.m. - 8 p.m., Sunday 3 p.m. - 2 a.m.
Ah, Lamont Café. Tried and true, home to many a sleep-deprived student, an abundance of Chobani yogurts, and questionable sushi. Standard Starbucks fare here, so no surprises, and by far the best hours of all your options—in fact, it’s literally your only option of the four on the weekends and late nights (or rather early mornings). Sodas, Red Bull, and the usual vending machine fare can be found here in all its glory.
Great for studying, not so great for just a quick drink (have to pass those bag checks on your way out), a real meal, or for those who are driven nuts by the palpable pressure and anxiety of nearby Lamonsters.
Arts Café at Baker
Location: Barker Center at 12 Quincy Street
Hours: Monday - Thursday, 9 a.m. - 8 p.m.; Friday 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.
Right in between Lamont and the Union dorms, the newly-opened Barker Center Rotunda Café boasts sandwiches, pastries, and salads from Hi-Rise Bakery and coffee from Culture Coffee. You’ll find a great, bohemian ambience with light music, high ceilings, leather couches, and more substantial food than Lamont—the menu includes quiche by the slice, bichermuesli, breakfast sandwiches, and salads. Certainly more pricey than some of the other options though—a single macaroon will run you $2.10, most cookies are $3.15, and salads go up to $10.75. (Note that Flyby reviewed the new establishment back in October, and found the quiche “passing.”)
Good place if you want to do some group work near the Yard, meet with English TFs and friends, or relax. Intensive studying, however, should probably be left to nearby Lamont. For those interested, the café also hosts a number of Art and Humanities-related events in the evenings throughout the semester.
Greenhouse Café
Location: Science Center
Hours: Monday - Thursday 7:30 a.m. - 8 p.m., Friday 7:30 a.m. - 7 p.m. (coffee cart only from 5 - 7 p.m.)
The Greenhouse Café’s Starbucks coffee cart is always busy in the mornings. Later on in the day, of course, Greenhouse offers a wide range of lunch and dinner options, ranging from Indian food and fruit smoothies to burritos and pizza. Fantastic for a quick bite when you’re tired of Annenberg or too lazy to trek over to your House—you can be in and out in less than a minute for most options and the diverse range of food offerings is always reliable.
This place is ideal for hanging out after science and math courses, hosting office hours, working on group projects, or enjoying the sun outside (though certainly not at this time of year). Not really the best place to do intensive academic work, however—best try out nearby Cabot Library, unless you’re enjoy noise, distraction, and the sounds of people rushing to and from LS1a.
Café Gato Rojo
Location: Basement of Lehman Hall, southwest corner of the Yard
Hours: Monday - Thursday 8 a.m. - 10 p.m., Friday, 8 a.m. - 8 p.m.
Perhaps the least known (or rather least visible) of the four options, Café Gato offers a small, comfortable space and great prices—$1 coffee if you bring your own mug, and 50 cent refills. The student-run café (which also features student art on its walls) hosts Jazz Jam sessions every week, and Open Mic Nights every other week.
Fantastic if you want to meet up with somebody, enjoy some croissants, or do some light reading, but might not be optimal for work unless you have noise-canceling headphones or enjoy working to “Just a Friend” (Biz Markie) and “Sunshine” (Atmosphere).

Good morning, Harvard, and happy last-day-of-classes-for-the-entire-semester! It may be hump day, but push through for those last classes left before reading period! On the last day, maybe get to class early, engage in some awkward small talk with that TF you never got to know, and resist that urge to tune out your last lecture. Or just sleep in and try to show up on time-ish—why break habits you’ve cultivated all semester on the last day?
For those drowning under final projects, papers, and exams, remember you’re almost done! Congrats on getting this far—a little over two more weeks (probably spent sleep-deprived in Lamont) until sweet sweet winter break.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today’s high is going to be 59 degrees, with a low of 32. You may not want your warmest winter coat, but definitely break out the rain boots and umbrella! It’ll be raining all morning, but then lighten up by the evening. At least it’ll be dry inside that last section.
