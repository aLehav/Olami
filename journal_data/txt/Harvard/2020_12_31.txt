After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You read the title, you know where this is going, and you know what I am about to say. You may disagree with me. You may want to argue with me. You may even be one of the many Lana Del Ray stans who recently attacked me on Twitter. But deep down, you know that I am right; you just don’t want to admit it.
But before I get ahead of myself, I should tell you who I am. My name is Annie Harrigan, I am the incoming Co-Music Executive of the Crimson Arts, and I have a confession to make: I think that Lady Gaga’s very controversial and widely-disliked 2013 album “Artpop” is not a bad album. In fact, it is one of my favorite albums of all time.
This may be shocking to hear from an incoming Music Executive. You may be thinking: “How can the person in charge of all the music pieces this reputable college newspaper publishes for the next year hold such an opinion?” I’ll tell you how: this opinion is right.
Now before you get your pitchforks ready (or Pitchfork reviews), hear me out. Here are my reasons why “Artpop” is not a bad album.
Reason Number 1: “Artpop” is unlike any album ever. Ever. 
People can compare Gaga to Madonna all they want, and, I’ll admit, I do see the similarities between “Born This Way” and “Express Yourself,” sure. But could Madonna do “Swine?” Could Madonna do “MANiCURE?” No! Gaga could do “Express Yourself” (and kind of has…) but Madonna could never do anything on “Artpop.” “Artpop” is so unique, so distinctively Gaga that, seven years later, it has yet to be emulated. “Artpop” is just so unique that not even Gaga has been able to do “Artpop” again (hey, Gaga, we’re still waiting for “Artpop part 2”)!
Reason Number 2: “Artpop” has no skips songs, not a single one. 
And before you say it, I think “Jewels N’ Drugs” is a good song — a great one, even. Everything from “Aura” through “Applause” is worth listening to. Of course some songs are better than others (with “Sexxx Dreams” easily being the very best song of the album, closely followed by “Venus” and “G.U.Y.”) but each one is baseline good. Songs like “MANiCURE” and “Mary Jane Holland” make you get up and dance. “Donatella” and “Fashion” make you forget you’re a socalist and compel you to live out your secret bourgeoisie fantasy. “Dope” and “Gypsy” make you wish you were in love (face it, you’re reading an article about why “Artpop” is good, I know you’re single). Are those not all good things? Are those not all worthy of your streams? Think about it.
Reason Number 3: “Artpop” epitomizes what Gaga does best. 
Dance pop. Freaky dance pop. Freaky, makes-no-sense-why-this-stuff-works-but-it-does dance pop. Freaky, makes-no-sense-why-this-stuff-works-but-it-does, I-probably-shouldn’t-play-this-album-around-my-mother dance pop. I mean, come on! Have you HEARD “Sexxx Dreams” or “Swine?!?” Freaky. Makes no sense why this stuff works but it does. I shouldn’t play these songs around my mother. Dance pop. And is that not the best type of dance pop? (That was a rhetorical question, because why all know it is.)
Reason Number 4: The Cover Art. 
Dislike the album all you want (you would be aggressively wrong in doing so, but I can’t judge (yes I can)) but you cannot say that this cover art is not dope (pun not intended). Lady Gaga, one of the most controversial living musicians of our time, paired up with Jeff Koons, one of the most controversial living visual artists of our time, to create this visual masterpiece. The cover art features an original Koons statue of a nude Gaga sitting behind a gazing ball — a recurring idol in Koons’s work — with fragments of Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus” and Gian Lorenzo’s “Apollo and Daphne” collaged in the background. This beautiful visual work truly encompasses the lines “Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me” from the album’s closer and lead single, “Applause.” It also shows how Gaga wasn’t joking when she said, in the same song, “One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me.”
Reason Number 5: Just because critics said it was bad, it does not mean it was! 
Wake up sheeple! Why do we base our opinions on what a select few so called “qualified art critics” have to say? Who gave them this authority anyway? We need to stop listening to what the reviewers for big name media companies and news outlets have to say about art and form our own opinions. I’m willing to bet that if you just listened to “Artpop” fully through without having heard anyone else’s opinion on it, you would probably enjoy it! And, yes, I recognize the same thing about art critics could be said for me: Who gave me the authority on what is good? Why should you all listen to me over the other arts critics who said this album was bad? But there’s a huge difference between me and those other arts critics: I’m right.
— Outgoing Theater and Incoming Co-Music Executive Annie Harrigan is the Crimson Arts reigning authority on all things Lady Gaga. If you know where she can find the Chromatica Oreos or have anything else you would like to say, please reach out to annie.harrigan@thecrimson.com — unless you are a Lana Del Ray stan, in that case, feel free to continue attacking her on Twitter.

Olivia G. Oldham ’20, Chair
The worst part of Zoom meetings is the beginning, when whoever’s in charge has to say, “Hey, how’s everyone doing?”, only to face a sea of muted microphones and, if people are feeling generous, a few nods. At Zoom FM writers’ meetings, though, I never had to worry about this. As soon as I asked the question, Olivia was unmuted, smiling, ready with an anecdote from that week’s comp meeting.
This is what Olivia does: They step up to ensure that others feel comfortable to speak, write, laugh. This makes them a good reporter — they make sources feel heard, and they ensure that sources are represented fairly. This makes them a wonderful writer, able to shed new light on big topics — like socioeconomic inequality at Harvard — and smaller topics — like dancing and comics — alike. This has made them a stellar comp director, who has trained our new writers with patience and wit and turned our comp into a multimedia experience. And I know it will make them a brilliant chair.
Olivia: Your warmth and thoughtfulness — your ability to make everyone feel welcome and heard — have translated easily into the virtual world, and I can’t wait to see how they translate into your role as chair. I don’t know what I will do when I have to start Zoom meetings and there is no one who responds to my how-are-you’s. I hope we can meet again in person someday soon, when we can share spiced foods (heavy on the harissa and paprika) and you can tell me all about being chair. Until then, I can’t wait to see the mag thrive under your leadership!

Matteo N. Wong ’20, Chair
When at last the dust settled on “apocalypse week,” when we had vacated campus and settled into new lives at home and under lockdown, Nina and I faced a reality in which FM was — understandably, justifiably — not at the top of anyone’s mind. We’d publish online and limp our way to the end of the semester, we decided; we’d salvage what we could and scrap the rest.
For months, Matteo had been working on an expansive enterprise project on Harvard’s relationship with China, and when we spoke over the phone after we both had returned home, I realized that he had no intention of scrapping it — or just “salvaging” it either. I offered that we could delay publishing the piece to the fall or scale down its scope; I worried about archives now impossible to access and sources probably in the wind already. Matteo didn’t: “Give me two weeks,” he said. “I can finish this.”
Over the next few days, I got to witness Matteo at his finest. He was diligent: He tracked down his sources and identified a mystery figure at the center of the investigation. He was empathetic: When a source feared the implications of speaking on the record, he put himself in their shoes and made sure to insulate them from the story’s fallout. And most of all, he was selfless: Matteo wrote not for glamor or for glory but because he genuinely believed in the public service his work could provide.
And as it turned out, Matteo had a lot to say: After two weeks, he had written nearly 10,000 words about Harvard’s relationship with China. We didn’t have to scrap our efforts or attempt to salvage them, his work proved. FM could thrive in this new, weird, remote setting — and Matteo inspired all of us to stay at our best, even when things seemed at their worst. When the story was published, he set out to do it all over again.
I feel so lucky to be able to watch Matteo at FM’s helm this coming year. He still has so much more to say.

Andrew W.D. Aoyama ’21, Chair
As we were both gearing up for finals season amid a pandemic, I sent Andrew a draft nearly triple the upper word count. I suspect he groaned upon realizing his store of sweet potatoes and peanut butter would not last him through editing that monstrosity — but if that’s really what happened he told me none of it. Instead, he replied with his own essay’s worth of insightful feedback that, miraculously, included a way to give structure to that mess.
Andrew’s tremendous attention to detail and dedication to his craft, writing hard-hitting and award-winning piece after piece, has never ceased to amaze me. He once told me his pitching strategy was to pitch smaller investigations and submit scrut-length epics. He not only took on the world — the college admissions process, the A.D., gentrification, Stouffer’s lasagna — and held his own, but translated that intensity into care and generosity as an editor, comp director, and chair, encouraging every FM writer, too, to never back down. The monthly glossy never came to be, but between steering our coverage and community through a pandemic, providing support and understanding in reporting and personal crises alike, and sharing tea, harissa, raw zucchini sticks, and in-hindsight-ill-advised cinnamon rolls, I feel safe writing on behalf of FM that we forgive you.
Andrew, thank you for the kindness, tenacity, brilliance, and integrity you brought to FM. I think everyone in the room teared up one year ago when, at the last writers’ meeting before you became chair, you shared how you first came to feel at home at FM; I am tearing up again now, imagining the magazine without you.
— MNW
Nina H. Pasquini ’21, Chair
If anything, Nina is multifaceted. She’s fun: Last Valentine’s Day, she sang and danced to Taylor Swift at Adams Carpe. She’s generous: When I ate upwards of seven helpings of the harissa she and AWDA brought back from Tunisia and promptly got embarrassed and apologized, she encouraged me to eat more. She has a broad fanbase: Nina is the only person I know who has received a (mostly) nice comment from a notoriously brutal Crimson commenter, who will remain anonymous. She’s graceful in the face of adversity: When, time and time again, the same piece of intel has come up in her Grand Elections roasts, she’s weathered it with a smile. And, finally, she’s brave: Last year, when I asked her why she decided to lead a cohort of nervy adolescents alone through the woods — i.e., become a FOP leader — she explained that she simply wanted to try something new.
Above all, Nina is notoriously kind. She’s generous with her energy and her care, which is what has made her such a wonderful chair. The harshest thing you’ll ever hear Nina say is a semi-skeptical “Yeah. . .” before offering advice on how to make your idea better, your sourcing stronger, or your word choice more precise. Even on crowded Zoom calls, she has a tendency to quietly laugh at off-kilter remarks, finding pleasure in the chaos of our virtual writers’ meetings. (Thank you, Nina, for not treating my desire to name my daughter Paprika as weird, and instead turn the idea into an icebreaker.) I’m truly so excited to see all the places she goes and all the things she will do — write! do photography! climb mountains! — unburdened by the dread of a bi-annual roast.

Jane Z. Li ’20, Editor-at-Large
Jane is someone you can always trust to pick up on what everyone else has missed. The number of times I have shared a furtive glance with Jane — and have been met with a warm smile — is beyond quantification. Jane even texts warmly. Every message I have ever received from her has felt like she is handing me a cup of hot chocolate and kindly patting me on the back. Underlying Jane’s universal kindness and balancing presence is a deep thoughtfulness, one that infuses all of her meticulous and vivid writing. I have been genuinely floored by all the time and effort Jane puts into every round of front-end editing done with a writer — her comments and pitch angles are always so insightful.
Jane, I will miss sitting next to you on the FM office sofa, gabbing and guffawing into the night. I have no doubt that you and Scott will be a powerful duo that will edit and EAL brilliantly together. I am so, so happy that younger generations of FM will have you as a mentor figure. I look forward to hearing about your EAL escapades. Onward!
— VMK
Scott P. Mahon ’20, Editor-at-Large
Scott and I have a routine. When we see each other on campus, be it in front of the Harvard Art Museums or in the Yard, one of us begins the call. Sometimes I begin. “SHIH!” Then, Scott will add, “KAH!” And finally, I’ll close it out with, “GO!” Together, we have sounded out the name of our hometown, Chicago. I might fist-pump and yelp. Then we both go on our merry ways. Actually, I would argue it is only my hometown, since Scott happens to be from The Suburbs. Still, for the sake of being real, true Midwestern buddies, Scott and I have mutually decided to ignore the salient differences between Chicagoland and Chicago. I can’t tell you how many times this has made my day so much better. Thank you Scott. I have no idea how we came up with this little routine, but thank God we did. Oh, and every time I see a TikTok from you on my For You Page, my day is officially made.
I have no doubt you will make incoming classes of FM writers immediately feel at home with your humor and contagious laugh. I’m so excited to see you and Jane take FM EAL-dom by storm!
— VMK
Vivekae M. Kim ’21, Editor-at-Large 
When I met Vivekae at the Activities Fair my freshman fall, I had already spent an hour ducking between clusters of upperclassmen vying for my attention. Overwhelmed, I stumbled upon The Crimson’s tables, clutching miscellaneous flyers in my hands. Then Vivekae spotted me — she asked for my name, we realized we had a mutual friend, and our conversation flowed easily from there. That was my first, but definitely not my last, experience with Vivekae’s immaculate vibes. She emanated positivity and was effortlessly funny — qualities which likely fuel her budding fame on TikTok — and my grip on the flyers loosened as she described her experience with FM, my anxiety falling away as her enthusiasm escalated.
Before she turned away, probably to greet another bewildered freshman with her sunny smile and impeccable eyeliner, she made one more plug: “You should join FM.”
Vivekae: I’m so grateful that you approached me that day. FM is a huge source of joy for me, and your patient editing and constant encouragement have been integral to that. It’ll be hard to follow in your footsteps. I doubt Scott and I can generate pitch form questions more contentious than “Is making oatmeal in oatmilk cannibalism” — not to mention that you restricted the responses to “numerical” — and creating an emoji more iconic than “%^)” is a monumental task. You’re the spark that brightens our writers’ meetings, and we’re so lucky to have experienced the version of FM that has you in it.
— JZL
The first time I met Vivekae, we bonded over the fact we were both from Chicago — and then she realized I was from “the suburbs.” Even so, our midwest camaraderie lived on. I got a text from VMK soon after we met that read, “we will bring down the coastal elite power structure and liberate the masses.” It’s not just her midwestern roots that makes VMK top-tier: There’s also her elite sense of humor, her ability to make anyone smile, her TikTok constantly hovering on the brink of virality. I have no idea how we will fill your void in writers’ meetings — Jane and I will need to write extra pithy jokes in the chat and I’ll need to overcompensate for Leverett House’s mediocrity even more now.
Vivekae: I know you’ll do amazing things. Co-founder of Stories at the Border, brilliant advocate, dedicated journalist, elite dancer, amazing friend, kind soul, the list goes on. Thank you for everything you’ve done over the past year. FM will truly not be the same without you. (How in the world will Jane and I come up with half as clever pitch form questions as you?!) FM has been lucky to have you for the past year, and we’re all excited to see what you’ll do next.

Dear reader,
At the end of each year, FM typically publishes a feature called “15 Most Interesting Seniors.” It’s always felt silly for the editors of a magazine to be the judges of who is “most interesting,” but it felt especially silly to do this in 2020, when a pandemic has spread us all across the world, far away from our campus and its definition of “interesting.” So this year, we decided to switch things up. We generated 15 seniors at random and profiled them — learning about their circumstances and exploring how the pandemic has impacted their lives.
In the process, we wrote about seniors who are enrolled in classes and taking time off, who spent the semester on campus and abroad, who are interning and caring for their families. We hope that we’ve painted a portrait of the Class of 2021 as it is — scattered, tired, overwhelmed, and a little hopeful, too.
We didn’t intend or expect that this feature would feel celebratory, as has often been the case in the past. In a year so defined by distance, disease, and death, that tone felt, well, at least little inappropriate. But even amid accounts of loss and hardship, our writers found so many things to celebrate — a pitcher on the varsity baseball team getting to play catch each afternoon with his dad, a pair of high school sweethearts taking their cat for walks, an aspiring surgeon caring for nearly 100 small fish. We hope you’ll take some time to get to know the seniors who took some time to let us into their worlds.
What a year it’s been. When we took over as editors of this magazine, we imagined our biggest problems would be exhausted Wednesday mornings in John Boonstra’s HL90 or frustrated Thursday evenings when C’est Bon ran out of non-variety pack Angry Orchard Rosé. Needless to say, things went differently than expected. But seeing our editors and writers come together week after week to keep our magazine chugging along — that’s been a greater joy than we could have ever imagined, too.
We can’t wait to see where FM goes under the leadership OGO and MNW. Thanks for faithfully reading — we hope you’ve enjoyed reading our increasingly unhinged closeout notes as much as we’ve enjoyed writing them.
Yours,
AWDA & NHP

After Harvard sent students home in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, it extended guaranteed pay and benefits for directly-employed and contracted workers who were not able to work due to the pandemic for thirty days. Following pressure from activists, the University extended the policy several times, eventually through January 2021. Still, workers raised concerns over pay and job security and loopholes in the policy.
Citing financial uncertainty, the University announced a salary and hiring freeze in April and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences furloughed some workers in June.
As Harvard began a phased reopening in the fall, some employees returning to work reported conflicting streams of information, limited testing and personal protective equipment, and unsympathetic managers. Contracted workers also raised concerns about unequal access to testing compared to directly-employed workers. Rumors of spring layoffs and furloughs triggered protests and petitions calling on the University to guarantee pay and job security for contracted staff as the fall term came to a close.
In November, again citing financial limitations, the University announced that directly-employed staff idled due to the pandemic will only receive 70 percent of pay beginning Jan. 15, 2021, while most idled contracted workers will stop receiving pay. The University will also permanently close four Harvard University Dining Services facilities in January, laying off 17 employees.
During the pandemic, the University simultaneously negotiated contracts with five unions, working to renew four contracts that expired in 2020 and write a first contract with its graduate student union. Covid-19 heightened unions’ focus on job security, workplace safety, wages, and paid leave.
After 19 months of negotiations and a historic strike last December, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers secured compensation and healthcare benefit increases in a temporary year-long contract, but HGSU-UAW and the University did not reach an agreement over discrimination and harassment grievance procedures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This story is part of The Crimson's Ten Stories That Shaped 2020 series. To view other parts, click here.
An eight-month investigation by The Crimson uncovered allegations of sexual harassment against three senior faculty in Harvard’s Anthropology Department — Theodore C. Bestor, Gary Urton, and John L. Comaroff — and a department culture that allowed the professors to sometimes avoid investigations into their behavior while placing women in the department at a disadvantage.
The three faculty weathered allegations of sexual harassment — including some leveled by students — over the years in part due to their power within anthropology, a tight-knit field in which all three held prominent standing, the investigation found.
Within a week of the story’s publication, the department removed Urton from his post as Director of Undergraduate Studies and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay placed him on paid administrative leave. Twenty-five members of the Harvard Anthropology faculty penned a letter requesting Urton’s resignation, as two more former students came forward with allegations that he sexually harassed them.
Urton ultimately informed colleagues of plans to retire by the end of August, though FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed the investigation into Urton would continue. On Aug. 25, Gay also placed Comaroff on paid administrative leave pending an investigation into the allegations against him.
In an early December interview, Gay declined to comment on whether the investigations remain ongoing.
A wave of student and alumni activism followed the revelations. Nearly 400 students demanded the University revoke tenure for the three faculty. Students, alumni, and other academics also petitioned the department to make transformative changes to its culture.
The department quickly formed a standing committee of undergraduates, graduate students, staff, faculty, and alumni to “work to dismantle” structures that contributed to “an environment in which abuses continue to manifest and go undetected.” In the fall, the committee formed eight subcommittees that will meet in the spring to develop recommendations in specific areas, such as professional development, advising, and accountability.

This story is part of The Crimson's Ten Stories That Shaped 2020 series. To view other parts, click here.
Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber — a University Professor renowned for his contributions to nanotechnology — was charged in federal court in January for failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
Lieber allegedly made false statements to government investigators for the National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense about his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan.
The TTP, established by the Chinese government in 2008, seeks to attract researchers across the world to China. The U.S. government has deemed the program a national security risk. Despite having signed a TTP contract in 2012, Lieber told authorities he was unaware of being in the program, according to an affidavit. He also emailed a colleague that he would withhold information about his research in China from investigators and Harvard.
The affidavit alleges Lieber joined Beijing-sponsored research programs at Wuhan University of Technology in 2011 while receiving millions of cash and contributions to his Chinese bank account. It also alleges that Lieber misled Harvard to tell the NIH he had no TTP ties.
Harvard placed Lieber on indefinite paid leave the day he was arrested. In June, a grand jury indicted him on two counts of lying to investigators. By mid-summer, Lieber was indicted on four additional counts for failing to report taxable income from his Chinese research.
Lieber has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and indicated he plans to fight the charges to trial. In the fall, Lieber sued Harvard, arguing the University should cover his legal fees. University lawyers argued he relinquished his right to indemnification when he knowingly lied about his relationship with China.
Lieber’s arrest was the latest in a crackdown by the federal government and American universities on “academic espionage,” wherein scientists pass academic research at U.S. universities to foreign governments. In January, a Chinese national was arrested as he attempted to smuggle cancer research from Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to China; he pleaded guilty in December.
Last year, Harvard formed new oversight committees in response to the NIH’s call to investigate intellectual property theft, primarily from China. The University, which boasts strong ties to China and troves of yearly federal funding, continues to walk a thin line as national security concerns have endangered global academic collaboration.

Harvard’s long-lived divestment movement this year gained powerful allies among the faculty and placed supporters in the upper echelons of University leadership, but its ultimate goal pushing the University to completely divest from fossil fuel companies remains unfulfilled.
In February, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of legislation that demanded the University divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry. Harvard Medical School’s Faculty Council passed a similar resolution a week later.
In response to pressure from faculty and students, the Harvard Corporation in April ordered the Harvard Management Company, which handles the University’s endowment, to create a plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for its investment portfolio by 2050. Still, activists called the move insufficient because it allows for continued investment in fossil fuels.
The University has been hesitant to divest, arguing it is important to engage with fossil fuel companies to bring about change from the inside.
The student and alumni group Harvard Forward launched last year to push for climate reform through increased recent graduate representation on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body. The group successfully elected by petition three of its five nominees to the Board of Overseers’ five vacant spots in this year’s election, making it the first campaign to successfully petition a candidate for the position in over three decades.
Less than a month after the election’s conclusion, the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers jointly imposed a new policy disallowing more than six petition-backed candidates from sitting on the Board at any time, drawing heavy criticism from Harvard Forward representatives and supporters. Other alumni, however, praised the move, citing fears of future elections being undermined by special interests.
Harvard Forward initiated its 2021 campaign in November, backing three new candidates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This story is part of The Crimson's Ten Stories That Shaped 2020 series. To view other parts, click here.
A January investigation by The Crimson exposed instances of racism and sexism within the Harvard University Police Department, touching off a pair of reviews by the University, student demands for the department’s abolition, and the retirement of its police chief. Criticisms of HUPD in 2020 coincided with a national reckoning on systematic racism in policing that erupted during the summer.
The Crimson’s investigation cited officers’ allegations of widespread favoritism and retaliation within the department. They faulted HUPD’s chief of a quarter of a century, Francis D. “Bud” Riley, who they said was responsible for perpetuating a hostile work environment.
HUPD faced accusations of police brutality the following month after witnesses to an arrest at the Smith Campus Center claimed the arresting officer, Anthony T. Carvello, used excessive force on a Black man. A subsequent Crimson investigation found Carvello had used force while arresting Black homeless men at the Campus Center on two previous occasions, including an incident captured on video in which the officer put his hand on one man’s neck and an incident in which Carvello pepper sprayed another man and allegedly called him a “n----r.”
In June, the presence of HUPD officers monitoring a demonstration in Boston over the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police, prompted swift backlash and renewed students’ calls to abolish the department.
Days later, Riley announced he would retire at the end of the calendar year, and University President Lawrence S. Bacow separately launched an independent review into HUPD’s practices, stating HUPD’s presence at the Boston protest raised “legitimate questions.” The results of the review, released in December, included recommendations for long-term, philosophical reforms to the department as well as immediate procedural changes.
As the nationwide search for Riley's successor remains ongoing, the University in December appointed Deputy Chief of Operations Denis Downing to serve as interim HUPD chief. The candidate whom Harvard ultimately selects to lead its police department in 2021 will have to confront conflicts within the department, implement the external review’s recommendations, and restore trust between the department and University affiliates. A September survey by The Crimson found nearly one third of College students support the abolition or defunding of HUPD.

Policies enacted by the Trump administration during the coronavirus pandemic brought tensions between the administration and Harvard to a head, culminating in a lawsuit Harvard filed against the federal government in July.
The year's first public dust-up between President Donald Trump and Harvard occurred in April, when the University was slated to receive nearly $9 million in federal aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
After facing backlash from high-profile Republican lawmakers who took issue with Harvard receiving federal aid given the large size of the University’s endowment, Harvard announced it would direct all of the federal aid toward its financial aid programs.
Still, Trump stated in a press conference that the money was “not for Harvard” and requested Harvard should return it. The following day, Harvard announced it would not “seek or accept” the CARES funding.
Trump and Harvard next sparred over immigration, which the federal government clamped down on during the public health crisis. In June, Trump issued an executive order suspending temporary worker visas through the end of the calendar year, which impacted the immigration status of some international Harvard affiliates and “disappointed” Harvard administrators.
As universities began to roll out their plans for the 2020-2021 academic year, the federal government unveiled new immigration policies in July barring international students enrolled in universities only offering online courses from remaining in or entering the country. Around the same time, Trump criticized Harvard’s fall reopening plan, calling it “ridiculous.”
As a result of the federal immigration policies — which subjected international Harvard students living in the United States to possible deportation — authorities detained a Harvard-bound sophomore at an airport in Belarus.
Harvard and MIT swiftly filed a lawsuit in District Court in Boston against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement seeking to bar the agencies from enforcing the guidelines. Several days later, the federal government walked back its policy.
President-elect Joe Biden will likely take a softer approach to student visas. Biden has said he believes international students should not face barriers to studying in the country. Bacow penned a letter to Biden in December congratulating him on his presidential victory and urging him to allow international students to receive student visa status even if their universities are operating fully remotely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This story is part of The Crimson's Ten Stories That Shaped 2020 series. To view other parts, click here.
Government preceptor David D. Kane invited social scientist Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak to students in Government 50: “Data” in October, provoking outrage among faculty and students and rekindling debate over free speech and conservatism on campus.
In his guest lecture, Murray — whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center has termed “racist pseudoscience” — spoke about his new book “Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class,” which challenges the notions that race and gender are social constructs and that class is a function of privilege.
Days before Murray spoke to Gov 50, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay told The Crimson she believed Murray’s scholarship lacks academic merit. Harvard faculty present for Murray’s talk discredited his methodologies and findings.
Kane’s invitation to Murray thrust the Gov 50 preceptor into the spotlight. Harvard undergraduates discovered racist blog posts allegedly authored by Kane under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog. Entries published by “Field” on the website allude to “Black Supremacy” in the NBA, claim more than 90 percent of Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted if it were not for their “Black’ness” [sic], and criticize Williams College’s condemnation of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa without similar condemnation of the Black Lives Matter and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements. In 2014, “David Dudley Field ’25” authored a post on the blog that was signed “David Kane ’88.” Kane, who graduated from Williams College in 1988, founded EphBlog in 2003 for Williams affiliates.
The discovery prompted Gov 50 teaching fellows and students alike to boycott Kane’s course lectures and to circulate a petition to remove Kane from his teaching position, which garnered roughly 700 signatures and was endorsed by the Undergraduate Council. Several faculty members deemed the blog posts “horrible” and “deeply disturbing.”
Student concerns led the Government department to launch a review into the allegations leveled against Kane. Days later, the department installed Government professor Kosuke Imai as the new course head. As part of the arrangement, Kane continued to teach optional lectures and the Registrar’s Office relaxed its policies regarding the Add/Drop deadline and associated fee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a dedication to scholarship and an innate ability to connect with others, Harvard professor emeritus Ezra F. Vogel will be remembered for not just “how many books he wrote, but how many people he touched,” his son, Steven K. Vogel, said.
Vogel, who served as Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Emeritus, and was described by his colleagues as a visionary in East Asian studies, died on Dec. 20 at age 90 of complications from cancer surgery.
His work, centered around East Asia, spanned a wide range of disciplines from sociology to political science and, in later years, history. Above all, he exhibited unfailing humility and what Harvard Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies research associate Sabina Knight described as a “heart of gold.”
Vogel’s years at Harvard began with his Ph.D. in 1958 and his return as a postdoctoral fellow in 1961. He served as a professor from 1967 until his retirement in 2000. During those four decades, he founded and directed several centers focused on the study of contemporary Asia, in addition to pioneering the undergraduate concentration in East Asian Studies.
Beyond Harvard's gates, Vogel garnered worldwide respect for his bestselling books on Japan and China, such as the 1979 “Japan as Number One: Lessons for America” and the 2011 “Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China.”
He will be equally remembered for his warmth and modesty as his academic accomplishments, colleagues and students said.
“That's the unique aspect of Ezra, as a human being,” said School of Public Health professor emeritus William Hsiao. “Often a person with a very sharp intellect will not respect everyone they meet.”
Vogel was born in 1930 to Jewish immigrants in Delaware, Ohio. He remained in the state until his graduation from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1950, where he studied sociology and anthropology.
After serving two years in the Army, Vogel graduated with a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard in 1958. He was appointed as a lecturer at Harvard in 1964, and later became a tenured professor.
“He seemed to have a third degree of energy and devotion that was beyond the normal,” Vogel's former student and current Kennedy School Senior Research Fellow William H. Overholt ’68 wrote in an email. “He was attentive to people and followed them for years and years. That’s just not the normal college experience.”
History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74, who took Vogel’s class “Japanese Society” as an undergraduate, recalled the dedication Vogel showed his students.
“Scanning and the internet didn’t even remotely exist, but he managed to prepare a course pack on his own,” Gordon said. “He collected about 30 or 40 English language articles from various obscure magazines or journals and put them into a pack and then had it all Xerox copied and prepared into a booklet.”
Beyond his commitment to teaching, Vogel helped shape Harvard as an institution.
In the early 1970s, the East Asian Languages and Civilizations concentration largely focused on the humanities. Vogel was “instrumental” in creating the East Asian Studies concentration in 1972 for students who wanted to study contemporary China or Japan, according to Professor of Chinese History Michael A. Szonyi, who now directs the Fairbank Center.
Vogel served as chairman of the concentration from its creation until 1991 and eventually led its merger with East Asian Languages and Civilizations in 1990. He continued to cultivate it even after he retired, Szonyi said.
“I became the director of undergraduate studies for that concentration in around 2010 or so, and Ezra – who had by this time retired from Harvard, was one of the leading experts, and had written his award-winning book – called me up and said we needed to have lunch so that we could talk about the concentration,” Szonyi recalled. “It’s just a further example of how genuine the man was.”
As director from 1972 to 1977 and again from 1995 until 1999, Vogel built up Harvard's Fairbank Center to become a leading interdisciplinary center for the study of China. He also served as founding Director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations from 1980 to 1987 and established Harvard’s Asia Center, serving as its director from 1997 to 1999.
Despite his sizable obligations and importance, he was a generous mentor and source of support for his students.
Government professor Christina L. Davis ’93 remembered that Vogel — who she called a “towering figure” in East Asian studies — would invite undergraduates to his house to talk about their senior thesis research.
“He would reach out and show interest in our research, our ideas — even when he was a world famous scholar — and that was really very powerful,” said Davis, who now directs Harvard’s Program on U.S.-Japan Relations.
“That’s what Ezra was like,” she added. “He was always looking for ways to help people out.”
Vogel’s reach as a mentor extended wide, with Overholt recalling the “hundreds” of guests at his retirement gala celebration.
“Harvard’s then-President Derek Bok said he had never seen anything like this outpouring,” Overholt wrote.
Vogel remained an important figure at Harvard even after his retirement.
“Until the pandemic struck, he was hosting dinners a couple of times a week for the community, for visiting scholars, for visiting speakers,” Szonyi said.
Still, the coronavirus pandemic did not deter Vogel from his active retirement. He continued to present events remotely, such as a November discussion on East Asia’s reaction to the U.S. election.
“There aren’t very many people who at age 90 would happily transfer their expertise to a Zoom seminar,” Davis said. “He was just wonderful.”
After receiving his Ph.D. at Harvard, Vogel traveled to Japan in 1958 with his first wife, Suzanne H. Vogel, to conduct immersive ethnographic research for his first book, “Japan’s New Middle Class,” which was published in 1963.
Steven Vogel — now a professor of East Asian politics at the University of California, Berkeley — said his parents “embedded themselves into a particular suburb of Tokyo for a year and interviewed six families very intensively almost every week for a year.”
Ezra Vogel employed the same level of meticulousness when working on his first book on China, the 1969 “Canton under Communism.” For that book, he traveled to Hong Kong to learn the language and interview refugees and sinologists — at a time when American citizens were barred from mainland China. Vogel’s emphasis on interviews in his research was remembered by colleagues like Knight, who called him “a consummate listener.”
Szonyi said Vogel was a strong supporter of mastering language to understand the perspectives of the people he met.
“Both his Chinese and his Japanese were excellent,” Szonyi said.
Vogel’s former graduate student Merry I. White ’63 described how Vogel elegantly phrased his approach to research.
“There’s this idea he used to tell me,” she said. “‘Find what makes your data sing. Don’t come in with a predisposition.’”
Vogel’s emphasis on the personal, per his colleagues, came through in his 2011 biography of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, which combined criticism with optimism.
“[Vogel] wanted to talk about the transformation of China and how they brought millions of people out of poverty,” Knight said. “He decided that sort of the best way to tell that story was around a person.”
Hsiao and Overholt both recalled the conscientious decision-making and personal modesty evident in Vogel’s decision to sign over the royalties of his Deng biography to his alma mater, Ohio Wesleyan. He did so before the work was published so the motivation behind his writings would not be questioned, Hsiao said.
Vogel had a unique ability to gain respect from both American and foreign audiences, which he leveraged to play an informal role in international diplomacy.
“At the time of the greatest Sino-Japanese antagonism over interpretations of World War II history, he was able to bring leading Chinese and Japanese scholars together in dialogue,” Overholt wrote.
Szonyi said bridging the divide would have been “politically impossible” in China and Japan, so Vogel brought them all to Harvard’s campus.
Vogel wrote his last book, “China and Japan: Facing History,” published in 2019, in hopes of reviving cooperation and relieving tensions between the two countries.
Vogel held stature even in the eyes of the average person in East Asia. Per Szonyi, Vogel was a “household name” in China and Japan. Still, his wide acclaim made no dent on his unwavering modesty, per colleagues.
Much of his influence on policy was done quietly, but still powerfully. Vogel served as East Asia Officer on the National Intelligence Council from 1993 to 1995 during the Clinton administration, but, as Overholt wrote, he was much more comfortable “without a title.”
“He painstakingly cultivated a self-presentation of modesty, professionalism, warmth, and total attentiveness,” Overholt described.
White, Vogel’s former graduate student and colleague, added that her former professor “didn’t feel like any of the mythologies of Harvard.”
“Wherever we were, Ezra was always sitting cross-legged on the floor,” she said. “He did not elevate himself in any way.”
Steven Vogel said he looked up to his father’s ability to “bring people at ease” in the cutthroat world of Harvard academics.
“Harvard can be a tough place for faculty or for students because the expectations are so high,” he said. “What I admire about him is he was able to pierce all of that and be very human within that context.”
Fundamentally, Ezra Vogel was an optimist.
“He always had a really long-term historical view, and part of what enabled him to do that was to be optimistic,” Knight said. “To see that things would get worse, and then they’d get better.”
That optimism is found not only in his research, but also in his daily interactions with people. Knight recalled his response, early on in their acquaintance, to her telling him that she lost family in the Holocaust.
“Thinking about these losses always made me sad, but Ezra was upbeat about it,” she said. “He told me that legacy meant that I would do my best not to let such horrors reoccur. I never thought about my family history the same way again.”
This optimism – what Knight referred to as a “rare gift” – was echoed by colleagues like Gordon.
“He tended to look on the good side of people’s activities and intentions,” Gordon said. “If he was on your side, he was on your side forever.”
Overholt wrote that it is “imperative” that those who knew Vogel’s immense contributions to the field ensure he is remembered.
“It’s too bad we don’t have a monument to him,” Overholt added. “We need one.”

The University announced in June that it would drop its controversial sanctions against single-gendered social organizations following a Supreme Court ruling on sex discrimination.
First established in 2016, the sanctions prohibited members of single-gendered final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving fellowships, athletic captancies, and leadership positions in extracurricular activities. As a result, many final clubs and Greek organizations on campus became co-ed by reforming their membership process or merging with other social organizations.
First applied to the Class of 2021, the sanctions received intense scrutiny and spawned a pair of lawsuits in state court and federal court.
In announcing the reversal, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said it was clear federal courts would rule against the University in the social sanctions lawsuits, given the Supreme Court's historic decision in Bostock v. Clayton County earlier that month, ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination against BGLTQ workers.
Some professors at Harvard Law School were not as certain the case would have undermined Harvard’s case for sanctions. Law School Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen speculated that Harvard decided to drop this lawsuit because it was “not as important as some other things it is currently defending in the courts, such as the Harvard admissions case.”
Nonetheless, internal communications and reports after the federal lawsuit revealed that Harvard administrators were hard-pressed in selling the sanctions to students and alumni from the beginning. In their early discussions, administrators struggled to combat various misconceptions and define the scope of the sanctions. They also acknowledged that sanctions against all-female social groups in particular would be “collateral damage.”
Though Harvard will no longer uphold the social sanctions, Bacow reinforced the University’s commitment to dismantling gender barriers that limit opportunities for students.
One month after the decision, the co-ed Delphic-Bee Club announced it will split back into the all-male Delphic Club and all-female Bee Club. This marks an end to the three year merger during which the two clubs shared a clubhouse on 9 Linden St. It is not yet clear how other co-ed social organizations will react to the sanctions being dropped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This story is part of The Crimson's Ten Stories That Shaped 2020 series. To view other parts, click here.
Harvard announced in July that it would welcome only freshmen and students with extenuating circumstances to campus for the fall semester and conduct its courses entirely online.
Though the College had planned to provide accommodations for up to 40 percent of its undergraduate population, just a quarter of students elected to live on campus.
Despite being among the class invited to campus, international freshmen were unable to live in residence due to federal visa restrictions.
Barred from on-campus housing, some upperclassmen opted to return to the Boston area anyway, taking up rentals with friends. Others chose to venture much farther from the Yard, settling in locales like Hawaii, Utah, New York, and Rhode Island.
Many undergraduates mulled taking a leave of absence or gap year upon learning of another semester of virtual classes. Ultimately, nearly 20 percent of students chose not to enroll for the fall semester, decreasing enrollment from 6,755 students last year to 5,382 students this year.
Students living on campus arrived in Cambridge in late August at pre-assigned times spread over a week. Once on campus, residents underwent Covid-19 testing, picked up their keys and pre-packaged meals, and moved into their dorms for a mandated quarantine.
In October, Harvard sent three freshmen living in Mather House back home for hosting an indoor party with at least three other guests. That incident marked the only confirmed case of the College’s Community Council — a group of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members organized to enforce health and safety requirements — disciplining undergraduates for violating the rules.
With all academic and extracurricular activities rendered virtual, some enrolled students reported feelings of Zoom fatigue throughout the semester. “We can't take for granted how important it is to have that student interaction, and it can't necessarily be replicated on Zoom. It's just not the same,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said of the online transition.
International students of all class years reported an onslaught of challenges during the fall semester, grappling with midnight classes and limited extracurricular and social opportunities.
“My extracurriculars are all but dead,” one international student said in a September interview with The Crimson. “My life at home has been reduced to academic work.”
Back on campus, many student-athletes living in residence said they were “grateful” to be able to meet with coaches and teammates to participate in sport-specific training for a portion of the semester.
Though the Ivy League canceled fall and winter sports, the College permitted student-athletes to participate in strength and conditioning training for an hour each day, during which they wore masks and maintained a six-foot distance.

Harvard Medical School researchers found that a combination of wearing masks and practicing social distancing can reduce student and faculty Covid-19 infections on college campuses by roughly 87 percent, according to a peer-reviewed study published last week.
The study, which was published on Dec. 21 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, used a dynamic microsimulation model to project the clinical and economic outcomes of different intervention strategies over the course of one semester, or 105 days.
Researchers measured outcomes by projected infections per 5,000 undergraduate students and 1,000 faculty in addition to days in isolation, test counts, test costs, costs per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life year, which incorporates health-related quality of life.
Of the 24 different infection control strategies the researchers modeled, adding routine testing to mandatory masking and social distancing prevented 96 percent of cases.
Lead author and Medical School professor Elena Losina said frequent testing comes at a higher cost per infection prevented. She said she does not believe cost is a “prohibitive factor” for Harvard, but it could be challenging for larger public universities and schools with lower budgets.
The study estimated program costs ranging from about $400,000 for minimal social distancing to up to $2.1 million for programs with Covid-19 testing. While extensive masking and social distancing cost $170 per infection prevented, adding routine testing ranges from about $2,000 to more than $17,000 per infection prevented.
The study comes as Harvard prepares to double the number of undergraduates living on campus this spring. Undergraduate case numbers remained low throughout the fall when only freshmen and students with challenging home environments lived on campus. The College invited seniors and most juniors to live in the dorms in the spring.
Losina said Harvard administrators have not contacted the researchers, but they would “be glad to chat with Harvard leadership.”
Losina also said she hopes the results of the study will motivate students to follow the University’s existing Covid-19 guidelines on mask-wearing, social distancing, and routine testing.
“I’m an optimist, so I think for the spring semester, it shows that masks and careful adherence to policies and recommendations that the University provides can be quite successful,” Losina said. “So hopefully this will equip and encourage students to follow the rules.”
Medical School instructor Pooyan Kazemian, who co-authored the study, wrote in an email that the study helped Case Western Reserve University administrators evaluate their Covid-19 campus protocols.
Losina said the researchers' model accounts for fatigue and the relaxation of guidelines over time as students become less willing to adhere to those measures. She said it was difficult, however, to track possible instances of transmission as students and faculty spend time participating in different activities.
Medical School professor Mathias D. Lichterfeld — who was not involved in the study — wrote in an email that the findings show non-pharmacological interventions such as masks and social distancing can reduce the spread of the virus before vaccines are distributed across campuses. The report does not account for contact tracing or vaccination as an intervention strategy.
“It’s remarkable that the combination of social distancing and mandatory masks can be almost as effective (87% in the paper) as vaccines (94-95%) for prevention — so following [non-pharmacological interventions] until vaccines are available is critical,” Lichterfeld wrote.
Medical School professor and study co-author Kenneth A. Freedberg ’79 wrote in an email that mask-wearing and social distancing trump routine testing in importance for curbing Covid-19 infection.
“Regular testing, as done at Harvard, can help further decrease infections, but it is less important on its own,” Freedberg wrote.
Still, he wrote that efforts to slow the spread of the virus in the United States have been limited by politics.
“The politicization of this virus in the US is responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality it has caused,” Freedberg wrote. “Hopefully we are now moving past that phase, on college campuses and throughout the country.”

UPDATED: January 4, 2021 at 3:15 p.m.
Five days after waking up to a March 10 email informing them of Harvard’s decision to de-densify campus, most College students found themselves uprooted from residential life and scattered across the globe.
As they hastened to move out, some first-generation, low-income undergraduates said they were hit hard by the financial burden of having to pay for storage, last-minute trips, and off-campus housing. Some also lost their on-campus jobs, and with them, financial security.
Students of the Class of 2020 mourned the loss of a senior spring cut short. Many scrambled to say their goodbyes — some “packing and drinking” at daytime parties. “We’re trying to get happier so we don’t get too sad,” one senior said.
Federal travel restrictions posed challenges for some international students returning home. “I can’t go home,” one student said. Many international students picked up their studies from their homes multiple time zones away, with some forgoing sleep to attend classes in the middle of the night.
On March 23, online classes made their debut on Zoom. An introductory economics course was delayed by 40 minutes due to technical difficulties, and many other classes also suffered from tech-related issues. Four days later, after much debate, the College adopted a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system.
The University postponed its in-person Commencement Exercises, instead holding its first virtual commencement ceremony on May 28. University President Lawrence S. Bacow — who tested positive for Covid-19 days after students departed campus and recovered — promised to hold a belated Commencement for the Class of 2020.
Facing a $415 million shortfall for fiscal year 2020, Harvard instituted cost-saving measures including a University-wide hiring and salary freeze, discretionary spending reductions, and a voluntary early retirement program.
In July, the University announced it would continue remote teaching for the entire 2020-2021 academic year and prioritize freshmen and select upperclassmen for on-campus housing in the fall.
CORRECTION: January 4, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Covid-19 pandemic forced Harvard to shutter its gates for the first time since World War II. In fact, Harvard did not close during World War II; it shifted operations and reduced its civilian student population.

As 2020 comes to a close, we are looking back at some of the big events that our photojournalists covered this year. While this year was untraditional in many ways, our photojournalists managed to capture many of the defining moments across Harvard’s campus.
Our recap of 2020 begins with Harvard Men’s Hockey in a dominant 7-0 shutout against perennial rival Yale at Madison Square Garden in New York City on January 11.
In late January, The Hasty Pudding Theatricals hosted their Woman and Man of the Year Ceremonies which honored Elizabeth Banks and Ben Platt. Following tradition, Elizabeth Banks rolled down Massachusetts Avenue in a Rolls Royce during the Woman of the Year parade, which was followed by a roast and press conference inside Farkas Hall.
On the first day of classes in the spring semester, nine graduate and undergraduate student activist organizations gathered in the Science Center lobby to hold a “Reorientation Rally.” The groups said the rally’s various participants shared a common interest in fighting for social justice on campus. Their statement concluded, “Today is only the beginning. So, we are calling on every Harvard student, worker, and faculty member to join us in this fight. We cannot win without you.”
During the last week of February, Harvard South Asian Association celebrated its annual production of Ghungroo — the largest cultural show on campus — which celebrates South Asian culture. This year’s performance utilized the setting and dynamics of the American city to celebrate the range of “linguistic, ideological, cultural, and religious diversity in South Asian America in the 21st century.”
Across the nation, Super Tuesday was a defining day in the Democratic presidential primary. In Cambridge, crowds gathered to watch Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) cast her vote near the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Students attended events at the Institute of Politics to hear from Resident Fellows and watch live updates of results. In a surprise, around 11 p.m., the Associated Press named former Vice President Joe Biden the winner of the Massachusetts primary.
Harvard’s squash teams continued their perennial dominance in 2020 as the men’s program captured its second straight national championship and the women’s team secured its sixth straight national championship in February.
Amid the spread of Covid-19 in March, the Ivy League became the first Division I conference to cancel the remainder of its winter sports seasons. Harvard had been slated to host the 2020 Ivy League men’s basketball tournament at Lavietes Pavilion.
On the morning of Tuesday, March 10, Harvard College informed undergraduates that they must vacate their dorms in five days and shift to online learning due to the pandemic. Amid the craze and confusion, students scrambled to move out of dorms and store their belongings.
While some students were stuffing dorm decor and bedding into boxes, others were celebrating their last moments together before vacating Harvard’s campus. Specifically, members of the Class of 2020 spent some of their last moments together as undergraduates partying, reminiscing about their college experiences, and participating in traditional commencement season traditions, including the class picture.
The last days of August normally see Harvard Yard filled with late summer tourists, chaotic crowds of freshmen, and exuberant upperclassmen excited to reunite with friends. This year, first-years and approved upperclassmen moved onto campus over a staggered two-week period to begin online classes for a very non-traditional Harvard semester.
With strict health guidelines and a limited number of students on campus due to the coronavirus pandemic, Harvard drastically adapted many spaces on campus. Usually bustling with students studying, conversing, or exercising, Harvard’s buildings were empty and mostly closed off from normal use to create a safe campus. Annenberg Hall – the first-year dining hall – shifted from indoor dining to a grab-and-go structure to accommodate new dining policies.
After five days of uncertainty and anticipation following Election Day, Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential race on the morning of Saturday, Nov. 7. The outcome marked the end to a unique and divisive campaign that brought anxiety to Harvard students — and Americans — across the U.S. Celebrations broke out around the country, with thousands taking to the streets in major cities, including Harvard Square, to celebrate Biden’s victory — and President Trump’s loss.
