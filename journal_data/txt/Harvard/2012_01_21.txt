I.  
Coming. It starts with a grumble, which is quiet at first but gets louder and louder. Well, no, it starts with a silence, but that silence is long, really long, and everyone is just sitting there waiting the whole time, waiting for the host to sit down and the lights to go on and the captain to say, "welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen, your flight will be arriving in beautiful Sydney in 14 short hours," or whatever, and we hardly even notice because we’re all holding our breath, dreaming about the adventures we’re about to live out. And so the silencetime shortens, and the grumbletime spills back into it, if only because we’ve all spent the whole silencetime thinking something along the lines of: vrrrrmmmmmmm.
Silence it is, and then grumble, then up. We kick off our shoes and we lean back on each other’s tight-tucked-in knees. In the still, stinky air of the passengers’ cabin, we steel ourselves for the unbearable mundane stillness that comes with zooming through the clouds at 500 m.p.h.
Vrrrrmmmmmmm. I am dreaming of home, which somehow feels like an adventure, even though it’s really just home and I was there six short months ago. I wonder if there will be a balloon at the airport again, a balloon I can roll my eyes at and then secretly treasure. Last time it was pink and deflated the day before I left.
I glance around the cabin and it looks like any other. The girl sitting next to me is watching Tom Hanks Finds Himself and Also Love on the big screen without having bothered buying headphones. I watch along, mute, until she falls asleep with her knee on my knee because there really is no space...and I keep right on smiling at the thought that, five years ago, this would have passed as a successful date.
I offer her gum just before we descend. She tells me that she’s traveling. "Cool," I say.
We blink and we stare. The clouds rush on by and everybody looks out, but they all look the same, suddenly boring like the land, so we close the little flaps and we doze against the window frames that rattle in our faces.
II.
Arriving. When the people you’ve kept locked away in your mind are suddenly there, alive and in the flesh—but not all too much in the flesh, not real-life people who have elbows and who snore and who have different opinions from you about things you always thought were completely straightforward.
When your love and its recipients are one and the same. I really do love that moment.
III.
Going. Silence, then grumble, then up. I try to see the city and bang my nose on the window; the plane picks up speed and ascends. The thrill of recognition leaves me pointing like a child: there’s Little Bay!, there’s Mahoney Park!, now there’s the Bridge!, and it’s still a vague rush as my hometown shrinks and flattens into a map, and then a sketch, then the faintest impression.
And there’s nothing, absolutely nothing, that screams adventure like the moment when it all collapses onto a point, when I shut the window with my little white blind that will keep in my memories and keep out the clouds.
The same clouds that kids down below us now point at, their eyes squinting sore and their backs on the grass, braving the light of the sun just to say, this one’s a dog no a bird, look, a dragon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale University announced a stricter set of tailgating regulations Thursday. The new guidelines, which include a ban on kegs and a requirement that student tailgates end at kick-off, are the outcome of an examination of tailgating rules spurred by the death of a 30-year-old woman at the most recent Harvard-Yale football game.
The new guidelines prohibit “oversized vehicles” such as U-Haul trucks unless driven by a pre-approved vendor and also forbid all vehicles from the student section of the tailgate, University Vice President and Secretary Linda K. Lorimer wrote in an email to the Yale community.
The new policies are the product of a two-month review of Yale tailgating prompted by the fatal accident in November. A Yale student driving a U-Haul struck and killed Nancy Barry, a resident of Salem, Mass., and injured two other tailgate attendees.
The New Haven Police Department investigation into the incident is ongoing, according to the Yale Daily News.
The shorter time for tailgate parties and the ban on U-Hauls and kegs bring Yale’s regulations in line with those put in place for the 2010 Harvard-Yale game held in Boston. According to Lorimer’s email, administrators looked to peer institutions like Harvard and Princeton when drafting the new policy.
Over the past decade, tailgating regulations have become stricter at Harvard—which first banned kegs in 2002—while usually remaining unchanged at Yale. But even before November’s accident, Yale began to tighten its tailgating policies, banning glass bottles and requiring tailgate attendees to show IDs and wear wristbands attesting to their legal drinking age at the most recent Game.
Former Lowell House Committee Co-Chair Margaret E. Soutter ’12 said that she expected policy changes following the tragic accident.
“I’d be surprised if they hadn’t made some serious changes given the gravity of what happened,” she said.
Given that Harvard has had more stringent rules than Yale in the past, Soutter said, “If anything, it will even the playing field in term of the fun-ness at Harvard and Yale.”
In her email, Lorimer wrote that the review committee at Yale will next examine “Yale’s tailgating logistics, including parking, traffic control, [and] crowd control.”
Harvard administrators review their tailgating policies annually. Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said in December that Harvard had not decided whether to conduct a more intensive review in response to the fatality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over four minutes to play in the first period of a fast-paced rematch of top-10 teams, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team found itself knotted at zero goals apiece with the third-ranked team in the nation—ECAC rival Cornell.
But despite outshooting the Big Red by a margin of 22-14 over the course of the game, the Crimson emerged winless for the seventh consecutive time against Cornell, falling, 2-0, Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
“We’re always pumped to play Cornell,” said junior assistant captain Josephine Pucci. “We’ve been looking forward to this game all week. Obviously it’s tough, and we’re disappointed with the loss.”
“It was a track meet,” Harvard coach Katey Stone continued. “There’s no doubt about it. There were a lot of great players on the ice, moving the puck quickly. Those are the kinds of games that are fun to play.…We wish we could play at this pace every day.”
The last 4:04 of the initial frame proved deadly for the Crimson (11-5-1, 8-3-1 ECAC), as the Big Red (16-2-0, 11-1-0) tallied both of its goals in that final stretch. After working the puck down the center of the ice, Cornell senior center Kendice Ogilvie played a pass toward the crowded left side of the Harvard net. In the ensuing scramble, classmate right wing Rebecca Johnston found the puck and tucked it past junior assistant captain and goaltender Laura Bellamy.
“We made a couple mistakes in the first period, and [against] a good team like that, it’s going to cost you,” Stone said. “But we bounced back, we never backed off, [and] we handled their speed. There are no moral victories; however, I’m really pleased with how our kids played.”
Soon after Cornell’s first goal, at 18:07 in the first period, Big Red defender Alyssa Gagliardi earned her second trip to the penalty box of the night. But the Crimson failed to capitalize on that power play opportunity or any of its other five of the night.
Just 1:36 later, an interference violation sent sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman off the ice to even the matchup at 4-on-4. And with 1.5 seconds to play in the period, Cornell’s Brianne Jenner sent a tough mid-range shot toward the Harvard net where Big Red defender Lauriane Rougeau deflected the puck into the net, putting the Crimson in a 2-0 hole.
“We have to be ready to go for 60 minutes,” Stone said. “That’s what it takes to win a hockey game. You can’t take five minutes off at the end of the first period. It’s going to kill you.”
After an uneventful opening to the second period, Harvard and Cornell traded power plays later in the frame, as Cornell’s Hayleigh Cudmore and sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong were sent to the penalty box within 20 seconds of one another for checking and interference, respectively.
The Crimson set the stage for a potential last-second comeback after Cornell’s Chelsea Karpenko was booked for hooking at 19:16 in the third. After a timeout with 43.6 on the clock, Harvard pulled its goaltender to give the team an offensive boost. But despite amassing three shots in the final minute, the Crimson could not find the back of the net.
“We have to score,” Pucci said. “There were a lot of rebounds we just couldn’t put away, and we need to be a little stingier on [defense]. We did a good job not giving up shots, but they’re going to be capitalizing on our mistakes.”
Cornell’s victory over Harvard marks its second of the 2011-12 season. When the teams first met on Nov. 12, the Big Red earned a 5-3 victory over the Crimson in Ithaca, N.Y.
But the two teams that met earlier this season were decidedly weaker than the squads that faced off Friday night in Cambridge, as a conflict with the Four Nations Cup left both Harvard and Cornell with depleted rosters in the teams’ first meeting.
“We’re not completely healthy yet, but we had more players in the lineup [than the last time we played Cornell],” Stone said. “You want to play at full strength, and see where the chips fall. Hopefully we’ll get another chance to play them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Playing No. 18 Colgate Friday night at Starr Rink in Hamilton, N.Y., the Harvard men’s hockey team got a big boost from an unexpected star when senior defenseman Peter Starrett scored his first collegiate goal midway through the second quarter to give the visitors the 2-1 lead.
The go-ahead goal would later prove crucial in allowing the Crimson (4-6-7, 3-4-5 ECAC) to tie the Raiders (12-8-3, 6-4-1 ECAC), 2-2. The result marked Harvard’s program-record seventh tie of the season—with 11 games still to go—and was its sixth in 10 contests.
Junior forward Marshall Everson led the Crimson in scoring on the night, netting two points with an assist on Starrett’s goal and a score of his own.
Starrett had a disallowed goal in Harvard’s shutout loss to then-No. 14 Union at Fenway Park last week, but this time, his score certainly counted. The senior took a cross-ice pass from Everson and raised a shot over Colgate netminder Eric Mihalik’s left pad to put the Crimson ahead.
"You could feel the emotions on the bench," junior forward David Valek said. "He scored in the Frozen Fenway, but the goal got called back…I kind of felt bad for him. We definitely could’ve used that goal there, but for him to bounce back and get one right after that was really great. The bench was all pumped up. It was pretty special."
Harvard took its 2-1 advantage into the third period, with freshman goaltender Steve Michalek keeping the Crimson ahead on two big saves on a late Raiders power-play opportunity.
"I felt pretty good last night, but my team made it easy on me," Michalek said. "I didn’t have to make too many saves inside. I thought they did a good job clearing out traffic from in front, which has been a problem for us this year."
But for the second consecutive game, Harvard blew a third-period lead, with Colgate’s Austin Smith—tied for the nation’s lead in points—putting back a rebound inside the left post to even things up with 12:28 left in the contest.
Neither squad managed a shot on goal in overtime, and the Crimson once again finished with a draw against its seventh ranked opponent in its previous eight contests.
"We just have to bear down more in the last few minutes of the game," Michalek said. "That’s a couple of games in a row that we’ve given up a lead late, and it’s something we’ve got to focus more on—paying attention to the details, remaining confident, and sticking towards our game plan towards the end."
It was the Raiders who got on the board first, with Chris Wagner beating Michalek in a crowd from close range with a one-timer six minutes into the opening period.
But after Colgate’s Thomas Larkin was called for slashing, the Crimson responded with a power-play score. With just 19 seconds left in the first, Everson took a cross-ice pass in the slot from teammate Alex Killorn and fired a high shot off the right post and into the opposite side of the goal.
"That was a huge shift in momentum, it pumped us up," Valek said. "For Colgate you could see on their faces they were a little shaky after that…[Everson’s] been on a hot streak recently, so hopefully that continues."
The Crimson was able to hang on for the tie despite being outshot, 16-1, in the final period. Michalek tied a career high with 34 saves, seven of which came off of Wagner’s stick.
"I could see the puck and control the rebounds," Michalek said. "They put a lot on net, but they didn’t have a whole lot of good opportunities."
Harvard did win 38 of 57 faceoffs, including an 8-1 record for freshman Colin Blackwell, which helped offset the shot disparity.
The draw allowed the Crimson to finish the season with a 1-0-1 record against Colgate after topping the Raiders, 4-2, in Cambridge on Nov. 12.
"I thought we played a good defensive game," Michalek said. "We played against a good team, and we knew it’d come down to a bounce or two."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After moving into the Top 25 earlier this week, the Harvard wrestling team appeared poised for a breakout performance on Friday night as it faced its toughest opponent thus far, No. 5 Cornell (7-0, 4-0 Ivy). But the highly touted Big Red proved itself worthy of the hype, and the Crimson (4-4, 0-2) couldn’t keep pace, falling, 38-7, in Ithaca, NY.
It was a convincing victory for Cornell, which boasts three wrestlers ranked among the nation’s top ten in their respective weight classes. After a forfeit victory in the 133-pound match, the Big Red claimed seven of the remaining nine bouts, winning three times by decision, once by injury default, once by technical fall, and twice by pin.
But the meet wasn’t without a couple of bright spots for the Crimson. Freshman Ryan Osleeb, seeing his first action of the dual-meet season, defeated Cornell freshman Nick Pena in the 125-pound match.  And after a string of Crimson losses, No. 5 Walter Peppelman cruised to an 8-0 major decision over Big Red sophomore Ryan Dunphy, giving Harvard’s junior co-captain a 16-3 record on the season.
Osleeb, who was wrestling in place of sidelined junior Steven Keith, trailed Pena, 3-2, heading into the third period. But in the final frame, Osleeb tied the match at three with an escape before going up 5-3 with a takedown. Pena scored an escape to add one more point, but Osleeb took the tightly contested match with a 5-4 decision.
Freshman Patrick Hogan lost by technical fall in the 141-pound match and co-captain Corey Jantzen was unable to get the Crimson back on track at 149 pounds. Jantzen kept pace with Cornell sophomore Chris Villalonga through two periods, but the senior was unable to escape after starting the third period in the down position, giving Villalonga the 1-0 decision.
Peppelman got out to a 2-0 lead in the 157-pound match and never looked back, narrowing the Crimson’s deficit to seven, 14-7, with the major decision.
Harvard would get no closer following Peppelman’s win. Big Red sophomore Craig Eifert won by injury default over junior Paul Liguori in the 165-pound match, and Cornell’s Billy George won an 8-5 decision over Crimson freshman Josh Popple at 174 pounds.
Sophomore Cameron Croy was pinned in just under three minutes by Cornell senior Steve Bosak, the third ranked wrestler in the nation in the 184 pound weight class. Harvard freshman James Fox suffered a similar fate in the 197-pound match, as he was pinned in just over a minute by first ranked Cam Simaz. Freshman David Ng couldn’t buck the trend of Crimson losses, falling in an 8-3 decision in the heavyweight match.
The undefeated Big Red is the highest ranked opponent the Crimson has faced this year, which, according to Harvard coach Jay Weiss, will serve as critical experience as the team moves toward the elite competition of the national tournament in the coming weeks.
“I firmly believe that our guys have to be battle-tested throughout the year,” Weiss said. “We have to get them wrestling against the best in the country.”
Weiss hopes the high competition level will serve as motivation for his team in the coming weeks.
“Hopefully this will make our guys realize, ‘Hey, if that’s where I want to be…we have to do a little more work,’” Weiss said.
The Crimson received another strong performance from Peppelman, who continues to dominate after posting a perfect 3-0 performance at the Lone Star Invitational earlier this month, earning him EIWA Wrestler of the Week Honors.
“He’s one of the best in the country,” Weiss said. “I know he expects a lot of himself, as do we.”
It was also a big night for Osleeb, who notched his first dual-meet win and the second overall win of his young career.
“He came in and won a big match,” Peppelman said. “That was a great win for him to get under his belt”
Jantzen, who returned earlier this month after missing an entire year due to injury, suffered only his second loss of the year. The senior, Weiss says, is still adjusting.
“He’s going to continually get better,” Weiss said. “He can be so good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After revealing the winners of the semifinal matchups, we now turn our attention to the finals, where football's Josue Ortiz and crew's Andrew Campbell square off.
Check back soon to find out the winners on the women's side of the bracket.
Josue Ortiz v. Andrew Campbell
Both Josue Ortiz and Andrew Campbell were one-man wrecking machines in the latter portion of 2011, often leaving their victims in intense amounts of physical pain. Campbell's opponents brought it upon themselves. At the US U23 World Championships Trials, Elite Nationals, US World Championship Trials, and USRowing East Coast Fall Speed Order, the best lightweight scullers in the nation were unable to match Harvard's 19-year-old sensation.
The suffering of Ortiz's victims was much less voluntary. The Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year finished with 38 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, and 10 sacks—good for tops in the league. For his exploits, he was named MVP of Harvard's 2011 squad that won the Ivy League title. Ortiz was also a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection, a third-team All American, and the winner of the New England Football Writers Association’s Harry Agganis Award, given to the best senior football player in New England.
What ultimately separated Campbell from Ortiz was not execution but the level of competition. Neither athlete was entirely perfect. Ortiz registered only two tackles in the Crimson's season-opening loss to Holy Cross, a defeat that kept Harvard out of the highest echelon of modern-era Crimson football teams. Campbell's defeats, meanwhile, came at the U23 and senior World Rowing Championships, where he took third and fourth, respectively. These finishes could hardly be considered disappointments, as they marked the highest US finish in the lightweight single ever at the U23 World Championships and the highest finish since 2002 at senior worlds.
Both Ortiz and Campbell had outstanding years in which they mastered nearly every challenge thrown their way. But Campbell did it against the best in the world, whereas Ortiz only competed against Ivy League foes. And therein lies the difference.
Winner: Andrew Campbell

HANOVER, N.H.—If the No. 24 Harvard men’s basketball team is to live up to expectations and earn the first outright Ivy title in school history, the league favorite must be prepared to grind out low-scoring affairs in front of sizeable road crowds throughout the Ancient Eight.
The Crimson did just that Saturday evening when freshman guard Corbin Miller had a game-high 13 points and classmate Steve Moundou-Missi added nine to lead Harvard to a gritty 54-38 win at Dartmouth.
The Crimson (16-2, 2-0 Ivy) led by five early in the second half before jumping out on a 18-3 run over the next seven minutes to drop its Ivy travel partner for the sixth straight contest.
“I give all the credit to Harvard,” Dartmouth coach Paul Cormier said. “They just came out, they played terrific defense, and it’s a real credit to them.”
Jvonte Brooks led the Big Green (4-14, 0-2) with 12 points, while Tyler Melville had 10 off the bench for Dartmouth, playing in front of a home crowd of 2,100 in the first Leede Arena sellout since Dec. 30, 2000, when No. 8 Virginia visited.
Though Harvard had picked up a 63-47 victory over the Big Green two weeks ago at Lavietes Pavilion, it trailed by as many as seven early on in the second half of the Ivy opener for both squads.
And so when Dartmouth held the Crimson scoreless for nearly six minutes to open Saturday’s game—or when it cut the Harvard lead to 28-23 on a three-pointer by Melville at 13:35 in the second half—an upset did not seem impossible.
But on a night when reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright had four points on two-of-seven shooting and point guard Brandyn Curry was held scoreless, Harvard relied on its reserves to provide a key offensive spark.
The Crimson’s bench outscored its starters, 32-22.
“Going into this year, we thought the keys for us would be our bench and our balance,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Now, as we get into late January, I’m hopeful if we can stay healthy, continue on the path we started tonight, it will be a nice opportunity for us.”
And wielding the nation’s fourth-ranked defense in points allowed per game, Harvard is well-equipped to remain competitive when its stars’ shots aren’t falling.
The Crimson held the Big Green to six assists and forced 17 turnovers.
“One night it might be [co-captain Oliver] McNally, one night it might be Wright, one night it might be [junior forward Kyle] Casey,” Cormier said. “And lo and behold, then you get the Miller kid who came off the bench. That’s the sign of a real good team.”
Harvard’s latest win was indeed anything but pretty, as the visitors again struggled with the ball at the beginning of the second frame, going without a field goal until junior Christian Webster nailed a three-pointer from the right wing six minutes into the frame.
Then Miller, who showed no signs of rust after missing three games due to a left thumb injury, began the decisive second-half spurt with a jumper on the baseline on the Crimson’s next possession.
Several minutes later, Casey came off a screen to slam home a two-handed jam—his first points of the game—to give Harvard a double-digit lead for the first time on the night.
Two possessions later, Miller hit a smooth triple from the left wing off a pass from Wright.
Following a Big Green turnover, Miller nailed a long jumper off the dribble to grant Harvard a 41-26 advantage with 8:55 left in the game.
Returning to action after missing two straight games with a hip injury, Webster came off the bench and had eight points on three-of-four shooting from the field.
Webster’s former backup, sophomore Laurent Rivard, started for the third consecutive matchup and also picked up eight points.
The Crimson led, 23-16, at intermission after a first half in which the two squads combined for 21 turnovers.
Unable to convert multiple up-close looks, Harvard shot 35 percent from the field—its second-worst first-half shooting performance of the year—and had three free throw attempts in the period.
“We didn’t finish,” Amaker said. “We didn’t make a ton of baskets that we thought we should have made, especially around the goal.”
Dartmouth did not fare much better, as only three of its players scored in the first half.
The Big Green went 6-of-20 (30 percent) from the floor and reached the free throw line once.
The Crimson will look to preserve its undefeated Ivy League record when it visits Yale and Brown this coming weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a 2-0 loss to No. 3 Cornell, the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team showed no mercy to Colgate (8-15-1, 3-9-1 ECAC) on Saturday evening, beating the Raiders, 4-0, in a penalty-ridden matchup.
The Crimson (11-6-1, 8-4-1 ECAC) began the game slow, making unprompted mistakes and having trouble keeping control of the puck. But Harvard found a way to score at the end of the first frame and maintained its lead before dominating the third period, scoring three more goals to seal the win.
Off to a lethargic start, the Crimson looked nothing like it did the night before in the fast-paced, high-level battle between two top-10 teams.
“We started off not really ourselves,” sophomore wing Lyndsey Fry said. “We definitely wanted to go into today’s game with a lot of momentum and carry it from last game, but we didn’t quite do that how we wanted to.”
“Today the timing was slower; the pace was slower,” Harvard coach Katey Stone added. “I thought we were off a lot, and we didn’t set the tone. We didn’t make things happen early on—we just kind of waited for them to happen, and that’s really not our game.”
With the score still in a stalemate, Colgate’s freshman center Taylor Craig found herself behind the Crimson defense on a breakaway. With Harvard defenders close on her heels, Craig managed a slap shot that threatened to give the Raiders the first lead of the game, but junior goaltender Laura Bellamy deflected the puck over the top of the goal, one of her 31 saves on the evening.
Showing the colors of a nationally-ranked squad, the Crimson found a way to get control of the game, putting the puck in the back of the net before the first period came to a close.
With less than two minutes remaining before the first break, sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman shifted around a Colgate player, skated down the right sideline, and rocketed a shot at the Raiders’ goaltender Kimberly Sass. Sass made the save, but the puck lingered around the goal until it found its way to the stick of Fry, who redirected it over the goal line.
Though the middle frame recorded no goals, Harvard had its chances.
Midway through the period, rookie wing Hillary Crowe scooped the puck up and danced around a stunned Colgate defender before she sent a powerful shot towards Sass. But a block from Sass kept the Crimson just one goal ahead, and the score remained 1-0 going into the second intermission.
While the second period resulted in no scoring, the Crimson seemed to gain the momentum with the start of the third period, as Harvard notched back-to-back goals within the first minute of play.
The scoring frenzy began when junior center Jillian Dempsey passed the puck from behind the goal to sophomore wing Gina McDonald, who was waiting right on top of the goal crease. McDonald hit a no-nonsense shot straight past Sass to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead.
Before the announcer could finish giving McDonald credit for her goal, Dempsey took hold of the puck and raced down the right side of the ice, cutting around the only Raiders’ player in her way. But as she moved around the defender, she slipped and fell to the ice as she cranked out a shot which still flew past the Raider netminder for the score.
Nine minutes later, the Crimson struck again. With an opponent on her heels, Fry intercepted a Colgate pass, transitioning to the attack as junior defenseman Josephine Pucci skated with her. In a 2-on-2 opportunity, Fry passed to her teammate, and Pucci tucked one more tally in before the end of the game.
Despite the four goals, Harvard struggled on the power play.  In 14 power plays, the Crimson was never able to capitalize on its man-up opportunities.
But the slow start and the weak power play didn’t matter in the end, as the Harvard offense found its form and overpowered the visitors in the game’s final frame.
“It was a different game entirely [from Friday night]—different team, different group of refs. You never wanna blame it on reffing, but it definitely can change the way a game works and how it goes, so we had to work out some obstacles,” Fry said. “But by the end there, we were running on all cylinders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping a close 5-4 contest at home against No. 3 Princeton last weekend, the Harvard men’s squash team (10-2, 2-1 Ivy) hoped to rebound with a win over No. 1 Trinity (9-1, 1-0 NESCAC) Saturday afternoon in Hartford, Conn. But the top-ranked Bantams had other plans, sealing a victory after just five individual matchups and eventually taking down the Crimson, 7-2.
“We didn’t play well,” sophomore Gary Power said. “Trinity was coming off of a loss to Yale, and they were determined to win. That determination really shined through. Maybe that’s a lesson to be learned because, on paper, we’re just as talented as them.”
Just three days before the matchup between two of the most storied men’s squash programs in the country, Trinity lost its first match in 13 years at Yale’s Brady Squash Center. The Bulldogs’ victory ended a 252-game winning streak—the longest in the history of intercollegiate athletics.
“You have to give a lot of credit to Yale on that one,” freshman Nick Hopcroft said. “They put together a great performance. Trinity and Yale are both very strong teams....Yale has trained hard and put a lot of hours in [since Ivy Scrimmages]. The season’s very long, and we’re going to have to come back much stronger if we want to try to win Ivies and Nationals.”
But the Bantams appeared to be back in top form on Saturday. Despite strong final-cycle efforts from sophomores Ali Farag and Power, who won their matchups at the No. 1 and No. 4 spots, respectively, Harvard’s early struggles left no room for a comeback.
“We got off to an extremely bad start, losing the first five matches, and they completely stopped us,” Hopcroft said. “The whole team contributed, but everyone was extremely down [after that].”
After taking the first game against Trinity’s Johan Detter, 11-3, Power’s opponent tied it up at one game apiece with an 11-7 victory in the second. But Power came back strong, taking the final two games, 11-7 and 11-6, respectively, to earn a 3-1 individual win.
At the No. 1 spot, Farag claimed the third victory of his Harvard career, picking up a win over Vikram Malhotra in four games. The match marked Farag’s second straight victory over a member of the 2010-11 All-America First Team, as the sophomore took down the reigning national individual champion—Princeton’s Todd Harrity—in a five-game thriller during Harvard’s recent contest against the Tigers.
“Ali is the best in the world for his age, and we’re extremely lucky to have a player of his caliber on the team,” Hopcroft said. “He recently beat two of the best players in the country…without even playing his best squash. He’s a harder worker than I think anyone on the team, and it’s great to see him do well.”
Despite the 7-2 final, most of Harvard’s individual matchups against the Bantams were close. Sophomore Nigel Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, took his opponent at the No. 5 spot to five games, winning two straight to open the matchup but eventually falling, 3-2.
Junior Zeke Scherl and sophomore Tommy Mullaney also dropped tight, five-game matchups for Harvard at the No. 8 and No. 9 spots. The Crimson took home at least one game in all but one of its matchups.
“It’s most important for us to start working harder on getting into better physical shape,” Power said. “We lost three five-gamers, three four-gamers, and those close matches really tip the balance. That’s where we need to improve if we want to win a national championship.”
For the first time in at least a decade, this year’s Potter Cup has no clear favorite with Yale’s recent victory over the Bantams giving it an edge as the current team to beat.
“In the past few years, it’s basically been Trinity winning the national title,” Power said. “This year, there are probably about six teams that could win....That definitely makes it more interesting.”
And if a Harvard squad with eight underclassmen currently playing in the top nine hopes to contend for its first national title since 1998, it will need to go through Trinity or Yale, not to mention Princeton, Cornell, and Rochester.
“A lot of it is mental,” Power said. “We want to go into a match with a little more confidence. And a little of that showed yesterday. We need to get our heads down and start training harder. We have a lot of really close matches, and those will determine where the national title ends up.”
