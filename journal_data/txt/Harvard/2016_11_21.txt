After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Subscriptions to music streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal are at an all-time high, while buying music—CDs, digital tracks, etc—has seen a steady decline in popularity. With the many different advantages and disadvantages to either streaming or buying—buying is more expensive, but streaming is more limited in music availability—it may be hard to decide which option is best. However, consumers are clearly showing a preference for streaming services, a trend that says a lot about the direction in which the music industry and music consumption is going.
The industry comes under fire when evidence emerges that it devalues both artists and their art. Spotify allegedly offers artists purposefully unfair deals that confuse and entrap. Furthermore, the lower-end music services offer tend to be more compressed and lower in quality, sullying an artist’s hard work. The biggest issue artists have, however, is whether or not their music should be offered for free. Taylor Swift’s music isn’t on Spotify because she refuses to make her music available anywhere for free. She was also initially at odds with Apple for offering a free three-month trial to new users, which would make it such that an artist would “not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.” While these services mean well in trying to attract an audience that is more reluctant to pay for music, the risk that the music itself and the team of people who work tirelessly to create it will be devalued is an essential issue that must be dealt with delicately. If artists feel devalued, why would they continue to make music?
An interesting consequence of the increasing popularity of streaming services is that artists gain an advantage in that they can choose the platform on which they will profit from their music. Adele, for example, did not initially allow her album “25” to be streamed, and only recently allowed for it to be released on Spotify. People feared this decision would dangerously limit her audience, but on the contrary, “25” broke the single-week US album sales record, selling more than two million copies in a little over three days. Drake has an exclusive deal with Apple Music, and his latest album, “Views,” was the first to reach a billion streams on the service. Both Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean released their most recent albums exclusively on Apple Music for a few weeks. Frank Ocean’s decision to release “Blonde” independently—without a music label—could spark a revolution in the music industry if more established artists forego music labels and just go straight to streaming services to negotiate music distribution. With artists gaining more power, the future of the music industry remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: The advent of streaming services have given both consumers and artists a plethora of options to access and release music, the ramifications of which we have yet to fully understand.

Ajarae D. Coleman ’02 is an actress and entrepreneur based in Los Angeles. She has appeared in such television programs as “Scandal,” “Revenge,” and “2 Broke Girls” and has taken parts in films like “Iron Man 2.” She also founded The Workshop Guru, a resource for actors to navigate through the world of casting workshops and make the connections necessary to further their careers.

The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell me a little about your Harvard experience?
Ajarae D. Coleman: I lived in Quincy House and I concentrated in Biological Anthropology. I wasn’t really quite sure what I wanted to do after graduation, but one of my jobs was a recruitment director for Teach For America on campus, so I ended up becoming a Teach For America corps member after I graduated. I recruited myself. But also during my time at Harvard, I was a member of BlackC.A.S.T. and did a few plays with the Dramatic Society, so [I had] a bit of theater during the second half of my experience there.
THC: Did your time at Harvard help inform your choice of career path, or did you decide to go into acting before that?
ADC: I didn’t really do any theater or performance in high school. Or didn’t do much, because I played sports, and you couldn’t really do both. So Harvard was the place where I developed my passion for [the] performing arts and realized it was something that I really loved to do. I didn’t really consider it as a career until several years after graduation, but I would definitely say my love started there.
THC: What factors contributed to your decision?
ADC: I started continuing my education as an actor out here in Los Angeles. I worked as a manager at an industrial supplies distributor, and I had some time after work, which was very different from my time as a teacher, where I was pretty much teaching, grading, sleeping, calling parents, you know, all day. So I started taking acting classes at UCLA, and I was encouraged by some of my professors there to really give it a shot.
THC: What projects are you currently involved in?
ADC: Right now, I am just actively auditioning for film and TV projects and commercials. I actually co-created a pilot presentation called S.M.A.C.K. Unit. It’s an action-comedy television pilot. My partners and I are working on pitching that out to management companies and networks and things like that. Other than that, it’s just the standard grind of an actor, right? Just going to auditions every week. Some of those you get called back for, and some of those you don’t. Some of those you book.
THC: Do you have any tips for up-and-coming actors that might have that process ahead of them?
ADC: I would say that no matter how good you feel as an actor, you should always be studying and pushing yourself—working on new material, working on more difficult material, material that stretches you. I would also say that a lot of artists in general focus on their craft, but they forget that we are also businesspeople. I am the CEO of myself as an actress. So you have to focus just as much on your marketing materials and building relationships with industry decision makers and creating your own content. Now, with the technology that we have, it’s easier than ever to create really high quality content with great production value, and it’s not super expensive to do it. So I would say that my biggest tip is just to be creative, and don’t wait for people to give you opportunities. Create opportunities for yourself.
THC: You received some attention this year for your defense of casting workshops in Deadline. Would you mind giving a rundown of the debate surrounding the issue, for readers who are not aware of it?
ADC: Casting workshops—or industry workshops, because casting directors aren’t the only people who teach these workshops—are really opportunities for actors who aren’t as experienced, who haven’t gone on as many auditions and don’t know that process, to learn more about what it’s like to audition and also to hear from casting directors more about the process at large, so you’re actually learning from people who are working in the industry. It’s great. When I quit my corporate job and just jumped into acting, I didn’t have a really good agent who was able to create relationships for me. I didn’t have any credits. A lot of times you can’t get an agent without credits, so your only opportunity to network as well with industry professionals is through these workshops.
I’ll give you one example: One of the casting directors of one of my first projects, I went to a workshop with her. It was a two-day, full-day weekend thing—Saturday and Sunday we went—and she was amazing. She told us things like whenever you go in for a daytime audition, you should always be off-book because the actors are expected to learn so many lines. Just tips that you wouldn’t necessarily know unless you were hearing it from somebody who really worked in the trenches day in and day out. We performed multiple scenes for her, got redirection on those scenes, learned about what it was like to work in her office, what it was like to be on set, all kinds of stuff. I would say maybe a week after that, she called me in for an audition because she liked my work in class, and I ended up booking that, and that was one of my first TV roles.
So that’s an example of what the process is supposed to look like. You’re supposed to go in and learn something from the workshop, and if the relationship being built results in an audition, that’s great, but that’s not something that happens all the time. However, I would say that is why most actors do workshops, because they’re looking for opportunities to get auditions. So the people who are against casting workshops are against them because there is the chance that casting directors can go in and not teach anything and charge these actors just for the opportunity to network with them. But I would say that the vast majority of casting directors that I have done workshops with are really teaching good content as well as meeting actors.
But the reason I involved myself in this conversation is because I am an entrepreneur as well. I founded a business called workshopguru.com, and the reason I founded it was to help actors distinguish between workshops that were really good and workshops where the casting directors are just there for a paycheck. So we have reviews of casting directors, reviews of workshop studios on the site, and we also show a schedule of all the workshops in Los Angeles and New York, so actors can compare prices and really find the workshops that are reasonably priced and intermediate for them. That’s my business. When this Hollywood Reporter article came out, which is basically a very one-sided representation of workshops, I kind of felt like it was up to me to speak for actors who really benefitted from workshops and to share the other side of the story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

When I was in sixth and seventh grade, screaming “Lil Wayne SUCKS!” was a fast way to earn social currency. In retrospect, this doesn’t make much sense, because a) probably none of us had ever listened to Lil Wayne, and b) Wayne dropped “Tha Carter III,” one of his most acclaimed albums, in the summer before sixth grade. As an insecure middle schooler, though, I liked that all I had to do to avoid total loserdom was say some rude things about a human Etch-a-Sketch.
I also had to wonder, though: Why did everyone agree that Lil Wayne sucked? What did this guy actually sound like?
I began to self-educate furtively on the family iTunes account still registered to my mom’s college email. Lil Wayne whined “Got Money” as the cover art for “Tha Carter III” burned incriminatingly on the screen. I immediately understood how the music could be regarded as really bad. I kept listening. I bought the song. Since then, I’ve continued to buy Lil Wayne tracks. I even dropped money on “Prom Queen,” probably because I liked seeing Wayne’s “soft” side. (Soft is, of course, relative: He raps about his pubescent love interest’s “fancy underwear.” Imagine Taylor Swift keening about an ex’s couture Calvin Klein boxers.)
The nadir—or maybe it was the pinnacle—of my Lil Wayne support was the $1.29 spent on “Drop the World.” The track starts off sounding a bit like a bad Tumblr post: “I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes / Hate in my heart, love in my mind / I seen nights full of pain, days are the same / You keep the sunshine, save me the rain / I search but never find, hurt but never cry.” And then, in the verse’s last two lines, Wayne’s monotone drawl rips into a scream that, accompanied by head-thrashing drum set, explodes into the chorus: “So I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your f*cking head! B*tch, I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your f*cking head!” Boasting, insults, and threats are rap’s connective tissue—but Wayne takes it to the next level here. He is not just going to rap you into obsolescence, sleep with your women, kill you, or channel the vengeful ghost of a silverback gorilla and massacre your family in a Percolet-crazed frenzy. No: He is going to “pick the world up and drop it on your f**king head!” He’s not just a multimillion dollar rap mogul—he is anti-gravity, Atlas, God Himself.
I’ve come to really appreciate Lil Wayne, probably less for his actual discography than for his wit and general kookiness, or for the concept of his persona. Who else would publish their prison diary as a book? Even coming from Lil Wayne, though, the chorus of “Drop the World” is one of the worst insults ever. It reminds me of a moment during comedian Jimmy Carr’s “Funny Business” special when, after suffering a ruthless round of “your mom’s a prostitute” jokes from Carr, a beleaguered heckler shouts back, “Your face is like a 42-inch wide TV!” I mean, how does one pick the world up and drop it onto someone’s head if that individual is still standing on the world itself? Is “world” metaphorical here? Who let Wayne into the studio with those lyrics? Why did Eminem agree to be featured?
But there is something deeply satisfying about hearing Lil Wayne, usually so smug with his scratched-ice voice and signature cackle, spitting bad digs like a red-faced fifth grader who’s been shoved on the playground. Unlike some of the physical and sexual violence tossed around in other adrenaline-rousing rap lyrics, this threat is so far-fetched it’s harmless; at the same time, there’s a certain appeal to the idea of dropping 5.9 sextillion tons of matter onto things and people we don’t like. I’m only slightly ashamed to admit that when “Drop the World” shuffled back into my life a couple months ago, I didn’t tap the fast forward button. I could almost see Lil Wayne giggling next to a scowling Eminem: “Man, these lyrics f*ckin’ SUCK!”

How do I begin? Women are evil. That is my thesis.
Right now, millions of South Koreans are calling for the resignation of their first female president, Park Geun-hye. The scandal centers on Ms. Park’s close friend Choi Soon-sil, who has been arrested for accusations of meddling in state affairs and soliciting business donations for a non-profit under her control.
While Ms. Park is constitutionally protected from criminal indictment, public trust and her approval ratings have plummeted to an unprecedented low in South Korea’s history, with enormous rallies calling for her resignation or impeachment. Part of the scandal is due to its religious implications: Ms. Choi’s father, Choi Tae-min, was the founder of an obscure sect called the Church of Eternal Life. Although there is no evidence that either Ms. Choi or Ms. Park were involved in religious activities, the indirect connection has caused South Koreans to claim that their country is being run by a “puppet” president controlled by the “shaman.”
In and of itself, this scandal is unconcerning. After all, corruption in South Korea is nothing spectacular. Each of the three presidents that came before Ms. Park were embroiled in family corruption scandals that 
sent multiple government officials to jail and led one president to commit suicide.
What is truly concerning about this story of downfall is the implication it has for future women leaders. Conservative politicians slander Ms. Choi as a “housewife” and men joke that new female presidents will now be farfetched.
Though the specific details are different, the parallels between the scandal in South Korea and current events here in the US are stark. In America, the defeat of first viable woman candidate for president defeat has been punctuated by chants calling for our new president-elect to “lock her up.”
The narrative is the same: Hillary is crooked. Hillary represents Wall Street and elite double standards. Hillary is a criminal. She had the audacity to use a private email server, and Americans couldn’t get enough of this one detail. This single point swallowed her entire platform, and at one point, 92% of Americans were convinced that Clinton had committed a crime or was at least guilty of poor judgement.  Even Hillary supporters can’t resist qualifying themselves with a weakly smiling, “Yeah, she’s messed up a few things, but...” Never mind the fact that the FBI has cleared Hillary Clinton twice. Never mind the fact that locking up political opponents is the job of dictatorships instead of democracies.
What is most disturbing about all this is not that one of the most qualified and honest modern presidential candidates was villainized, but rather that Hillary’s downfall is neither surprising nor uncommon.
When women are allowed to lead, they are landmarks, exceptions, perhaps even experiments. Their victory is a victory for womankind, but it is also a heavy burden to bear. Their mistakes, their scandals, and their failures define not only their career, but also the entire concept and image of women leadership. When a woman blunders, she mars the face of all womankind.
Yet this idea of generalizability applies only to women, not to men. We see men as individuals rather than a species—individuals whose failures and scandals represent only themselves. And sometimes, we even give them second chances because we understand that men are not angels.
But neither are women. The precedents set by Hillary Clinton, Park Geun-hye, Dilma Rousseff, and Cristina Kirchner, among others, are precedents that should be taken with a grain of salt. Their accomplishments are great for the obstacles they faced and their failures are disappointing for the potential that was lost, but to think that the character traits and distinct fates of a handful of women can be generalized to half the population or that female leadership will have some distinct “style” is both ignorant and sexist.
Women are evil. That is my thesis. But so are men. As human beings, we can be corrupt, incompetent, emotional, and narrow-minded—but that says nothing about our gender. We can also be the greatest leaders the world has ever seen—because we are individuals. The assumption of variation and the privilege of second chances can’t be reserved for men. We can’t afford to cut the talent of the world in half when at the end of the day, our potentials for good and evil are all the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We were elite, colored, guarded, and beautiful. We made safe spaces and cried in them for no reason or for the simple reason that they existed. It was possible for a world this tense to be this pretty, the art to be this good, and for once, our art stopped being so angry. Chance used God tones, and Rihanna said “you got me like ahh” instead of  “I am not a victim,” and we shifted from “black is beautiful” to “in moonlight black boys look blue.” We were sentimental and heartless with ourselves, and white people were listening to us too. We practiced radical love, which is a kind of God-love, the love that makes you feel good doing it, the love that’s unreciprocated and nonspecific and definitely okay, the love that disqualifies you from being a hardo, the love that forces you to snap at open-mics and gets you to dance salsa even if you don’t know how to with girls and boys and girl-boys and boy-girls, the Maya-Angelou kind of love, the love that’s so present you don’t need a past, the drunken love, the love that makes you cry at the anthem.
The day before the election, Tinashe posted a picture half-smiling, baby blue fingernails, and candid with the caption “HAPPY cuz my new music is out & Donald Trump is finally gonna lose tomorrow.” The day after, my roommate corrected me, saying we were now post-Obama, not Trump’s America, because black presidents create whitelash, and whiny kids don’t invent countries so we should stop giving them all the credit. I listened to Nightride for the first time, which was spooky enough for the day. Pitchfork called it “strictly after-hours,” but the reviewer was probably a little too old and white to figure that being an ice-cold bitch is more of a lifestyle than an aesthetic choice.
Is the radical love that made me feel so good enough? I always hypothesized that the trope was driven by some need to be both sexy and independent, which is important when you have control over only your own body. But even that idea is contested. The racism and sexism in this country is apparent enough for the trope to really mean something, and even though icons like Rihanna and Tinashe are adorned in spaces of radical love, there is something difficult about how the tension builds, something incongruous about a community that expresses that it is both ready to love indiscriminately and too defensive and noncommittal to actually do it on an individual basis. Like we spread love too thin it broke. We romanticized everything too much and related to them all no matter how much they contradicted, from dreams of brotherly love to our inability to love, from our readings of Dubois as too old-school (i.e., How am I supposed to navigate both my double-consciousness and his double-consciousness?) to our readings of Beyoncé as queen.
The last time I went to an open mic, I came out unconvinced of radical love’s truthfulness because the place was a sick kind of sweet, positive but through-the-roof. The venue was beautiful; the music was great; the people were dancing. But it wasn’t enough, I think, to be real. Because I still left more defensive than before, unable to view myself or the others in the room as capable. Our thoughts were not radical enough for the radical nature of the love we wanted, because our concerns were human. Our positivity was a sheen that did little to distract me from the ache of my country. Because I am older now, wiser. And I want, now more than ever, a love that means something.
The day after the election, in Protest Literature lecture, Professor McCarthy talked to us about James Baldwin—gay, black—who loved this country so much that his love was directly tied to hate, so much that he grew too sick of it to stay here. Until his death in France, he continued to write, hate, admire, criticize, speak about, drink off, and love this country. In some ways, I think I understand more that kind of love, the parasitical kind related to country, because I have seen its impacts more than the radical love rooted in dreams. How I defensively felt, along with Frederick Douglass and Toni Morrison and my sister and my parents and my acquaintances, that I belonged here and only here, in my skin and only my skin. I was obsessed with a problem that I needed to convince others was systemic, to convince them that my sensitivity was not my weakness. So I am slowly redefining, to myself, the type of love that is necessary to exist in this country. I want love that creates language rather than erases it.
In discussions of our country, it is necessary to describe what associations, what love, we must have with it in order to survive. Whether our love should be passive or active, temporary or permanent. Whether it should be all-encompassing or specific, whether we look far or near. But I do know now that love for this country should not feel good, but it’s the kind that forces you to stay. It still stands when you walk out of the room, even if you move out of the country. It’s the kind that surpasses beauty because it survives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding into the Game on a wave of optimism, students said they were disappointed following Yale football's triumph over Harvard on Saturday, ending a nine-year winning streak and the Crimson's chance for an Ivy League title this year.
In the 133rd playing of the Game, Yale closed out in the final quarter with a 21-14 victory. The Crimson's failure was made all the more unexpected by the winning streak Harvard has enjoyed since 2006. Yale leads the overall series 66-59. The two schools have also tied on eight occasions.
Leading up to Saturday, many students said they were expecting the Crimson to continue their dominance over the Bulldogs. In preparation, the undergraduate humor magazine Satire V sold shirts with messages that included “Insanit-Y is playing the same team over and over again and expecting different results.”
Some students described Saturday’s loss as only the most recent twist in 2016, a year characterized by unexpected events like the election of Donald Trump to the presidency.
“My friend was comparing it to the Trump victory in the Electoral College, something that is so unexpected that it becomes so much more devastating,” said Rachel C. Sadoff ’19.
Natalie W. J. Hodges ’19 agreed.
“Given the series of events of the last couple weeks, it just felt like one more thing proving that this is the end of the world as we know it,” she said.
Although some students were surprised by the defeat, James M. A. Johnston ’17 said people need to “move on.”
“Obviously it’s not a great result, but that’s sport,” Johnston said. “You win some games, you lose some games and I think Harvard needs to come to terms with that we lose sometimes.”
Austin D. Shifflett ’20 said even though the result was disappointing, “Harvard-Yale is still a fun day, regardless.”
The football game capped off a spirited week for Harvard’s campus with organizations like the Undergraduate Council, College Events Board, and First-Year Social Committee planning events to build up enthusiasm for the Game. The Office of Student Life partnered with House Committees to organize gameday tailgates on Saturday morning.
Though students felt disappointed about the end of the nine-year winning streak, Nicholas R. Wheeler ’19 was still able to make jokes about Harvard’s rival university in New Haven.
“They go to a subpar school, so they’ll take any victory,” Wheeler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s custodial workers have voted to ratify the agreement their union reached with the University last week, ending a relatively short round of contract talks in comparison to some of Harvard’s other campus unions.
The workers voted 430-105 in favor of ratifying the contract, according to Eugenio H. Villasante, spokesperson for 32BJ SEIU—the regional union that represents Harvard’s custodial workers and some of its security guards. The new contract features modest wage increases and changes to the workers’ health benefits. Thirteen votes were voided because union representatives could not find the voters’ names in the union’s membership database, according to Villasante.
Under the new contract, wages for Harvard’s janitors will increase 12.5 percent by the end of the four-year life of the agreement, bringing the average salary of the union’s workers up to $24.61 from $21.89 per hour, according to a press release the union disseminated the night that the then-tentative agreement was reached. Additionally, the contract “includes language to promote full-time work.”
In terms of health care, the agreement “secures employer-paid” health benefits, according to the press release. Under the union’s current contract, SEIU workers do not receive their benefits directly from the University but rather from a fund SEIU maintains to which Harvard contributes.
SEIU has been bargaining with Harvard since Oct. 7, just days after Harvard’s dining services workers launched their 22-day strike. Their new contract will expire in four years.
Another campus union, Harvard University Security Parking and Museum Guards Union—which represents approximately 80 workers at Harvard’s Art Museums—is still in contract talks with the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve naked Yale students, baring all in a fit of school spirit, were escorted from Harvard Stadium by police during Saturday’s annual Harvard-Yale football game.
Near the end of the Game’s third quarter, at least a dozen Yale students stripped in front of hundreds of spectators, forcing a brief delay in play. Yale went on to win 21-14 in a shocking upset, ending Harvard’s nine-year victory streak and denying the Crimson a share of the Ivy League title. 
The students undressed as part of a tradition known as the “Saybrook Strip,” performed at many Yale football games by residents of the school's Saybrook College. The tradition dates back to the 1970s, when a Saybrook resident first mooned Harvard fans, according to the Yale Daily News.
This year, the Harvard University Police Department intervened. HUPD officers identified 12 naked Yale students who bared their genitals and escorted them outside Harvard Stadium, according to Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for the department.
Catalano said the officers released the students immediately after exiting the Stadium, and that the department will not take any “criminal enforcement action.”
“We will be sending the report down to Yale,” he said. “We share information, they’ll have to decide what to do.”
 Some Harvard students and alumni, still processing the Crimson’s unexpected loss as they passed through Harvard Square Saturday evening, expressed distaste for the students’ stripping.
"I thought it was quite stupid,” James M. A. Johnston ’17 said. “I mean, I get it's a bit of fun, a bit of ‘rah rah,’ and everyone's quite intoxicated, but at the end of the day you’ve got to realize what you are doing, and that's not going to be right along with everyone.”
Others said they thought the Yale students had crossed a line in exposing themselves at a public sporting event attended by families with children.
“I thought it was wildly inappropriate,” Harvard Law School student Alex Gazikas said. “This is supposed to be an event that’s for families, for kids, for everybody, and it was wildly inappropriate to put yourself in that position.”
Kamran Khan, an alumnus of Harvard's School of Public Health, agreed with Gazikas, though he said he thought the naked students were likely “having a good time.”
“I think that was unnecessary, because you have kids, families, things like that,” he said. “At the after-party, if you’re going to tout your victory, something like that, it would have been fine.”
Yale students took a different view. Reveling in their surprise victory, many Yale students milled around the Square in small groups Saturday night, occasionally breaking into celebratory chants.
Krzysztof W. Chwala, a freshman at Yale, said he had heard rumors about the Saybrook Strip before. He added that he had always thought the tradition seemed “really weird.”
“I wasn’t surprised it happened, per se, but when it did, it’s kind of just like, ‘You do you,’ I guess,” Chwala said. “I thought it was kind of funny.”
Yale freshmen Daniel Dager and Ines Ozonas said they also found the stunt amusing. Ozonas emphasized that the prank was meant “as a joke,” something “in-the-moment” and “not a big deal.”
“Plus, it just makes it harder to forget this game,” Ozonas said, smiling.
Dager said he thought the whole thing was “hilarious.”
“I enjoyed every second of it— one of my best friends was up there,” he said. “It was for a little bit longer than I expected, but, you know what, that just makes it more legendary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 1,000 current students and alumni of Harvard Business School signed a letter denouncing Stephen K. Bannon, a 1985 Business School graduate and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for chief strategist.
The letter, published in the New York Times, was written by Lauren M. Rourke and Ali Huberlie, who both graduated in 2015. The letter opposes Trump’s appointment of Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor, citing him as “one of the chief architects of the alt-right movement, a movement that preaches white nationalism, racism, misogyny, and hatred.” Bannon is the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a right-wing media company.
Rourke said in an interview the decision to write the letter came after Bannon’s appointment last week. While the authors said they felt parts of Trump’s platform in the aftermath of the election were agreeable, the business tycoon’s decision to involve Bannon in the administration worried them.
The letter had 650 signatures at the time of publishing on Nov. 18, according to Huberlie. Now, two days later, that number has more than doubled to 1,480.
“[Bannon] is not a man we can find common ground with,” Rourke said, adding that Trump’s claims to be President for “all Americans” are negated by Bannon’s appointment.
Specifically, the letter points to the “sinister” rhetoric of Breitbart—founded in 2007 with the stated purpose of challenging the “liberal media bias.”
“Breitbart frequently publishes articles that disparage women,” the authors of the letter wrote. The letter also blasts the media company’s attacks on “prominent women leaders,” including Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer and Business School alumna; the outlet published an article about her undergraduate senior thesis.
The appointment of Bannon to his new position “legitimizes and emboldens these voices— those of white nationalists and anti-feminists—the letter reads.
Rourke said the original edition of the letter, which was cut short in publishing, included a call for the Business School to respond.
“HBS frequently invites alumni to come speak with students, and we have had controversial leaders speak before, but Steve Bannon is not someone who should ever be invited to campus,” she said.
Huberlie said the larger goal of this letter was to remind HBS graduates that they have a they have a voice they can use “when they see something that is wrong.”
“Graduates from Harvard Business School are fortunate in that we can speak out without facing a lot of the consequences that many people do,” she said, adding that Bannon is someone “completely contrary to the values of HBS.”
Rourke said they sent the letter out in an online Google form to friends, asking them to sign it if they agreed with the spirit of the letter. She said they were hoping for 100 signatures and were “blown away by the response” as friends spread the letter to coworkers and other peers.
The signatures span 47 class years of Business School women, dating as far back as the MBA class of 1963.

UPDATED: November 21, 2016, at 2:38 p.m.
National Labor Relations Board officials have not yet begun counting the ballots of students who voted in last week’s union election due to the time-consuming process of sifting through challenges. The vote count process will resume Tuesday, according to union effort spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis.
Graduate student teaching and research assistants, as well as undergraduate teaching assistants, voted in the NLRB-supervised election on authorizing the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers last Wednesday and Thursday.
After voting in the historic election ended, ballot boxes were delivered to the NLRB regional building in Boston. They were expected to be unsealed and counted on Friday, after Harvard officials and graduate student union organizers came to an agreement on the challenged ballots.
The process is taking longer than expected, however. Harvard officials, graduate student organizers, and NLRB officials spent Friday sifting through challenged ballots one by one. Boston’s NLRB general attorney Gene M. Switzer estimated that there are roughly 3,500 total votes, and about 1,000 challenged ballots.
NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord said the logistics of this case complicated things. Although the Boston regional office has held much larger elections in the past, Harvard’s election spanned two days, three different locations, and ended late at night, preventing an immediate count.
For reasons of practicality, Redbord said officials do not begin a count unless they can finish it that day.
Graduate students sat alongside Harvard’s representatives from the Office of Labor and Employee Relations and the Office of the General Counsel as both sides commented on each challenged ballot—from name discrepancies, to voting at a different location than the one assigned, to voting without being on any voter list at all.
About 100 students voted under challenge due to a name discrepancy. Union organizer and Ph.D. student Sam S. Klug said the names of some students on the voter lists did not match their full legal names as noted on their IDs.
“We have basically a lot of avoidable problems that Harvard created with the list they gave us,” Klug said, adding that the HGSU-UAW made Harvard aware of this issue before the election.
But Erica F. Crystal, Harvard’s associate director of labor and employee relations, wrote in an email provided by University spokesperson Ann Hall that Harvard first learned of the name discrepancy issue on Wednesday, the first day of the election. According to Crystal, those students were able to vote and thus far, the “vast majority of those challenges were resolved.”
As of 3 p.m. on Friday, the parties were still discussing challenges, and had not yet gotten to the more difficult questions of eligibility. The parties could only use the room, an auditorium inside the Boston NLRB regional office, until 5 p.m, Switzer said.
About 300 of the total challenged ballots have to do with eligibility issues, Switzer estimated. If both parties do not agree on whether or not certain students are eligible to vote—such as Ph.D. students who are not currently teaching—the NLRB will need to hold a hearing and decide.
For example, one group under challenge are first-year Ph.D. students who do not currently work and are thus not part of the bargaining unit explicitly laid out by the election agreement signed by the University and HGSU-UAW. The agreement stipulates that the bargaining unit includes graduate student teaching and research assistants and undergraduate teaching assistants.
Ph.D. student Beryl B. Cummings argued that it “makes absolutely no sense” if first-year graduate student votes are not counted. They typically do not work as teaching assistants or research assistants but are expected to do so during their time at Harvard. In the sciences, students move into labs in their second year, and students in the social sciences and humanities are required to teach in their third and fourth years.
“If a contract happens, we’re all bound by that contract,” Cummings said. “By definition as a first year you’re the person who is going to have to live under the union or not the union for the longest time.”
Klug said he is “excited” about moving forward with the count.
“We so rarely have a voice in these kinds of decisions at Harvard and that was really inspiring for all of us, and I’m really proud of the work we did to put this together,” Klug said.
Massachusetts politicians have also expressed their support. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, along with four members of Congress from the Bay State, penned a statement Wednesday encouraging graduate students to vote in the union election, and cited October’s dining service worker strike as evidence of union success.
“Just last month, Harvard graduate students witnessed first-hand the benefits of collective bargaining when 750 union-represented Harvard cafeteria workers successfully negotiated for higher wages and more comprehensive health benefits,” the letter reads.

Donald Trump won the presidential election in an upset victory fueled by populist rhetoric, but it may have been less of a surprise for Kennedy School lecturer Pippa Norris.
This summer Norris authored a paper arguing that the recent rise of populism across the Western world can be attributed to a cultural backlash against progressive values. In her paper, Norris examines the popularity of Trump and the United Kingdom’s "Brexit"—the referendum decision to leave the European Union in June—in the context of rising populism in world politics.
"Trump’s angry	nativist	rhetoric	and	nationalistic appeal fits	the	wave	of	populist	leaders whose	support
has been	swelling in	many	Western	democracies," the paper argues.
Norris said that, after the recent presidential election, “there is tremendous uncertainty” in how President-elect Trump will shape the United States' foreign policy.
Co-written by University of Michigan professor Ronald F. Inglehart, the paper focuses “public opinion and whether or not populist leaders and their rhetoric actually appeal to the public,” Norris said in an interview.
“The U.S. has come kind of late to the table,” Norris said. “There are many other countries where mainstream parties have really pushed [populism] forward in Austria, in France, in the Netherlands, and even in Sweden.”
Populism in the U.S. is notably “unexpected partly because the American political system is one with high hurdles for minor parties,” which include “electoral hurdles, campaign-finance hurdles, [and] media hurdles,” Norris said.
According to Norris, the general sentiments that propelled populism beyond those obstacles are, for the most part, dissatisfaction with the establishment alongside the “rising tide of progressive ideals.”
Norris emphasized the continued role of the U.S. as an important leader in promoting democracy and influencing other nations.
“Other authoritarian regimes are going to take advantage if America no longer tries to protect human rights and presses forward democracy promotion,” she said.
The paper has received generally positive feedback in the past few weeks.
Norris and Inglehart “are surely correct that these movements are in some respects a cultural revolt against post-materialist values,” Peter A. Hall, a government professor who specializes in European studies, wrote in an email. “I think this is also a revolt against the neoliberal policies and rising levels of inequality that have accompanied globalization.”
Others have claimed that recent world events have the potential to significantly alter how academia approaches the study of populism.
“I think the challenge posed by populism is that the current variants include sustained critiques of the academy,” government professor and incoming University professor Danielle S. Allen wrote in an email. “College and universities will find themselves not only needing to continue the business of studying the world but also of rebuilding understanding about why and how we do that.”
Norris and Inglehart, who have already written three books together, will further develop this research in an upcoming book, Norris said.

Undergraduate Council President-elect Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President-elect Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 plan to create a “multicultural cabinet,” establish UC caucuses for underrepresented groups, and mandate annual sexual assault prevention training workshops after assuming leadership of the UC next semester. 
Sachee and Khansarinia were elected last week to lead next year’s Council, in a contentious race against three other tickets: Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18.
Of the 3,042 undergraduates who voted in the election, 44 percent ranked Sachee and Khansarinia as their first choice. Thirty-four percent ranked Gonzalez and Popovski first, 17 percent ranked Ely and Bonsall first, and six percent ranked Solomon and Moore first.
Establishing a multicultural cabinet was one of several initiatives on Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign platform, with the aim of involving cultural group leaders in decisions made by the UC and in conversations with College administrators.
“We want to create this multicultural cabinet to make sure we're reaching out to as many student voices as possible, so they can be included in the very many important conversations that are going to be happening next semester,” Sachee said in an interview with The Crimson Sunday, the pair’s first since their election.
Sachee and Khansarinia also said they plan to work with student groups to help them create “freshman bridge programs” with the goal of making first-year students feel welcome on campus after Opening Days.
Sachee said she and Khansarinia would consider re-purposing some of the funding from this year’s new Grant for an Open Harvard College to help fund such bridge programs. Khansarinia said he and Sachee were considering other ways that the grant’s money could be better utilized.
Khansarinia also said he and Sachee wanted to create formal caucuses on the Council for underrepresented minorities. Khansarinia sponsored legislation earlier this semester to establish caucuses on the UC, but the legislation ultimately did not pass. Current UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 voted against the legislation, with Banks criticizing it as creating unnecessary “layers” of bureaucracy.
Sachee and Khansarinia said their highest long-term priority is to establish a mandatory annual sexual assault prevention training workshops for all undergraduates. Sexual assault prevention was a key focus of all of this year’s presidential tickets, with many candidates proposing strategies to address sexual assault prevention.
“The very first conversation with Dean Khurana we have, that's going to be the focus of the conversation,” Khansarinia said.
Earlier this fall, the College rolled out a mandatory online sexual assault prevention training module.
Sachee said her administration will focus on providing more resources to organizations like Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
“They don't have enough funding and they don't have the resources,” Sachee said. “We're also going to be in constant conversations with CARE and OSAPR to figure out what their needs are.”
Other platform initiatives—including a “Q Guide” for student organization comp processes and a textbook buyback and exchange program—are also on the pair’s agenda for the semester.
During the interview Sunday, Sachee and Khansarinia addressed an allegation of voter coercion which delayed the results of the UC presidential election by more than three hours. Sachee and Khansarinia emphasized that the allegation was untrue, and that the independent UC Election Commission voted unanimously that there was no evidence to substantiate the allegation.
“We were very pleased that the record was cleared and the record was set straight. It's important for us to focus not on these incorrect claims but on getting things done for the student body,” Khansarinia said.

UPDATED: November 21, 2016, at 10:06 a.m.
Three College seniors and one graduate of the Class of 2016 will receive the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the most prestigious and competitive in the world, the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
Spencer D. Dunleavy '17, Nancy Ko '17,  Maia R. Silber ’17 and  Anthony Wilder L. Wohns ’16, will join the ranks of Harvard’s 355 previous Rhodes Scholars in the scholarship’s 114-year history. Harvard will send the most representatives of any university in the U.S. for the second year in a row.
The scholarship traditionally pays for two or three years of study at the University of Oxford in England.
“It was really rewarding and I was really grateful,” said Dunleavy. “I wanted to just really reach out to everyone that got me there and thank them for all their support.”
Harvard’s four recipients are among 32 that were selected from the United States, and the University is among 25 higher institutions represented by the finalists.
For consideration by the Rhodes Trust, applicants must be endorsed by their college or university. According to the Trust, around 2,500 students sought endorsements from their institution this year, and only 882 of these requests were granted by a total of 311 colleges and universities nationwide.
The selection process requires that finalists travel to in-person final interviews in the region from which they apply. Finalists convene in that venue directly following their interviews and wait for hours while deliberators decide on the two who will be named from that region, Harvard's Rhodes recipients said.
Silber, who is a chair of The Crimson's Fifteen Minutes magazine, said she had her interview on Saturday in Boston at 8 a.m., and spent the rest of the day waiting with her fellow finalists until the announcement came around 3 p.m.
Silber concentrates in History and Literature, with a focus on 19th century reform movements, such as abolitionism, women’s rights and temperance. Silber said she hopes to study these movements from a “transatlantic perspective” at Oxford, where she will pursue a Masters of Philosophy in British and European History focusing from 1500 to the present.
Ko, another recipient, said she applied despite doubting herself as being the right fit for the scholarship. She said hearing of her win was “exhilarating.”
She will study at Oxford for a Master of Philosophy in Modern Middle Eastern Studies. Ko grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., where she was “surrounded by Jewish life and culture,” which motivated her to focus her academic pursuits around Judaism. Ko is currently concentrating in History and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and writing a thesis on Jews in Iran in the early 1900s.
“The Rhodes nomination is as much a reflection on the people around us, the people who raised us, as it is a reflection of the scholars themselves,” Ko said.
Dunleavy, a Chemistry concentrator, will study at Oxford for degrees in education and primary health care. Dunleavy, who is also applying to medical school, where he still plans to go following his time at Oxford, said he was not planning to apply for the scholarship until Roger B. Porter, his faculty dean in Dunster House, managed to convince him, with some effort, to apply.
For Dunleavy, receiving a Rhodes scholarship was never something he imagined happening to him.
“I grew up with parents who didn't go to a four-year college, knew nothing about this, had never heard of Oxford. Most of my family, even now, don’t know what Oxford is,” Dunleavy said.
Wohns, who is already currently studying in England at the University of Cambridge on Harvard’s Herchel Smith Fellowship, graduated earlier this year with a degree, summa cum laude, in Human Evolutionary Biology and a secondary in Computer Science.
Wohns said his middle name “Wilder,” which he goes by, led him to make it a goal to apply for the scholarship. He was named after Wilder G. Penfield, a pioneering neurosurgeon in the early 20th century who was a Rhodes scholar. Wohns grew up being inspired by Penfield’s life story, he said.
“Seeing that a Rhodes scholarship was such a big part of his life—that’s when I first heard about it, and it’s always been a goal of mine since then,” Wohns said.

CORRECTION: November 21, 2016
A previous headline of this article incorrectly identified recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship as winners of the 2016 prize. In fact, recipients were named 2017 Rhodes Scholars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A win is a win, but Friday night’s 57-52 triumph for Harvard women’s basketball (2-1) was not pretty. The Crimson seemed determined to make its own life as hard as possible, turning a comfortable lead into an ultimately nail-biting win over Samford (1-2) at Lavietes Pavilion.
“It wasn’t our best game, but we got the [win], which is what matters most,” said freshman point guard Katie Benzan, tied for the game’s lead scorer with 16 points.
On a weekend where the football team fell to Yale in “The Game,” the women’s basketball team struggled to put away another set of Bulldogs. Despite trailing by as many as 14 points late in the third quarter, Samford took advantage of loose play from Harvard to cut the lead to 1 midway through the final quarter.
Late buckets from captain Destiny Nunley and junior forward Kirby Porter helped along with two high-pressure Benzan free throws saved the Crimson’s blushes despite the visitors’ late run.
“We got outworked. Every player on the other team outworked us pretty consistently throughout the whole game,” said head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who cut a frustrated figure after the game. “This was as bad as our worst practice. I’m pretty disappointed in my team, I did not expect them to do this.”
Harvard started well, taking advantage of space on the outside as the Bulldogs’ guards collapsed into the paint to deny the Crimson’s forwards, Nunley and freshman Jeannie Boehm, the opportunity to catch and turn. The bench was especially effective late in the first quarter, with sophomore guard Madeline Raster hitting a three before junior forward Taylor Rooks put in a couple of baskets to stretch the home team’s lead to seven.
Delaney-Smith continued rotating heavily to keep players fresh, and Harvard was active on defense; Samford did not record its first field goal of the second quarter until the 4:16 mark, a triple by leading scorer Hannah Nichols sandwiched between a pair of Benzan threes. The Crimson continued to struggle inside, though, recording just seven two-point field goals in the first half. Six first-half three-pointers, however, ensured that the home side entered the halftime locker room with a 32-23 lead.
“Yes [our forwards] were having a hard game inside, but [Samford] was doubling down,” Benzan said, “so [the forwards] weren’t going to have their best game and we knew that coming in. We knew we had to look for the kickout and maybe get a drive or hit a three.”
The third quarter continued in similar fashion, with the Bulldogs unable to find any sort of offensive consistency. A pair of Benzan free throws after her fourth three-pointer of the game gave Harvard a 14-point lead, its largest lead of the game, with just 1:11 remaining in the frame.
The fourth quarter, however, saw a complete reversal of momentum. Junior guard Kassidy Belvins scored six points in the first three minutes of the quarter as part of a 13-2 run by the visitors, cutting the Crimson’s lead to 50-49.
With the game on a knife edge, Nunley took matters into her own hands, stealing an inbounds pass and then going down the floor and knocking in a crucial jumper. Porter would then hit a layup to stretch Harvard’s lead to six, and although Belvins’ three-pointer gave the visitors a brief glimpse of hope with seven seconds remaining, Benzan calmly strolled stroked both free throws at the line to put the game to the bed.
Despite the win and gritty final minutes, Delaney-Smith was not appeased.
“Poor execution on offense, very grey early shot selection,” the thirty-five year program head remarked. “Nothing, no connection between players, nothing. There’s nothing I recognized about my team tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Decade-long streaks weren’t only snapped on the gridiron this weekend in Cambridge.
One night before Yale’s football team surprisingly spoiled Saturday, the icemen from Harvard also tried the streak-stopper role on for size. Up against a third-ranked Boston College team it had not beaten at home since 2006, the No. 11/10 Crimson exploded for five goals—including three third-period tallies within a single minute—en route to a 5-2 victory at a sold-out Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
That single minute transformed a back-and-forth contest into a trouncing. In a span of 49 seconds, all three members of the Crimson’s solely senior second line lit the lamp, paving the way for Harvard (5-1-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) to hand No. 3 BC (10-3-1, 5-0-1 Hockey East) its first defeat in over a month.
Just as a Crimson power play—one on the tail end of a Harvard 5-on-3—was set to expire early in the third period, Luke Esposito kicked off the rapid rally with a scrappy conversion amid a scrum in front of freshman goaltender Joe Woll, putting the Crimson up, 3-1.
Before play even had a chance to restart, the officials whistled the Eagles’ Casey Fitzgerald for roughing, sending Harvard’s power play unit right back onto the ice. And Tyler Moy made BC pay, ripping a slapper from the top of the right faceoff circle over Woll’s glove to make it 4-1. Sixteen seconds later, Sean Malone poked another loose puck past Woll, bringing the rookie’s night to a premature close.
“I thought Harvard played better than we did tonight,” BC coach Jerry York said. “They were just a little more intense, just a little quicker than we were…. I was really impressed with Harvard’s team. I’m sure we’ll see them later on during the year, so it’s our objective to be better the next time we play them.”
If the two sides do meet again this season, it would have to be either in the second round of the Beanpot or in the NCAA tournament, where the Eagles ended the Crimson’s 2015-2016 campaign with a 4-1 opening-round victory back in March.
Earlier in the week, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 deflected talk about the last meeting, preaching how each year’s a new year. But presenting a different perspective after the game, Moy revealed that the contest in March was “definitely” on everyone’s mind and that playing well against BC is something members of the team “take pride in.”
“It’s a bitter taste in your mouth when they ended our season last year, so we were coming back for vengeance,” Moy said. “We put together a good effort. Everyone knew what was on the line here.”
Moy, who leads the Crimson with 11 points through seven games, finished with two goals on the night. In addition to his power-play strike in the third, Harvard’s player of the game—a designation confirmed by the hat Moy wore at the podium—notched the go-ahead goal late in the second period.
With the score even at one, Malone threw a shot at Woll from behind the net that somehow slipped through the freshman’s pads. Standing all alone by the opposite post was Moy, who tapped in perhaps the easiest 5-on-5 goal of his career to put the Crimson up, 2-1.

That goal gave Harvard its first lead of the night. The Eagles had jumped in front six minutes prior thanks to persistence in front of the Crimson net from BC sophomore Christopher Brown. Junior goaltender Merrick Madsen was sharp for most of Friday, making a season-high 33 saves, but he was left with no shot of stopping Brown’s second-chance opportunity atop the crease at 10:23.
But three minutes later, an “outstanding play” from freshman defenseman Adam Fox in the eyes of Donato evened the score at one. With the puck on his stick in the slot, Fox delivered an extra pass to the far post, where junior Seb Lloyd misfired but co-captain Alexander Kerfoot bailed him out, using his quick hands to slip the puck inside the pipe from just behind the net.
Donato said he felt the Fox to Kerfoot connection gave his bench life and led his side to start moving the puck better and create more opportunities. Harvard went on to outshoot the Eagles, 19-10, in that middle frame.
Subsequently, the floodgates finally opened in period three. The Crimson’s two power-play goals 33 seconds apart helped the hosts finish 3-for-7 on the man advantage—a monumental improvement for a unit that previously had been just 2-for-17 since its opening weekend against Arizona State.
The special teams success proved to be enough to dethrone BC, marking another significant step forward for the Harvard program, which had lost 12 of its last 13 matchups against its rival from Chestnut Hill. Not one to be fixated by the past, however, Donato simply joked after the game about how the Crimson’s hardly been BC’s only victim.
“I think they’ve been the best team in college hockey over the last 15 years,” Donato said. “So anybody that’s not had their struggles with them, I’d like to meet.”
GAME NOTES
—Harvard successfully killed 5-of-6 penalties on the night, including a 5-on-3 that lasted for more than a minute towards the end of the opening period. Prior to Friday, opponents not hailing from Arizona had been converting at a 35 percent clip against the Crimson.
"When you play the game, you’re looking for opportunities to get momentum," Moy said. "We have a lot of guys who can kill penalties here. And I think when you sacrifice your body, you get in front of shots, and get pucks out, it’s really something you can build off of as a team. And I think we did that well."
—Sophomore forward Ryan Donato looked sharp on the attacking end yet again on Friday, logging a whopping six shots on goal in the second period alone. He leads the team with 32 through seven games.
—While Harvard won the shots on goal battle, 38-35, the Eagles out-attempted the hosts, 68-61. This was just the second time this season that the Crimson has surrendered more attempts than it has generated (Nov. 11 at Princeton).
—The result marked Harvard's first victory over a top-five team since Nov. 29, 2014, when it beat No. 4 UMass Lowell on the road. Four days earlier, the Crimson had also knocked off No. 1 Boston University at Agganis Arena, where Harvard will play the Terriers this coming Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team prides itself on its depth. The Crimson can consistently rely on athletes across the team to produce results, and that fact was demonstrated clearly in Harvard’s second Ivy League meet of the year.
Double-digit Crimson swimmers picked up wins on Friday as Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) toppled Columbia (2-2, 2-1) in decisive fashion, 190-102, at Blodgett Pool. The result extends the Crimson’s run of victories over the Lions to 11 in a row.
“Overall, we had a great meet and improved on our performance from last week against Dartmouth and Cornell,” co-captain Eric Ronda said. “This meet really displayed both our depth as a team as well as our ability to post some very fast times for this point in the season.”
Harvard came out firing early in the meet and never looked back, sweeping the podium in the first two events of the day.
In the opening race, the 200 medley relay, the Crimson’s A, B, and C lineups all beat out Columbia’s top squad. Juniors Koya Osada and Shane McNamara, senior Max Yakubovich, and freshman Dean Farris took top marks with a time of 1:29.14. The B lineup of sophomore Daniel Tran, freshman Daniel Chang, and juniors Steven Tan and Ed Kim finished second, with co-captains Mitchell Foster and Ronda, sophomore Sebastian Lutz, and senior Paul O’Hara rounding out the podium in third.
Harvard maintained its momentum in the next event, taking the top three spots in the 1000 freestyle. Sophomore Brennan Novak touched the wall first, 11 seconds ahead of sophomore Logan Houck and 21 seconds in front of junior Kent Haeffner, who ended up second and third, respectively.
The Crimson would not lose an event until halfway through the meet, when Columbia junior Jayden Pantel, who won both the one-meter and three-meter dives at last year’s Ivy League Championships, took first place in the three-meter event with 404.18 points. Junior Bobby Ross ended up a distant second with a score of 330.3, narrowly edging out Lions freshman Shinya Condo by .3 points.
Pantel also won the one-meter dive later in the day. Ross finished in second place, and freshman Austin Fields picked up a third-place result to round out the podium.
Overall, Harvard took top marks in 12 of 16 events, also posting race-best times in exhibition heats in the final two events of the meet. The Crimson’s success came on the back of a team-wide effort, with Harvard swimmers from each class picking up wins.
Farris continued an impressive start to his debut season with a victory in the 200 freestyle. Freshman Zach Snyder came in third place, three seconds behind his fellow first-year. Farris would pick up top marks in the 100 freestyle as well, as Kim finished second.
Chang also had a strong meet, notching a solo win in the 200 breaststroke in a time of 2:00.18. McNamara would touch the wall less than half a second behind the freshman to finish second.
Not to be outdone, Snyder continued the run of victories by Crimson rookies with a win in the 500 freestyle. Novak touched the wall third in the event.
“We have an extremely talented freshman class that has integrated well into the team and understands our mission this year,” Ronda said.
The team’s upperclassmen contributed strong results as well, starting with Osada, who chipped in a win in the 100 backstroke. Sophomores Jack Manchester and Tran finished in a dead heat in the event to share second place.
The sophomore pair would face off again in the 200 backstroke, as Tran edged out Manchester by three tenths of a second to pick up an individual victory of his own.
Elsewhere, in the 100 breaststroke, McNamara and Chang reversed their order from the 200 breast, with the junior coming out ahead of the freshman for first and second places, respectively.
Harvard collected a string of one-two finishes to cement the win, as Tan and Lutz took the top two places in the 50 freestyle, Tan and Yakubovich replicated the result in the 100 butterfly, and senior Christian Carbone and Yakubovich did the same in the 200 butterfly.
Despite the dominant nature of the win, the Crimson is not getting ahead of itself.
“Today's results were good, but something we've stressed this season in particular is a rejection of complacency,” Yakubovich said. “While we're definitely experiencing some positive momentum from the meet today, it's important to never get overconfident and to continue looking for ways to get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson’s rookie wrestlers continued to make their presence known this weekend as the team took the mats at the Keystone Invitational. In his second collegiate competition, Hunter Ladnier notched a sixth place finish at 149 pounds, while his classmate AJ Jaffe recorded a multiple win day for the Crimson as well.
“Hunter was impressive again this week,” Johnson said.  “Because he's so dangerous from top, he can really open up matches better than most people.  He fought for every point, whether he got it or not.”
Ladnier finished the day with a 4-3 record. The rookie started the day with a loss to Drexel’s Matt Cimato. Ladnier bounced back from this initial setback, winning his next four matches before falling in the fifth place match to Eastern Michigan’s Nick Barber, 8-2.
Meanwhile, Jaffe opened strong for the Crimson, winning his first two matches. In his third match of the day, Pittsburgh’s Robert Lee ended the Jaffe’s streak. From there, Jaffe dropped his next two matches.
Posting 48 points, the Crimson had the second highest tally of any Eastern conference competitor. 11 wrestlers earned points for Harvard, while five athletes won multiple matches for the squad.
Following this trend, junior co-captain Josef Johnson also built on his performance from last week, appearing on the podium again for the Crimson. Johnson posted a 6-1 record on the day, with his most decisive victory coming at the end. In the bronze medal match for the 174 pound division, Johnson managed to keep his opponent off the scoreboard for the entirety of the match, and claimed third place with a final score of 6-0.
“As the day progressed, I gained a lot more confidence in my offense and that showed in how much more potent it was later on,” Johnson said. “I wrestled two opponents twice today and my second matches with both of them were much more dominant. I think I finally had glimpses of my potential when I'm fully locked in, and I'm very hopeful to build from there and channel the that going forward.”
In the heavyweight division, Senior Nick Gajdzik also contributed to the Crimson’s top ten performance. Appalachian State’s Denzel Dejournette ended Gajdzik’s championship run, shutting the senior out 6-0. Following this loss, Gajdzik entered the match for third place with a 3-1 record. He was unable to find his momentum again, and lost by decision, 4-2 to Drexel’s Joey Goodhart.
“Nick will be the first person to tell you he could've wrestled better in his losses,” Johnson said. “But I think today was a very positive day for him. He showed his ability to dominate and control matches. He was dictating the pace of his matches, which goes a long way.”

Capping an already historic season, the Harvard men’s water polo team claimed gold in Northeast Water Polo Conference tournament for the first time in the history of the program, and secured a spot in the NCAA Championships.
Traveling to Princeton’s Denuizio Pool, the team now has won 11 of their last 12 games following their victories against MIT, Princeton and Brown.
HARVARD 11, BROWN 7
Securing an 11-7 victory in the NWPC championship matchup against No. 10 Brown (22-8, 8-2), No. 11 Harvard (25-6, 7-3 NWPC) matched the most wins in program history since 2001.
“Against Brown we put together a full 4 quarter team effort top to bottom,” said junior captain utility Harry Tafur. “We stuck to our game plan and everyone gave 100 percent effort for all 32 minutes. It was a great team win.”
Harvard played the Bears twice this season, losing the first meeting 9-7 and taking the second 9-8. This time though, a 3-0 first quarter start distanced Harvard from Brown in the opening minutes. The three-point lead was extended through the half as the teams went to their locker rooms with Harvard up 7-4.
An early second half goal brought the Bears within two but from there Harvard would continue to extend their lead. Three straight goals, two from Tafur and another from sophomore attacker Grayson Judge took the lead to four. Sophomore attacker Nick Bunn tallied the final point for the 11-7 victory.
On the defensive side of the ball, senior attacker Noah Harrison had two steals and two field blocks. Sophomore goalie Anthony Ridgley added three steals and an assist in addition to six stops.
“It was a true team defensive effort,” said senior two-meter defender Dan Stevens. “Every single person on the team contributed; it was a great team win.”
HARVARD 14, PRINCETON 13
In the semifinal matchup Saturday against No. 12 Princeton (18-9, 8-2), Harvard edged by with the 14-13 victory. The competition represents the third time the teams have faced off and with the win, Harvard extended to 2-1 in the series. Harvard took the first matchup, 8-7 and the Tigers the second, 11-10.
“Our team defense was outstanding,” Ridgley said. “Our depth has been a strength all year and that was highlighted this weekend as we had production on offense and defense from everyone on the roster.”
Goals by senior attacker Noah Harrison, junior utility Colin Chiapello and freshman attacker Charlie Owens in the first quarter led Harvard to take the early 3-2 lead. Five more goals by each team led to an 8-7 Harvard advantage at the half.
For the duration of third quarter the two teams matched scores with three apiece. It wasn’t until the fourth quarter that Princeton took their first lead of the matchup. Down 13-12 in the fourth, Harvard’s captain attacker Joey Colton scored the tying goal with only two minutes left. With less than a minute left, Colton then replicated the previous goal, securing the victory.
Chiapello led Harvard in points with three while Colton had two of his own with 3 assists. Ridgley matched quarterfinal performance with ten saves.
“We've really gelled together as a family,” Tafur said. “We hold each other accountable for our mistakes which pushes us to work harder and not let each other down. We all found our roles and put it together for the end.”
HARVARD 14, MIT 8
In their first match of the tournament, Harvard took on the Engineers (10-14, 1-9). The contest represented the third time the two squads have met, with Harvard taking the first two 11-8 and 12-3. After a slow start Friday night, Harvard advanced to the semifinal round with a clean 14-8 win. The game started out close, with a low scoring first quarter and tied 2-2 scoreboard early in the second quarter.
From that point forward, the game was all Crimson. The remainder of the half featured a 4-1 run by Harvard, extending their lead to three. The beginning of the third quarter built upon this run with four consecutive goals.
Leading in scores for Harvard were senior attacker Noah Harrison with four, Colton with two, and freshman attacker Austin Sechrest with a pair of his own. On the defensive side of the ball Ridgley racked up tallied ten saves.
The three victories guarantee Harvard a spot in the 2016 NCAA Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The reign of dominance finally came to an end. Yale beat Harvard in football.
A Crimson win was supposed to be a sure thing. After all, the program had lost a mere four games over the last four seasons. By beating the Bulldogs (3-7, 3-4 Ivy), Harvard could have earned a fourth-straight Ivy League title for the first time in school history.
But as 2016 has indicated time and again, no outcome is certain. The Crimson (7-3, 5-2 Ivy) has played an inconsistent season, defined by injuries, defensive lapses, and a hot-and-cold offense. Such inconsistency showed this weekend.
At times against Yale, Harvard looked like the best team in the Ancient Eight. But at the end of the afternoon, timely plays by the Bulldogs and costly mistakes by the Crimson resulted in Harvard’s first defeat to Eli’s men in a decade.
OFFENSIVE FIREPOWER SILENCED
The most obvious deficit that the Crimson showed on Saturday was a lack of offensive firepower.
Especially in early play, Harvard seemed set on punishing the Yale defense with its rushing attack. In the first quarter, the Crimson threw the ball exactly once—this meager production despite the fact that Harvard averaged almost 250 passing yards per game this season and featured two of the league’s best pass-catchers in senior halfback Anthony Firkser and sophomore receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley.
Still, senior quarterback Joe Viviano ended the half with 34 yards on a two-for-nine performance. Meanwhile, the Yale defense bottled up the Crimson’s run game. Harvard was forced to punt five times in the first 30 minutes.
“We felt like we really had to get the ground game running to be able to sort of open it up, which is what we eventually did,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “But I think the bottom line is, we felt like we had to have a balanced attack, and we’ve thrown the ball a good deal the last couple of games.”
The offense did find more balance in the second half, but by that point, it was too late. The Yale defense was locked in on Harvard’s rushing attack, and the secondary was fresh. Viviano ended the game 16-of-28 for 181 yards and a touchdown, far below his average of nearly 225 yards a game. Overall, the Crimson totaled 329 yards on offense. For comparison, Harvard’s season average was 390.
FOURTH TIME’S THE CHARM
Statistically the Crimson and the Bulldogs looked equal throughout the game. Yale punted eight times, Harvard six. The defenses of both teams held strong, allowing less than 330 yards to the opposing offenses.
Nonetheless a lot of mistakes hurt the Crimson on Saturday. For one, six of Yale’s 20 first downs came off penalties by the Harvard defense. In addition, the Bulldogs’ special teams outplayed the Crimson, as highlighted by a successful onside kick to open the second half and a missed field goal by Harvard.
However, one factor stood above all others: Yale was perfect on fourth down. Late in the second quarter, with Harvard leading 7-0, Yale drove the ball down to the Crimson 19. The secondary shut down the Bulldogs, and the Yale kicking team trotted on the field to attempt a field goal on fourth-and-four.
However, as soon as holder Andrew Johnson got the snap, he ran towards the line of scrimmage and threw a jump pass to senior tight end Leo Haenni. The Bulldogs scored four plays later. Later in the game, Yale converted on a fourth-and-one that set up another touchdown.
This is not to say that Harvard didn’t make big plays. Shelton-Mosley picked up a huge gain on fourth-and-three to set up Crimson’s first touchdown. However, Yale’s timely conversions gave the visitors much needed momentum.
“I just think that when you get in a game like this, it comes down to making plays,” Yale coach Tony Reno said. “We were able to make some plays,”
NO MORE STREAKING
For the first time in four years, the Harvard football team will not win at least a share of the Ivy League championship. Moreover, for the first time since 2006, the Crimson lost to Yale.
“It’s heartbreaking for our seniors because they had a chance to win an Ivy championship,” Murphy said. “It’s heartbreaking for our seniors because at the end of the day this game is about pride. As I’ve said before, [it’s] pride in our team, pride in our program, and certainly pride in our school first and foremost.”
What’s interesting is the way in which the streak ended. In most fans’ eyes, this playing of The Game felt like a sure victory for Harvard. The Crimson was 7-2 coming into the clash, with its only losses coming to non-conference foe Holy Cross and eventual Ivy League champion Penn. Yale, on the other hand, was 2-7 and starting a rookie quarterback on the road. However, none of that mattered between the sidelines on Saturday.
“It really teaches the young guys how to be leaders,” Yale freshman quarterback Kurt Rawlings said. “It’s the start of something new. There’s been a long streak; we didn’t really like to talk about it. But it’s over. Now it’s our streak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Racing in Terre Haute, Indiana against 250 of the top collegiate female runners, junior Courtney Smith finished of her successful cross-country season with a 35th place finish at the NCAA Cross Country National Championships.
Smith’s finish was the best Harvard mark since Suzanne Jones ‘91 crossed the mark in 37th place in the 1988 edition of the event. Because of her top-40 NCAA Championship finish, Smith earned USTFCCCA All-America honors, the second All-America award the Westchester, Pa. native has received. She is the sixth Harvard runner to become an All-American in the program history and the first since Lindsey Scherf ‘08 obtained the recognition her freshman campaign in 2004.
The Crimson came in 26th place overall with 551 points, again making history. This was the Harvard team’s best finish since 1983, when the team finished 13th out of a total 16 teams. The Crimson also made the national field for only the fourth time in program history, joining the 1982, 1983 and 2012 squads.
“We were a young team this year and still made history for Harvard,” Smith said. “This makes me even more excited for the potential and seasons to come.”
Starting off the race in the lead pack with the nation’s top young runners, Smith battled the harshly cold and windy condition to finish in 20:21.1 but was unable to capitalize on a strong start. After clocking in among the lead pack at the first split, Smith slowly dropped back just behind the leaders up to the third split where she sat at 17th. Unfortunately, the junior dropped 18 spots before the final 6k mark but was still able to secure the top-40 position.
Smith’s trajectory closely mirrored the team’s as well, as Harvard sat in eighth place and within striking distance of a podium finish at the first split as the scoring contingent all fell within the top-80. By the second split, the Crimson had dropped to 14th before making a slight comeback to 11th at the third split, ultimately falling to 26th.
In addition to Smith’s All-American finish, sophomore Erin Dietz placed 137th with a time of 20:59.0. Finishing their first season of collegiate racing, freshman Lisa Tertsch was right behind Deitz in 21:00.9 claiming 141st place overall, while classmate Judy Pendergast, usually the Crimson’s No.2 runner, finished 176th in 21:14.0. Junior Elianna Shwayder was the Crimson’s fifth scorer, finishing in  191st place with a time of 21:23.0.
This is the process we have been trusting,” Shwayder said. “Confidence, focus, the grind and some grit”
Karissa Schweizer of Missouri reached the finish first in 19:41.6, becoming the individual champion after unleashing a monster kick that separated her from the lead pack as they came down the chute with 250 meters left. She was followed by Erin Finn of Michigan and Anna Rohrer of Notre Dame who came in second and third with close times of 19:44.2 and 19:44.6 respectively.
Oregon, Michigan and Colorado claimed the top three overall scores, with the Ducks edging out the Wolverines by a mere point. Unlike Heps, the Crimson was unable to defeat all of the Ivy opponents in the field as Penn finished with 520 points to claim a 24th place finish. Yale finished second-to-last with 661.
While Harvard was unable to match its ranking going into the meet–the women were ranked 17th in the latest USTFCCCA poll and 12 in FloTrack’s Saucony Flo50 Poll–getting to Nationals is promising for the future. Given all five runners in the Crimson’s scoring contingent will return for at least one more year and the program boasts a strong recruiting class, Harvard could barely be cracking the surface of its potential.
“I think even though the season is over now, we feel like we've built some really awesome things,” Smith said. “The relationships, memories, friendships will continue on.”
