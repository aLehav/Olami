There was something almost eerie about rereading Emily St. John Mandel’s 2014 novel “Station Eleven” in 2021. The novel follows a societal collapse after a deadly virus sweeps the world. It’s not just the almost prophetic nature of the novel that I found haunting, but St. John Mandel’s prose itself, which is full of lines that rattled around in my head for weeks. One of these lines comes towards the end of the book when an actress in the traveling Shakespeare troupe the story centers around, recounts a conversation from the early years of the pandemic when she was still a kid. She remembers the friend telling her that Shakespeare was defined by the plague, then asking her if she knows what it means to be “defined by something.” In the present-day Kirsten responds to this years-old question, quoting the book of Revelation — “Yes. There was a new heaven and a new earth.”
I originally finished reading “Station Eleven” the second week of March of 2019, which stands out to me as a marker — the first day of my last year “before,” inaugurated through fiction. I remember being really touched by the novel, even crying at parts, which seems strange in retrospect — that this book would have such resonance with me even before my life began to mirror its events. While this novel isn’t entirely similar to our real-world pandemic, notes about the changing nature of normalcy that are apparent in “Station Eleven” will ring true for anyone living in the drastically changing present world.
Part of what struck me then was how the novel depicted the process of moving on from something. The first time I read the book, I was a senior in high school, about to graduate and leave the boarding school I had called home for the past four years. I was desperate for something new, and simultaneously in shock that this chapter of my life was ending, that my known world was closing around me. I felt excitement, certainly, but also loss and fear. In March of 2019, as I read, I underlined a character’s pre-pandemic description of his childhood home, “It was gorgeous and claustrophobic. I loved it and I always wanted to escape.”
In A March 2020 INTERVIEW, Emily St. John Mandel described how she had been inspired to write “Station Eleven” by her “terrible awareness of the fragility of civilization.” “All of this,” she continued, “ we take for granted. It’s unsettling to realize how quickly this falls apart.”
“Station Eleven” received a lot of attention last spring, as, in the light of uncertainty, people turned to fiction for answers. Having reread this book since the pandemic started, I’m not sure “Station Eleven” is all that good of an allegory for our current times. While there certainly are parallels between the spread of the fictional “Georgia Flu” and Covid-19, the similarities end there. As devastating as Covid-19 has been, the novel’s post-apocalyptic landscape and decimated societies are far worse than anything we have experienced.
Moreover, “Station Eleven” is not really about the virus, as much as it is about the loss and change. About half of the novel is situated before the collapse of society, following the beginnings and ends of marriages, careers, and friendships. These stories are told throughout the novel, interspersed within the narrative of the acting troupe’s journey through their post-apocalyptic society. The effect of this shift is not to diminish the seriousness of the character’s pre-pandemic problems but to show more precisely how strange and fragile every facet of our lives are, from the macro to the minuscule.
In the novel, loss itself is not a beautiful thing, but the recognition that life can fall apart is the key to understanding its worth. “What was lost in the collapse,” the book asks, “almost everything, almost everyone, but there is still such beauty.”
When I first read “Station Eleven,” I had just begun to gain that “terrible awareness of fragility” that St. John Mandel describes. Now, I feel it more acutely. Despite what I say when friends and I pretend to be public health experts, announcing our plans for “when Covid is over,” it has slowly dawned on me over the last few months that there is no certainty about when and even if things will return to the way they were, and as the pandemic stretches on, normalcy feels farther and farther out of reach.
Often, when looking at old photos on my phone, I find myself touched by the casual joy that they embody. How special what was once ordinary is to me now! Hugging a friend, eating out, spending holidays with family — how rare and beautiful this old world seems.
Rereading “Station Eleven” I return to this question — Do I understand what it means to live a life defined by the plague? Yes. There is a new heaven and a new earth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last February, Northampton rapper slowthai was staring a career meltdown in the face. Following a controversial joke at the 2020 NME awards involving the show host, comedian Katherine Ryan, Twitter users moved to “cancel” the rapper by spreading videos of the incident online without context. After the fact, slowthai apologized profusely on social media and Ryan stated that the rapper did not make her feel uncomfortable at any point. As part of a series of single drops last summer, slowthai indirectly addressed his attempted cancellation with “ENEMY,” a homophonic title for NME. With his latest two disc project, “TYRON,” slowthai attempts to move forward, channeling equal amounts of rage and vulnerability in an impressive — and mostly successful — showcase of emotional and musical growth.
The first half of the project — with song titles in all caps — sees the rapper in full rampage mode, supported by strong production from frequent collaborators SAMO and Kwes Darko. On the album opener “45 SMOKE,” Kwes Darko places a heavily modulated, creeping piano loop over the top of drill-style drums to create an absolute banger of an intro. The beat matches up perfectly with slowthai’s unique flow, highlighting and never overwhelming his abrasive delivery. SAMO and Kwes Darko employ a similar strategy on “MAZZA” featuring A$AP Rocky, using a lowkey stepwise melody to anchor a busy landscape of high hats, 808s, and kick drums. Yet “45 SMOKE,” “MAZZA,” and the rest of the tracks on the first half are disappointingly straightforward — rhythmically and melodically — compared to some of the singles released by slowthai last summer like the menacingly aggressive “BB (BODYBAG)” produced by Mount Kimbie and the wonderfully spastic “MAGIC” produced by Kenny Beats.
Like the beats, slowthai’s pen game on the first disc is solid, but severely lacking in certain respects. On “CANCELLED,” one of the lead singles for the project, the rapper teams up with fellow UK native Skepta in an abrasive response to slowthai’s 2020 NME Awards fiasco and cancel culture. Skepta’s repetitive eight bar chorus is remarkably tone-deaf: “How you gonna cancel me? / Twenty awards on the mantelpiece.” Besides it being a dry and repetitive hook, Skepta’s defiant attitude seems totally inappropriate — especially considering that he was uninvolved in the NME scandal or any other past incident involving cancel culture. On the track, slowthai seems to distance himself from his collaborator, deciding to focus on spitting clever rhymes: “Harry Potter, I’m off the vodka / Orderin’ lobster said it’s preposterous.” slowthai only takes one verse on the track, a confusing choice that further highlights the ineffectiveness and insensitivity of Skepta on hook duty. The track plays like a bad Skepta song with a slowthai feature. On “MAZZA,” the stark difference in delivery and accent between A$AP Rocky and slowthai allows the track to maintain its punch and avoid the monotony of “CANCELLED.” The last track on the first disc, “PLAY WITH FIRE,” displays slowthai, unencumbered by features, in top lyrical form and provides a nice transition into the softer second half of the album.
The introspective turn on the latter half of the project makes up for some of the first half’s failure with overall better production from Mount Kimbie, Kenny Beats, and Kwes Darko. The disc’s second track, “focus,” produced by Mount Kimbie and Kenny Beats with writing credits from James Blake, features a pulsating vocal sample that warmly cradles slowthai’s off-kilter delivery. Mount Kimbie and Kwes Darko join forces on “push,” a stripped-back acoustic guitar-based beat that highlights a beautifully sung chorus from Deb Never and allows slowthai to show off his chops: “Sellin’ drugs gets you richer, that’s a royal flush on the river.” The cool, breezy beat-making on “focus” and “push” gives context to and enhances the lead singles off the second half like “nhs” and “feel away.”
Throughout the second disc, slowthai opens himself up in ways rarely seen in his discography. On “i tried,” the rapper utilizes a laid-back, deliberate flow to talk about himself: “If Hell’s meant for sinning, Heaven’s never been for me.” The change in approach from “CANCELLED” to “i tried” is jarring but welcome, and it highlights slowthai’s skillful versatility. “terms,” which features Dominic Fike and Denzel Curry, is the one low point in the second half as it distracts from slowthai’s tender lyricism with a less than stellar hook from Fike, killing the momentum set up by the prior two songs. The Fike and Curry track excluded, the second half of the project expands on ideas from slowthai’s first project, “Nothing Great About Britain,” in songs like “Toaster” and “Ladies” — tracks that were overshadowed by the commercial success of bangers like “Doorman.”
A little more than half the length of “Nothing Great About Britain,” “TYRON” offers more than double the emotional content and lyricism via the second disc of the project. While slowthai first gained popularity with punk-inspired bangers, the rapper has worked to diversify his catalogue and prove his maturity as an artist. On Feb. 19, the project debuted at number one on the UK album charts. The Northampton rapper’s efforts seem to be paying off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We always knew that Lara Jean was cheesy, but it turns out we hadn’t seen the half of it. With the release of the third and final film in the "To All The Boys" cinematic universe, “Always and Forever,” we follow a sentimental Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) and an equally sappy Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo) on the rollercoaster that is senior year of high school. While the first two movies struck a great balance between aesthetic and narrative, the finale certainly prioritizes visuals over substance. Nevertheless, the affectionate couple delivers plenty of adventure and their part-delicate, part-wild ride through the last year of high school makes for an incredible send-off to one of the most beloved teen romances of our generation.
The script for the finale is the most complex one yet. It sets up an intricate network of themes and narrative devices that are returned to and advanced with precision. For example, in the opening scene, LJ (Lara Jean) writes a letter to Peter from South Korea, which, in addition to clueing us into the status of their relationship and providing insight into LJ’s background, tactfully sets up the film's driving dilemma: whether or not they’ll be able to attend Stanford together. There are nods to the prequels, like the film's conclusion where Peter offers up a new “contract” for their relationship. Even the smallest details become hidden gems in a new context, such as when Chris forbids LJ from packing a certain pair of sneakers for their senior trip to New York. We later see LJ eyeing someone on the NYC subway, dressed in all formal wear… with sneakers. LJ smiles at the sight. It's moments like this that hit home how painstakingly detailed and intentional the narrative is.
LJ and Peter are quite different people now than in previous films. Being in a secure relationship brings out traits in LJ and Peter that we haven’t seen before, and Condor and Centineo were evidently up for the challenge. LJ constantly drops references to ‘80s teen movies, charges at Peter and gives him bear hugs, and at no point reveals any insecurities about kissing him. Meanwhile, Peter never gets suspiciously intimate with Gen, plans elaborate dates for Lara Jean, and indulges her rom-com obsessions. The character development is real, and the cast handles it well.
What we don’t get as much of here is immersion. The film covers a lot of ground by way of chapters, like “The Senior Trip,” “Prom,” and “The Wedding —” however, at times, the moments come off as a sequence of smash-cut clips and conversations that don’t really stick. There’s no slow-burn buildup, no explosive climax, and none of the suspenseful will-they-won’t-they action that animated Peter and LJ’s breakups in the first two movies. Here, the climactic fight between Peter and LJ is heartbreaking but not earth-shattering, and it feels like they are back together in minutes. The film lacks tension, and segmenting "To All the Boys" into chapters plays a role in that.
The finale also lacks the experimental visual language, like the use of a narrow depth of field and stylized dynamic shots, that gave audiences immediate access to LJ's headspace in previous movies. We do see a few creative shots, like when LJ breaks the news to Peter that she actually wants to go to NYU, and the camera pans around the back of LJ’s head to Peter’s stunned face. But it's evident that the production team was more conservative about using these techniques this time around.
The one thing that this movie does perfectly is closure. All the mini-resolutions push on until the very last minute, with the ultimate ending line: “You know one thing 3,000 miles is good for? Writing love letters.”
In “To All The Boys: Always and Forever,” we follow Lara Jean and Peter’s relationship through senior year and to college, with all its ups and downs. In the pursuit of fleshing out what their chemistry, and also friction, looks like from all angles, we are sometimes snapped out of the moment. But it’s a necessary evil in service of the expansive perspective we get of the dynamic duo: LJ and Peter have never been cuter, realer, better. And while it seems like LJ eventually chooses distance from her loved ones when she makes her college decision, the movie assures us that she will always put her family and her boyfriend first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a Harvard student seeking out a paid public service internship during the summer, opportunities are abundant.
There are literally hundreds of unique employers to choose from, whether a student wants a politics-oriented internship through the Institute of Politics, a science-focused position through the Harvard Global Health Institute, one devoted to cultivating leadership skills through the Presidential Public Service Program, or an advocacy-oriented position through the Mindich Service Fellowship Program.
Most provide at least $4,000 for 10 weeks of work, all on Harvard’s dime.
Yet when seniors look towards post-graduation — probably one of the most daunting transitions in their lives — the flood of Harvard-funded public service opportunities dries to a trickle.
The College proclaims in its mission statement that it strives to churn out society’s future “citizen-leaders.” Yet almost half of all Harvard graduates entering the workforce each year take jobs in just two sectors: consulting and finance. In other words, they head in pretty much the opposite direction on the path of anyone’s reasonable definition of a “citizen-leader.”
So why are students taking these jobs? I haven’t personally heard any say they are eager about the responsibilities of their new positions. In fact, many have extensive public service backgrounds and don’t see their future in industries that just grease the wheels of the capitalist system.
Rather, they often take these jobs directly out of college because of the financial uncertainty of an alternative public service route. Compared to a $90,000 salary with bonuses, a service job might offer just $30,000 with few benefits, let alone bonuses.
Harvard doesn’t have to help make up this gap entirely to convince some students to make the jump. Most service-oriented students aren’t seeking a get-rich job, after all, but just a modicum of financial security.
If Harvard can supplement first-year salaries for post-grad public service jobs, raising them to, say, just $45,000, it could lead dozens or even hundreds more seniors to take these positions.
Yes, it would be expensive and logistically difficult. But a model for fixing this misalignment of students’ desires and financial reality is available right in the College’s own backyard; Harvard Law School was a pioneer in putting its money where its mouth was when it came to post-graduate service work.
In 1978, HLS became the first law school in the country to create a loan assistance program, forgiving tens or even hundreds of thousands in debt for any graduate earning less than a certain threshold post-graduation. The program has grown rapidly, from 37 recipients in the Class of 2008 to 111 in the Class of 2015.
For College graduates, however, it’s not debt forgiveness that’s needed, but rather a comparably generous public “service subsidy.”
It is worthwhile to take a step back and consider some of Harvard’s current financial outlays and their justifications. Consider, for example, that Harvard doles out nearly $200 million each year on undergraduate financial aid.
Well, for what reason? Presumably, to make sure students aren’t saddled with lifelong debt, thereby preventing them from pursuing their dreams.
But Harvard has missed the other half of the equation. Debt accrued during college is only one barrier to taking a post-graduation job free of financial concerns. Fears of an empty wallet a year after graduation can also cloud graduates’ post-graduate decision-making, disproportionately those from lower-income backgrounds.
So where could Harvard find the money for these generous post-graduate subsidies? Hopefully, donors could step up, as they have to the tune of millions of dollars for summer internship funding. Or maybe the University could dip into its pot of all-purpose money.
It’s not as if the College doesn’t already recognize the importance of helping students find public service jobs post-graduation.
For those with the financial means to accept a service-oriented job, there are endless resources to ensure a placement: a multitude of advisors devoted to public service from both the College Office of Career Services and the IOP Internships and Career Services, an annual Public Service Recruiting Day, a robust careers website, just to name a few. But at the end of the day, the phrase, “it’s all about the money” seems to adequately sum up the unresolved and central issue.
One of the luxuries of a diploma from an elite school is that anxiety about being unemployed is not a primary factor in decision-making about post-graduate jobs, especially when the economy is on the upswing. But a well-paying job versus a low-paying option is still a relevant contrast for most Harvard grads, just like it is for pretty much every member of the U.S. workforce.
So, it seems Harvard administrators can do something relatively easy to help students fulfill the College’s stated mission. What are they waiting for?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a rainy gritty day when I walked to vote in my early voting place. The wind was cold and strong. Yet I took each step with purpose and hope because I believe in democracy. I believe that the government has the potential to fight for its people. But not everybody feels this way.
The very trust that binds democracies together is at a near historic low. Covid-19 conspiracy theorists spout harmful misinformation attacking public health experts. The global coverage of the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor opened America’s eyes to the injustices of police brutality.
Insurrectionists successfully stormed the Capitol to “take back” their country. Former President Donald Trump primed his base with accusations of voter fraud months before the first vote was cast and manipulated 72 percent of Republicans who continued to question the election results even after losing or withdrawing over four dozen lawsuits. How can one trust a government whose own head calls its integrity into question?
Even Harvard has not escaped a declining regard for our public institutions. In the last 10 years, the number of Government concentrators has declined by 34 percent. This past spring, only 4 percent of seniors entering the workforce went into public service or non-profits, and an even lower 3 percent went into government or politics.
Democracies are built on trust. Citizens must have faith in their government for it to be successful. The governed have to believe that their voice will be heard, that elections are open and fair to all, that every citizen can participate fully no matter their race or ethnicity. The governed have to have faith that that elected representatives will respond to the collective voice of their voters, that the government will pursue policies that help the people.
The solution to reviving public trust and thus revitalizing our democracy is not a government that sits idly by. The solution to distrust of government is big government.
Bold ambitious policies that tangibly impact the lives of Americans are crucial. People need to see the government in action firsthand to believe in government again, and the demand is there. The vast majority of Americans believe that the government should play a major role in fighting for the people: ensuring everyone has access to healthcare, protecting the environment, investing in infrastructure, and alleviating poverty. These might sound like progressive priorities, but these are American priorities.
One such policy that is critical to increasing public trust is raising the minimum wage to a living wage that also keeps up with inflation. Government transfer payments benefit workers in effect, but the psychological impact of a wage gain would outweigh that of a perceived handout. Of course, it is important to retain transfer programs like the earned income tax credit, but raising wages has an additional synergistic effect of people believing in their own worth as well as the value of a caring federal government. The contributions of workers have been devalued for far too long — median and lower-income households have faced stagnant wages since the 1970s while their productivity has grown. At the same time, they watched the income of the top one percent skyrocket. Public trust is no trickle down matter. We need to build it back up from the bottom up. A government that sees the worth of its own people will earn the people’s trust.
Another crucial step in resurrecting public trust is much-needed election reform, starting with the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to reinstate voting rights and the For the People Act to reform the campaign finance system and ensure election integrity. Instituting public financing of elections and limiting the influence of special interests will prevent the voices of the few from trampling the many. The government must also update our voting system and put in place election security measures so governments (foreign or our own) can’t tamper with our elections. Belief in free and fair elections are a cornerstone to a healthy democracy.
As a matter of rebuilding public trust, everyday encounters with government matter too. For example, reinvesting in infrastructure (with the added benefit of creating jobs) should be part of the arsenal in rebuilding public trust. The 2017 American Society for Civil Engineers Report Card gave American infrastructure an overall D+ rating, while roads and drinking water languished at a D score. The devastating practical and psychological effects of poisonous tap water or crumbling roads ties the idea of government with incompetence and gross negligence. On the other hand, programs like Medicaid are popular because the people have seen firsthand how these government programs make a big difference in their lives.
When people think of the government, they should instead think of public servants looking out for every American every day or policies that have improved their everyday lives.
Americans need to believe that our democracy can work again, and that belief can only be earned through bold concrete results. Raising the minimum wage, ensuring free and fair elections, revitalizing our crumbling infrastructure, and other policies designed to fight for the people should not be seen as government overreach, but rather the government proving that they deserve the public’s trust, that they are upholding the social contract. It’s time for the U.S. government to show that this house deserves to stand.

The Harvard Management Company has reduced its investments in fossil fuels by 80 percent since 2008 as it works to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions associated with the University's endowment by 2050, according to a company report published Thursday.
“HMC has reduced its overall exposure to fossil fuels — including both direct commodity investments as well as indirect investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels held through dedicated externally managed funds — from approximately 11% of the portfolio at the end of fiscal year 2008 to less than 2% at the end of fiscal year 2020, a decrease of more than 80%,” the report reads.
In addition, HMC had no direct exposure to companies that “explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels” as of last June, per the report.
Following student and faculty pressure to divest the endowment from fossil fuels completely, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the Harvard Corporation in April 2020 directed HMC to develop a plan for the endowment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The report also outlines challenges HMC faces in understanding its ties to the fossil fuel industry. For example, many public and private market managers do not disclose the carbon emissions produced by companies in their portfolios.
As a result, HMC plans to conduct an assessment of its portfolio investments’ greenhouse gas emissions to develop a timeline to achieve an emissions-free portfolio. That assessment could take several years, according to the report.
“The timeline for when we will be able to do this will depend on how quickly our managers are willing and able to supply the necessary underlying data,” the report reads.
HMC also launched efforts to collaborate with other institutional investors to improve access to environmental data, per the report. HMC will engage with data providers to develop its own methodologies to evaluate the endowment’s environmental footprint.
“HMC has spoken with asset owners and asset managers that have made similar net-zero commitments, as well as potential service providers, to assist HMC in developing a process for creating a baseline carbon footprint of the endowment,” the report reads.
The report also references challenges of evaluating the environmental footprint of hedge funds, which often pursue investment strategies “uncorrelated to the broader markets.”
“No industry consensus currently exists on the best way to calculate the emissions of investments by these uncorrelated hedge fund strategies and existing protocols are expected to continue to evolve over time. HMC is studying the underlying logic of existing protocols and we will likely adapt these protocols for the purpose of our own unique reporting,” the report reads.
The report also provides an update on HMC’s involvement in several environmental initiatives and networks including Climate Action 100+, the United Nations-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.
Following Bacow’s directive to achieve net-zero emissions through the endowment by 2050, student activists called the plan “insufficient” because it still allows for some investment in fossil fuels. Some faculty who have advocated for divestment were similarly skeptical of the plan.
In Thursday’s report, HMC defended its policy of collaborating with greenhouse-gas-emitting companies on environmental and clean energy initiatives.
“Engagement may directly lead to a company’s changing its behavior and is a powerful tool for investors to achieve real world impact,” the report reads. “It is the mechanism through which the impact on real world emissions is most likely to materialize.”
HMC will update the University’s leadership on its progress “on a regular basis” and will update Harvard affiliates annually, per the report.

Harvard History of Art and Architecture professor Thomas B. F. Cummins has been named the new director of Dumbarton Oaks, a Harvard-owned research institution in Washington, D.C., according to a Tuesday press release.
Cummins has served as interim director of the institution since July 2020, when Classics professor Jan M. Ziolkowski left the role after 13 years.
“An eminent scholar and seasoned administrator, Tom has proven to be a wise and compassionate leader while serving as interim director of Dumbarton Oaks, and praise for his leadership has come from many quarters,” Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey said in the press release. “I have every confidence that the Dumbarton Oaks community will thrive under his leadership.”
Cummins will take over the research institute located in Washington D.C.’s Georgetown neighborhood that was gifted to Harvard in 1940 by arts patrons Robert Woods Bliss and Mildred Barnes Bliss. Through fellowships, grants, public lectures, and symposia, the institution serves as a hub for Byzantine and Pre-Columbian Studies, as well as the study of garden and landscape architecture.
Known as the site of the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conversations, which ultimately birthed the Charter of the United Nations, the 54-acre estate now consists of a satellite research library, a museum, and National-Geographic recognized public gardens. In 2014, the campus gained a new fellows’ housing building to encourage interactions among visiting scholars.
“It is a great honor and privilege to become the Director of Dumbarton Oaks,” Cummins said in the press release, which noted he has previously served as a Senior Fellow at the institution. “The community and staff have been an invaluable part of my life as they have been for so many others.”
Cummins served as chair of Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture from 2005 to 2012. He has held prominent positions in the University’s Center for Latin American Studies and Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, and is a member of the Afro-Latin American Research Institute at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.
Cummins has written and edited 10 books and won numerous research awards such as La Orden “Al Mérito por Servicios Distinguidos” En el Grado de Gran Cruz from the Republic of Peru, the Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize from the Modern Language Association, and the Bryce Wood Book Award from the Latin American Studies Association.
Cummins said in the release that he is “eager” to oversee the future of humanities study at Dumbarton Oaks and make the field “ever more exciting and relevant for future scholars from around the world.”
“Above all else, I look forward to reopening the doors of Dumbarton Oaks to share in the fellowship of scholarship and friendship after our universally shared year of isolation and darkness,” he said.

Third-year Harvard Law School student Brice Ngameni co-founded Pembe, a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering prospective law students of African descent, in early January.
“Our mission is to nurture and raise a generation of legal scholars and leaders from across the African diaspora, by providing the tools necessary to excel in the law school application process and beyond,” the organization’s website reads.
Ngameni said he helped found Pembe out of a “desire to give back” to the larger African diaspora and break the “ivory ceiling,” which includes knowledge gaps, financial inaccessibility, and a lack of connections to the field.
Ngameni, who grew up speaking French and moved from Cameroon to the United States in 2008, said the “main challenge” he encountered pursuing law school was “information.”
“Just learning about what becoming a lawyer means in the U.S. in terms of an educational path was an uphill battle,” he said. “I didn’t know any lawyer at that very moment, and I had to build a network organically of people who were in law school — professors or whatnot — and pick their brains about what I needed to do.”
Oluwole M. Oluborode, a third-year law student at Georgetown University involved with Pembe, said that when Ngameni approached him a month ago about joining the board, it was a “no-brainer.”
“Being a first-generation Nigerian, I understand the need for more Africans in law school,” he said. “Applying to law school can be a very tedious process — there’s just so many difficulties that one can face, and I understand it can be a lot.”
Ngameni said he started recruiting students to join him this past December.
“We went about contacting friends of ours or various legal student organizations,” he said, including the student organizations for African law students at Harvard, New York University, Columbia University, and Howard University.
“This really happened very quickly,” Ngameni said. “I realized it was my last semester, I really wanted to have some kind of a legacy and something that my community could really benefit from.”
Ngameni — who co-founded the organization alongside Dani Makia, his cousin and graduate of William & Mary Law School, and Aita Seck, a second-year law student at Columbia University — said he reached out to multiple friends and legal connections to “gauge their interest.” The response, Ngameni said, was “overwhelmingly positive.”
What distinguishes Pembe, Ngameni said, is instead of paying a fee for the service, members commit to joining Pembe as a mentor or officer after completing their first year of law school.
“We don’t ask people to pay, but we do ask them to pay forward,” Ngameni said. “It’s a very unique and distinctive feature of our organization. We are non-profit — there's a lot of organizations out there that do what is called law school admissions consulting, and they charge very, very hefty fees.”
Raissa L. Ebeh, who is considering applying to law school, said she had difficulty locating resources to prepare for the law school application process, especially the LSAT. Ebeh, who recently lost her job, also said the “biggest struggle” is to “get the right materials.”
“I just met this roadblock where I didn’t have people who looked like me or talked like me who I knew were in law school,” she said. “And then I found Brice, and he actually sat down with me for almost two hours just talking about his experience applying to law school.”
Matt Tessema, a senior at Virginia Commonwealth University and first-generation American who co-founded his university’s pre-law society, said Pembe addresses issues prospective law school students of African descent face across the U.S.
“It’s been increasingly difficult to get connections and to get advice on what are the next steps that I have to take to assure that I could achieve my goals of becoming a lawyer," Tessema said. "This program really solves that problem of finding people that I can talk to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the nation enters the 12th month of the coronavirus crisis, Harvard Director of Athletics Erin McDermott laid out three possible scenarios for the fall 2021 athletics season during an interview Wednesday.
Depending on the state of the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard’s varsity teams may participate in conference-only competition, expanded Ivy League and regional competition, or full competition including long-distance, non-conference play, according to McDermott.
The Ivy League hopes to reintroduce athletics competition in fall 2021 after the coronavirus pandemic forced the League’s presidents to cancel four athletics seasons beginning in March 2020.
McDermott said she is “very hopeful” Harvard’s varsity sports teams will be able to safely compete in fall 2021 as more Americans receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
“Ivy seasons in the fall, I would hope, is pretty assured,” McDermott said. “We would hope that we are actually in a better position than that and able to do some things beyond the Ivy League.”
The Ivy League usually begins conference play for the fall season by the end of September, though teams engage in pre-season and out-of-conference competition before then.
If the University and the Ivy League allow Harvard’s varsity sports teams to compete against non-conference schools, McDermott said Harvard will consider how far beyond Cambridge it permits its student athletes to travel for games.
“Let’s think more locally, regionally, for those other games,” she said. “Probably best to be fairly conservative as we think about those non-conference games.”
“It could be that going to the West Coast is very possible; at the same time, it might not be a case where we can do that yet,” she added.
Though the Ivy League canceled its spring sports season earlier this month, it outlined a path for member institutions to partake in “local non-conference competition” during the current academic semester, provided the public health situation “substantially” improves.
In advance of Harvard’s return to athletics competition, McDermott also said Wednesday that her department has been closely monitoring how conferences competing during the pandemic have prioritized the safety of their athletes.

In light of challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, some academic departments extended deadlines for College seniors to submit their theses this spring.
Department heads cited Covid-19, winter storms, and students’ personal difficulties as reasons for extending their senior thesis deadlines.
Nara Dillon, director of undergraduate studies for Government, said her department received several requests for extensions and ultimately decided to extend the deadline for everyone.
“In the last couple of weeks, we’ve gotten an unusual number of requests for extensions due to Covid, last week due to the power outages, and we just decided after considering a few of these cases, one by one, the most equitable thing to do would just be to give everyone the same extension,” she said. “Some students probably had difficult circumstances but weren’t as proactive in reaching out.”
“The overall context is that the whole research process has been harder for this group than ever before,” Dillon added.
Sydney V. McDonald ’21, a Government concentrator, said she was overjoyed by the department’s decision to extend its deadline from March 10 to March 17.
“I knew that I would have something by March 10, but I wasn’t necessarily confident that it was going to be my best work or that it would be a reflection of all the work that I’ve put in. But now with this deadline I feel really good,” she said. “I went around my whole suite, like screaming in joy.”
Joshua Berry ’21, who also concentrates in Government, said Covid-19 prevented seniors writing theses from experiencing the camaraderie they would find in a typical year, working together into the early morning in Lamont Library, for example.
“I remember around thesis time, every evening, there were just packs of seniors all together, writing together,” he said. “We’re losing out on maybe the social and support structure that you would have if you’re on campus and you can go to the library with your friends and you can thesis together.”
Benjamin M.W. Ho ’21, a concentrator in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, said he is thankful his department granted students a two-week deadline extension through March 26. Ho said he started his project significantly later than he planned after Covid-19 health restrictions disrupted in-person lab research.
“It would have been a very tight squeeze where I would be finishing everything all at once in the last few weeks,” Ho said. “It adds up to being able to produce a final product that I can be more proud of, which means a lot.”
Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, the co-director of undergraduate studies for HEB, said he and his colleagues offered the deadline extension because they recognized students were “struggling.”
Lieberman added his department provided students the option to write literature-based theses in lieu of standard lab-based projects.
“We made an exception because, otherwise, students wouldn’t have been able to do theses,” he said.
History of Science concentrator Jaycee M. Yegher ’21 said she appreciates that the department offered seniors an extra week to turn in their theses, considering the pandemic has made research difficult.
“A lot of us really struggled with access to archival information. Being able to visit an archive in person is way different from viewing the same materials online,” Yegher said. “Having the deadline moved a week, I think, just takes the pressure off immensely.”
At the same time, other concentrations, including Social Studies, which requires a senior thesis, have not extended their deadlines.
Anya B. Bassett, director of undergraduate studies for Social Studies, wrote in an emailed statement that her department maintained its thesis deadline to ensure all grading is completed in time for graduation.
“Social Studies is not moving our thesis deadline back because we have 64 theses coming in this spring and in addition to requiring a thesis, we also require an oral exam for each student,” she wrote. “We have to make sure that we can complete thesis grading for all of our students, run 64 oral exams, and complete the honors process in time to recommend our students for graduation.”
J. Ryan Zhang ’21, a Social Studies concentrator, said an extension would be “tremendously helpful” due to challenges that have arisen since the College went remote.
“There are tons of novel challenges introduced, not just this semester, but ever since last spring when we first began our theses,” he said. “Some of those obstacles are really visible like not being able to collect data, having to rework methodologies.”
“There are also an equal number of factors that aren’t as visible,” he added.
Ella R. Necheles ’21, an Applied Math concentrator, said she feels ambivalent about her department’s decision not to push its deadline.
“I’m a little conflicted because, obviously, would love more time to work on it,” she said. “But at the same time, I also really have, for a long time, been looking forward to being done on a certain date.”
Even before the Government department announced the extension, Berry said he was confident he would be able to submit his thesis by the deadline.
“One of the jokes that I’ve sort of been telling stressed-out friends and also telling myself is that maybe the thesis won’t be finished by the deadline, but it’ll certainly be done,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a winter storm in Texas earlier this month left the state's residents to contend with widespread power outages and skyrocketing electricity prices, William W. Hogan, the architect of the state’s energy market system and a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said in an interview with The Crimson Wednesday that the state’s electricity market had “worked as designed” given the conditions.
Hogan, an energy policy professor, has researched the structure of energy markets for several decades and advocated for a specific type of scarcity-based market model in an attempt to reduce prices for consumers. In 2013, Texas chose to adopt Hogan’s model.
Per scarcity-based pricing models, when the power supply is scarce, as was the case during the recent storm, the price of energy increases.
Energy generation dropped during the record-setting storm due to loss of power plants, fallen transmission lines, and damage to the grid. As a result, the price of energy rose, and some Texans whose power remained on saw their energy bills increase precipitously.
One Texas resident, for example, told the New York Times that the cost of his electricity went up 70-fold. He now owes $16,752 for his energy bill, wiping out his savings.
Hogan acknowledged in the Wednesday interview that such situations are “terrible.” Still, he argued the end result could have been much worse.
“The people who didn’t lose their power, they’re much better off than the people who lost it,” Hogan said. “Even if they had to pay bills for it, then that’s going to have to be figured out.”
He added that Texas residents who ended up with high power bills “chose not to have long-term contracts that protected them."
In Texas, the energy market is unregulated, meaning consumers can choose to pick a long-term, fixed-rate energy plan or a variable rate plan, among other options. Fixed-rate energy plans lock the consumer into a certain price, even if market rates rise or fall. Variable rate plans offer prices that respond more quickly to the market, and thus are more vulnerable to rate hikes due to natural disasters or other adverse market conditions.
Hogan said situations like the one seen earlier this month are uncommon and that the system works well, with low prices during normal conditions.
“You have to have a balance of supply and demand essentially all the time, every minute,” Hogan said. “If we get out of whack because demand drops or supply falls, you can get in trouble very quickly.”
Hogan added that the recent storm was a “one-in-100-year event” — well outside the normal bounds the system was designed to operate in.
Though Hogan emphasized the magnitude of the winter storm in Texas could not have been anticipated, Texas previously encountered problems meeting demand on its energy grid. In 2011, a winter storm caused 1.3 million people in Texas to lose service, and 4.4 million people to be impacted by outages.
University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability professor Peter Adriaens said in an interview that although it is not yet certain that the recent storm was caused by climate change, extreme weather events will become more common as the world experiences its effects.
“Climate change is causing events that used to be rare to become more common,” Adriaens said. “Those are the impacts or effects of climate change that could be more unpredictable. Events are more extreme and in locations where you don't expect them, such as in Texas.”
Adriaens disputed Hogan’s claim that those who maintained power but had to pay high prices were better off than those who lost power entirely.
“I don’t think that is really a fair reaction,” Adriaens said. “The question is, ‘should you ever have to pay that much for your energy?’”
Several Kennedy School students from Texas said they were disappointed that the market was designed with the possibility of such outcomes witnessed over the past month.
Kennedy School student Christopher J. Stewart, whose family was in Texas during the storm, said residents' negative experiences with the energy system during this crisis matched his expectations for a state where politicians have long pushed for cutting costs.
“It was interesting to see a comment from Professor Hogan that the system worked as designed because I actually think that that’s true — I think the system did work as designed,” he said. “It’s not surprising, because under the guise of fiscal responsibility, they’ve defunded a lot of our public services.”
Y. Joana Ortiz, another student at HKS, also said she was disappointed to hear Hogan’s position, but said it pointed to a “larger systemic issue.”
“Maybe people are surprised by his bluntness, but I think if you do not grasp that you live in a capitalistic society that favors private market for profit, I mean, that is the basis of our country,” she said.
Ortiz added that she believes Texas should meet the recent disaster with bold action.
“I think there certainly needs to be accountability, but I actually don’t even think accountability is enough,” she said. “I think there needs to be major reform and personally, I think that will really manifest itself in the next state election cycle.

Victor O. Ojeah, a Master of Laws student taking online classes from Nigeria, will not set foot on campus in his time at Harvard Law School.
With spotty electricity at home and living six hours ahead of Eastern Time, Ojeah said he hoped to access recordings of his Law School classes to make the most of his already “diluted” time at HLS.
He learned quickly, however, that his Law School peers had already been organizing for months to expand access to class recordings during the pandemic, but had found little success.
Law School administrators have argued that recordings could have a chilling effect on student discourse and undermine the socratic classroom experience. Though the school does allow students to request recordings under certain strict conditions — like a religious holiday, birth of a child, death of an “immediate” family member, or military service — each request must be made individually in advance of each class.
“I don’t want to be that guy who is the poster boy for asking for class recordings,” Ojeah said.
Ojeah said the recording policies have been especially difficult for and demonstrate a lack of understanding of students residing abroad, who are living in varying time zones with different levels of internet accessibility.
“In some countries, there’s a possibility of having constant and steady electricity,” he said. “In others like mine, electricity is really a luxury.”
Noelle G. Graham, co-president of the Law School’s student government, said that though recent power outages in Texas brought the issue to the forefront of student concern, discussions with administors about the issue began last summer.
“This is actually something that’s been a stressor for students, not just this year, but in previous years as well,” Graham said. “It’s something that student government last year was looking at, even before we were in a remote environment.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement that the student services team has “worked hard” this year to decrease the advance time required to request a recording from “3 days to 3 hours in most cases.”
Neal defended the Law School’s prohibition on recordings, citing the school’s teaching method and “feedback” from students after classes were temporarily recorded at the start of the pandemic.
“Synchronous learning is essential to the active, engaged Socratic method that is at the heart of Law School pedagogy,” he wrote. “Moreover, feedback from last spring’s experience suggests that some students felt uncomfortable about articulating arguments during classroom discussions because they were being recorded. That situation is not conducive to an effective Law School learning environment.”
Graham said she is “proud” of the reduction in advance time for requests, and “happy the administration was able to make that step.”
“If that had happened last year, that would have been astounding,” she said. “A lot of students don't realize that that is such a significant improvement.”
But numerous students said it is not nearly enough, and argued the Law School has abandoned some of its most vulnerable students.
The Law School’s Handbook of Academic Policies lays out a narrow set of circumstances that qualify a student to have their class recorded.
Students are allowed to request the Information Technology Services provide recordings of class lectures in the case of a religious holiday, birth of a child, death of an immediate family member, significant personal or medical emergency, or military service, the handbook reads.
One other circumstance listed in the policy that justifies a recording is if a professor reschedules a class, which first-year student Anita T. Alem said she thought she could take advantage of when one of her courses was moved to a time when she was on a flight.
“I filled out the little form,” she said. “I didn’t think I was going to have any trouble getting a recording.”
Contrary to that belief, she received a response that asked what the class conflicted with. When Alem clarified that she was asking for a recording of a make-up class outside of the regularly scheduled time, her request was denied, she said.
Vandana S. Apte, another first-year student, ran into similar difficulties when she contracted food poisoning and had to miss class.
“I am sorry to hear that you got sick with food poisoning; it can certainly make you never want to eat that food for a long time,” read a reply to her request from Student Support Services. “Did you speak to your provider or have any documentation?”
Alem argued that the administration’s request that students prove they are undergoing a crisis in order to obtain class recordings does not create an accessible learning environment, particularly during the pandemic.
“There’s just something so off about how [the Dean of Students’ Office] is navigating the situation during a pandemic, where we need to set policies that are somehow so specific because we need to be treating students in some very strict, punitive manner,” she said.
Alem said a friend of hers was asked to send a confirmation to prove that she really had a doctor’s appointment, which felt like a “huge, violation-of-privacy type thing.”
“We’re not children,” she said. “Why would I lie about having a doctor’s appointment?”
Kaylee Y. Ding, a first-year student at the Law School who missed weeks of class because of an illness last semester, said she believes the additional steps students must take to access recordings is concerning.
“The principle behind it, having this one extra step of like, ‘Oh, you need to confirm this, you need to email them, you have to fill out this request form’ or whatever, just seems like they just make it harder than it necessarily needs to be,” Ding said. “I don’t really see why they’re so stringent about class recordings.”
“Why does Harvard have to have a less liberal recording policy?” asked Graham, the HLS student government co-president.
Graham said Cornell, Berkeley, Columbia, and Yale are peer institutions that have significantly more accessible recording policies for their students. She added that she found the Law School’s response about why Harvard is an exception unsatisfactory.
“Mostly, the answer to that is, ‘because we’re Harvard,’” she said. “I can’t say it was much more of a conversation than that.”
Considering the first-year law school curriculum is similar across most U.S. institutions, Ding said the school’s rationale for not making recordings accessible remains unclear.
“It’s just strange to me, because I know other law schools in the same tier record all their classes just by default, and so I’m not really sure why there’s such a huge discrepancy between Harvard’s policies and some other law schools’ policies,” Ding said.
Katherine K. Shen, president of the Coalition of International Students and Global Affairs at the Law School, said administrators told her and other students that the Law School’s Academic Committee had a role in crafting the recording policy.
Shen said that though she and the other students are “not totally sure” who constitutes the Committee, they have a “vague” idea that it includes many of the Law School’s professors.
Graham also said she believes HLS faculty have significant influence over the recording policy.
“I think the faculty does have a very important role in what their recording policy is,” Graham said. “I don’t believe it is solely up to [the Dean of Students] or solely up to [HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82]. Professors have a lot of leeway in what they do with classes — it’s kind of their domain.”
Neal, the Harvard spokesperson, wrote that in planning policies for the year, the Law School’s “academic leadership” was in “direct consultation with the faculty.”
Ding said one of her professors this semester “freaked out” when the course teaching fellow accidentally hit the record button too soon.
Gabrielle L. Crofford, a first-year student and a member of the Law School’s Mock Trial team, said she did not understand why the Law School would work against students who she said are doing the University a service.
“Even though we’re representing the University — preparing and performing very well at these competitions, our Mock Trial competitions are not covered by the policy,” she said. “It’s a little surprising to me because you’d think if we were doing something through a University-sanctioned organization, it would be covered.”
Ash E. Tomaszewski, a first-year law student and representative for their section cohort of roughly 70 students, said their cohort had the most dropouts of any section last semester and has “really been struggling.”
The Law School has “completely and fundamentally abandoned their students,” prompting classmates to rely on one another for academic support, per Tomaszewski.
“We now organize as a section,” they said. “We don’t go through DOS if we need something, if we need something we go to each other.”
Anna J. Dorman, a third-year student, circulated a petition last fall calling on the Law School to change its recording policies. As of Wednesday, it had garnered more than 300 signatures.
Addressed to Manning, the school’s dean, the petition describes the current recording policy as an “inefficient mechanism,” that serves to “perpetuate inequalities among the student body.”
When drafting the petition, Dorman said she wanted to include a diverse array of perspectives, including those of students who are in notably challenging circumstances and have less visibility with the administration.
“The administration interacts with a lot of students who aren’t in more difficult scenarios,” she said. “We wanted to make sure that these were people that they were thinking of when making their policy, and realizing that there are a lot of students who are in situations that are more difficult.”
In an emailed response to Dorman dated Sept. 8, 2020, then-Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote the transition to remote learning “inevitably presents some challenging circumstances” for Law School students, and that administrators have had to “choose among imperfect alternatives” during the pandemic.
“We have done our best — through measures such as the tech fund, the allocation of rooms in North Hall, the scheduling of some classes at hours more consistent with remote time zones, and coordinate note-taking for all 1L classes — to mitigate the impact,” Sells wrote.
The recording policies have been “particularly burdensome” for LLM and international students, said William “Billy” P. Wright, the other Law School student government co-president. Ninety-seven percent of the current LLM class is composed of international students.
“We talked to some who say they have pretty frequent power outages or internet outages that just proves to be very disruptive,” he said. “The time zone difference is also a really tough one. There are classes for them they could take, but it’s hard to have access to everything that goes on in HLS.”
Wright said those groups of students also often have the most difficulty relaying their concerns to administrators.
“It’s kind of easy to appreciate what the JD population is going through, because only one-third of the JD population turns over each year,” he said. “Once you’ve been here for a little while, I feel like JDs have a pretty good understanding of how to carry forward their concerns.”
Of the 97 international students who responded to a survey organized by the Coalition of International Students and Global Affairs about recording policies, 94.8 percent said they prefer having recordings for class, according to Shen, the coalition’s president.
Half of the respondents said it was difficult or extremely difficult to participate in classes during the times offered.
Matthew P. Farrell, vice president of the international students coalition, said while the Law School’s recording policy may address issues such as family emergencies, natural disasters, and other limited circumstances, it largely ignores international students’ situations.
“We were concerned about people who are in different time zones, who are facing other circumstances, as well as for the Disability Law Students Association, people with disabilities being able to access classes,” he said.
Neal wrote in a statement that the Law School supports students with disabilities through “a range of accessibility-related accommodations.”
“More broadly, for any student who wants guidance on how to optimize their home learning environment for online learning, the School provides individual consultations from the Learning Experience & Technology team,” he wrote. “Any student experiencing academic or other challenges should reach out to the Dean of Students office to be guided to these and other resources.”
Alem said making recordings of classes more accessible could also be a valuable practice in post-pandemic times.
“Being able to access recordings after the pandemic is definitely something that I think is still worth fighting for,” she said. “Even if we think this is something that’s only going to be valid for the next few months, it could have impacts beyond that.”
Ojeah, the LLM student taking classes from Nigeria, said a change to the recording policy would acknowledge the “very challenging year” he and many classmates have experienced.
Though he said he thinks the Law School’s concerns over making all class recordings available — including the potential chilling effect on student discourse — are valid, Ojeah said the unprecedented circumstances call for more administrative cooperation.
“Everyone knows that we are in extraordinary times,” Ojeah said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will postpone its Commencement Exercises and hold a virtual ceremony in May for the second consecutive year to heed public health guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Friday.
Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, will be the virtual ceremony’s principal speaker. Simmons previously served as the president of Brown University from 2001 to 2012, making her the first Black president of an Ivy League institution and first female president of Brown. From 1995 to 2001, she served as the president of Smith College.
Bacow pledged Friday to welcome the Class of 2021 back to campus for an in-person celebration “one day” — a promise he also made last year to the Class of 2020.
“Though circumstances may well improve by spring, it takes months of planning to prepare for our usual festivities, which draw to campus and to Cambridge thousands of people from around the world,” Bacow wrote. “Right now, the risk posed by that possibility is too great.”
Simmons was seen as a contender for the presidency of Harvard in 2006. She testified in defense of the College’s admissions process at the high-profile 2018 admissions trial.
“Having led a women’s college, an Ivy League research university, and a historically black university, she has a unique perspective on how very different types of institutions contribute to the fabric of our nation,” Bacow wrote.
The May ceremony will feature a University-wide virtual “celebration” followed by smaller virtual events held by each school. Graduates will receive their diplomas in the mail following commencement.
The first time Harvard’s Commencement Exercises were cancelled was due to a smallpox outbreak in 1752. Before 2020, the event had been held in person every year since 1780.

As many of us packed up all of our belongings and left Cambridge last March, there were plenty of things to say goodbye to — the warm spot by Canaday, our favorite House pooch, and literally anyone from the class of 2020 (rip). Yet, little did we know we’d also be saying goodbye to some iconic establishments in the Square: from Café Pamplona to Parsnip to Legal Sea Foods, it seems no restaurant was safe from Covid’s path. But this time, it’s personal. Border Cafe has been the unofficial second home of Flyby Blog for years, hosting many a margarita-filled gathering of bloggers. When the restaurant closed its doors for the first time due to a two-alarm fire, we were heartbroken. As it shutters its doors for the final time due to the long pandemic, we’re damn near inconsolable. Oh Border, you will be missed. This is our final love letter to you, dear. Gone, but never forgotten.
Felipe’s this, Jefe’s that — Border, you were always in a league of your own. The only way to express the absolute desolation of losing Border is through the classic emoticon of jaded acceptance, :/. I’ll miss getting full on chips and salsa before even ordering, and all the laughter and love that came with Border Blog gatherings. Thanks for the mems, baby.
—Peyton A. Jones ’22
How do you write a love letter to a soulmate you never met and will never get to meet? Border, I’ll be honest. I’m hurt. I can’t count the number of times I’ve walked past you and then decided I’m feeling in the mood for something else, only to settle for dhall food. To be fair, I thought we had years left to finally get acquainted. Sigh. Maybe at another location or in another life. I guess I was just waiting for the perfect occasion — the best guacamole in the Square deserves nothing less.
—Janani Sekar ’23
Oh Border Cafe…How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth of each bowl of queso, to the breadth of each fajita, to the height of each endless chip basket. Your Cajun Favorites made Harvard Square feel a little more like home, and I’ll search high and low for somewhere that can provide me with both crawfish etouffee AND chips and queso without breaking a sweat. Maybe someday I’ll take a drive to Saugus and we can be together again — until then, I’ll get by with a Felipe’s burrito and nostalgic smile in your direction.

This is not the way it was supposed to happen. Harvard reunions for years were supposed to feature Border frozen margs and loaded-with-goodness quesadillas. The pandemic took senior spring and commencement from me — but this is the last damn straw. All I can do is remember the good times we had, Border, and wish the best for your employees and your Saugus location. We’re always together in my heart.

Dear Border Cafe, I actually didn’t know about you until I heard about the news that you permanently closed down...considering you closed down the first time before I even knew I had been accepted to Harvard. So tbh, I’m not really devastated. But know that you’ll be missed (by the upperclassmen).

Devastating is our loss. I had heard legends of the frozen margs, and was so excited to have finally turned 21 and get to experience one for myself. Border, you were the host of many boisterous dinners featuring great food and great company. Thank you for always making vegan adjustments when I asked. May your spirit live on in the hearts and stomachs of Harvard students forever.

Ah, Border. Though we only met once in this lifetime, I still dream of you, your ~moist~ beef fajitas, and your warm-but-not-scalding-and-did-we-mention-free tortilla chips. But you know what they say: of fire did these culinary delights start, and unto fire shalt they return. Border dared to soar above every other institution in the Square, but alas, the legendary café flew too close to the sun on wings of guacamole. May your heaven contain frozen margs and all the sides you can possibly imagine.

Border didn’t take reservations because it didn’t have to. How I yearn for the evenings when I waited to be seated, perched on the edge of the front wooden bench, gazing longingly at the baskets of hot chips on tables before me, glancing plaintively at the host stand, my ears perking at the crackle of sizzling fajitas and finally, at the reassuring vibration of the Border buzzer. The hour then came for revelry and gluttony. It’s also no exaggeration to say that Border got me through the fall 2016 HUDS workers strike, where I could gorge myself several nights a week on Border’s cheap and filling eats (one could craft a whole meal out of 99-cent sides), with the added benefit of not being a scab. The queso was top tier. Even the Border water, served in tall plastic cups with the perfect amount of ice, was superior. Imy Border bb.

As soon as we get more than one competent driver on the Blog (thanks, Hannah J. Humes!), we’ll come visit one of your other locations, we promise. Till then, old friend <3
Xoxo,
