After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


In “Witness Uganda,” a new musical running at the American Repertory Theater through March 16, an aspiring American actor named Griffin is prompted by a show of intolerance at his church (he is expelled from the choir due to his sexuality) to go searching for himself in Uganda. What he finds differs from what he was expecting. Griffin’s journey of self-discovery is complicated as he learns unsavory truths about the volunteer program for which he has signed up and is confronted with the idea that he may be incapable of making a difference. The musical, directed by ARTmainstay Diane Paulus, is based on the experiences of one of its writers, Griffin Matthews. Matthews first visited Uganda in 2005 and founded the organization UgandaProject.
 
“Witness Uganda” succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings; you will leave the theater feeling moved, even, perhaps, compelled to donate to Matthews’ foundation. Unfortunately, the dialogue and lyrics fail to live up to the melodies and visuals in which they are couched, and the vision of Uganda proffered by the musical is problematic.
 
The production’s greatest asset is undoubtedly its score. “Witness Uganda” boasts a flurry of songs that are mind-bogglingly hummable: plangent, heart-thumping, pop-influenced and pathos-evoking. “Invisible Thread,” “Put It All On The Line,” and “Bricks” in particular plant themselves in the head and linger afterwards. 
 
An equally captivating set design enhances the hypnotic nature of the score. The choice to substitute projected images for a constructed set is a smart one. The bareness of the beautifully lit stage simulates the expansiveness of the outdoors better than any assemblage of set pieces could hope to. The projections themselves are an effective complement to the music; the musical numbers are arresting on both a visual and an aural level, and they create an atmosphere of total engagement that helps to distract from the production’s weak spots.
 
The weakest among these problem areas is the lyrics: the music of “Witness Uganda” makes a beeline for the heart but bypasses the brain. Stripped of their fortifying melodies, Matthews and Matt Gould’s lyrics would collapse under the weight of their own abstractness. The majority of the songs in “Witness Uganda” are clumsily cobbled together. Typically, verses rife with single syllable words alternate with a chorus in which vague, naturalistic imagery is tied to emotional growth. 
 
The libretto, too, suffers from a lack of depth. Act One in particular brims with platitudes, and while the characters’ dialogue is realistic, their conversations serve little purpose other than to do what the songs don’t—advance the plot. As a result, character development takes a backseat. With the exception of Joy (Adeola Role) and Jacob (Michael Luwoye), workers at the compound that hosts Griffin’s volunteer program, the characters in “Witness Uganda” are resolutely two-dimensional.
 
The failures of the lyrics and dialogue are nearly overcome by the talents of the actors charged with delivering them. It is difficult to fixate on the laziness of this or that lyric when the vocals come from Emma Hunton, Nicolette Robinson, or Kristolyn Lloyd. Hunton plays Griffin’s best friend and fellow struggling artist Ryan; Robinson and Lloyd play Eden and Grace, Ugandan teenagers who befriend Griffin and become his students. Each of these actresses makes the most of the material they are given to work with. Ryan, Eden and Grace are not dynamic characters, but due to the acting chops of the women playing them, they manage to be mostly believable and highly sympathetic.
 
Unfortunately, there is no redress for the production’s subtler failings. There are elements of the piece that point toward the kind of exploitative, simplistic representation of an African nation that no one wants to endorse. The dance numbers are mesmerizing, but the namelessness of the dancers that comprise the ensemble is problematic. They not only move as one but also seem to think and act as one. When they appear in non-musical scenes, their actions and expressions are uncomfortably uniform. The issue is not improper handling of the chorus; choruses, by their very nature, tend toward deindividuation. But in “Witness Uganda,” this sometimes seems to promote an uncomfortably simplistic image of the Ugandan people. As a consequence, a serious musical about Uganda, written by a Westerner for a Western audience, probably should not include a chorus, period.
 
Ultimately, the creative team and cast of “Witness Uganda” are its saving grace. It would be inaccurate to say that they do the material justice; rather, they elevate it miles higher than anyone reading the script could reasonably expect it to go. This is not a musical that should be read or revived. But it is a powerful piece of what might best be described as activist theater. It is the product of a professional activist, based on a true story and attached to a very real foundation (t-shirts and informational pamphlets are available in the lobby). Consequently, it resists criticism as a theatrical work. Is “Witness Uganda” a particularly good musical? No. Is it a brilliant and effecting piece of advertising? Yes. Is it worth seeing? That depends on what you’re looking for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 6:38 left in regulation, a three-pointer from sophomore guard Siyani Chambers extended the Harvard men’s basketball team’s lead to 12. After trading buckets with Columbia for the majority of Friday night’s game, the Crimson seemed to finally create some breathing room with Chambers’ trey.
And then Columbia’s Alex Rosenberg woke up. Moments later, this lion claimed Levien Gymnasium as his den.
While Rosenberg had already tallied 18 points on the night, the junior would score 16 more before the final whistle blew.
Following Chambers’ shot from downtown, Rosenberg converted an and-one attempt and an additional layup in the span of 60 seconds.
Two minutes later, Harvard’s 12-point lead had dwindled to five, and Columbia held the ball. Sophomore Maodo Lo drove towards the basket and put up a runner, which clanged off the rim. The guard grabbed his own rebound and shoveled the ball out to Rosenberg, who was waiting behind the three-point line.
Catch, shoot, swish. Rosenberg had made it a two-point game.
The Lions would need four more points from Rosenberg in the waning moments of regulation to force overtime. And while the five extra minutes started off with more of the same—Rosenberg knocked down a step-back, shot clock-beating jumper with 3:46 remaining—a single play in the final moments of the period was what changed the flow of the game.
Rosenberg caught the ball at the top of the circle and began to run out the game clock. 20 seconds became 15, which became 10 before the forward began to make his move. Rosenberg put the ball on the floor, pulling up near the right elbow. His body collided with that of Harvard co-captain Laurent Rivard and, a moment later, his wild circus shot nicked the backboard before dropping into the hoop.
A whistle blew. No one moved.
For an instant, players did not know whether the referee had called a defensive blocking foul—giving Columbia a two-point lead with just two ticks left on the clock—or an offensive charging foul, giving the Crimson possession with the game tied.
It was the latter. Rosenberg picked up the foul, the shot was waved off, and after a near miss on a half-court shot, the contest was headed into double overtime.
But even Rosenberg’s heroics couldn’t save the Lions in the second extra period, and the Crimson came out on top, 88-84. Rosenberg led all scorers with 34 points, going 10-of-17 from the floor and 4-of-6 from deep.
“[Rosenberg] was unstoppable,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought he had a tremendous rhythm on the offensive game, was in a groove, and made some incredible basketball plays.”
CALLING IT A COMEBACK
In last weekend’s matchup against Yale, Harvard’s top two offensive threats—junior wing Wesley Saunders and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers—shot a combined 9-of-28 from the floor. The night before, against Brown, the power duo went 4-of-19 from the field.
What a difference a week can make.
Against the Lions on Friday night, the Crimson backcourt pair shot at a 58.8 percent clip, totaled 41 of the team’s 88 points, and made bucket after bucket when it counted.
In double overtime alone, Chambers knocked down five free throws, while Saunders tallied perhaps the most crucial assist of the night with one minute left in the period.
With under 1:15 to play and the shot clock winding down, Chambers had possession of the ball. Saunders quickly beat his man with a backdoor cut, and the point guard bounced him a low pass near the hoop. Saunders navigated traffic for a moment before sending a bullet pass to Rivard, who sat, hands ready, at the three-point line. The senior did what he does best, promptly knocking down the trey to give the Crimson a five-point lead.
“The beautiful part of that possession was that we had two guys [Chambers and Saunders] who made the right play,” Amaker explained. “Those two guys are our best playmakers, and boy, did they make the right play. Laurent had the easy part: just make the shot. And he did. And we are very fortunate for it.”
Seconds after the three went down, Columbia coach Kyle Smith was whistled for a technical foul. The game was over.
“I’m not sure you need a stat sheet to say how incredible that game was, how hard-fought it was by both teams,” Amaker said. “I think [tonight’s game] was critical [moving forward].”
