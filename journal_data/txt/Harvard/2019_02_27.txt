After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chinese dramaturg Yan Chen knew little about what dramaturgy entailed before applying to study the discipline at Harvard’s award-winning American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), but she has come a long way since. She was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship after studying and training across continents at Nanjing University, A.R.T, Moscow Art Theatre School in Russia, and other theaters globally. The Harvard Crimson spoke with her about her aspirations to promote the greater diversification and inclusivity of theater for cross-cultural understanding.
The Harvard Crimson: What are your aspirations for American theater?
Yan Chen: Theater cultivates empathy, and collaboration is essential. Even with one person shows, you have to have people — like lighting and sound people. You “can't do it alone,” as said in “Chicago.” Right now, there are extremely exciting emerging playwrights, and the conversations American theater is having about diversity and inclusion are fantastic. At the same time, international artists or works rarely seem to come into the picture. Institutions like Brooklyn Academy of Music or Arts Emerson in Boston make it part of their mission to bring international artists over, but why can't all our other theaters look into having more transcultural exchanges? The A.R.T. has historically been an artistic home for visionary, international theater, and it produced works by directors like Andrei Serban and Krystian Lupa. During my time there, I saw touring productions from Ireland and from Nigeria. Things like that deserve to happen across American theater on a much larger scale. There are a lot of practical difficulties that being an international student or artist in America can entail. How do you get work here? What do you have to do to prove you have extraordinary talent to get the O-1 visa? American theater talks very much about American theater, but I wish it could expand to include international theater and artists in the conversation.
THC: Can you provide an example of how your international experience — your work in China and training there, and then in the USA, the UK, Russia and Poland — informs the kind of theater work you do?
YC: It was actually through my work at the A.R.T. that I worked on my first professional production in China. Alumnus Dmitry Troyanovsky is Russian-American, and he had been teaching and directing projects in Shanghai since 2011. He invited me to collaborate with him on the mainland Chinese premiere of a German play called “The Ugly One.” I researched why the play had been successful in multiple countries to figure out how we could better make it resonate with audiences in China. The play was about plastic surgery and explored the instability of identity and self-perception which was very pertinent in China, both because plastic surgery had become increasingly popular and because China was undergoing enormous changes in landscape and economy, in people's perceptions of self-worth and identity. Our conversations about the play were not just about how to preserve an authentic German-ness, nor about bringing an American perspective to it, nor how to localize the play to make it authentically Chinese. When you have people from different cultures working on something, the result is a fascinating hybrid quite unlike anything you've seen before.
THC: What do you plan to do with your Rhodes scholarship?
YC: In recent years [the Rhodes has] made a huge effort to geographically expand so that more people across the world can benefit from the Rhodes Scholarship. The Rhodes only entered China in 2015, and I'm part of the fourth class of Chinese Rhodes Scholars. I'm planning to do a one-year Master's in comparative literature or English. Then, I'm hoping to apply for a PhD in English, specializing in drama and theater.
THC: What impact do you hope to make with the Rhodes scholarship?
YC: To use the opportunity to advocate for theater and for the importance of humanities and the arts. In China, there's this prejudice that only people who can't excel academically go into the arts. The other perception is that you can only make it in the arts if your family is rich. I don't come from a rich family; I have had to depend on scholarships throughout the years to sustain my studies.
The Rhodes attracted me because it places such an emphasis on service. Its slogan is “fighting the world's fight.” A lot of people choose to fight the world’s fight through politics or through public service. I was there to make the argument that theater is also an essential way to better the lives of other people. I ended up being the first Chinese Rhodes Scholar to have majored in the arts. I was thinking before my interview that if I won, it would be a really great opportunity to show parents, fellow students, and everyone that it's possible for people majoring in the arts to have excelled in academics. Those things are not mutually exclusive. You can do a lot for society through the arts, as I saw at the A.R.T.
THC: What is your vision for accessibility and diversity in theater?
YC: Making theater accessible means thinking about who you've been leaving out. One example I like from my A.R.T. days was “James and the Giant Peach,” in which the theater had a sensory-friendly performance for those on the autism spectrum and with other sensory sensitivities. Preparing to make that theatrical experience friendly for those audiences was one of the most special experiences of my life. There were parents who told us afterward that this is the one chance they get every year to come to the theater as a family, and to have an outing all together. When you hear from those audiences, it's not about patting yourself on the back and being like, “I’m so moved.” It's more about, “There were people who could only go to theater once a year, because we don't have enough accessible performances. What can we do to further change that?” It's not about what you've done so far, it's about, “What else am I not doing?” That's also true for myself, because the Rhodes is an affirmation of what you've done so far. But even more than that, it's an investment in your future and in the promises that you've made.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a college that prides itself on being a premier liberal arts institution dedicated to, among other things, providing an encompassing literary education, the number of students who confess to never thinking to read a book of their own choice is surprising.
I admit it. I am one of the many who have fallen into the habitual micromanaging of daily schedules to maximize productivity (or at the very least try to), without leaving much room for leisure activities that I once loved, such as reading. Ever since my first semester at college, I admit to being someone who, when asked what interesting stories or novels they’ve recently read, will most likely dodge the question by citing the many papers and projects I have left to complete and rush off to my next destination.
However, this wasn’t always the case. On a typical Sunday morning in high school, I could have been found at the nearest cafe or in a similar locale, newly minted novel in one hand and iced coffee in the other. Yet during the college semester, I am more likely to be found in Cabot Library or the Smith Center, coffee still in hand, but busy scrolling through the emails in my inbox or browsing online. This phenomenon wherein college students become too preoccupied with other commitments to make as much time for interests that once occupied them is relatively common and understandable. However, it becomes an issue when academic and social demands take precedence to such a degree that interests such as reading, which once held importance to me, are now shelved under the category of “leisure” and very rarely indulged in.
Growing up, reading represented an avenue into different worlds. Reading was my chance to learn more about different places I would’ve never had the opportunity to visit, understand the complexities of different characters, and step out of my own shoes into another person’s. Every book was a new chance to explore a previously undiscovered place, on my own terms and according to what I was most interested in.
And yet in college, it seemed like the value of reading for the sake of reading had been lost. I felt that if the activity I was engaged in did not produce a tangible result or have some sort of concrete, positive outcome to hold up and justify the time spent on the activity then it was not worth pursuing. And thus, I found myself only perusing class-assigned readings instead. Many of these were wonderfully enlightening and important. However, they could not replace the gratification of reading by choice, whether that be in the form of an audiobook, novel, e-book, or other form of media. In the end, there was a different type of value in choosing to pick up something that caught my eye, being drawn into a story, and wanting to see it through to the end.
Despite the actual meaning of the famously alluded to “Harvard Time,” which recently went out of use on campus, it seems like in reality, Harvard time is divided very unevenly: The vast majority of time is spent in pursuit of activities that are only pursued under the belief that there will be a benefit or reward in their completion, and very little time is spent on other interests that provide less tangible, but no less valuable rewards. Under the impression that this was the better division of my time, I boxed reading mainly into an academic context, separate from any activities I would pursue for diversion. However, this did nothing to improve my overall generativity in my work, nor did it help me be more productive. It only resulted in the loss of a cherished pastime.
Learning to unsee reading as a solely academic practice was what helped me regain my ability to engage with and make time for it. The necessity of understanding this goes for all of us here at Harvard, regardless of what interest stands in place of reading. Learning to see that value in something does not always lie in the most obvious or visible results, such as a grade on an assessment, will ultimately benefit the well-being and happiness of students, as well as our productivity. Studies have also indicated that the hyper-fixation upon a certain task without any sort of occasional mental diversion is unproductive in completing said task. Therefore, interests, hobbies, and passions should not always be sidelined in favor of what we think will produce desirable results; it just may be that allowing some room for mental respites and enjoyment can help us get further in our goals and pursuits than anything else.
Regardless of what our interests are, it is important to leave room in our lives for them. The inherent value in partaking in those activities may not be visible in the form of an A on a paper, or as practice for a future vocation, yet it is there nonetheless. Our diverse passions and interests are a part of who we are, as a student body and as individuals, and they should never be sacrificed as a part of the false idea that productivity excludes doing what we love best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an interview nearly two weeks ago, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said that the College plans to review its “amnesty policy” in response to an internal report on the April 2018 arrest of a black College student, which sparked allegations of police brutality. The incident took place following Yardfest, the College’s annual spring concert, during which medical transports were more than five times higher than the previous year and two emergency rooms became so overextended they turned away several intoxicated students.
The amnesty policy, which guarantees that students will not face disciplinary action from the College when they seek medical assistance for themselves or a friend using or providing alcohol or drugs, should not be viewed as a means to reduce the number of students under the influence. Likewise, the administration should not retract the protections the amnesty policy affords to students seeking medical assistance. While the increased number of emergency calls for intoxication and overdose at Yardfest is undoubtedly troubling, students’ comfort in reaching out for help should be protected.
While Khurana’s stated goal of clarifying the wording of the amnesty policy seems agreeable, we are concerned that changes to the policy in efforts to lessen the “encourag[ing]” behavior Khurana believes it to promote will result in less students relying on University medical resources in times of need. If changes to the policy lead to increased fear of disciplinary action, students might make emergency calls less frequently or later than would be best for their safety. Amidst any changes, the policy should continue to prioritize student safety.
Student deaths from alcohol and drug use are an all too common tragedy on college campuses nationwide. This policy is a critical measure against these incidents. Instead of withdrawing the protections of the amnesty policy, which would only encourage students to gamble with their safety, Harvard should focus on ensuring that Harvard University Health Services and Harvard University Police Department are sufficiently staffed to handle all calls during large, campus-wide events such as Yardfest.
The College’s review of the amnesty policy should, however, clarify how the protections apply when the Cambridge Police Department or Boston Police Department are involved. As we have opined in the past, Harvard students must know who they can and cannot contact under the amnesty policy in case of an emergency.
Finally, the University should not conflate vagueness in the language of the amnesty policy with the April 2018 incident. Doing so undermines the severity of the “profoundly disturbing” use of force used against the unarmed black College student. Instead, they should look closely at why HUHS became so overcrowded and conflict arose with CPD. Any vagueness in the amnesty policy does not excuse these shortcomings or the unfortunate events that took place as a result.
The amnesty policy encourages safer behavior among College undergraduates, encouraging students to seek medical help instead of taking risks that can, and often do, end in tragedy. In looking to the future, we hope the College will clarify the role of non-Harvard affiliated officials so that expectations are clear when a emergency call is made. A full emergency room during Yardfest is not ideal, but the alternative is far, far worse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many have noted millennials’ unique affinity for hyperbole. We are never laughing, we are “literally dying”; we don’t have off days, we “want to kill ourselves”; we don't have close friends, we are "best friends forever." We willingly accept each others’ exaggerations and smilingly recognize their lighthearted nature. However, our tendency to overdramatize sometimes goes beyond frivolous metaphor into an inclination to use stronger, harsher language to convey our feelings towards any phenomenon, and this may have adverse consequences that bear recognition.
An example: The word “creepy” is often thrown around by young women describing the various shades of men that they encounter. An unfamiliar man asks you on a date? He’s “creepy.” A boy makes flirtatious advances towards you at a party? “Creepy.” A male classmate texts you back one too many times? Still “creepy.” Yes, of course, some men engage in creepy behavior, and I have no doubt that a number of these incidents actually warrant the label; however, the overuse of the word has meant that it has lost its significance.
Bad actors deserve a healthy dose of cynicism, but our words must effectively distinguish the behavior of men who attempt in good faith to initiate friendship, or even romantic relationships, from those who have viler intentions. We do not want to create an atmosphere where (as I am afraid is already to some extent the case) some of my male friends are afraid of speaking to women. It would be a shame if, after all our efforts to achieve gender equality in the workplace, our otherwise well-meaning male colleagues are nervous about exchanging even a casual greeting.
As for young men describing their female peers? Any small deviation from what might be considered normal behavior is immediately branded “psycho” or “bitchy.” The vileness of this language is simply absurd. When the default words used to express minor discontent with a woman are already so foul, I shudder to imagine how millennial men describe the ladies they truly despise.
Negative descriptors are not our only problem. We jump over basic contentment, and move straight to adulation, using “love” to describe any person that we, well, like. We do not make casual acquaintances, instead we curate an ensemble of “best” friends. Once again, the meaning of our words is eroded by their repetition. It has become difficult to distinguish someone’s bosom companion from that kid they hung out with that one time in middle school.
To be sure, we have not ceased to use more gentle language; however, we typically tend to do so in displays of irony. When our friends act in a clumsy manner, we say "nice"; when we wish to denote disinterest via text message, we say "cool." It appears that we have stopped using such simple words genuinely, unless accompanied by aggrandizing adjectives ("OMG, it was literally so cool!"). It has become difficult to discern sarcasm from subtlety; hyperbole is often not used only when disinterest supervenes.
Our predilection for excess stems, perhaps, from our lack of discipline surrounding speech. Our constant use of online fora and digital media allows — even requires, if we want attention — us to be forceful, harsh, one-sided, and emphatic without ramification. It was once the case that the freedom to talk was modulated by the privilege of having people that would listen — abusing the former would cause one to lose the latter. Now, however, this is no longer the case: We may rant ad nauseam, but still manage to retain our friends. In fact, we may rant without our friends ever knowing that we uttered a single word.
The lack of restraint has debased our discourse. Words are powerful weapons, as we often recognize in demanding that others address us with dignity and respect, and ought to be used with care. The next time I find myself reaching instinctively for a superlative, I hope I am able to resist.

Cambridge residents discussed a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority proposal to raise fares for a range of public transportation options, including rail and bus services, by an average of 6.3 percent starting on July 1, 2019 at a public comment session Tuesday.
The proposed fare hikes would increase the cost of riding the T one direction with a CharlieCard from $2.25 to $2.40 and with a CharlieTicket from $2.75 to $2.95. One-way bus ride costs with a CharlieCard would rise from $1.70 to $1.80.
MBTA Deputy Press Secretary Lisa Battison wrote in an emailed statement that the agency must enhance revenue and cut costs in order to control a rising deficit due to increases in union, pension, and healthcare contributions.
“Based on data for the first 6 months of the year, the MBTA is on track to receive a deficit of $36.5 million,” she wrote. “Even as the MBTA continues to focus on controlling costs and growing non-fare revenue, this proposed increase, which is in line with the rate of inflation in the Boston area, is necessary for the Authority to continue making system investments to improve service.”
State law limits the MBTA to rate increases of 7 percent or less within a two-year period. The last rate hike was in 2016.
The MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board will vote on the proposed fare hikes this March, after hearing public comment during at least twelve community meetings across the Boston metropolitan area.
The MBTA held one of these community meeting at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School Tuesday evening. At the meeting, local residents criticized the fare hikes.
Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler, who works in Cambridge, said, he believes “it’s going to disproportionately affect the working-class residents of Cambridge.”
“There are other cities making public transportation free right now. We shouldn’t be going the opposite direction with ours and make it more expensive,” he said.
Aaron B. Greiner, who works in Boston, said the MBTA should ensure the increase will not hurt users who already struggle to afford public transportation by providing discounts and "ideally" free passes for people who make under a certain income threshold.
The MBTA conducted an equity analysis in January 2019 to address potential concerns surrounding the rate hikes. The report concluded the MBTA does not expect there to be a disproportionate impact on minority or low-income riders.
“Non-minority and non-low-income riders use the commuter rail system and other more expensive modes more than minority and low-income riders,” the report states. “At the proposed fare levels, minority and low-income riders would continue to pay lower average fares.”
When weighted by fare usage frequency, the MBTA report predicted rates will increase an average of 5.99 percent for minority riders and 5.65 percent for low-income riders, both smaller increases than the 6.3 percent average for all riders. Both fares, however, are still higher in absolute terms than current rates.
At the Cambridge meeting, MBTA Deputy General Manager Jeffrey D. Gonneville acknowledged the fare increases and their role in sparking a review of investment.
“Yes, this is a fare increase. Fare increases are never pleasant for anybody. However, what this is going to allow us to do is have a dialogue and a discussion about being able to reinvest in our system,” he said.

The College’s Committee on Student Life is considering an audit of “comp” processes — membership training or vetting exercises for student organizations — to eliminate requirements which some committee members believe are “detrimental to campus culture,” according to several attendees of the Feb. 14 committee meeting.
Concerns voiced among members of the committee follow previous debate within the Undergraduate Council about the merits of comps and the requirements some organizations establish for prospective members. In 2016, the UC’s Finance Committee passed legislation tying funding to whether a club’s comp is “legitimate” and meets an “inclusivity standard.”
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said she and UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 proposed that the committee consider the topic because they are concerned about the equity of students’ access to “exclusive” extracurricular opportunities. Many undergraduate organizations require some kind of comp, which can take the form of an application, audition, demonstration of proficiency, interview, or required meetings.
“Harvard is already an exclusive place, and the comp process adds a whole new layer of exclusivity,” Palaniappan said in an interview Monday. “So what are steps we can take to reduce the presence of overly competitive comps that have been difficult for students to navigate and detrimental to the overall campus culture?”
Palaniappan said she believes other problems with comps include intense time commitments, limited transparency about requirements, and a “social component” that students may find “arbitrary” and discouraging.
“The comp process for several organizations skews towards those students who already have experience in a particular area,” she said. “So it can be difficult for a student without any experience to have the same opportunity to partake in something new.”
Katie Colleran, senior director of student organizations and resources in the Dean of Students Office, wrote in an emailed statement that the proposed audit would aim to increase access to extracurricular opportunities.
“We are hoping to look at the bigger picture of why organizations comp and how those processes contribute to their recruitment and community,” she wrote. “One of the benefits of Harvard is the plethora of opportunities available both inside and outside of the classroom.”
Huesa said in an interview Monday that the first stage of the committee’s review will focus on understanding the underlying philosophy of organizations’ requirements. She said that based on the findings of the audit, the committee may then impose regulations on comp processes.
“I think… the next step would be putting in some type of regulation or some sort of stipulation for when clubs are applying for recognition — that they either wouldn't have comp processes or that their comp processes would take a certain form such that they would in some way be adding value or contributing to the experience or the educational mission of the College,” she said.
The long-term goal is to create standardized criteria for assessing comp processes to ensure that they are inclusive and reasonable, according to Palaniappan. She added that the committee will likely not implement any policy until the next academic year, taking this semester to learn more about comp processes for different groups.
“I think the immediate next steps would still be discussing with student organization leaders, and also trying to find more ways to collect feedback from students,” Palaniappan said. “Even once we develop the criteria, I do think that it will be a time-intensive, long process. I definitely know that it’s not something we can rush into, so it won’t happen within this semester.”

The Harvard Divinity School announced Tuesday it will continue with plans to remove the red oak tree in front of the Andover Theological Library, despite objections from some Divinity School students and Cambridge City Council’s one-year moratorium on cutting down trees.
Bartlett Tree Experts, a tree preservation company hired by the Divinity School to assess the red oak, concluded that the tree is a safety hazard and “in irreversible decline,” according to a statement released by the Divinity School. The tree-cutting moratorium, which passed Monday, includes an exception for trees deemed “dead” or “dangerous” by the city’s arborist.
The City of Cambridge reviewed the Bartlett report, and the Commissioner of Department of Public Works, the City Arborist, and the Director of Urban Forestry agreed that the tree must be removed, according to the statement.
Divinity School students and nearby residents have protested the tree’s removal since September, citing its spiritual and environmental importance, They also criticized the school’s decision-making process.
“They’re not taking any input, they’re just planning to cut down trees. It’s like they don’t take their own rhetoric seriously about community engagement and about environmentalism in our own backyard,” Divinity School student Shane H. Brodie said.
The tree is currently surrounded by yellow fencing and scaffolding out of safety concern, according to the school.
“The fence, especially, seems abhorrent to some of us who still want to treat the tree as if it’s a sentient being,” Divinity School student Gretchen T. Legler said.
The Bartlett findings were announced on Feb. 7 at an Agassiz-Baldwin Neighborhood Council meeting. Several students and community members emailed administrators requesting more information, namely that the report’s data be made public, according to Brodie. A summary of the report was included alongside Tuesday’s statement.
Divinity School spokesperson Michael P. Naughton declined to comment beyond Tuesday’s official statement.
Removing the red oak tree is part of a larger plan to renovate Andover Hall, which includes building a multi-faith space and reducing the building’s carbon footprint. The Divinity School plans to mitigate the loss of caliper and canopy provided by the red oak tree.
Brodie, however, claims mature trees provide unique benefits.
“Mature trees provide shade, they help with slowing down rain, they help with infiltration of rain into the soil, they provide habitat,” he said.
If the tree’s removal cannot be prevented, some students have considered ways to honor the tree, according to Legler.
“Some of us have talked about moving on to a public ritual,” she said. “We’ve also thought about creating a conversation around creative ways to use the tree or to incorporate the tree into the new building, to transform the tree so that it’s still a part of our community.”

Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira raised concerns about the logistics of expanding access to naloxone, a drug used to reverse the symptoms of opioid overdose, as HUHS considers a proposal to make the drug more widely available to the public.
Eana X. Meng ’19 and Kailash S. Sundaram ’19 are currently pushing to make naloxone available to the public in automatic external defibrillator cabinets located across Harvard’s campus. Though HUHS is reviewing the proposal, they have not yet taken an official stance, according to Barreira.
In an interview last week, Barreira discussed several logistical hurdles surrounding the implementation of the plan.
“The question in front of us, which we haven't answered yet… is do we really want to make it more ubiquitously available on campus?” Barreira said. “There's a little bit of training involved in doing that, there's a little bit of 'where would it be, and how would you access it.'”
Maria Francesconi, HUHS senior director of nursing and health promotion, said they support making naloxone available on campus but questioned whether a sufficient need exists for expanding access to the drug.
“Once we start putting drugs out into the community, we'd have to put into place some kind of a monitoring system and we'd also have to figure out if a dose got used by someone in the community,” Francesconi said.
She added that CrimsonEMS and the Harvard University Police Department already carry Narcan, a brand of naloxone.
“One of the questions that we still have to talk about with the students who are interested, I think, is what do the students see as the benefit over what currently exists?” Barreira said.
Meng and Sundaram said the benefit of expanding access to the drug outweighs any cost the University might face. They said their current proposal to put naloxone in every AED boxes on campus would cost far less than continuing maintenance of the AED boxes.
“A life is a life, right?” Meng said. “Preventing things is important, and then more than anything, this process has been about raising awareness on the opioid crisis. I think the stats are that at least 100 people overdose in the country a day and just because it's not a visible thing — it's a very silent invisible epidemic — doesn't mean that we should be turning a blind eye to it.”
Beyond the scope of Harvard’s campus, Meng and Sundaram said they believe that their plan will increase accessibility and raise awareness among Cambridge residents. Construction workers and people experiencing homelessness have been disproportionately affected by the opioid epidemic, according to Sundaram.
The two said they believe their proposal could help address the epidemic at large, especially as Harvard continues its construction projects and Cambridge’s homeless population increases.
“With public health, there is often a window of opportunity and if you don't act then, it's often hard to act later down the line,” Sundaram said. “The opioid crisis is on people's minds now and so we have a responsibility as one of the nation's leading universities to step up and hopefully lead the way for other universities to do the same thing.”
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry confirmed in an emailed statement that HUHS is “exploring details of the implementation” of Meng’s and Sundaram’s proposal.
“Before making any decisions, HUHS plans to facilitate conversations across the Harvard community to best understand the needs of various stakeholders for Naloxone,” Perry wrote.
HUHS will respond to Meng’s and Sundaram’s proposal by March 1, according to Francesconi.

Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos will deliver the Harvard Kennedy School’s 2019 graduation address, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced Tuesday.
Santos was the President of Colombia from 2010 to 2018. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for his efforts to end the civil war between Colombia’s government and FARC, a guerilla army. Santos negotiated a peace deal with FARC that was approved by Colombia’s Congress, but was narrowly rejected in an October 2016 referendum. Santos’s term also saw a decline in unemployment, poverty, and Colombia’s murder rate.
“President Santos is a distinguished public servant who has made an important positive difference in the lives of millions of Colombians,” Elmendorf said in a press release. “We are honored to welcome him back to the Kennedy School, from which he received a Mid-Career Master’s in Public Administration degree in 1981.”
Before his election to the Colombian presidency, Santos served as the country’s Minister of National Defense, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, and Minister of Foreign Trade.
Prior to earning his master’s degree at the Kennedy School, Santos studied at the Admiral Padilla Naval Cadet School in Cartagena and served in the Colombian Navy. Santos attended the University of Kansas and the London School of Economics after leaving the Navy.
Santos is currently serving as the Kennedy School’s fourth Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow — a title previously held by prominent world leaders including former Mexican President Felipe Calderón and former Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. His fellowship began in fall 2018 and continues through the spring 2019 term. As an Angelopoulos Fellow, Santos researches, studies, and teaches about issues he tackled during his term as president like human rights and peace.
In 1988, Santos was named a Nieman Fellow for his work as a journalist for the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo.
Santos’s graduation address will take place at the Kennedy School at 2 p.m. on May 29, preceding University-wide commencement exercises the following day.

United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos released a new proposed Title IX rule in November 2018, opening it up for a 60-day comment period that ultimately garnered more than 100,000 pieces of feedback. Since the rule’s release, it has sparked both controversy and confusion. Here’s what we know so far about the rule’s future and how Harvard and other universities will be expected to comply.
Title IX is a federal law that underpins Harvard’s policies on gender and sex-based discrimination. It states that no person in the United States should be discriminated against on the basis of sex in any educational programs or activities that receive federal funding.
At a national level, Title IX is enforced by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. OCR conducts compliance reviews and responds to complaints alleging sex discrimination. All schools that receive funding from the federal government — including Harvard — must abide by rules that govern Title IX enforcement.
In 2011, the Obama-era OCR issued a “Dear Colleague” letter that governed schools’ approach to Title IX for years. DeVos withdrew that guidance in September 2017, and more than a year later, in November 2018, she released her own Title IX rule that would have the force of law if codified.
DeVos’s proposed rule redefines sexual harassment as conduct that is both “severe and pervasive.” This is a shift from Obama-era guidance that defined sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that includes “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
The proposed rule mandates that Title IX investigations include live hearings with cross-examinations, a practice that was discouraged under the Obama administration. The rule will also make all evidence in investigative proceedings available to both parties and eliminate restrictions on parties’ rights to speak about allegations.
The new rule further requires Title IX coordinators to file formal complaints any time there are multiple complaints against one individual, regardless of whether alleged victims want to pursue a formal investigation.
The new rule mandates unprecedented changes to Title IX investigations — a move that has proven controversial for the Department of Education.
Harvard submitted two comments in response to the rule via the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts and the Association of American Universities. The College’s Undergraduate Council, several professors at the Law School, and a number of University student groups also shared their thoughts.
Many of the comments took issue with the new rule, criticizing the new definition of sexual harassment and the mandate that investigations include live hearings. The rule’s opponents argue that the live-hearing requirement will discourage victims from coming forward; those in favor claim the increased systematization will maintain fairness.
Now that the notice-and-comment period has closed, the Department of Education is under legal obligation to consider and respond to all substantive comments, according to Jacob E. Gersen, a Harvard Law School professor who consults on disputes involving federal administrative agencies and Title IX proceedings in higher education.
A spokesperson for the Department of Education confirmed via email that it is currently reviewing the comments and will publish the final rule only after reviewing and considering all public comments.
The review period could take a few months to a year, experts estimate.
“One hundred thousand is a massive amount of comments, and many, many, many of them were highly substantive,” said Cari Simon, a lawyer at the Fierberg National Law Group and a former Law School Gender Violence Program fellow.
In response to a question about how the Department of Education would apply the new rule to already existing investigations filed under the old guidance, a spokesperson for the department said OCR “applies relevant law as it exists, including when changes occur.”
Law School Professor Janet E. Halley said that though some schools are already preparing to comply with the new rule, many will wait to see the final outcome before officially changing their policies.
“I think most schools are going to wait, so they don’t have to put in a bunch of reforms and changes in a pendency period and then reform the reforms,” she said.
Though it is uncertain when the rules will be finalized, it is likely that a proposed Title IX rule will eventually be implemented in some form, Gersen said.
“Proposed rules are sometimes withdrawn, but it is rarely because political opposition to the rule is expressed in the comments,” he wrote. “In my experience, it is quite rare for an agency to abandon a proposed rule entirely because of negative comments.”
OCR complainants who have open Title IX investigations surrounding universities’ compliance are permitted to withdraw their complaints at any time for any reason, including if they do not wish to continue under the eventual rule.
Title IX regulations are enforced through OCR investigations. If a school is found to be out of compliance with Title IX during an investigation, the issue is usually resolved with a voluntary resolution agreement, according to Diane L. Rosenfeld, a Law School lecturer who taught a course about Title IX in the fall.
Schools that repeatedly refuse to comply with Title IX can be threatened with a loss of federal funding. Rosenfeld said, however, that it is unlikely that a school’s funding would ever be revoked in practice.
“While it is a power of the Department of Education, it has, to my knowledge, never been used,” she said.
Simon likened the Title IX rules to a “floor” — a bare minimum for what schools are required to do to address sexual harassment on campus. Even in the face of a rule change, Rosenfeld said she hopes schools will hold their policies constant.
“I would advise schools to not change their policies, and to make sure that their policies and procedures are fair to both sides, and are trauma-informed and sensitive to a student whose education was compromised by sexual assault,” she said.

A previous version of this article misquoted Janet Halley as saying, "They don’t have to put in a bunch of reforms and changes in a dependency period." In fact, she said "pendency period."

Dear Overly Excited First-Year,
You’ve almost made it to Housing Day, the one day of the year Harvard actually shows some school spirit (other than slapping on a red sweater and invisible drunk goggles for Harvard-Yale). Housing Day is one of Harvard’s best remaining traditions (RIP Harvard Time). Truly, it’s a blast — upperclassmen get up at stupid hours of the morning, throw on house gear, and storm the Yard to tell you what house you got.
But for all the fun Housing Day brings, some parts of it can be stressful — namely, blocking. We’re here to tell you that blocking is really not that deep.
Some people will be best friends with their blockmates all four years, some blocking groups dissolve before the end of the semester — and that’s okay. You get here in August, and Harvard basically tells you, “ Welcome! Here’s a new type of schedule! We get that you’re (likely) living on your own for the first time, that there are thousands of clubs to join, and that you have more freedom than you’ve ever had in your whole life, but you’ve got six months to make your lifelong best friends that you want to live with for the remainder of your time here. Piece of cake!”
Take a breath and remember that friends don’t disappear just because they’re not in the same house. There are best friends who live in the Quad and Mather and make it work even through the “long distance” jokes.
If your blocking group is so big it’s threatening to leave someone out, don’t be mean and exclude someone — just split the group and link. No, don’t look at us like that. Just do it. It saves a whole lot of drama and keeps people’s feelings from being hurt. Pull names out of a hat to split the group if you’re really that pressed. You’ll still be in the same neighborhood.
Conversely, if you don’t have someone in mind as the deadline looms closer, or if all the blocking drama reveals how shallow your “friends” are, remember that floating doesn’t make you lame or a loser. It’s easier than you’d think to make new friends once you get to your house. In fact, being a floater might encourage you to get more involved in your house community next year, and meet even more awesome people!
Your blocking group does not have to be made up with your ride-or-dies or people you want to room with. It can be, but it doesn’t have to. (In case no one’s told you, you don’t actually have to lottery to room with your blockmates, a blessing if you’ve got some messy friends or everything falls apart). Your blocking group, at its most basic level, should be made up of people you wouldn’t mind seeing around the dhall for the next three years.
So fret not, first-years! Focus on the fact that every house has its perks and on the excitement of Housing Day, not on whether your blocking group will be the most iconic of all time. We promise you, it won’t be. At the end of the day, it’s really not that deep.
