After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted to end its contract with companies that “perpetuate violations of International Human Rights Laws” during a Tuesday meeting that followed more than seven hours of public comment the previous day.
More than 500 people, among them Harvard affiliates, signed up to speak during the meeting after Councilors Quinton Y. Zondervan, Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Dennis J. Carlone introduced a proposal — which was ultimately amended — for the city to sever ties with companies that have business dealings in Israel, such as Hewlett-Packard, which the councilors charged with “abetting apartheid in the Middle East.”
Due to the high volume of testimony, council business was postponed to Tuesday.
The assistant city manager for business affairs, David J. Kale, found that the city has not had direct contracts with Hewlett-Packard since 2014. He said the city may use their products but would have acquired them through a third party, such as Cambridge’s office supplies vendor W.B. Mason.
Following vigorous public comment, the Council unanimously passed an amended version of the order that omitted mention of Hewlett-Packard and alleged Israeli apartheid. The amended legislation also included language requesting the city manager work with the city’s purchasing department to ascertain if the city has contracts within companies in violation of human rights laws.
“[The City Manager] is hereby requested to work with the Purchasing Department to review Cambridge’s corporate contracts and purchases to identify any vendors or manufacturers whose products are used to perpetuate violations of International Human Rights Laws and Cambridge’s policy on discrimination,” the order reads.
The motion comes on the heels of the worst violence in Israel and Palestine in seven years. After Palestinians protested the anticipated eviction of several Palestinian families living in East Jerusalem, Israeli police clashed with protestors, which left 300 Palestinians injured. In response, the Islamic militant group Hamas launched rockets into Israel, which responded with airstrikes into Gaza.
After 11 days of conflict, 248 Palestinians — including 66 children — were killed, and thousands were left injured or homeless. Twelve Israeli civilians — including two children — and one Israeli soldier were also killed in the fighting.
Zondervan originally introduced the motion to dissolve dealings with Hewlett-Packard at a May 17 meeting. Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 invoked her charter right to push discussion to the following week’s meeting, noting that the Jewish holiday Shavuot could keep observant Jews from calling in for public comment on the day the order was first introduced.
Harvard Chabad Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi wrote an email to Chabad affiliates last Friday urging them to call into the meeting and explain their opposition to the motion. He also wrote the proposal would make Cambridge the first city in the United States to join the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement — a movement that aims to put economic pressure on Israel to shift its policies toward Palestinians — which he called anti-Semitic.
“The deceitful, incendiary rhetoric and anti-Semitic policies being put forth by our elected officials are fueling these emboldened public expressions of hate and violence against Jews throughout the US,” Zarchi wrote. There has been a spike in anti-Semitic violence nationwide in recent weeks.
Simultaneously, organizations such as Cambridge Democratic Socialists of America urged their followers to sign up for public comment in support of the motion.
The meeting saw 530 people sign up for comment and lasted until nearly 1 a.m.
Harvard Hillel Orthodox Rabbi Daniel “Dani” Passow gave public comment at the meeting opposing the policy order. He said voting yes on the policy order would be anti-Semitic “in impact, if not in intent.”
“Israel is regularly singled out for criticism, including by government bodies such as this prestigious council,” Passow said. “In a world filled with genocidal regimes and state-sponsored terrorism, this double standard sends a message that Jews should be treated differently.”
Nolan — who co-sponsored the amended order with Councilors Marc C. McGovern and E. Denise Simmons — said about the original version that “the policy order written does single out one country.”
In the amendment, the City Council added that it “affirms Israel’s right to exist and to defend its citizens from attacks” and “recognizes that violence and suffering is happening around the world in Israel as well as other countries.”
Other Cambridge residents such as Harvard Law School and Business School alumna Tabatha P. Robinson spoke and urged the council to “rethink safety,” citing a 2011 decision by the council to investigate a trip that Cambridge Police Department officers took to Israel to receive security training.
“Whenever I mentioned to Palestinians that I studied at Harvard, people responded by mentioning the Boston Tea Party — ‘no taxation without representation,’ they quoted,” Robinson said. “BDS is reviving this peaceful Massachusetts legacy.”
“Let us align our ethics with our wallets,” she added.
Sobrinho-Wheeler reacted to the vote on Twitter, acknowledging the change to the language of the order.
“It’s not as strong as it could’ve been, but it’s a step to address our connection to state violence against Palestinians,” he wrote.
Zondervan tweeted the order was an “unmistakable victory” despite the changes.
“We voted to end purchasing from companies that violate international human rights laws,” Zondervan wrote. “I want to thank the hundreds of brave activists who gave powerful testimony in solidarity with Palestinian liberation.”
Zarchi, though, remained critical of the order even after it was amended.
“After members of the Cambridge City Council exhibited public discrimination against Jews in our city, any policy order they propose (or modify) related to these discussions, is suspect both in its intent and final outcome,” he wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Secretary of Transportation and former presidential candidate Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 emphasized the generation-defining nature of the current political moment in a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School’s virtual graduation ceremony Thursday.
Introduced by Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf as a “dedicated public leader,” Buttigieg opened his speech by calling the pandemic, confrontations with racism, and climate change the issues that make the current moment “so difficult, so sensitive, so dangerous.”
Although he never attended the Kennedy School, Buttigieg said he spent a lot of his time as an undergraduate working at the school’s Institute of Politics. He spoke about his experience within the school, and told the graduates he was sorry that their experience had to be through a screen.
“I hope you carry the effects of this disrupted season in your lives as a kind of propulsion, a reminder of the importance of the service to which you have been called,” he said.
He compared the feelings of the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic to 9/11, a disaster that his class faced during their time at Harvard. As in the current moment, his class sensed, but didn’t fully grasp, how much of an impact the disaster would have on the world, he noted.
“I do think it’s important to mark the fact that the very thing that has disrupted your experience at the Kennedy School — along with so many other crushing effects in your lives and across the world — can also be a remarkable source of purpose in the public lives that are ahead of you,” he said.
Buttigieg spoke about the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, American Jobs Plan, and American Families Plan.
“Any one of these three endeavors taken individually would be a historic undertaking,”he said. “Collectively, they comprise the greatest investment in our country and people in generations.”
He compared the Biden administration’s plans to efforts of the past, including Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, Teddy Roosevelt’s Square Deal, and Harry Truman’s Fair Deal. He called Biden’s packages the “Big Deal.”
“There’s no denying that their emergence represents a new window of what is possible in this country — a window different in scope and scale, from the limits on our thinking just two years ago,” he said. “The ‘Big Deal’ is based on a big ambition, to demonstrate how good government can indeed do big and good things, and do them well.”
Buttigieg concluded his remarks by noting the graduates’ generation has more experience and lessons learned than previous generations.
“I am eager to see how you will use the wisdom you have learned here to serve your countries, the places you call home, and our kind — humanity — in this decisive time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor emerita and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.) urged the Law School’s 2021 graduating class to “have courage” as they considered their long careers ahead in a speech at the school’s virtual Class Day ceremony Wednesday.
Warren told graduates she hoped they would take the time and have the bravery to explore purposeful careers, instead of following a pre-planned, comfortable future.
“I want to talk about my hope that you will be carried to an unexpected place,” Warren said. “A place where you will find work that you love, work that gives you purpose, and just possibly, work that makes the world a better place.”
Warren joined the Law School as Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law in 1995 and taught there until her successful run for U.S. Senate in 2012. In February 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy for president, eventually earning the third-most delegates in the Democratic primary.
Over the past four years, Warren argued, individuals have “witnessed something” they “never imagined” they would see, citing generations-long racism, a “badly broken” criminal justice system, income inequality, and “growing corporate power.”
“It’s a grim list to talk about on graduation day,” she said. “But this list is why the world needs you.”
Many graduates, Warren said, would likely follow an “already set” path, such as joining a prominent law firm or business. She added that “in all likelihood,” these individuals would “prosper.”
“But graduations are about dreaming big,” she added. “So let me suggest something different, something that requires courage — step off the path.”
Despite taking “pleasure” in the successes of nearly all of her students, Warren said that the ones she was most proud of were those who had the courage to “take risks” and “try something that is truly consequential.”
Warren described a law degree — “particularly” a Harvard law degree — as “a powerful tool,” and remarked that how a graduate chooses to use that tool “matters.”
“You may choose to use it quite profitably, helping clients who are already rich and powerful, get richer and more powerful,” Warren said. “But my own advice is to respectfully ask you to consider other paths where the need is great. I ask you to consider other paths, precisely because you have so much to offer.”
Deviating from the well-trodden path, Warren told the graduates — many of whom already have “jobs lined up” and have prepared for “predictable and secure” futures — is where “courage comes in.”
“I urge you to consider leaving that behind. I urge you to consider a life that is open to public service, open to taking on the troubles that are bearing down on us, open to tackling the crises that are still in the making and we don’t even see yet,” Warren said. “It takes courage — real courage — to step off the path that you have laid out for yourself.”
Using her own life as an example, Warren said taking that leap of faith by entering politics meant she has been able to receive far more.
“I gave up the classroom and the students, and climbed into the political pit for which I was unprepared,” Warren said. “But no matter how many times I wondered how I had gotten myself into this, every single day, no matter what, I’ve awakened in the morning thinking about what I will get to do today. Not ‘have’ to do — ‘get’ to do.”
Her conviction that her career path and work was purposeful, Warren said, was “true” on both the days she has “won” and “lost.”
“Because every day, I’ve known that the work I do matters. Creating more opportunity for other people matters, fighting to right wrongs and demand accountability on behalf of other people matters,” Warren said. “Combating climate change matters, tearing down systemic racism matters — battling to save our democracy matters.”
Warren — admitting that she has not “solved every problem” she encountered and “made mistakes” — said that despite the challenges of the job, she has “stayed after it every day, persistently.” Her decision, Warren added, was “worth it, every single day.”
Though dedicating one’s life and career to serving others took “courage,” Warren said that pursuing a career that helped those who needed it most would gift graduates with “a richer life.”
“When the day comes five or 10 or 20 years from now, when you’re getting together with your classmates, or when that moment comes late at night that steals upon you and you wonder about how you spent your professional life, I guarantee that you will smile a deep-down smile over the parts of your life that you have spent in service to others,” Warren said.
Above making their families and communities proud, Warren urged graduates to both “have” and “choose” courage to make themselves proud.
“I know you can,” Warren concluded. “And I wish you well.”
