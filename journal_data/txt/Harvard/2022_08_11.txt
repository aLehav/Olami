After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year's Governors Ball was special for many. Fans got to see some of their all time favorite performers at the same venue for the first time in years. Performing at New York’s Citi Field in 2022 was also a first for some of the artists too. Here, we break down the performances that stood out on Day Two of the three day festival.
DJ Diesel 
More commonly known as NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal, DJ Diesel pumped up Gov Ball’s  Verizon stage with a host of popular party mixes that had the whole crowd moving. A club remix of BeatKing’s “Then Leave” had the audience reciting the chorus in unison, followed by a bass-heavy rendition of Drowning Pool’s “Bodies.”
“Hands up New York!” Diesel instructed before starting a crowd wave. Moments later, he shouted “take off your shirts New York!” as Right Said Fred’s “I'm Too Sexy” began to blast. He capped off his set with the quintessential college alt-rock anthem — The Killers' “Mr. Brightside,” which belled across the Gov Ball stage. The crowd knew every word.
Denzel Curry
The Verizon stage welcomed Denzel Curry, decked out in black overalls and chains. He began with a synth laden cover of “13LACK 13ALLOONZ,” from his 2018 album “TA13OO.” Following a performance of “This Life” from his album Imperial, Curry teased an early end to the set, running backstage as the music cut off. He re-emerged moments later: “Did y’all think it was over?” he asked the audience. A mix of no’s and cheers filled the arena, as Curry began to perform Imperial’s introductory number “ULT.” Curry encouraged the audience to “go stupid” and form a mosh pit, and many obliged. He then switched to one of his newer tracks — the fast-paced “Sanjuro,” first released earlier this year. He continued with his 2019 hit “SPEEDBOAT,” before closing (for real this time), with “CLOUT CO13A1N.” Before exiting completely, Curry hopped off the stage and into the crowd, giving handshakes and high-fives to enraptured onlookers.
Halsey
Halsey, the Saturday headliner, closed out the night with a candy-colored visual showcase that perfectly encapsulated her pop punk origins. Befitting their position as the star of the festival, they began with their 2015 hit ”Castle.” They then transitioned to the high octane "Easier Than Lying," enveloped in the stage’s piercing red lights and accompanied by a fiery pyrotechnics display. These vibes were turned on their head with “1121,” a ballad describing the stillness of post-heartbreak pain.
“The radio burnt this one the f*ck out,” Halsey warned before playing the next track, their classic pop number “Graveyard.” They went on to stun the crowd with their first ever live performance of “So Good,” before taking their audience back to ‘85 with a cover of Kate Bush’s newly viral queer anthem “Running Up That Hill.” “That was a special moment for me,” Halsey told their fans. Halsey neared the end of their set with one of their biggest hits, “Without Me,” which had the crowd singing along to just about every line. They closed out on with yet another feminist banger, “I am not a woman, I’m a god” — the perfect end to a power-packed set.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final day of the 2022 Governors Ball in New York City brought the energy, the culture, and some of the best vibes of the weekend. A day filled to the brim with fantastic acts and eager crowds, Sunday’s show was the perfect wrap-up to a weekend of nonstop music. Below, we break down the standout performance from festival Day Three.
Becky G
“Where are my Spanish speaking people?” Becky G asked from atop the Go Puff stage, as a feverish roar of excitement erupted from the crowd. “And my non-Spanish speakers too, I love you.”
Becky G owned the Gov Ball stage on Sunday with tracks that pulled heavily from reggaeton and the other Latin American pop genres that have inspired her career. In her signature style, the set consisted almost entirely of Spanish-language tracks. And though many in the audience didn’t speak the language, Becky G had everyone dancing along throughout her set. The pop artist began with her earworm “RAM PAM PAM,” before transitioning to one of her biggest Spanish-language hits, “Sin Pijama.”
Still, the Gov Ball audience eagerly awaited a song they could more easily sing along to, and before long a throwback performance of her breakout hit “Shower” had attendees shouting out every line of the chorus. She followed by performing 2017’s “Mayores,” before surprising festival goers with a guest appearance by Guaynaa to perform “TAJIN.” “Let’s give the people what they want!,” she cheered before the closing song. Her performance of “MAMIII” had G, and the audience, rolling their hips and bobbing their heads.
Jazmine Sullivan 
Jazmine Sullivan graced the Go Puff stage with a set that paid tribute to Black love, self-love, and sisterhood. She began her performance with “Bodies,” the cheeky, low tempo opener of her Grammy Award-winning EP “Heaux Tales.” The track was followed by one of her classic R&B hits — 2008’s “Bust Your Windows” — which had the audience all-but embodying the rage of a scorned woman taking revenge.
Sullivan made sure to connect with her audience, too. With “Put it Down” she described a positive sexual relationship with a partner, and it was here that she took a moment to address the audience directly: “If you’re with someone who isn’t treating you right, say fuck ‘em.” As expletives flew from the audience, Sullivan followed with a declaration of her own self-love, whether or not a partner is present. It led directly into her performance of “Girl Like Me,” to which Sullivan initiated a slow crowd wave.
The show was endlessly fun. With “Hurt Me So Good,” for example, Sullivan taught the audience how to “soul clap” to the beat of the song — most got it in no time. The vibes evolved with a cover of Beyoncé’s “Party,” complete with a 90s-esque Black dance party projected behind the artist. Sullivan’s succeeding cover of Fugees’ “Killing Me Softly With His Song” brought the energy back down to Earth, simulating the constant back and forth of pleasure and pain in unstable relationships. She closed with “Need U Bad,” indicating that despite this back and forth, the love she feels is real and she craves it dearly.
Playboi Carti
Playboi Carti assumed his position as the closing act of this year’s Governors Ball atop a massive pyramid constructed on the headlining stage. Cloaked in a large hoodie, drowned in bright fluorescent strobe lights, and perched several feet above the ground, Carti offered audiences a version of himself that exuded an almost mythic presence. Onstage, he became akin to an ethereal being who, despite performing directly in front of the crowd, was impossibly out of their reach.
Still, Carti’s heavy bass and zeitgeist piercing tunes created a level of energy in the crowd unmet by all prior performers, with the audience jumping and swaying uncontrollably. From his starting track “On That Time” to the end of the show, the crowd did not let up. The performance was truly the closest thing Gov Ball had to a rager.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Masking and Covid-19 testing will remain optional on Harvard’s campus going into the 2022 fall semester and the school will stop providing free PCR tests to affiliates three weeks into the term, the University announced Wednesday.
Harvard students will be required to take one rapid antigen test upon arrival on campus and optional PCR tests will be provided through the first three weeks of the term, but the school will end its testing program on Sept. 16. Antigen tests will still be provided to College students on request from building managers in their houses.
Harvard will not provide isolation housing or contact tracing for affiliates who test positive to start the year.
The announcement, sent to school affiliates Wednesday by Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen, signals that the University will take an unrestrictive approach to managing the pandemic on campus going into the start of the academic year, despite the presence of new Covid variants.
Nguyen said Harvard is “prepared to pivot to more extensive protections,” such as a mask mandate, if warranted by changes in public health conditions.
Students will be eligible to receive eight free rapid antigen tests a month through their private health insurance, Nguyen wrote.
“Antigen testing is a fast, convenient, and reliable way to test when you have symptoms or want confirmation of your COVID status,” Nguyen wrote. “I highly recommend you take advantage of this benefit.”
The University is also monitoring monkeypox cases on campus and consulting public health experts.
Harvard stopped requiring Covid-19 testing in May despite rising Covid-19 cases on campus, citing that “there has not been a corresponding rise in the hospitalization rate.”
The City of Cambridge reported a 6.87 percent Covid-19 positivity rate over the past two weeks as of Aug. 10. Middlesex and Suffolk Counties, where Harvard’s main campuses are located, both have medium Covid-19 community risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Thanks to high immunity levels, many infections are mild,” Nguyen wrote. “However, hospitals continue to see serious illness, especially among older persons, those with chronic medical conditions, and people who are not up to date on vaccination.”
Students who test positive for Covid-19 will continue self-isolating in their dorms. HUHS will offer guidance to infected students via automated email, and students should “continue to notify their close contacts directly,” the announcement said.
HUHS will offer support to those with “complex medical situations as needed,” Nguyen added.
The outbreak of monkeypox, which has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, is an “evolving situation,” Nguyen wrote in his announcement. HUHS is working alongside the state of Massachusetts “to build capacity for testing and vaccine referral,” he added.
HUHS published updated monkeypox guidance on their website on Tuesday, detailing the virus’ symptoms, modes of transmission, vaccine information, and isolation recommendations.
Patients who test positive for monkeypox should remain in isolation until skin lesions are resolved and a new layer of skin is formed, Wednesday’s announcement said. Isolation times will vary from person to person and may last more than 21 days, according to HUHS.
“If you live on campus, HUHS will work with you and your School/Unit to manage your isolation,” per the guidance.
Those living off-campus should isolate at home, HUHS added.
“Mutual respect is a core value, so I ask that we all avoid any language or behaviors that stigmatize individuals or communities with monkeypox infections,” Nguyen wrote.
“While the media has largely focused on sexual transmission routes of this infection, it is important to understand there are other routes of transmission, including direct contact with infectious rashes, scabs, or body fluids and touching items (linens and clothing) previously touched by infectious rashes or body fluids,” Nguyen added.
Individuals who suspect they have a monkeypox infection or exposure and individuals seeking vaccine referral should contact HUHS, Nguyen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal appeals court last week rejected a libel lawsuit filed against Harvard and The Crimson by a former University employee, upholding a lower court’s ruling.
A three-judge U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed a 2020 ruling by a lower court, throwing out a suit filed by ex-Harvard employee Eric Clopper.
Clopper sued the University and The Crimson for defamation and libel in 2020 and alleged that both parties violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. Harvard fired Clopper from a position at Lamont Library’s Language Resource Center following a 2018 performance at Sanders Theatre in which he criticized circumcision.
Clopper, who identifies as Jewish, stripped naked during the performance and referred to Judaism as “an unmasked genital mutilation cult.” Clopper alleged in his suit that The Crimson’s May 3, 2018, headline — which labeled the performance a “Nude, Anti-Semitic Rant” — was false and libelous. He also accused the University of unjustly firing him and conspiring with The Crimson to defame him. (The Crimson is financially and editorially independent from Harvard.)
A federal district judge dismissed Clopper’s claims in 2020. The appeals court panel upheld the dismissal on Monday, rejecting the suit’s libel and labor rights claims.
In a three-page ruling, the judges — William J. Kayatta, Jeffrey R. Howard and Gustavo A. Gelpí — wrote that Clopper could “be terminated for any reason or for no reason” by Harvard because he was an at-will employee at the school. The panel wrote that the “statements underlying” the defamation claim “either were substantially true or were subjective statements.”
The appeals court ruling noted that the Sanders Theatre’s policy book prohibits nudity and Clopper had been warned by the theater’s program manager not to perform naked.
“Under these circumstances, no reasonable employee in the appellant’s position could have thought that Harvard had given him permission to perform nude in Sanders Theatre or that he would suffer no employment consequences for such a performance,” the judges wrote.
The court also affirmed the dismissal of Clopper’s claim that The Crimson interfered with his employment contract at Harvard. The suit “did not set out any false accusations that allegedly interfered with his contract,” the judges wrote.
Clopper’s lead attorney, Andrew DeLaney, declined to comment. Clopper — who is now a law clerk at the Kane Law Firm, according to his LinkedIn page — did not respond to emails seeking comment.
The Crimson’s president, Raquel Coronell Uribe ’23, lauded the ruling.
“We are gratified that the First Circuit has affirmed the thoughtful decision by the district court dismissing all claims against the paper,” Coronell Uribe wrote in a statement. “The court’s sound decision not only protects the right to freedom of the press, but it also validates The Crimson’s enduring commitment to reporting fairly, accurately, and ethically.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, who led his country for seven years before resigning in 2021, will headline a cohort of seven resident fellows joining the Harvard Institute of Politics for the Fall 2022 term.
Löfven, whose selection as a resident fellow was announced by the IOP Thursday, said in a press release that he was “honored to be a part of this program.”
The six other resident fellows are Raul Alvillar, New Mexico state director for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign; Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, professor of constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice; Stephanie Carlton, partner at McKinsey & Company and former senior Republican staffer on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee for Medicaid; Judith LeBlanc, executive director of the Native Organizing Alliance; Matthew Mead, former Governor of Wyoming; and Natalie Tennant, former Secretary of State of West Virginia.
IOP spokesperson Lauren L. Miller said in a statement that the seven resident fellows make up “one of our largest cohorts of resident fellows in the IOP’s recent history.”
Löfven, who was elected leader of Sweden’s center-left Social Democratic Party in 2012, took office as prime minister two years later following the 2014 general election. After stepping down from government, Löfven was appointed co-chair of the United Nations’ high-level advisory board on effective multilateralism by Secretary-General António Guterres.
“I very much look forward to get to know and work together with the next generation of leaders on topics that they find important,” Löfven said. “I will do my best to contribute to their development, and I am sure they will enlighten me as well.”
Outgoing IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said in a statement that he is “proud” to be welcoming the new cohort of resident fellows.
“At a time when our democracy is being tested, the work of the Institute of Politics could not be more important,” Gearan said. “Their extraordinary experiences as prime minister, governor, secretary of state, civil rights attorney, Capitol Hill policymaker, organizer, and campaign leader represent the very best of public service and will advance our brilliant mission to inspire Harvard students to lead lives of consequence.”
The IOP resident fellows will lead study groups on topics such as Native and indigenous organizing, the functioning of international institutions, and Republican policy in the U.S. Senate.
The study groups are slated to begin meeting the week of Sept. 19.
Alexa C. Jordan ’22-’23 and Jessica A. Alexander ’24 said the fellows and study groups program, which they co-chair, is “dedicated” to offering a space for discussion where students can also learn how they can continue to get involved.
“The Fall 2022 Fellows cohort joins us as we navigate unprecedented rulings in the Supreme Court, continued debate over government intervention in public health and safety issues, and the upcoming midterm elections,” they said. “Our seven Resident Fellows each have their own definitions of what it means to be in public service and we look forward to inviting students to work with these fellows, as they continue to determine what political and civic engagement mean to them.”
Raul Alvillar, who will lead a study group on Southwest, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ politics, said the experiences that IOP fellowships foster “are vital for the future of The American democratic experiment.”
“As a third generation Hispanic American and the son of a single mom, the opportunity to serve as a fellow after working four presidential campaigns is the pinnacle of my professional life,” he added.
