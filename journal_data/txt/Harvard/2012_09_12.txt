After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you ever heard of the Happy Planet Index? As a Costa Rican, I hear about it quite a lot. Both the HPI, a project of the New Economics Foundation, and the lesser-known World Database of Happiness, assembled by a Dutch sociologist, put Costa Rica at the top of the rankings. This officially makes Costa Rica the most content country on the planet. (For once, we’re first in the world at something other than potholes per capita.)
The HPI is calculated from a combination of three factors: life expectancy, self-reported well-being, and ecological footprint. Thus, according to its own website, the HPI measures “how many long and happy lives [countries] produce per unit of environmental input.” That sounds like a mouthful at first, but once you think it through for a bit the concept seems to make sense. Traditional measures of wellbeing, such as GDP per capita, simply measure output. They don’t take into account environmental devastation brought about by industrialization or unhappiness stemming from social or economic inequality. The HPI, on the other hand, rewards countries with healthy, satisfied citizens for living within their ecological means. Thus, the HPI tells developing countries they shouldn’t aspire to the living standards of the United States or France, but rather to the smile production of Costa Rica.
So, Costa Rica ranks first in the HPI. Here are some other facts about my country: Recently, a massive sinkhole, caused by faulty construction, opened up under the only highway worthy of that title in the country. Another, brand-new highway (with one lane in either direction), took us 35 years to build and is already falling apart. In some villages, drug traffickers are forcing children to drop out of school and cultivate marijuana. Three recent ex-presidents are accused of serious corruption charges; two were convicted, and one fled to Spain. The current president has a 26 percent approval rating, the lowest of the continent. Our public healthcare system is falling apart. By the way, this isn’t a recent state of affairs. Costa Rica is a country that lives in constant crisis.
Why, you may ask, do we remain the happiest country on Earth? For me, the simple answer is our “pura vida” lifestyle. Costa Ricans are easygoing, friendly, and hospitable people. Most of us live less than a two-hour drive from a beautiful beach. The HPI awards us for being “green,” and while we take good care of our environment, that’s not such a hard thing in the first place: the biodiversity here is simply stunning, and people appreciate that. Put simply, Costa Ricans feel fortunate, despite their myriad misfortunes. Thus, when the latest political crisis or infrastructure collapse rolls around, we take the situation with humor more than anything else. We roll our eyes at it—that’s life as we know it. Can you imagine jokes, rather than outrage, if a sinkhole opened up under the Mass Turnpike?
My point here is that, in Costa Rica at least, happiness seems to stem partly from culture. It’s not at all controversial from an economic viewpoint to suggest a link between happiness and culture, and this is somewhat validated by the fact that five of the top ten countries in the latest HPI ranking are located in Central America, a relatively small and homogeneous region. One of those, El Salvador, has the highest murder rate in the world, and another, Nicaragua, displays levels of poverty one would expect from a war-ravaged Sub-Saharan nation. Living in either one of those (and I have for a time, in both) actually sounds like a pretty grim prospect to me, yet the HPI would have us believe that these countries are worth emulating.
Thus, we approach the core problem with the Happy Planet Index: Happiness and wellbeing are inextricably linked, but they cannot be reduced to the same thing. If Costa Rica got its act together and built better infrastructure (even at the expense of causing a little bit of damage to the environment) our wellbeing would be much higher—we would no longer have to endure endless traffic jams brought about by rock slides or sinkholes, for instance. Yet—here’s the key—our happiness wouldn’t change that much, because it’s largely a consequence of who we are as a people. Improved infrastructure is precisely the sort of advancement that shows up in measures like GDP per capita, and which the HPI ignores completely—forms of progress that undoubtedly change us for the better, though we remain as content as ever.
The HPI is valuable in its own way, but it should be viewed more as an interesting thought experiment than as a guide to development. Yes, traditional economic indicators are flawed, and the environment should not be sacrificed at the altar of development, but for countries to truly advance they must do more than maximize happiness. Don’t get me wrong, I love my country to death. But if Costa Rica is truly our best model of development for the 21st century, then the entire planet is in some truly sinkhole-deep trouble.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Discussions of mental health, mental illness, and suicide are often taboo topics in our society. But while we mourn the loss of Cote K. Laramie ’14, we must also confront the prescient issue of the mental well-being of all students on Harvard’s campus. An event as shocking as the suicide of a fellow student necessitates the immediate need for a more open discussion of the health of the many individuals struggling to deal with this tragedy. If any good is to come of this terrible news, it should lead to a continued frankness and attention to mental health at Harvard and the broad range of services ready for those who need them.
Many students at Harvard and other universities feel the burden of great pressure and resulting stress throughout the course of our semesters at school. Mental health challenges, however, are not always the product of habitual problems like exams, career plans, and the unique social environment of college. True enough, college-age students experience a unique stage of life in which they may be burdened with the expectation to do well academically and are shackled at times by the uncertainty of their futures. Of course, students may also face pressure from financial stresses or personal issues at home.
But not all cases of mental health problems, especially the most serious cases, are created by exogenous forces or temporary situation. Therefore, we should not only encourage a more open dialogue on the frequency of feeling down or anxious about one’s role as a college student; we must also discuss chronic mental health illnesses, like depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety.
Many people shy away from discussing or confronting the topic of mental illness. We frequently discuss depression and anxiety alone with more than a bit of reticence. By doing so, the Harvard community risks ignoring psychological disorders including mood, personality, and dissociative disorders. All of these include conditions that have the potential to completely devastate the mental well-being of the sufferer. At times when mental health arrives at the forefront of our collective focus, mental illness must not be left unnoticed.
It is of course normal to have difficulty telling others about our mental states. For this reason, Harvard students must work to break down the stigma of mental issues not only by speaking up ourselves but also by lending an ear, and learning to lend an ear better, to help those suffering from anxiety, distress, or disorders
No matter what distance one could go in search for an answer, most people could never fully comprehend why or come to terms with the fact that someone they knew decided to take his or her life.  Though suicide is irreversible, it is preventable. Harvard has an array of resources that can help those who are currently suffering from any level of mental anguish, ranging from peer counseling services like Room 13 and Contact Peer Counseling, to Mental Health Services at University Health Services, to the Bureau of Study Council. We encourage all students to make use of these resources whenever they need them.
Everyone deserves mental well-being. No matter how big or small the issue, each member of the Harvard community should feel comfortable discussing and seeking help for any mental health issue they face. Every life is valuable and cherished, and we must work together to support everyone our community by openly discussing mental health and being ready to help those who need us most.

On September 10th, the Chicago Public School District closed its doors to its more than 350,000 students. The district’s teachers have gone on strike after months of heated bargaining between the teacher’s union and the district over contracts. Similar battles have been fought in Boston and New York, among other cities, with parties enduring months, even years, of negotiations. A number of issues have been brought to the table—teacher compensation, extended school days, teacher assessment—but the problems over which these drawn out conflicts have occurred are indicative of a wider crisis at hand.
America’s schools are malfunctioning, the complicated and crumbling mechanisms that control them are antiquated, and without widespread and innovative school reform, the consequences could be devastating.
The crisis in education is enormous and has far-reaching implications. 1.3 million students drop out of school each year—that’s 7,200 students each school day.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly two-thirds of fourth-graders who do not learn how to read by the end of fourth grade will end up in jail or welfare. We are not only failing our children by hindering their ability to succeed, we are also failing to prepare the next generation to compete in an increasingly complex and global economy.
Over the past decade, politicians have been paying more and more attention to America’s decaying school system. Yet many of our leaders fail to understand the intricacies of education policy and the many factors that must be balanced in order to produce effective reforms. School is too often reduced to a simple formula: Kids go to class, read books, learn their multiplication tables, and draw hand turkeys. Teachers stand in front of classrooms, chalk diagrams on the blackboard, and serve as general guidance counselors throughout their students’ learning career.
In reality, public education is a multifaceted partnership between teachers, students, parents, and government. Schools in high-poverty areas often lack access to quality teachers, necessary resources, and the positive environment that enables other schools, usually in suburban areas, to thrive. Something in the formula is plainly broken—there’s a reason students in under-performing districts are not receiving the same quality of education as students in high-performing ones.
Here is where policy comes into play. Politicians like Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney support reforms such as vouchers that would allow students to attend any school in the state they choose, public or private. While vouchers would, in theory, accelerate school improvement by creating competition between high-performing and low-performing schools, they provide no standards of accountability and do not address any of the problems that are causing schools to fail in the first place. Romney’s plan fails to offer solutions to many of the real and thorny issues that are hindering American education—issues like access to federal funding, accountability, standards, and evaluations.
This apparent lack of understanding of the forces that drive education is, frankly, dangerous. We need better and more nuanced reform. President Obama, by contrast, has voiced the kind of fresh and progressive ideas that education policy needs. Reforms like Race to the Top, which encourages discussion and innovative solutions from states and districts, have helped bring much-needed attention to the education crisis. Obama’s emphasis on accountability, strong federal funding, teacher improvement, and turnarounds of under-performing schools has instigated national conversation and experimentation in states and districts, resulting in turnaround schools and public charter schools. Obama has had the political courage to address difficult questions. Furthermore, the leadership, foresight, and open-mindedness he has brought to the table constitute exactly the approach we need in order to make a difference in America’s schools.
Education can no longer take a political back seat. The strength of our education system is crucial to America’s future success and well-being. The process of fixing our nation’s schools is undoubtedly a rocky path to travel: It will be messy, taking political casualties and creating uncertain outcomes—but it is no longer an undertaking we can afford to ignore. President Obama has set an example of the kind innovation the system needs. If we can learn from our mistakes, embrace our successes, and bounce back from our failures, then perhaps we can guarantee the strong and equitable system of education America’s children deserve.
It’s time to roll up our sleeves and prepare to get our hands dirty. Education is the most important investment we can make as a society. It will take hard work, collaboration, and sacrifices on the part of every player involved, but they are sacrifices worth making.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst the stress of study card day, worries over the first assignments of the semester, and rumors about the high-profile cheating scandal, many students’ thoughts on Tuesday wandered back eleven years.
While working on a problem set late Monday night, Emily L. Chen ’15 watched her cell phone’s date change to September 11. Memories of that day returned, and Chen recalled watching news footage in her third grade classroom.
However, Chen had not remembered that the anniversary was approaching until that moment. “I completely forgot until today,” Chen said.
For others, the anniversary was a sober reminder of how their identities were defined for them.
“People have forgotten a bit, but it changed my life. It was hard being Muslim right afterward. In second grade, I was ashamed to tell people I’m Muslim,” Aniqa T. Hassan ’16 said.
Last year, students received an email from the College about a list of events commemorating the 10th anniversary of 9/11 the week before, but this year the day received less attention.
After not hearing about events happening on campus for that day, Peter G. Machtiger ’14, secretary of the Harvard College Veterans Engagement Initiative, took action.
Members of HCVEI, a student-run organization that plans service events and seminars for veterans, brainstormed ideas to commemorate the event, deciding to hold a moment of silence in front of the John Harvard statue.
“I thought the best and simplest way was having people come together as a community,” Machtiger said.
Shortly after noon on Tuesday, nearly 100 students gathered at John Harvard’s feet. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 spoke briefly at Machtiger’s request.
“Let’s think about the contributions that all of us can make by opening our minds and hearts in a bipartisan way,” Dingman said.
News about the moment of silence spread over House lists, but while the American flag hung high over the statue of John Harvard, the anniversary sat at the back of people’s minds.
Naji A. Filali ’14, a member of HCVEI, said he hopes the moment of silence will become an annual event at Harvard, though he said he thinks the tragedy is receding into memory.
“I think it will live on, to a point. It’s kind of like the Civil War—after some point in history, something bigger will happen, and 9/11 will become a bookmark in history,” Filali said.
However, the impacts of the event live on, whether it be in students’ personal lives or in the classroom. A new seminar in the government department looks at the legal implications of 9/11.
“What the course is trying to get at is how do the imperatives of national security, which change in different ways in each sort of era—how does the challenge of responding to those…then change some of our ideas about self-government,” said instructor Adam J. Lebovitz.
Andrew Jewett, an assistant professor of modern American history, said while September 11, 2001 left a major imprint on the nation’s psyche, much of daily life has continued as it was before.
“In some ways it changed us a lot, but in others ways it hasn’t. It hasn’t come home in many of the ways that past wars did. There’s a degree in which life has gone on around us,” Jewett said.

Construction is underway to transform the Science Center Plaza into a dynamic social gathering site that will accommodate more seating, events, and local engagement for the Harvard community.
The project, which commenced last May, is part of Harvard’s Common Spaces program and is taking place in tandem with Cambridge’s structural renovation of the Cambridge Street tunnel’s roof and drainage facilities.
“The goal of the project…is to transform the site from a pedestrian walkway into a vibrant meeting space for Harvard students, faculty and staff events,” said Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal in an email after declining to comment by phone.
Trees will be planted to provide shade around the Science Center and near the entrance to Memorial Hall. The plaza lawn and stones of the Tanner Fountain will be refurbished. Fixed benches and movable tables and chairs will be placed in the area to accommodate campus programming such as performances and winter skating, or daily activities like meals from Science Center food trucks.
New lighting fixtures and bike paths will also be put in place to enhance safety and access for pedestrians and bicyclists in the plaza. Many students travel through the area late at night to reach Annenberg Hall or commute from labs to dorms.
“I’m glad that they’re improving access within the plaza,” said Lily H. Ostrer ’14, adding that there wasn’t a great way for bikers and pedestrians to navigate the space.
Plans for the space also emphasize environmental sustainability. Recycled porcelain will be incorporated in the pavement and information kiosks using solar-powered displays will announce news and events to the community.
In the next few months public access to the plaza will increase and regular programming will steadily return as construction progresses.
Students look forward to a new hub for relaxation and engagement.
“I think it’d be great to have a space to relax, enjoy food, and study. I’d really like to see the construction gone,” said Michael Constant ’16.
Construction of the plaza is expected to be completed by next summer.

The investigation that has heaped scrutiny upon Harvard, sidelined the captains of the men’s basketball team, and landed nearly 2 percent of the student body in disciplinary hot water all began with a 1910 Congressional revolt and a simple typo.
In a letter dated May 14 obtained by The Crimson this week, assistant professor Matthew B. Platt described the series of discoveries that led him to bring the final take-home exams submitted by his students in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” to the attention of the Administrative Board, a move that launched Harvard’s most sweeping and public plagiarism inquiry in recent memory.
The letter, addressed to Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison, narrated Platt’s first suspicions of plagiarism in 13 exams among the 279 submitted in the spring course.
Platt’s initial report prompted the Ad Board to spend the summer reviewing all the final exams. By the time the College publicly announced the investigation on Aug. 30, the number of students under investigation had ballooned to about 125 undergraduates.
Platt’s letter identified two groups of students represented among the first 13 suspicious exams: graduating members of the Class of 2012 and members of the baseball team.
Members of the basketball and football teams have been implicated in the scandal, but no professor or administrator had previously linked any extracurricular organizations to the case.
In his letter, Platt said he had detected similar strings of words in multiple questions on multiple exams, including the same unusual responses, the same misunderstandings of course materials, and an identical typo.
On a bonus question, “all the answers use the same (incorrect) reading of the course material in arguments that are identically structured,” Platt wrote.
He wrote that one of his teaching fellows originally detected suspicious similarities on that question, which read, “Describe two developments in the history of Congress that ostensibly gave individual MCs [members of Congress] in the House greater freedom and/or control but ultimately centralized power in the hands of party leadership.”
Several students answered that question with the same two “somewhat obscure” responses—the Cannon Revolt of 1910 and longtime 19th century Congressman Henry Clay, Platt wrote.
Platt wrote that upon further examination, “comparisons with some of these exams also suggest that there was collaboration on the three other short answer questions and essays.”
Then he compared the suspicious exams with a random test selected from the class.
“I am convinced that the similarities between these papers are not the product of chance,” he concluded.
Also among the shared phrases were “Freddie Mac’s stealth lobbying campaign” and “22, 500 organizations in 2008,” Platt wrote. He also noted that the same typo—an unnecessary space in “22, 500”—was present in two exams.
Interim baseball coach Thomas Lo Ricco could not be reached for comment Tuesday night on the team’s mention in the letter, and team captain Kyle R. Larrow ’13 declined to comment.
Ellison declined to comment on the letter, saying it is a confidential Ad Board document—indeed, it is branded with a “CONFIDENTIAL” stamp.
Platt, who has declined to comment since the scandal first broke, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Tuesday.

Inspired to write and sing for her cousin battling kidney failure, Rylie X. Y. Zhang ’13 moved audiences in China this summer with a live TV performance of her song “I Believe in Dreams.” She and her cousin were one of seven finalist teams who appeared on the TV talent show “China Dream Show,” a spin-off of “Britain’s Got Talent.”
As finalists, Zhang and Li Gen were granted their dream to advocate and raise funds for terminally ill children by Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who is famous for her roles in “Rush Hour 2” and “Memoirs of a Geisha.” They have signed with a music label and plan to use their royalties to create the Rylie and Li Gen Dream Kidney Foundation.
Zhang recalled that early on, the China Dream Show judge asked her cousin what his dream was in an TV interview. He replied, “My dream is to be alive,” Zhang said.
“Our dream is to use our own music and to help others. We’re not here for commercial things,” she said. “We just want to write music and we want to broadcast it in a way that will help other severely ill children.”
Zhang began writing for her cousin Li Gen during her sophomore year at Harvard, when he was removed from the waitlist for a kidney transplant in China. Believing she only had a few months left with him, Zhang decided to write him a song.
“I wanted to make him feel like he had something to hold on to,” she said, “I just wanted to make him happy.”
That song, “Life-Light,” was first played at Harvard College in the spring of 2010, for her friend Jennifer K. Cloutier ’13.
“I honestly just broke down in tears because it was so good and so heartfelt,” Cloutier said.
Soon after, Zhang shared the song online, and it was quickly discovered by listeners in her home country, Canada. One Canadian family was so inspired that they donated $25,000 to help cover the cost of Li Gen’s transplant surgery. That allowed him to get back on the waitlist and receive a new kidney in March of 2011.
After his recovery, Zhang and Li Gen decided to try recording music together. Just two weeks after sharing their music on Youku in November—the Chinese version of YouTube—they were discovered by the directors of “China Dream Show.” After a long-standing invitation, the duo accepted the offer to compete this past March during Zhang’s semester off, when she worked in China.
Now, after her successful season, she has been asked by the “China Dream Show” to return for more performances. She decided instead to come back to Harvard to finish her degree, but plans to go back to China for shows during J-term.
“I think [Rylie’s] story is a really special one and I think it really touches the hearts of so many of us,” said Gorick K. H. Ng ’14, one of Zhang’s friends.
“I think we can all connect emotionally to a family member that has gone through challenging times,” he added. “What’s unique about her story is that she’s chosen to step up and do something about it.”

As news that men’s basketball captain Kyle D. Casey ’13 had withdrawn from College spread from the internet to the Yard, students reacted with surprise and disappointment to the impact of the Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” cheating scandal on the University’s athletic department.
“I think the whole thing is really disappointing, particularly as a Harvard basketball fan,” said Tyrell Dixon ’13, a senior in Kirkland House. “Kyle is a big part of the team. But more generally, as a student, I think it reflects poorly on the University, especially something as pervasive as this.”
Casey, honored as the Crimson’s Most Valuable Player for 2011-2012, led Harvard with 11.4 points per game last season, which culminated with the Crimson winning its first outright Ivy League title on the way to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946.
Many students around campus were unaware of the situation early Tuesday afternoon, after Sports Illustrated broke the story in the early hours of Tuesday morning.
Though Lucas B. Cofer ’16 had not heard the news, he said he believes this latest chapter in the still unfolding scandal takes the incident to a new, graver level.
“[The 1310 Scandal] sent a message early on that coming into any school, cheating would not be tolerated,” Cofer said. “The fact that you can relate [the Gov 1310 cheating scandal] to affecting the athletic department...really makes it that much more serious.”
Dixon described himself as a big fan of Harvard basketball, but agreed that responsibility for any academic indiscretions should be put on the athletes themselves.
“I think [student-athletes] know right from wrong and they knew what they were doing was cheating,” Dixon said.
It is not the responsibility, he added, of the athletic department to “monitor them on something as basic as this, their integrity as students.”
Several students promised their continued support of the rest of the team in the upcoming season, as the Crimson begins its Ivy League title defense in November.
“Losing a captain is tough for any team to go through,” said Serena F. Hagerty ’16, “so if anything, the rest of the team needs more support.”
Dixon also pledged his support to the team for their upcoming season.
“I’m a big fan and I’m going to cheer for the team just as hard,” he said. “[This is] going to be tough to overcome on the court, but I’ll still come and cheer.”
Ali I. Ramirez ’15, a women’s rugby player, wanted the University to do more for the resolution of this investigation.
“I think it’s unfair that Harvard is not being more expedient and more clear with the rules, because it’s affecting a lot of the athletes,” Ramirez said. “It’s not just the athletes that are being affected but also their team and the school as a whole.”
Ramirez said she believes that ambiguous regulations were at the root of the scandal.
“I wouldn’t hold the athletic department accountable for this,” Ramirez said. “I think it’s more Harvard College as a whole, and especially the government class and department, making the rules clear for what is cheating and what is collaboration.”
Students said they understood that varsity sports require a significant time commitment beyond the classroom, but they insisted that standards should be held the same for every student of the College.
“If you are the star player on the athletic side, people support you in that way, but you also have to maintain your classes,” said Hugh P. Zabriskie ’16. “It’s an added weight, but that’s also what makes you so respected on campus. I’m just sad to see it play out as it did.”

The fall semester brings a range of new items to Harvard’s dining halls, including green curry chicken, vegetable loco moco, and swordfish tacos. The new offerings are part of Harvard University Dining Services’ mission to provide different menu items, “make-your-own” stations, and drinks based on feedback received through student satisfaction surveys.
“We’re always listening to feedback, and meet the needs of the community as best as we can,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin said.
This semester, Mondays in the dining halls will be “less-meat Mondays,” and will feature a make-your-own crepe station with sweet and savory fillings. The “less-meat” initiative entails providing students with two vegetarian entrees as opposed to one. Other new items include coconut and tofu soup and homemade deli salads. There are also new soy milk dispensers in the dining halls, by popular demand.
“I’m not a soy milk drinker, but the dispensers look cool,” S. Ethan Lyle ’13 said.
Recurring menu themes from last semester include Sunday bread nights, a fruit bar on Tuesday nights, as well well as internationally-themed Friday nights featuring cuisines such as South American, Southeast Asian, Tex-Mex, and more.
“All of the chefs participate in making recipes,” Martin said. “They try to take things people love and do variations on them.”
According to Martin, HUDS also tries to improve upon items that have proven last popular.
“People weren’t crazy about the fried fish,” Martin said. Now, swordfish tacos will be available.
Also new this semester to HUDS are food labels, detailing nutrient information to a greater extent.
“We’ve enhanced [the menu cards] based on a range of feedback,” Martin said. “If an item is a good source of fiber, the new menu card reflects that. The name [of the item] is a little longer to help you better understand what’s in it.”
Some students also say that they’ve noticed the changes HUDS has implemented, and say that it is a reflection of their feedback.
“I have just a general feeling that [the food] tastes much better,” Rebecca M. Bonne-Annee ’13 said.
“They are definitely getting better,” Paul H. Farber ’13 said.  “The effort is there and the results are showing.”
But for Lyla J. Wasz-Piper ’15, there is still room for improvement.
“I don’t think we’re quite there, but keep on going HUDS,” she said.

In Joe McCormick’s mind, his competitive sporting days were over during his senior year of high school. Aqil Sajjad never thought he would be able to play sports again after his 16th birthday. But for these two and for thousands of other visually-impaired individuals across the United States, the sport of beep baseball (“beepball”) has changed everything.
Both McCormick and Sajjad play beepball, a variation of baseball, for the Association of Blind Citizens’ Boston Renegades, a co-ed team composed of visually-impaired athletes and volunteer coaches. The Renegades give McCormick, a junior in Adams house, and Sajjad, a Harvard graduate student pursuing a Ph.D in theoretical particle physics, an opportunity rarely afforded to legally blind individuals—a chance to compete in athletics at the national level.
McCormick began to lose sight in his right eye in February of his final year of high school and was diagnosed with Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) in the same month.
“I woke up one day, and I looked through a telescope and I thought the lens cap was on,” the Melrose, Mass. native said. “But when I put the other eye in I could see fine. That’s when I realized there was something wrong.”
McCormick eventually began losing sight in his left eye in May of the same year, and now has vision of what he estimates to be around 20/800. (Perfect vision is regarded as 20/20.) Although the engineering sciences concentrator is still partially sighted, his ability to play sports was one aspect of his life most affected by his disease.
“Basically [my] whole blocking group and group of friends are all about sports,” McCormick said. “All throughout school, we’d be playing something on the weekends—just pick up basketball or pick up football or something.… But after losing my vision, I really couldn’t keep up with them as much. I could play, but we’d always have to modify the rules…. It wasn’t the same.”
Sajjad also lost his ability to play the sports under standard rules as a result of his blindness. The native  of Pakistan suffered a retinal detachment in his right eye at the age of 10, and at 16, his left retina also became detached. Sajjad, an avid cricket fan, played the sport throughout his youth until he lost all vision in both eyes.
“When I lost my sight, cricket was the game that I was most crazy about,” Sajjad said. “And when they told me about [blind cricket], it was so different from real cricket…. It seemed like it would be so much less interesting that I didn’t even feel like trying it out.”
Enter beepball into both of these men’s lives. There are six players on the field. Not only are these players legally blind, but they are all also blindfolded so everybody is on a level playing field. There are two sighted coaches, known as “spotters,” on the field as well, whose job it is to alert the fielders of the direction the ball is hit by yelling out a number corresponding to a part of the field.
The batter is also blindfolded, but the pitcher and the catcher are sighted coaches on the batter’s team. The ball—an enlarged softball with a 16-inch circumference instead of a 12-inch one—beeps as it is thrown. There are two four-foot tall foam pillars placed 30 feet down the first and third base lines that begin to beep once the batter makes contact with the ball. The batter does not know which pillar will beep when the ball is hit, and if he runs down the line and touches the beeping pillar before a player in the field picks up the ball, a run is recorded. If a fielder finds the beeping ball and holds it up in the air before the batter touches the pillar, then the batter is out. There are four strikes and one “ball”—one chance to not swing—afforded to a batter and six innings in a complete game.
Sajjad was first introduced to the sport in 2009 and played his first full season for the Boston Renegades in 2010, while McCormick joined the team this past winter.
“Like any other game, it’s competitive,” Sajjad said. “Once you get into it, you feel all the excitement. If things are going well, you’re jumping up and down with excitement, and if things are not going well, you feel like crying.”
The Renegades went 10-5 this season, and traveled to Ames, Iowa in August to compete in the Beepball World Series, where they finished ninth out of 17 teams. At the tournament, McCormick hit .643, an all-time Renegade World Series high.
But for McCormick, playing for the Renegades is about more than just winning or batting well. It’s about being part of a competitive atmosphere again and playing with people who he’s come to regard as close friends.
“It’s so much fun to just hit a ball and know that the defense isn’t going to make a play on it,” McCormick said. “My favorite feeling is just after hitting the ball and hearing the crowd cheer…. Pretty much before this I didn’t really know any other people who are blind…. This was the first time I met people who had vision like mine or much worse, so I was able to meet them [and] get to know all their experiences.”
Sajjad echoes his teammate’s sentiments.
“I think [beepball] is the whole package,” Sajjad said. “And it’s not just the game, it’s that I feel very welcome by the whole team…. The head coaches are amazing. I mean, these guys are all volunteers, and they do it for us…. Initially when I joined, I didn’t know how much I was going to enjoy it. But the team is so nice and awesome, and the game is fun. So I just gradually fell in love with it completely."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team travels to Hamden, Conn. on Wednesday afternoon looking to preserve its undefeated road record. Led by junior co-captain Peyton Johnson and senior Taryn Kurcz offensively and sophomore Bethany Kanten in net, the Crimson (2-1-1) ­will take on Quinnipiac (5-0-1) in Harvard’s last away contest before Ivy League competition begins.
In Harvard’s most recent a matchup—a 3-1 win at Colgate on Sunday—Kanten stopped five of six shots she faced,  increasing her save percentage to 79.3 percent. Against the Bobcats’ strong offense, Kanten will need to turn in another strong performance. Kemesha Woodfine leads all Bobcat players with two goals, accounting for 40 percent of her team’s overall scoring. Junior Aine McKeever, sophomore Christina Cesarini, and freshman Shannon Larkin have also found the back of the net this season.
“I don’t think that their strong offense changes anything for us and what we’re trying to do,” said sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke, who scored the game winner against Colgate. “As we always try to do, we’re going to assume that Quinnipiac will be a good team with a strong offense and do our best.”
In addition to slowing the Bobcats, the Crimson will need offensive production of its own. Johnson and Kurcz have paced Harvard’s offense thus far, with Kurcz tallying a team-high three goals and Johnson recording a team-high four assists and a goal. Urke, senior Aisha Price, sophomore Meg Cassells-Hamby, and freshmen Lauren Varela and Haley Washburn have scored one goal apiece.
Senior goalkeeper Jill Kelley will be in charge of stopping Harvard’s offense. Through four games, Kelley boasts a 92.3-percent save percentage.
“Going into a game, we don’t look to watch out for one specific player to pay more attention to. We focus on stopping the best players during each game,” Urke said. “If Kelley is one of the best players, along with Cesarini, we will watch out for her.”
Harvard and Quinnipiac each have an 11.6 percent shot percentage, putting more pressure on their respective defenses. While the Crimson has an average of two goals per game this season, the Bobcats have an average of one.
Leading up to Wednesday’s game, Harvard has worked on maintaining possession.
“This week we have worked mostly on connecting passes and playing the best as a team. By connecting our passes better, we can improve our number of goals,” Urke said. “Even though we have worked on this all week, we will continue to work on this during the game and hope that it leads us to a win.”
With Sunday’s 1-0 win over Hartford, Quinnipiac extended its home winning streak to four games, a streak that dates back to the 2011 season.
Though Harvard is focused on this win, the players are putting more emphasis on playing well..
“We’re focusing on us, making sure to play well and score goals,” Kanten said. “If we focus more on the other team, that could hurt us in the end, so we’re going into the game [today] without worrying about each team’s record.”
According to Johnson, the Crimson is looking to use this game as preparation for Ivy League play, which begins at Penn on Sept. 21.
“Taking our game to the road is a challenge, but we have to overcome and beat this challenge,” Johnson said. “We know that the Ivies are not far away, so we need to keep our eyes focused ahead. If we win against Quinnipiac, we will definitely have more confidence going against Penn.”

Everywhere you look around Harvard, signs of construction greet you. It's time to say "out with the old, and in with the new," as Quincy House renovates Old Quincy and moves some of its students to Dewolfe and apartment buildings. FM decided to check out swing housing in Hampden Hall and see how the apartments compare to normal dorms.
 
THE SETUP
Similar to most dorm room, the apartments have "n" housing with a common room, bedrooms, and bathroom. The only difference is the rooms are clean. Very clean. Well at least before students started living in them. 
 
THE FURNISHINGS 
Don't worry about buying a new couch because every apartment comes furnished with a navy blue, polka-dotted loveseat. Rooms also include typical furniture like desks, beds, and wardrobes. All apartments have wood flooring—very shiny wood at that. 
 
THE KITCHEN
Can't wake up for breakfast? No problem. Formerly, Dewolfe was one of the few living options that offered a kitchen. However, now the apartments provided by Quincy give residents the chance to concoct their own late night snacks. Each kitchenette comes equipped with a stove, oven, and refrigerator. 
 
THE HALLWAY COMMON ROOM
Every house needs a place where students from the floor or entryway can come together to relax. To provide this for students in swing housing, Quincy converted apartment rooms into public common rooms, in which students can gather together, whether it be for study breaks or study groups. Common rooms have everything from flat screens TVs to sofas to ping pong tables.
 
THE DISTANCE
Adams used to be the closest upperclassman housing to the Yard. Now, the apartments above the Harvard Bookstore and JP Licks claim this title. Students who live in the apartments not only get working elevators, but they also get the fortune of living right across the street from the Yard. While many upperclassmen have to wake up earlier to catch the shuttle, residents in the Quincy swing space can roll out of bed five minutes before class. Upperclassman housing with freshman perks. 
 
However, being closer to the Yard also means being farther away from Quincy itself, but students in the swing space don't seem to mind. 
 
"I really think that Quincy is doing a great job to make us feel like we are a part of the house," said Chris S. White '15, a resident of Hampden Hall.

It's the most wonderful time of the year for elite institutions of higher education: the release of college rankings. And Harvard has much to be jolly about as top accolades roll in once again.
Third parties assess colleges on a variety of factors, such as quality of faculty, freshman retention, and graduation rate, ultimately boiling down the intangibles of the college experience into succinct lists for eager high school students and parents to pore over.
U.S. News and World Report, for many the ultimate Santa Claus of college rankings, granted both Harvard and Princeton the gift of sharing first place in the National University category of its annual ranking, released today.
Harvard also received a little international good cheer from the QS World University Rankings, released this week, which rated Harvard third. The University of Cambridge made second and MIT first. Seems like the cities of Cambridge on both sides of the pond are doing something right.
It's lonely at the top, though. The Chronicle of Higher Education released an interactive graphic on Monday, which visually represents "comparison groups," lists of peer institutions that universities submit to the U.S. Department of Education for comparison. While 25 colleges, including Stevens Institute of Technology and University of Phoenix, Jersey City, consider Harvard to be a peer, Harvard only chose to list three: Princeton, Stanford, and Yale.
Maybe Harvard is a Scrooge after all.
