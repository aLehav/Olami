The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study has raised $55 million towards its $70 million capital campaign fundraising goal, according to Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth Cohen, placing the Institute at nearly 80 percent of its target.
At this year’s Radcliffe Day ceremony, Cohen thanked the Harvard affiliates in attendance for their financial contributions, noting that contributions came from more than 6,300 households that made more than 17,000 gifts.
This time last year, the total amount raised in its campaign was $44 million. The school’s individual campaign has been publicly underway for about two and a half years.
Cohen said at the event she was “especially grateful and proud” that donors came from across the University and from all 50 states, 23 countries, and “every class since 1933.”
Radcliffe’s campaign goal constitutes approximately one percent of the University-wide fundraising goal—6.5 billion dollars. Funds will contribute to the Institute's fellows program, which brings researchers to Radcliffe each year to undertake a project, as well as its undergraduate research program, among other priorities.
