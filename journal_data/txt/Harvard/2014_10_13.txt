After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any illusions of conventional romance conjured up by its theatrical trailer are promptly shattered by the dramatic two-minute continuous opening shot of “The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby.” An exquisite yet simple long take follows the titular character (played by Jessica Chastain) as she bicycles to the apex of a low bridge. From an angle that highlights the grief and pallor of the character's face, the camera swings around to settle on a close-up of the back of Rigby's head. The angle of the shot keeps the focus of the viewer on Rigby herself—until she suddenly walks out of the frame. The viewer is left to simply listen as she climbs the clinking fence and jumps off the bridge as a bystander exclaims and runs toward her. The entire sequence screams, “This is not just a love story.” But what kind of story is it?
Part of the film’s character comes from its own structure, which casts it as an exploration of grief from different viewpoints. “The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby” is actually a series composed of three discrete films: “Her,” “Him,” and “Them.” (This review deals with only the first two films; “Them” premiered last month.) Each tells, from a different character’s perspective, the same story: the relationship, estrangement, and struggles of a young couple. Essentially, each plot follows the story of Eleanor Rigby and Conor Ludlow (James McAvoy) as they each try to process a personal tragedy, searching for catharsis and a semblance of their normal lives. Rigby, played by a restrained yet internally volatile Chastain, has run away from her marriage. Her jump from the bridge is not so much a suicide attempt as a cry for help. She returns to her childhood home, begins taking university courses again, and tries to regain her sense of purpose. Repeatedly appearing in her narrative is her husband, Conor. His story, though represented in “Her”, only begins to make sense in “Him”, which screens directly after Rigby’s story. For Conor, the story is a recovery not just from his own share of tragedy but from the distance that depression creates between him and his wife. In addition, he struggles to manage his restaurant bar in New York City independently from his father, who is a successful restaurant owner.
Director Ned Benson employs a variety of techniques to convey the uniqueness of each narrative. The clearest difference is in the color palette of each film. “Her,” though filled with moments of doubt and anguish, has very warm cinematography, while “Him” is much cooler in color tone. Benson’s more subtle method of differentiation, however, is more striking: each film has slight variations in the script. For example, in Eleanor’s version of events, she walks to the subway in a dark-colored outfit, pausing at one point to look back over her shoulder at graffiti, as if she feels someone watching her. The sequence is accompanied by pensive yet light music (scored by the musical artist Son Lux). In Conor’s version, however, he watches her walk past in a green dress while smoking a cigarette, not pausing a single moment before descending the subway stairs. The music is much tenser and more anxious. These kinds of small moments do not seem to dictate what actually occurred so much as they suggest the subjectivity of experience and make the viewer think about each character’s motivations and perceptions.
Chastain and McAvoy have a very particular kind of chemistry, pleasantly complicated by the intertwining of romance and confrontation. Chastain’s performance as Eleanor is not ground-breaking, but it is fully realized. Perhaps the finest moments come when Chastain demonstrates the ultimate volatility of grief—at times, Eleanor’s demeanor hints at an instability hidden beneath a veneer of calm. McAvoy’s performance shines best when in conversation with Chastain. At one point, when Conor and Eleanor are discussing an instance of infidelity, he becomes incredibly anguished over Eleanor’s lack of response. He implores her to scream at him, begging her in a pained voice: “You’re supposed to say this.” This emotionally strained Conor often feels absent in moments of solitude.
The truly notable aspects of this film, however, are not in performance but in storytelling. Benson is fond of using very long takes just for the sake of getting into the rhythm of each character’s existence—there are hardly any jump cuts used. At times, his shots feel unnecessarily long, but this might just be in comparison with popular movie editing, which is aimed at effect rather than realism. This difference is ultimately the film’s attraction: it is not another neatly packaged dramatic romance. It is, however, a unique and artistically minded exploration of grief, loss, and personal growth that acknowledges the variant versions of what might seem to be a single narrative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong showing on the West Coast last weekend in which the Harvard men’s water polo team (13-5, 3-3 CWPA) went undefeated in five games, the Crimson hoped to carry that momentum into this weekend’s two matches against No. 13 Brown (12-4, 6-1) and Connecticut College (2-7, 0-1). Despite coming away with a win in its second game against the Camels after suffering a defeat at the hands of Brown, Harvard struggled on the defensive end and came away unsatisfied with its results.
“We had a tough day defensively,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “We gave up 34 goals in two games, and that’s way too many goals.”
HARVARD 22, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 14
The Crimson managed to continue its domination of Connecticut College this weekend with a high scoring victory on Saturday evening. This was the second time the two teams have faced each other this year, as they met during preseason action in the Bruno Fall Classic in September. In its first contest, the Crimson defeated the Camels by a score of 17-11.
Saturday’s win pushed the Crimson’s win streak against Connecticut College to 22 games, although this one wasn’t the prettiest of wins. The 14 goals scored by the Camels represented the most they have scored all season against any opponent.
In order to overcome the struggling defense, the offense successfully took control of the game and tallied a season-high 22 goals. Harvard scored early, and scored often. Despite a few rallies by the Camels, Harvard maintained a steady lead through most of the game. A fourth quarter shutout allowed the team to hold on to its eight-goal margin.
Junior Blake Lee led the offensive charge for the Crimson, finding the back of the net six times and dishing it off to his teammates for an additional three assists.
"I was happy we won the second game against Connecticut College, but I still didn't think we were playing up to our potential," junior goalie Colin Woolway said. "That said, I was happy we rebounded mentally and were able to get the win."
The Crimson will get another chance to face the Camels in just two weeks, this time in Cambridge on Oct 25.
BROWN 19, HARVARD 11
The Crimson failed to continue its five-game win streak against a tough Ivy League opponent in Brown. The Bears, on the other hand, were able to extend their win streak to eight games.
The last time the two teams faced each other, Brown defeated the Crimson by a score of 13-8. Although Harvard kept the game close early on, ejections and fouls plagued the team as the Crimson was consistently down a player in the pool, leading to its eventual defeat.
Though the offense scored in double digits for the fifth time in six games, it wasn’t enough to escape Brown’s strong attack. High scoring contests have been the Bears’ strength all season, led by senior Nick Deaver who had five goals in this weekend’s showdown.
Harvard kept the game close early on and ended the first half with the score tied at six. Brown began to pull away, however, in the third quarter as the Bears outscored the Crimson 5-2. The Bears put the game firmly out of reach by scoring eight goals in the fourth quarter, compared to the Crimson’s two.
“They executed in the second half,” Minnis said.” Just like last time we went from a close game in the first half to them taking it away in the second half. They did a good job of putting the ball in the back of the goal and we just didn’t respond.”
Sophomore Viktor Wrobel led the Harvard offense with four goals in the match as he scored one in each frame. Junior Ben Zepfel also contributed three tallies for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, a visit to the Empire State yielded two league wins for the Harvard women’s volleyball team. By dispatching Cornell on Friday and Columbia on Saturday, the Crimson climbed into a tie for third place in the Ancient Eight and dispelled memories of a straight-set loss to Brown last weekend.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 2
Freshman outside hitter Paige Kebe recorded six of her career-high 22 kills in the decisive fifth set, and the Crimson (10-4, 3-2 Ivy) held on to beat Columbia (7-7, 3-2) after conceding a 2-1 set lead in New York City.
“The defense and the setters were putting the ball right where it needed to be,” Kebe said. “And the bench did a great job of helping me out with shot selection. I just tried to play with intensity.”
After pulling away to win the third set, 25-19, Harvard seemed on the verge of victory. But the Lions used an efficient attack to win the fourth frame and push the fifth to a 15-all tie. Ultimately, a kill by sophomore setter Corie Bain and a Columbia serving error gave Harvard the win.
By the middle of the second set, Kebe had equaled her previous match-high of eight kills. She had set this record only the day before against the Big Red.
“Her confidence from the game versus Cornell definitely carried over,” Bain said. “She was able to be our big gun in a tight game, which I am so proud of as her teammate and setter.”
Bain also performed at a high level. For the second consecutive match, she finished with a triple double, notching 43 assists, 12 digs, and 16 kills.
The game began with a competitive first frame that climbed up to a 22-all deadlock. Harvard regained the lead after two attacking errors by the Lions, and claimed the set with a kill by junior outside hitter Jennifer Shults.
“We knew that we could win the game against Columbia,” said sophomore outside hitter Grace Weghorst. “The confidence that we had in our team’s ability…[pushed] us through the fifth set.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 0
In a match that was never in doubt, Harvard rode a strong defense to a straight set win over the Big Red in Ithaca, NY. No Cornell player (3-12, 0-5) topped eight kills as the home team finished with a .077 hitting percentage.
“We played our system and we knew what to expect going into the game because we had studied their hitters,” Weghorst said. “I think that’s what really made the difference.”
Although Cornell challenged Harvard in the second set, the Crimson managed to squeeze out of a 21-all tie thanks to kills from Bain and senior middle blocker Caroline Walters. The third frame was quite different as Harvard fell behind only once—on the first point of the set.
For the Crimson, the victory followed a disappointing 3-0 loss last weekend to a Brown squad that had yet to celebrate a conference win.
“The victories allow us to have a lot of motivation to push hard this week and next weekend,” Bain said. “I couldn’t be more excited.”
Bain topped the team with 11 kills en route to a triple double. She also led the Crimson with 15 digs and was second with 12 assists.
Harvard set the tone of the match with the opening points. With a flurry of kills, the Crimson jumped out to an 11-3 advantage and forced Cornell to play catch up from the get-go.
“We are definitely coming into our element and…starting to work well together as a team,” Kebe said. “I can’t wait to see what is in store for us as we finish the first round of Ivy play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman forward Dani Stollar and co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby each scored goals to propel the Harvard women’s soccer team to victory over Cornell, 2-0, at Soldiers Field on Saturday.
Harvard (7-3-2, 2-0-1 Ivy) dominated the Big Red (6-5-0, 1-2-0) on a cold, rainy afternoon to keep its Ivy League unbeaten streak intact at 11 games and remain atop the Ancient Eight standings.
In the contest’s opening minutes, both teams struggled to control the ball as they traded possession in the midfield and had few opportunities on goal. The Crimson showed no signs of fatigue despite coming into the contest having played three consecutive overtime games.
It was clear from the opening whistle that the Harvard defense was at its best, as the Crimson defenders swarmed to the ball and cut off Cornell passes, barely letting the Big Red get the ball into the attacking third.
Harvard allowed just five shots all game and senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba made two saves en route to the Crimson’s eighth shutout of the season. Emba continued her recent strong play, as she has surrendered goals in only two of the nine games in which she has played this year. Harvard is yet to allow a goal through three conference games, and Emba has seen action in each of those contests.
“They’re defending the spaces very, very well—good chemistry, good goalkeeping,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “It’s not just the [backline], the team defense was excellent today.”
On the offensive side, the Crimson broke out of the slump that had held it to just one goal in the past three games. In the 19th minute, sophomore forward Midge Purce blasted a shot from outside the box that nailed the crossbar and landed on the goal line before bouncing back into play.
The Harvard barrage continued from there, as the Crimson, led by Purce, fired eight shots before Cornell recorded its first. Harvard broke through in the 31st minute, as Stollar ripped a shot from the top of the box to the lower left corner of the goal. The Crimson continued to press at the end of the first frame and outshot the Big Red, 10-2, in the first 45 minutes of play.
After halftime, Harvard refused to sit back and protect its lead, coming out with just as much energy as it had in the first half. In the 53rd minute, the Crimson tallied an insurance goal as Casscells-Hamby finished a header off a cross from junior forward Emily Mosbacher.
“It was just a great ball by [Mosbacher], as soon as she got around the corner I just tried to get in the right spot.” Casscells-Hamby said. “I was just in the right spot at the right time.”
For the rest of the game, Harvard continued to threaten to add to its lead, narrowly missing on a number of solid chances. Cornell mustered only three shots in the second half as the Harvard defense clamped down, never allowing the Big Red any hope of getting back into the contest.
“We were really getting around the corner well and finishing our chances, and we had a lot of runners coming in,” Casscells-Hamby said. “It was good all around.”
Purce and Mosbacher led the way for the Crimson, recording eight and six shots, respectively, while junior midfielder Haley Washburn added four.
The Harvard offense has been balanced all season long, as nine different players have found the back of the net this year. Purce leads the way with four goals, and Casscells-Hamby and Mosbacher have each notched three.
“[I’m] just really, really proud of the way we played today,” Leone said. “We’ve been giving effort, maximum effort in all these games, that has not been the issue. Just the movement of the ball, the support of everyone, and our flow was just so much better [today] than it’s been in the last few weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 48th minute goal by senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi was the lone score in the Harvard men’s soccer team’s (7-3-0, 2-0 Ivy) 1-0 victory over Cornell (6-4-1, 0-2-0) Saturday at Soldiers Field. It was the team’s ninth win in 10 home contests and one that maintained its perfect home record in 2014.
“We know that when we are playing on this field there’s no way that we are losing,” Kobayashi said. “Whenever we play a home game, we have a really good mentality going into the game.”
After a scoreless first half in which all five of its shots missed the goal, the Crimson came out and controlled the ball from the beginning of the second half. Big Red goalkeeper Zach Zagorski, who had surrendered just five goals all year, withstood the initial barrage—parrying away a header from junior co-captain Mark Ashby a minute in.
“He is very good. He is not very tall but he gets the height; he’s very brave,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “He gets down low really well. He is very good with his feet and he is an outstanding goalie.”
The steady Cornell defense, however, made its first mistake of the game after a deflected shot in a box early in the second half. Freshman midfielder Christian Sady controlled the ball and noticed a wide-open Kobayashi behind the defenders. Two touches later, Harvard had the lead.
A jubilant Kobayashi jumped onto the nets surrounding the field, falling back into the waiting arms of teammates. Forty minutes remained, but the Big Red would only get off a single shot on goal the rest of the way.
“They are by far the best defensive team we’ve played and that makes it difficult,” Lehrer said. “We had to scrape for second balls…to get going. [But] those guys are resilient and fight through everything.”
The stakes were high. A loss would ostensibly eliminate Cornell—the 2012 league champions—from this year’s race, considering the Big Red’s 1-0 loss to 2013 champion Penn a week before. For Harvard, which ends the season in Philadelphia, it was an early opportunity to strike a knockout blow to a rival’s league hopes.
With Cornell fighting to stay alive, tension clearly bubbled to the surface. Harvard committed 22 fouls on the game as five total yellow cards were handed out. After a late whistle blew against Cornell, the Big Red coach erupted at the referees, drawing a yellow card in the 77th minute. A minute later, continued jawing at the official brought out the red.
Ignoring the distractions on the other bench, the Crimson seized the moment, shutting down the Big Red and extending its scoreless streak to 254 consecutive minutes of game time. Led by Ashby, Harvard locked down the wings of the field and forced the Big Red to navigate through the middle, where Crimson defenders swarmed to the ball. Junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez made only two saves all game as Cornell failed to generate good chances.
“[Ashby] is a fantastic player and he leads the entire group,” Lehrer said. “They do the little things, and what gets them their result is that each player focuses on what they can do to make it work every game, and Mark orchestrates that.”
The team’s second straight shutout comes after giving up two goals in six of the first eight games of the season. Dating back to last year, the Crimson has allowed just six goals in its last eight Ivy League contests. Lehrer noted that the improved results have not come from big picture adjustments, but consistent improvement on the team’s general scheme.
“We just work hard to get better at what we do and make our strength into a great strength,” Lehrer said. “We work daily on how we defend.”

Harvard field hockey (7-4, 1-2 Ivy) added another win to its record on Sunday, beating Fairfield (5-10, 0-2 America East), 3-0, on the road.
Freshman Hannah Wellington started the Crimson off strong, with a goal at 9:00 off a penalty corner taken by freshman Ellie Cookson. The momentum continued with another goal 10 minutes later by senior Kaitlyn Boudah. After Fairfield goalie Caitlin Bennett blocked an initial shot, Boudah followed up, driving the puck into the back of the net.
“I think we’re a passing team and we did really well moving the ball quickly,” captain Caitlin Rea said. “Everyone was getting touches and everyone was around the circle. That’s why we had a lot of opportunity passing the ball to different players.”
Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden elaborated on the importance of the team’s game plan, which focuses on quick and simple passes.
“We showed a lot of structure,” van Herwaarden said. “I think our technical plan and the execution of the game plan worked well in our favor. We’ve been doing quite well so far connecting and giving the easy pass.”
This game plan proved effective, as the Stags found themselves down three goals only 24 minutes into the first half. The final Crimson goal came from senior Noel Painter, unassisted, who increased Harvard’s lead by following up on her own shot.
Painter attributes much of her success to the effort and teamwork the Crimson displays on the field.
“I couldn’t have scored any of those goals or had any of those assists without my teammates being in the right positions and making the play possible,” said Painter, who leads the team with six goals and four assists this season.
Harvard’s defense dominated throughout the game, keeping Fairfield to one shot on goal early in the first half.
Painter hopes her team can continue to improve its level of intensity as the season wears on, maintaining a consistent effort throughout the entirety of the game.
“Every game you have a strong 15 minutes and you have a 5 minute slump and so on and so forth,” Painter said. “We want to limit those slumps in our game and play a full 70 minutes hard.”
Regardless of the loss of momentum in the second half, the Crimson managed to add another win to its record, moving one step closer to a winning season—one of the team’s biggest goals.
Harvard started off winning its first five games, the program’s best start in history. However, after losing four of the last five matches, a victory over Fairfield provides an opportunity for the Crimson to gain the momentum it needs to compete in the rest of its season.
“We’re just at the halfway point through our season where we’re now looking at a 7-4 record [instead of 6-5],” van Herwaarden said. “That’s a huge difference in terms of what we want to get out of the season and in terms of what we want to stand for.”
Harvard’s next game is against Cornell (8-3, 3-0 Ivy), an Ancient Eight frontrunner. Riding the momentum of this weekend’s win, the team plans to stick with what it knows.
“We’re very confident that if we play our game we can play with anyone in this league and in this country,” van Herwaarden said.

HUPD has had their hands full with us Harvard students over the past few weeks. Between annoying texts, stolen cleaning supplies, and wall twerking, it seems that a lot's been going on around campus. As part of our Securitas Series, we've combed through recent HUPD logs and published some of the more colorful entries below.

October 6Officer dispatched to take a report of a stolen package containing a leather toiletry bag valued at $300.00.Is this overestimating or overcompensating?
October 7Officers while monitoring a lecture observed an individual constantly interrupting the lecturer. The moderator asked the individual to quiet down numerous times to which they did not comply. The moderator requested the individual to be escorted out of the area. Dreams do come true. HUPD finally takes down the overeager participant in lecture we all love to hate.

Last Saturday, a reporter from “Campus Reform” came to Harvard to ask students if “America or ISIS poses a greater threat to world peace?” In case you haven’t heard, the video went viral. Within hours Fox News picked it up, and then commented on it during their show Outnumbered.

Now, without discussing the political merits of either argument, here are a couple moments of hilarity, irrationality, and downright absurdity from Fox’s response:
#OneLuckyGuy In Reference to Harvard Students:
“They’re a threat to the gene pool…”
Really? We’re a threat to the gene pool? People want to buy our sperm for $1200. A Harvard student could probably make more money in 20 minutes than Fox News did making this video.
In reference to the fact that many countries require citizens to serve in the military:
 “And I’m not saying that’s necessarily the case in Cambridge, or Harvard, or whatever we’re talking about…”
Girl, you know Harvard’s in Cambridge. Your rejection letter was stamped with 02138. And in case you’ve forgotten, the ENTIRE United States of America has a volunteer military, which means regardless of where you live in America, you can be a citizen without serving too.
In reference to the comments of three Harvard Students in Campus Reform’s video:
“The sample size might have been Harvard here…”
The video features 3 Harvard students. Three. Out of 6400 undergraduates. 0.05% is a pretty solid sample size to extrapolate to the views of the entire university, right? Solid reporting.
In response to a claim that everyone should drive Teslas to reduce the dependency on foreign oil:
“What about a Horse? C’mon, What about a horse? Ride a Horse, Ride a Cow…”
Honestly John Wayne, we don’t even know where to start.

It’s that time of year again! While Harvard is observing Columbus Day with no classes today, the holiday isn’t celebrated in all parts of the country. Only 34 states recognize Columbus Day as a legal holiday, and some US cities such as Minneapolis and Seattle have renamed it Indigenous People’s Day.
Columbus aside, major shoutout to whoever decided to put this holiday on a Monday. Because of them, we've had an extra night to party, and we're postponing our inevitable end-of-the-weekend panic a whole 24 hours. Cheers to that! Whether or not you agree with celebrating Columbus, here are some fun facts about the man of the day:

Good morning, Harvard! We’ll keep this one short and sweet so you can make the most of your 3-day weekend. Whether this means vaguely checking the time on your phone and then rolling back into bed, cramming for the slew of midterms you have this week, or ignoring your academic duties (I mean, the part where you panic and hate yourself for procrastinating is reserved for the late hours of the night anyways, right?) and doing something fun with a day off, we all love Monday’s off because the countdown to the weekend is just that much closer!

It’s going to be a sunny and nice day today with a high of 67 degrees! Keep telling yourself that the nice weather totally justifies ditching your plans at Lamont and eventually you’ll believe it and feel no qualms!
