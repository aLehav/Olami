Welsh indie pop group Los Campesinos! started off with a youthful, joyous sound, but in recent years they’ve injected gloom and despair into their work, progressing towards a more mature image. Titled “No Blues,” the band’s newest album seems poised to take a turn for the optimistic, but with Los Campesinos! first impressions are often deceptive. On “No Blues,” the group has captured the best of both worlds—combining the darker tone that has garnered applause from critics with the youthful energy they once feared would shackle them to the “twee-pop” genre.
After a deceptively calm start the opening track, “For Flotsam,” explodes with palpable enthusiasm. The beat drives forward, with a buzzing undertone that suggests energy barely contained. Lead singer and lyricist Gareth Paisley's voice is strong, almost jubilant as he exclaims “Knees knocking and / Blood flowing so / I want you to know that I want to.” The images here are so bursting with life that they almost obscure memory of the track's darker opening lines: “You say you're an old cassette that has gone and spilt it's spool.”
 
Despite the band’s moments of levity, the darkness that has marked its older releases is irrepressible, reappearing throughout the album. Themes of death and decay emerge everywhere—subtly in some songs, but taking over entirely in the self-described murder ballad “A Portrait of the Trequartista as a Young Man” and the aptly named “Cemetery Gaits.”  In an ironic twist at the beginning of “As Lucerne/The Low,” it’s revealed that the album title, rather than promising an upbeat collection, was merely foreshadowing the lyric “There is no blues that can sound as heartfelt as mine.”
 
  The lively, passionate sound that kick-started the career of Los Campesinos! career is still there, tempered by a sense of despair. The imagery is rich, but in typical indie-angst fashion, it's hard to tell if Paisley is meditating on the transience of life or merely upset over his latest heartbreak when he croons lines like, “As I describe my lonely, you listen very clear / The last set of goalposts taken down, summer of an odd-numbered year.”
 
Despite the darkness, “No Blues” contains infinite reserves of energy. The pulsating electronic sound is infectious. Organized melodic chaos has always been the band’s forte, and they've managed to improve even upon that—the complexity is there, tighter and more cohesive but still managing to avoid predictability. The last two tracks exemplify this feat: both begin simply, “The Time Before the Last Time” gradually dissolving into cascades of harmonic noise while “Selling Rope” is marked by skirling instrumental offshoots and plaintive background vocals.
 
 No song better epitomizes the blend of angst and excitement that is “No Blues” than “Avocado, Baby,” originally released as a single. The repeated offset delivery of the madcap background line “A heart of stone, rind so tough it's crazy, that's why they call me the avocado, baby,” seems geared to get an audience pumped up and dancing, in sharp contrast to the naked pain of the jolting pause after “I feel like I'm the host of a terrible game show and the guests on today's quiz are celebrities / Won't respond to any clues, they're just cracking jokes for views, but the answers to these questions mean everything.” The tension between periods of boldly shouted lyrics and periods of chaotic instrumentation over more reserved vocals that enlivens so many of the album's tracks is clearly apparent in this moment.
 
Paisley clearly loves playing with his words and mixing his metaphors. Self-consciously clever lines such as “You'll know us by the way we crawl, you'll know us by our / Cemetery gaits” and “I'll be gloomy ‘til they glue me in the arms of she who loves me” turn out to be strangely compelling. On first listen most of the lyrics seem nonsensical, a disconnected series of bizarre images—“it's clear if you're the doormat / I'm the hickory,” “Doe Eyes you / Should stay at home licking batteries,” “Dirty in dish rack drips the Holy Grail,” etcetera—but with a bit more attention they begin to coalesce into intriguing, multilayered narratives that express a poignant mixture of hope and despair.
 
It all comes together to create an album that’s rich and infectious. Slower-paced tracks are interspersed among the more blatantly enthusiastic songs, but the album never loses its drive; even the calmer tracks conjure a feeling of power just below the surface, ready to burst forth. In both lyrics and instrumentation, carefully constructed chaos is the rule. And never has chaos seemed so appealing.

When pumpkin spice lattes make their return to Starbucks and jack-o’-lanterns appear in the window displays of your favorite stores, we all know that Halloween is fast approaching. Since people of all ages love Halloween, here are some fun ways to celebrate the holiday:

Movies
 
“Hocus Pocus”Starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Midler, and Kathy Najimy, “Hocus Pocus” is a classic children’s Halloween movie that may leave adults legitimately horrified. After 300 years, three sister witches come back to life in Salem, Massachusetts on Halloween, and it is up to two teenagers, a young girl, and an immortal cat to save Salem from the witches. It’s the perfect movie to watch if you’re looking for festive nostalgia.
 
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show”A musical/horror/sci-fi/comedy, “Rocky Horror” is about a newly engaged couple whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and must pay a visit to Dr. Frank N. Furter’s eerie residence. It’s a cult classic and even made its way into a “Glee” Halloween special episode in 2010.
 
Music
 
“Thriller” by Michael JacksonAlmost instantaneously recognizable by its electronic beats and occasional howls, “Thriller” is the go-to Halloween song. Along with its ridiculously catchy hooks and Jackson’s amazing vocals, the lyrics make the song apt for the spooky season: “‘Cause this is a thriller, thriller night / And no one’s gonna save you from the beast about to strike.”
 
“Jeepers Creepers”A jazz standard from the 1930s, this song was actually written for the film “Going Places” about an unruly horse, but thanks to the 2001 horror film “Jeepers Creepers,” the song is now perceived as menacing. Against the harmonically pleasing saxophone melody, the singer eerily croons: “Jeepers Creepers, where’d ya get those peepers? / Jeepers Creepers, where’d ya get those eyes?” Spooky? Yes, indeed.
 
On Campus
 
HCSUCS’s “HA!loween Spooktacular”The Harvard College Stand-Up Comics Society presents this annual show that features most of the comedians performing character-driven sets. The show is free and will take place Friday, Nov. 1 at 8 p.m. in Science Center A. Highlights from last year’s show can be found here.
 
“The Pirates of Penzance; or, the Slave of Duty”Presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, “The Pirates of Penzance” is a comic operetta about a pirate apprentice, Frederic, struggling with his sense of duty. On Halloween, the show opens with a “Creative Black Tie” event (costumes encouraged), and the admission fee is only $5 with a valid student ID. The show will run until Nov. 10 in Agassiz Theater.
 
Off Campus
 
Salem, MassachusettsIf you do ever make it out of Harvard Square, Salem offers a variety of activities to do on Halloween. You can go for a Ghost Tour at Salem’s 13 Ghosts, Mahi Mahi Creepy Cocktail Cruise, the Witch Trial Trail, or just simply roam around town on the Salem Trolley. Be aware though: some of these activities may be intended for children, and may not necessarily be worth the trip.
 
Trick-or-TreatingWhoever said dressing up and getting free candy was a “kid’s activity” was wrong. Traipsing through Cambridge with your friends in costume and collecting sweets might be the highlight of your Harvard Halloween experience.

Can a novel be written in which the main character is dead? Alice Sebold wrote “The Lovely Bones” from the perspective of a teenager who was raped and murdered at the onset of the story; in Markus Zusak’s “The Book Thief,” the narrator is Death itself. With her latest novel “The Lowland,” author Jhumpa Lahiri subverts traditional narrative devices and creates a tangled, far-reaching story of a family whose lives revolve around one young man, struck down in the prime of his life, whose absence leaves an all-consuming wake of loneliness and destruction. Lahiri alternately stretches and compresses time, revisiting the past, skipping through decades. Though she occasionally leans on clichéd emotional crutches, the unique temporal landscape and surprising twists of “The Lowland” mark it as a signature Lahiri book, albeit a darker and less redemptive tale than those explored in her previous works.
Lahiri’s decision to write a sweeping family epic is perhaps not surprising, given her background in short stories. “The Namesake” and “Unaccustomed Earth” wove together disparate tales concerning central themes—assimilation and biculturalism—while her novel “The Namesake” spanned two generations of the same Indian-American family. “The Lowland” outdoes them all: over the course of five decades and four generations, Lahiri examines the lives of various members of the Mitra family. From California to Calcutta, their experiences are inexorably affected by the politically motivated murder of their son, brother, and husband Udayan. His involvement in the Naxalite communist movement of the 1970s leads to his tragic ending: police shoot him in the swampy lowland adjacent to the family home. His aging parents and pregnant young wife Gauri watch, horrified; across the ocean, his scientist brother Subhash receives the news in two brief sentences, compelling him to return to the world he so recently escaped.
These first 100 pages contain Lahiri’s weakest writing. The tone is somber, yet the reasons for this unclear: as yet unmarked by tragedy, Subhash still insists on viewing the world through grey-tinted lenses. Tragic descriptions abound: Subhash is “unable to fathom his future, severed from his past”—a line he comes up with, tellingly, on a scientific research boat. “He was able to keep pushing back [his parents’] objection,” he thinks of his relationship with an American woman, “farther and farther, like the promise of the horizon, anticipated from a ship, that one never reached.” Simile after simile stocks the book’s initial chapters; Lahiri seems incapable of describing a feeling, sad or otherwise, without an overly theatrical comparison. Perhaps she is trying to prepare the reader for the tone of the rest of the novel: dark and dismal, with brief breaks of sunlit love. But her premature affectation works less as foreshadowing and more as perplexing tonal dissonance. “The Lowland” is, to use a phrase, hard to get hooked on. But once the tragedy of Udayan’s death hits, a fourth of the way into the novel, Lahiri’s funereal tone is perfect. The sadness is earned, and Lahiri is, at last, at her finest.
Central to this tale is the marriage of Subhash to Udayan’s widow Gauri. Subhash marries her out of duty, providing her with an escape route from India and a father for her and Udayan’s child, Bela. Yet their marriage, built on nothing more than fleeting physical attraction and scarred memories of the brother and husband they both loved, crumbles as certainly as it formed. This turn of the tale is surprising and refreshing: instead of finding love and conciliatory peace with each other, as typical tropes of literature would have it, Gauri becomes a disconnected wife and mother whose deep unhappiness leads her to abandon her small family a dozen years after it formed. “…It was useless,” Gauri says of trying to replace Udayan with Subhash, “just as it was useless to save a single earring when the other half of the pair was lost.”
This deep and bone-chilling sadness provides ample ground for the maudlin similes that were so out of place in the beginning of the novel. Gauri flies over the country, looking down at crop circles, which to her appear “like a pile of faceless coins.” Subhash’s watery metaphors find a new home in Gauri’s dissociated motherhood: “But Gauri feared she had already descended to a place where it was no longer possible to swim up to Bela, to hold on to her.” And through all this, Udayan is present, the most central character in the novel yet one whose presence is, by necessity, fleeting. Gauri cannot love Subhash for the memory of his dead brother; Bela is enraged when she learns of her hidden parentage; Subhash and Udayan’s mother mourns for decades, a neighborhood specter forever carrying memorial flowers.
Unconventional and irredeemable sadness is not the only unique aspect of “The Lowland.” Most striking is Lahiri’s fluid presentation of time. The novel begins with a linear narrative: over 80 pages, Subhash and Udayan grow from adventurous boys to scholastic teenagers to intellectual young men. Eventually Udayan is killed, Subhash raises his brother’s daughter as his own child, and a fragile marriage dissolves. Time progresses slowly and surely, each moment building on the last, until Bela begins to grow up. Her teenage years span two pages; time skips, sputters, flits away as quickly as she does from her broken home. Time contracts, expands, and reverses: as an old woman, Gauri recalls her brief and passionate marriage to Udayan. Eventually Bela raises her own child, vowing not to repeat her parents’ matrimonial mistakes.
It is this finely crafted presentation of time, not as a string but rather as a recursive loop, that lends the book its greatest triumph. No character is ever truly old, and none are young, either. Subhash stoops, a white-haired grandfather in the age of the iPhone; one chapter later, Udayan draws his last breaths in the lowland as bullets pierce his chest. “The Lowland” may not be an immediately enjoyable book, but by the end, Lahiri’s meticulous chronology and emotional intimacy elevate it above that flaw. It is, in the end, simply the story of one man whose influence reaches far beyond his premature grave. “Everything in Bela’s life has been a reaction,” Lahiri writes. “I am who I am, she would say, I live as I do because of you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Halloween, which means it’s time for scary things like counting down the days until reading period begins—about 34!—or white people making our cultures uncool or job applications going unanswered. BUT! If you want a real scare, I have just the thing, just the trip. I double-dog-dare you to go to Lamont tonight, or any night, after about 10 p.m. Go there not to study your books, but the people sitting all around you. It’s going to be hair-raising, eye-opening, trust me.
What won’t you see? Not the stereotypical shushing librarian, that I guarantee. Lamont Café is loud, and that’s ok: It’s a café intended to provide necessary space for meetings, study groups, office hours, and tutoring. But the policy of the café is not the policy of the whole of Lamont: There are levels of quiet in Lamont. The third floor Donatelli Reading Room is reserved for quietest study, nearly silent study. The second floor is less quiet than the third; and the first floor isn’t quiet at all, with the noise of the main doors, the café, and the circulation desk precluding even a pretense of reading in silence. The Collaborative Learning Space on level B and the Larsen Room in fact invite students to talk and to collaborate. Though not to “collaborate.” Yet you will find whispering and conversation on level 3, study groups outside of group areas, and so on.
What will you see? Very little studying, for one thing; taking a walk to the bathroom or hunting for a study carrel, you’ll likely glimpse many people’s laptop screens opened to YouTube, Hulu, or naked women (who aren’t Miley Cyrus). Despite being in a public place, people will freely remove their shoes, their socks. People leave behind belongings to occupy “their" spots. Boundary issues, hoarding, minimal hygiene—we’re only a step away from our own TLC reality show.
Perhaps the worst are the babies. Yes, there are babies in Lamont. I’ve brought this up to many friends. Typical reactions: Michael, you are being too harsh; Michael, it is hard to be a mother and a student; Michael, you will make people uncomfortable and angry by mentioning this. But once I explain that I see infants in Lamont at 10 p.m., 11 p.m., and past midnight, people take my side.
It’s bad for a baby to be kept awake, in the library, at such ungodly hours. Infants and toddlers need plenty of sleep, and sleep on a regular schedule, for their healthy development. It simply isn’t good for them to be out of their cribs because of schoolwork. The health of children—of your child—should come before that paper, email, or lab report. By all means, let graduate student parents—mothers and fathers—lean in and strive for both family and excellence in their chosen fields. But, by all means, don’t demand the right to bring your crying, screaming, potentially traumatized baby to the PCs on level B at 1 a.m.—when other students would like to study normally in the library they also share with you.
Harvard, though, needs to change to make this happen. Reading the Child Care@Harvard webpage, I was horrified to read, “affiliation with Harvard University does not guarantee admission to Harvard-affiliated child-care centers.” If Harvard is serious about “lean in” strategies, childcare needs to be available for every graduate (or undergraduate student) and for every schedule, and for every budget. Many undergrads would love the chance to make extra cash by babysitting: therefore, resources like the Watch portal should be advertised more. Perhaps even a corps of babysitters could be established as an avenue for student on-campus employment. No one should have to be in the position that their only option is to bring their child into Lamont late at night. I know it’s not done maliciously, but it is done inconsiderately.
We all act inconsiderately at times, but this tendency is amplified in the libraries because we have lost touch with the notion of shared public space. We fail to see that our conduct affects the productivity of others around us. Public courtesy in Lamont has declined so that most people make every effort to avoid study there. During the Opening Days tours and the required library Expos 20 sections, library staff might have to teach both research skills and library etiquette.
The end of the age of print brings new challenges, but it does not eliminate the importance of the library as a physical space. In explaining the logic of the capital campaign, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said, "place still matters, especially this unique place. We believe in the power of the chance meetings that occur every day across this campus." I agree that place is important; it is why I am worried for Harvard’s future based on the state of its libraries, their institutional culture, and the norms of use established by patrons without regard to building a shared space, not just hundreds of isolated scholars in the same room.
Nothing represents “our heritage and our future” more than our libraries. This Halloween, I ask all Lamonsters, all alumni, all administrators to consider how to renew our library system in its body and soul. It’s time the libraries receive our respect and consideration. This involves changing priorities—Harvard needs to provide comprehensive childcare, because Lamont is not equipped for patrons and their infant children. It is hard enough to manage as it is.

The land of the free sure manages to lock up a lot of its people: more so, in fact, than any other country in the world. For every 100,000 Americans, 716 will wake up today behind bars. That’s more than five times the rate in Canada and the United Kingdom. That’s more people than Stalin locked up in Gulags. That’s almost the entire country of Jamaica.
It may be hard to see who the benefactor of this penal epidemic is, but one has certainly emerged: private prisons. In a cruel, cyclical pattern, private prisons both benefit from and contribute to higher incarceration rates. By operating with profit motivations, they create an exploitative system that rewards unreasonable imprisonment levels, unjustly depriving individuals of their freedom and draining resources from society.
Privatization began to develop in the 1970s, when the War on Drugs and harsher sentencing policies produced a rapid growth in prison populations. Mandatory minimum sentencing, curtailed probation and parole use, and three-strike laws led to ballooning incarceration rates. Prisons became overcrowded; the cost to maintain them rose. In an effort to cut costs and balance budgets, federal and state governments looked to contract out the service. Freed from heavy bureaucratic regulations, private companies promised a more cost-efficient—but perhaps less moral—model.
In 1983 the Corrections Corporation of America secured the first contract to run an entire facility in the United States. The industry has since boomed. Private prisons today operate in 30 states across the country, housing around seven percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. Unlike public ones, however, private prisons do not aim to carry out a public good or necessity. They operate with the same intention as all private companies: profits. As federal funding is on a per-detainee basis, more prisoners equates to higher revenue and profits. Today the CCA holds over 90,000 inmates in 65 prisons. It’s worth almost $2 billion.
Profit consideration unfortunately leads the private prison industry to push for policies of more arrests and longer imprisonments, which in turn increase incarceration rates. For example, following a pledge by the Bush Administration and Congress to improve homeland security after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, companies stepped up lobbying efforts to increase immigrant detentions. The CCA spent 13 times more on federal lobbying in the years following 9/11 than before. The number of immigrant arrests soared, and today over half are held at private facilities. The CCA and the second-largest private prison company GEO Group have both more than doubled their revenues from immigrant detentions since 2005. Regardless of their necessity, more arrests equals higher profits for private prisons.
Private prisons also push for policies of higher incarceration by aligning with ALEC, an organization of state legislators and corporate executives that supports tougher criminal sentencing. The CCA provided major support for ALEC, which championed legislation resulting in higher incarceration rates. In the 1990s, for example, ALEC succeeded in pushing through Truth in Sentencing, which restricts parole eligibility, and three-strikes laws in 27 states. The CCA recently withdrew its membership under heavy public criticism after ALEC helped draft Arizona’s controversial immigration law. Once again, these policies result in more arrests and longer imprisonments that benefit private prisons but not society as a whole.
To secure a constant influx of inmates, private prisons also exert a troubling amount of influence at the local level. Executives often organize agreements with local communities that provide compensation to the community for each detainee housed at a facility within their borders. Over time, local economics have begun to rely heavily on this revenue. This dependency gives sheriff departments an incentive to increase detentions, as some money will flow back to the town. A Huffington Post investigation found that several counties in Arizona with private prisons have excessive incarceration rates from sheriff departments. Another investigation by The Times-Picayune found that private prisons contributed to higher local arrest rates in Louisiana.
Private prisons also increase profits by reducing operational costs, which comes at the expense of prisoner safety and security. Private facilities usually employ fewer guards and pay lower wages. Though they hold fewer inmates convicted of violent crimes than public prisons, violence within private prisons is often more frequent. Prison guard assaults occur 49 percent more often; violence against fellow inmates is 54 percent more likely.
In 1985, before any private prisons had been constructed, Crimson writer John Ross ’87 forewarned of the dangers of privatization and of giving “the business community a financial stake in increasing the number of prisoners.” He was right. We should halt and reverse the movement to outsource prison responsibility to private firms.
There are certainly moral implications from profiting off the bondage of others, which delve into everything from individual rights to freedoms to the role of the state. But from a purely rational perspective, privatization fosters policies of excessive and unnecessary jailing and devalues prisoner rights. The underlying motivation for incarceration in a private prison is not founded in justice, but rather in profits. Removing these profit considerations from the American penal system is an important first step in creating a freer nation.

After Edward Snowden released secret NSA documents revealing the extent to which the United States has spied on its citizens and allies, the NSA has been the subject of much outrage at home and abroad. Indignant leaders of foreign governments have chastised the U.S. for invading their sovereignty, and Senator Dianne Feinstein expressed the view of many Americans that it is wrong to spy on friendly leaders. Representative Mike Rogers, however, defended the NSA’s actions, calling the European criticism “disingenuous,” as they too engaged in similar espionage and the resulting information benefitted everyone. Regardless of how we feel about the proper reach of American counterterrorism, the real travesty is that a president of the United States could claim ignorance about the surveillance activities of U.S. intelligence agencies.
Germany is one of many friendly countries, including France, Spain, Brazil, and Mexico that have been targeted by American spy operations. Although the Snowden papers indicate that the NSA had been wiretapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone since 2002, German newspaper Bild am Sonntag claims President Obama had been aware of the wiretapping only since 2010.
Bild am Sonntag reported that once Obama learned about the NSA’s surveillance of Merkel, he in fact requested that it redouble its efforts. We cannot be certain if or when Obama learned about the NSA’s foreign surveillance operations or whether he approved them. Yet it is unacceptable for him to shrug off responsibility for America’s actions. That a president could be unaware that the nation is spying on its allies is a clear indication that we need to enforce measures to increase the NSA’s accountability.
It is one thing to hide the NSA’s mass surveillance program from the American public, but it is quite another to claim not to have known about it. Obama’s hedging leaves the impression that the president is unable to reign in the overreaching powers of the NSA.
It is essential that the intelligence community’s  activities be overseen by the president and Congress, especially when those activities threaten the liberty of Americans and allies. To this end, we put out full support behind the bipartisan efforts of the House and Senate to demand more accountability from both our elected officials and our espionage agencies by insisting on greater communication and transparency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About halfway through my internship in Buenos Aires this summer, I realized that in order to really immerse myself in Argentine culture, I'd have to stop hanging out with my American peers. Not having any Argentine friends, I began to spend a lot of time doing things alone. I would go to artisan fairs, art museums, malls, concerts, and even nice restaurants completely unaccompanied. I wasn't really alone, as there were always tons of people around me in the densely populated metropolis, but I was alone in the way we usually understand the word: without friends.
As you can imagine, when I began my lone ventures in Buenos Aires, I often felt deeply uncomfortable. Going out alone made me feel insecure about what other people would think of my solitude. This fear of being judged when I was alone led to not-so-subtle changes in the way I carried myself when I went out so as to reject other people's potential pity, astonishment, or other imagined reaction. My arms folded tightly to my body, my eyes avoided other people's faces, my walking hastened, and my mouth made a slight frown, so as to give the message to onlookers that I wasn't looking for friends and was perfectly fine being alone—I was merely busy. A smug and self-important solitude.
Because we fear other people thinking there's something “weird” about being alone, we avoid doing things by ourselves. And when we do go out by ourselves, we feel a discomfort that makes us more closed off to strangers in order to protect ourselves from that awful sensation of social insecurity. It's ironic and unfortunate that the very insecurity from being alone can lead to us to act in ways that discourage interactions with others. On the other hand, being comfortable while alone leads to more open interaction-inducing behavior.
This summer, I eventually became accustomed to doing things alone by force of habit. A fear of going to the movie theater by myself was gradually replaced by an eagerness to travel on my own. And once I felt comfortable enough by myself, I no longer disseminated subconscious messages that I didn't want company. Whereas my default expression had previously been a slight frown, I began to smile at people I passed on the streets; instead of marching through crowds to prove to no one in particular that I had things to do, I started to saunter slowly and openly to take everything in. Instead of trying to seem occupied by my phone and headphones, I opened my eyes, ears, and attention, leaving them available for others to borrow. Consequently, I found myself in more random and rewarding interactions with strangers, such as one night when a good Samaritan walked me through the deserted city streets toward a distant bus stop.
One my goals for the summer had been to feel like I had really immersed myself in Argentine culture. As such, it makes sense that I viewed my conversations with Argentine strangers as invaluable—they gave me direct exposure to Argentine culture and as well as opportunities to practice speaking Spanish. But they also made me feel more connected in a city whose large population can easily render it impersonal and indifferent. In this way, the ability to be comfortably alone is an incredibly valuable one. When we're willing to connect with strangers, we become more empathetic and generate social capital—creating a powerful sense of community based on nothing more than common humanity.
So while I am encouraging people to try doing things alone more often, I am not encouraging antisocial behavior. My goal, rather, is to encourage social interactions with people we don't know and with whom we wouldn't normally have occasion to converse.
Being alone need not signify misanthropy, introversion, or depression. We should instead conceive of it as a tool to break routine social life.

On a campus filled with world-class musicians, it’s only natural that the iTunes libraries of these individuals should reflect their fine artistic talents. Even apart from actual performers, Harvard students take their music choices seriously, carefully constructing playlists for studying, partying, or just hanging out.
FM set out to find the students on campus with the best taste in music. The chain started with Henry Kennelly, a freshman in Greenough, who then named his “best music friend” (BMF), who named their BMF, and so on. Listen in!
Henry B. Kennelly '17
Favorite Genre: I never really listened to the radio. I grew up with Coltrane and Led Zeppelin, and I got really into hip-hop and funk through playing the drums. I fell in love with those beats—the pockets you can find in those types of songs.
Music Background: I started playing drums in fifth grade and guitar in first grade. I taught myself piano by learning how to play “Nuvole Bianche” by Ludovico Einaudi.
His BMF: Sasha and I went to high school together and we put on an Irish music gig one time which was incredible. He’s pretty much fluent in classical music.
Sasha G. Scolnik-Brower '17
Favorite Genre: I was brought up listening to classical music and have always been most drawn to it. I usually find new music by going to concerts or playing pieces with which I’m unfamiliar. Youtube is also pretty great.
Music Background: I’ve played the cello since I was 5 or so. It’s definitely been part of the reason why I love classical music.
His BMF: I met Laila because we are both in the joint program between Harvard and New England Conservatory—in 5 years we get a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a Masters of Music from NEC...she’s a great jazz singer.
Laila M. Smith '17
Favorite Genre: I’m a jazz musician, but I love folk, classical, and Brazilian music. In the 70s, Brazilian and jazz had sort of a “love child.” I also really appreciate the lyric and storytelling side of folk music, which is a big part of jazz, too.
Music Background: I grew up playing piano and I’m now a jazz singer. I’m in a dual degree program with the New England Conservatory of Music, but I also have a band outside of Harvard, which is composed of all jazz musicians. It’s heavily influenced by R&B, folk, and Brazilian music.
Her BMF: I met Kevin through the NEC dual degree, though I’m pretty sure we would have encountered each other simply by virtue of the jazz community being so small. What I like about Kevin is that he balances the visceral part of the listening experience with the intellectual/methodical part of it. He’s very thoughtful about what he likes in a cerebral sort of way, but he certainly doesn’t leave out any of the pathos in his reasoning.
Kevin Sun '14
Favorite Genre: My taste is strongly skewed towards jazz, but when I came to college it was somewhat hard to find people with the same taste in music, so I was forced to check out other scenes. I started listening to more R&B, and I’m now trying to break into the bluegrass scene.
Music Background: I’m a tenor saxophone player who doubles on the clarinet and flute. I started with classical piano when I was younger. I compose and arrange music, as well. I’m a first year masters student in the New England Conservatory of Music and a jazz-blogger on my personal site, A Horizontal Search.
His BMF: I met Josh Lipson during freshman year and we bonded over the fact that we’re both from New Jersey. We would hang out and listen to music, and he turned me onto some interesting stuff. He listens to a lot of world music.
Josh D. Lipson '14
Favorite Genre: I’m very interested in world sounds. I like things with a psychedelic edge, especially Middle Eastern, Indian, and Latin American music. I studied in the Middle East and my family has strong ties to Israel, so I consider myself an admirer and student of many different cultures.
Music Background: I have a little bit of background in percussion because I played drums in middle school. I do some Middle Eastern drumming now. I definitely wish I had a stronger background in playing music.

Since you've been meaning to go to office hours all semester, get face time with your favorite faculty members by showing up to their houses on Halloween and demanding candy. Here's what FM imagines that they’ll be giving out.
Donald H. Pfister: M&Ms. He doesn't get his hands dirty with chocolate or with scandals. All of the colors remind him of the fall foliage.
N. Gregory Mankiw: He won't be there. David Johnson will hand out the candy for him. If you accept the candy, you also have to buy the newest edition of his textbook. This isn't a welfare state.
Richard H. Fallon: In order to form a more perfect Halloween, promote general wellbeing, and ensure domestic tranquility, he'll be offering candy in amounts equal to the weight of the Con Law textbook. Make sure to use (judicial) restraint.
David J. Malan: Chocolates with "I Took CS50 and Trick-or-Treated at Malan’s House" stamped on them. Even if you don’t go to Harvard, you can still watch the video of him giving out candy on the EdX website.
Michael Brenner and David Weitz: Liquified, frozen nitrogen infused cocoa butter malt balls with salted caramel made out of ice. When you bite into one, it tastes surprisingly like Felipe's nachos with undertones of the relief of finally getting your SPU requirement out of the way.
Dennis Gaitsgory: Nerds. There are too many in his Math 55 class.
Drew G. Faust: Spooky photos from "Death and the Civil War." She won’t be offering alcohol, but she intends her house to become the much needed social space on campus.
Niall Ferguson: British Cadbury chocolates. Everything British is better than what you can get in the colonies.
Andrew Berry: A variety of candies that you can naturally select from to choose the fittest one.
Paul E. Farmer: He'll give you the best candy and then convince you to give it to someone who could use it more.

It is fall. It is time to refuse the shackles of heavy down jackets and throw on the most world-renowned, freedom-enforcing, time-honored and life-improving article of clothing: the vest.
Fall brings the 700 percent increase in the number of #autumn pictures on your Instagram, the invasion of pumpkin flavoring, and the necessity of blowing your nose a lot due to your seasonal allergies.  What do all of these activities have in common? They improve significantly when you have full range of your elbows. It’s easier to enjoy your pumpkin spice latte when your arms are not being held captive by your puffy-sleeved coat. With this kind of freedom, it’s a disservice to wear anything else.
Let’s face it. You really like your arms. They hold your backpack straps in place, they offer a convenient area to check your pulse, and they keep your shirt on the right way when you barrel roll down a huge hill. No other body part can claim that level of importance. And so we argue the case for the vest—the article of clothing that gives your most important upper-body extremities the freedom that they crave. Revel in the freedom of your arms. Wear a vest.
Consider the proud and stylish vest-wearers that have gone before you—barbershop quartets, cowboys, player 1 sporting a ballistic vest in Modern Warfare. Recognizing the incredible fulfillment of a warm torso and mobile arms, the likes of Aladdin, Shrek, and Doug Funnie have donned vests over the years. Would Aladdin have been able to defeat Jafar in a J. Crew peacoat? No.
Just look at the non-vest wearers of the world—the NSA, Voldemort, most members of Congress. When they feel warm, they wear a shirt, sans jacket. When they get cold they put on outerwear with sleeves. Where’s the excitement, the flexibility, the respect for fundamental rights? Where are the arms?
Wearing a vest says something about your values overall. Mainly that you were too warm for a normal jacket. But also that you are a fashion-forward creative thinker with big dreams and plans to save the world from a lack of #fallfoliage pictures, which you will no doubt accomplish with your incredible work ethic, overwhelming talent, and free arms.

After three years of mediocre costumes (last year I panicked, threw on jeans and flannel and told everyone I was a lumberjack), I was determined that this year I was going to do Halloween right. I was sure I had things locked when I stumbled upon a puffy orange vest in a pile of thrift shop clothes. “Perfect!” I thought. “Pair it with a jean jacket, Walkman, and cardboard hoverboard and I can impress everyone with my rendition of Marty McFly, time traveler extraordinaire.”
Undaunted by cries of “who?” from my roommates, I assembled the proper components. But when I found myself in front of the mirror, I was disappointed with the final effect. The vest was a problem. On my lean, aerodynamically ideal body, it fattened up my core and accentuated my thin arms. I looked like the lovechild of the Great Pumpkin and a T-Rex.
While I’m open to the idea that this might have just been a particularly ugly vest, something tells me that the problem is pervasive throughout this particular subgenre of outerwear. I mean, does anyone really benefit from wrapping their core in excessive amounts of protective material? Police officers and the US Army don’t count. The truth is that vests are just fundamentally unflattering, and the time-traveling Delorean was just so cool that I had never realized it. (Building one to salvage the costume seemed like too big of a DIY project for midterm season).
With a heavy heart, I decided to retire the costume and liquor treat as a greaser instead (leather jacket and white t-shirt). I’ve resigned myself to never being able to pull off the vest “look.” It’s not that big of a deal, I am strangely unaffected by the freezing core, sweltering arms problem from which a large proportion of the student body seems to suffer. Besides, clothes with sleeves are just better. Anyone who says differently clearly has a vested interest.

Donning a purple pant suit, Gail Collins seems quirky and laid-back—a far cry from the intimidating personality one would expect of a journalist of her stature. She babbles, or so she claims, whirling her hands around and every so often releasing a big, booming laugh that fills the small office with its volume. On October 22, the celebrated New York Times columnist visited the Radcliffe Institute to discuss her 2009 book on the modern feminist movement, “When Everything Changed.” FM chatted with her before she entered the Knafel Center’s main hall for her lecture.
1. Fifteen Minutes: How did you get the idea to write “When Everything Changed,” and how long did it take you to compile and write the book?
Gail Collins: I had written a book called “America’s Women” before that. I had a deal with a publisher to do the story of what happened with women in America. I thought I was going to go all the way to the end, but it’s one of those things where you’re taking an American history course, and it’s June and you’re on World War II, and you just know that it’s not going to end. I was in 1950, and it was five hundred pages, so I just kind of wrapped it up. I knew I would do another book, and this is the other book. So this is the book that I meant the first book to be.
2.  FM: How did it all change for women so quickly? How did it happen so fast?
GC: It really is a bunch of things, but out of all of them I really think the economy, it’s always the economy for these things. After World War II there was this monstrous surge in the economy, and for the first time in history anywhere in the world, an average family could have this stupendous lifestyle. Then when the 70s hit, and all these other economic forces came in, you couldn’t do it on one salary anymore. Suddenly, that was when middle class women began to go to work. Once you think of your life in terms of, “Okay, I’m going to school, and when I get out, I will get married, I will have children, I will work to support my family,” as a matter of course, your whole vision of yourself changes, and society’s vision of you changes, because this is not a country where you’ll have any power whatsoever without an economic role.
3. FM: Have you ever felt like your gender has held you back, professionally or otherwise? If so, what made you feel that way?
GC: People always ask me that, they always want the story of my great struggle. But it’s always been a huge help to me, if anything. The reason is that the women who came approximately one second ahead of me historically were the ones who filed all the suits, and did all the petitions, and got in the face of their employers, and they didn’t get the rewards. People like me, who were just coming through the door right after them, got all the good stuff, so if anything I’ve gotten a lot of things because it was that moment when they were looking for a woman columnist. So it’s been a help, I think.
4. FM: What hasn’t changed for women?
GC: There was a point during the women’s liberation movement in which there was a theory that as part of their liberation, women would be wearing sensible, comfortable shoes wherever they went. This did not happen, and it’s never going to happen. We will always wear really silly shoes that look good; it’s part of life.
5. FM: Tell us about one of the more interesting or surprising interviews you’ve done.
GC: One of my favorite ones—it was over the phone, I never did get to meet her—was a woman from Georgia named Lorena Weeks, who was one of the first critical plaintiffs in the cases that really broke all the loopholes that business had used to keep from promoting women. You know, that women shouldn’t have to lift heavy things, or women shouldn’t have to work more than forty hours, all that. She was just this normal woman who was trying to get a good life for her husband and herself and her kids, and nothing she did was planned. It was just a natural response. She was just so sweet, such a pistol, and she had lived her entire life in this small part of Georgia. She just really knocked me out.
6. FM: Tell us something funny.
GC: The kids at Columbia, where I live in New York, are really nice, they’re just lovely. But the people here are just wildly polite, I mean stunningly polite! Maybe it’s just that I looked pathetic, but I’ve just never met so many really, really, really, really polite young people.
7. FM: You’ve collaborated a lot with other writers throughout your career—you’ve co-written a book with your husband, and you collaborate with David Brooks on a blog for The New York Times. What has made these co-writing relationships effective?
GC: You have to have two people who are really prepared to work together, because there’s sacrifice involved. You can never control, you can never have things your own way, and if you’re working on it, trying to figure a way to make sure you really do secretly have your own way, it becomes a disaster. But working with David is so much fun, and I think we’ve perfected it by now. He’s on book leave now until the end of the year, and I really miss him.
8. FM: How do you feel about writing op-eds?GC: The thing that I’ve done with my life is to write eight hundred words, twice a week. It’s almost a dead art, because nobody coming up now is going to have to write eight hundred words, twice a week. There’s so much more flexibility. I think in some ways it makes things…not better, but crisper, or clearer, and being restricted in some way is useful when you’re writing.
9. FM: Do you have any role models?
GC: Ellen Goodman was writing a column, and I thought that was just amazing, before I started writing them. Maureen Dowd was writing a column before me, Anna Quindlen. So every woman who was writing a column before I was, basically.
10. FM: How has journalism changed since you’ve been a writer?
GC: Well, the biggest change from when I started is the interaction with the public. We thought we were very responsive to the public before the massive Internet influx, but we were not responsive at all. We had no idea. We were just babies, typing away and thinking that everybody liked it because there was no way they could [comment]. So now it’s much more of a conversation, which is really cool. But I came to realize that the readers like talking amongst themselves, and when you come in, it’s sort of like your father coming in and turning out the light, or something. So I appreciate more that a lot of what we do is opening up the conversation so that people can come in and talk.

On Broadway Street, just off Kendall Square, the harsh lines of high-rise hotels cut into the sky and cast dark shadows onto the street below. It’s October, but the ground is so cold I can feel it through my tennis shoes. The sidewalk is deserted save Erin and me. I don’t blame others for abandoning this place—the simultaneous sense of claustrophobia and emptiness here is palpable, scary even.
Eight minutes later, I am relieved to see an enormous square building, circumscribed by a thick stripe of pink paint, emerging from a row of brick offices. I break into a ridiculous smile, and I’m not even embarrassed. I have arrived at the famed Garment District.
Once inside the store, my cold-deadened senses come alive. Warmth! Lights! Neon! Chaos! All of it hits me at once. I’m Alice, lost in a wonderland of eccentricity. The walls are so pink I taste bubblegum. There’s a traffic sign blazing above my head with “WALK” and “DON’T WALK” illuminated simultaneously. A shiny mannequin, outfitted as a German beer girl, gazes down at me from the landing of the stairs.
An employee interrupts my reverie. She hands us store guides—little pink slips of paper explaining what we’ll find on each level—and takes our coats. I’m realizing that this place is actually very useful for finding Halloween costumes. Erin has already run over to the colored tutus, which hang in a rainbow on their circular rack. I agree with her: They are so “Toddlers and Tiaras.”
It’s when our eyes move to the floor-to-ceiling cornucopia of hats that we comprehend the endless possibilities The Garment District affords. With just one 15-dollar piece of headwear, we could become cops, firefighters, sailors, or soldiers. We could become anything.
But we’ve only seen a corner of the store, which spans two expansive floors. We decide to check it out. Downstairs is mostly packaged costumes, accessories, wigs, and masks, a dizzying array of colors—cobalt blue, electric green, neon orange. When we head upstairs past the mannequin, she is still watching me. It’s all too easy to get lost, the various walls and alcoves popping up out of nowhere. We can’t remember if the devil horns we found were on the top or bottom floor, in the left or right corner. I feel woozy.
Upstairs, the store’s vintage clothing section is to our left, and as much as I would like to shop for oversized, pilly men’s sweaters right now, I must focus on the goal: Halloween. This is simple enough—classic costumes hang everywhere. We’re surrounded by authentic-looking ’70s flare pants, ruffled pirate shirts, and gladiator chest armor. There are quirkier displays too. On a rack labeled “Clowns and Religious,” Adam and Eve costumes hang stoically next to polka-dotted petticoats.
My ridiculous smile returns when I see this section. Really, I say to myself, there is something enchanting about The Garment District. It’s an undeniably weird and crazy place, a place in which I feel too conventional. It’s a place where Jesus robes and red noses go together. Compared to other Halloween stores, The Garment District is less trick and more treat, concerned with the strangeness and delight of costumes.
I begin to notice that many of the other wandering shoppers are smiling too. Maybe what’s entertaining isn’t just the store’s oddities but also the notion of assuming another persona for a night. Halloween is the only time during the year when it’s acceptable to forget who we were, who we are, and who we will one day become. On Halloween, the world becomes our oyster: We can be scary, slutty, funny, beautiful, or ugly. The Garment District knows that abandoning our own self-conscious identities is Halloween’s true magic.
Back on the ground floor, Erin and I decide that though the neon tulle skirts are appealing to us, going the firefighter route might be ultimately cuter and less fussy this year. After nearly an hour losing ourselves in the store, we head to the registers invigorated, holding reflective plastic fireman helmets and yellow suspenders.
We whisk away our purchases in bubblegum pink plastic bags and head back to the T station. Somehow, the walk through post-apocalyptic Cambridge seems much livelier now. The shadows are not so dark, the gray pavement not so cold beneath my feet.

With so much costume-fueled excitement occurring this past weekend, it may be hard to find motivation to get into the spirit of Halloween now that it’s actually here. But what, you ask, does one do in such a dilemma? The answer: watch movies! Here to satisfy all your Halloween-related desires is a list of the spookiest and most skin-crawling films that FM can come up with.
If you want to get in the frisky mood before putting on your skimpy costume and going to a party...
“Mean Girls” (2004)—after all, what better movie to watch than the one that teaches us that “Halloween is the one night a year when girls can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it”? Alternatively, watch a few episodes of “Breaking Bad” (2008). Nothing will make you feel feistier than watching the incredible Walter White get himself in a winnebago-load of trouble with his wife and take it like a champ.
If you want something that will make you feel less bad about yourself after gorging on Halloween candy...
“Super Size Me” (2004), a documentary about a man who ate nothing but McDonald’s for a month and consequently gained not only many extra pounds but a whole host of health problems, is guaranteed to make you forget your guilt over having a few (hundred) extra pieces of candy. Otherwise, indulge yourself in a beautiful yet heartbreaking romantic movie, such as “The Notebook” (2004) or “Titanic” (1997). When you’re feeling nothing but loneliness and heartache and the tears are streaming down your face, you’ll need that candy to lift your spirits. You’ll forget all about the less-than-desirable side effects.
If you’re looking for something that will make you feel young again...
There’s nothing better to bring you back to your childhood than the classics “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown” (1966), “Casper” (1995), or “Hocus Pocus” (1993). That being said, if you try to talk about any of these movies with anyone under the age of 18, all you’ll receive is blank stares and a reputation for being a try-hard weirdo. If what you’re looking for is to fit in with the crowd of youngins as you shamelessly trick-or-treat with them around Cambridge, your best bet is to watch the Disney Channel Original Movie “Halloweentown” (1998), and then talk about nothing else all night while trying to blend in with all the eight-year-olds.
If you’re looking for some solid costume ideas...
Seeing as it’s already Halloween, you’re going to need some quick and easy ideas that will not only take 10 minutes to put together but also convince everyone else at the party that you put real thought into your outfit. “Moulin Rouge!” (2001) provides just that—an entertaining and wildly bizarre movie, but one with a fair amount of flashy costumes that can be put together relatively easily using some things you may already have in your closet.
If you’re looking for an idea of what not to do on Halloween night...
“The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) provides a pretty solid example. In fact, it’s a pretty solid example of what you should not do on any night, ever. Another suitable substitute is “Legally Blonde” (2001), reminding us that the last thing we want to do is show up to a non-costume party dressed as a bunny. Double check your party invites, people. Don’t be that bunny.
If you’re looking for something to really freak you out...
If you’re the type of person who goes to haunted houses hoping they’ll actually manage to scare you one of these days, and your idea of the best Halloween ever is one in which you are literally afraid to leave your room for fear of spirits attacking, the right movies for you are “The Exorcist” (1973), “The Thing” (1982), and “Paranormal Activity” (2007). Alternatively, see “13 Going on 30” (2004) or “Peter Pan” (1953), movies in which the main characters eventually have to stop being children and grow up, to remind you that once college ends you’ll have to be a real adult and Halloween will never be this fun again.

Harvard students are surrounded by art. We have three fine arts museums on our central campus and countless more across the river. Our humanities professors teach us how to appreciate beautiful music, profound literature, and exquisite paintings. Even those who have yet to fulfill their Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding requirement can’t help but notice  Annenberg’s Gothic towers or Sever’s Romanesque arches.
Recently, though, you may have also noticed works that declare themselves to be “Not Art” around Cambridge. Written on buildings, sidewalks, and the whiteboard belonging to the Chinese restaurant Bon Chon that normally displays the day’s dumpling offerings, the two words seem to crop up everywhere. The snobs amongst us might scoff and say, “That’s Not Art,” but, well…
I tracked down the project’s mastermind through the Not Art Facebook page, which now displays the Harvard insignia with “Veritas” crossed out and replaced with you-know-what. On the phone, we arranged to meet at Peet’s Café, where he told me I would “recognize him.”
Not quite sure what to expect (would he be dressed in a Not Smock covered in Not Paint?) I arrived at the café on a cold, windy Thursday. The man smoking on the bench in Winthrop Park looked just like any other, dressed in jeans and a faux-leather jacket. He greeted me happily and told me how excited he was for his project to be covered for the first time, but asked not to be identified by name, as he sees the “mystery” of his project as one of its appeals. He told me I could refer him to him as the Not Artist.
The Not Artist launched into his story. The son of a photographer, the Not Artist had been making art since he was a child, experimenting with graffiti until around age 14 when he was caught writing on the back of school bus seat. Most recently, the Not Artist had been showing assemblage and collage works at local coffee shops.
“I got to be in my mid-twenties and I realized that I wasn’t getting enough exposure with my art,” the Not Artist said, shrugging. “I was kind of sick of coffee shop gigs.”
One day, the Not Artist brought one of his pieces to the restaurant where he waited tables at the time. He meant to show it to his colleagues, but when the workday got busy, he accidentally left it on a table over night. The next day, the Not Artist returned to a crowd forming around the piece, trying to figure out what it was.“
They were like, ‘Oh my god, this is so creepy! This  is so weird!’” said the Not Artist. “It was the greatest reaction I’ve ever gotten to anything that I’ve made.”
This got the Not Artist thinking. The piece generated such a strong response, he felt, because it was viewed out of the context of a gallery or museum, and thus didn’t appear to be art. He started to wonder what, exactly, defined that elusive word, art.
“Okay, if you take a traffic cone and you bring it into a gallery does it become art?” he asked me. I remembered seeing the very object adorned with the Not Artist’s standard black spray paint in a photo online.
When I didn’t answer immediately, the Not Artist continued. “Then if you take it out of the gallery and put it back on the street, is it Not Art anymore? But what’s the difference?”
He cites Marcel Duchamp’s famous “readymade” titled “Fountain” as his inspiration. In 1917, the French artist tried to submit a urinal, flipped on its side and signed with the pseudonym “R. Mutt,” to an exhibition by the Society of Independent Artists. It was subsequently declared Not Art and rejected. Now, the urinal is a hailed as a landmark of the avant-garde movement, and replicas are featured in museums worldwide.
When we finished talking, the Not Artist offered to take me around to see some of his pieces in Harvard Square. We walked back up JFK St. and turned on Mt. Auburn where the Not Artist stopped in front of a comic store called Millionaire Picnic. He pointed to the side of the building. It was dusk, and the wall was obscured by shadows, but after squinting for a few seconds I spotted the simple black words painted a few feet above eye level.
I asked the Not Artist how he chooses his locations, and he told me that he looks for spots with overlooked aesthetic appeal; he sees his project as a way to highlight the “art” that we pass without notice from day-to-day.
He recalled making his first public piece on the back of a loading dock in Somerville. “I spraypainted ‘Not Art’ on there,” he said. “A few weeks later someone added ‘ichoke’ on the end so it said ‘Not Artichoke.’ I think they even drew a little picture.”
We went on to the next location, a stairwell next to Charlie’s Kitchen that leads underneath Eye Q Optical. This location, too, seemed partially obscured.  I hadn’t expected Not Art to be so inconspicuous; I grew up in New York, where street artists usually try to be as big, bright, and bold as possible.
The Not Artist explained that he prefers his work to be impermanent and unobtrusive, so that he does not deface private property or disrupt what he sees as “the subtle beauty of an urban setting.”
“I have this one at an abandoned gas station in Somerville,” he told me. “There’s this big sign that says ‘regular self’ and ‘plus self’ and I put [removable] plastic letters that say ‘Not Art’ where the numbers usually are. It looks really good but it’s socially responsible.”
The Not Artist then led me to the specials sign outside of Bon Chon, where he has written “Not Art” in erasable marker. The words, he told me, have been there for a week without anyone trying to remove them.
Similarly, on the Harvard campus itself, the Not Artist painted his letters on a wooden block and placed it over a square on the chessboard outside of the Science Center. He told me that he didn’t feel a need to paint over any Harvard buildings.
Besides spraypaint, plastic letters, and wooden blocks, ideas, the Not Artist told me, are his primary medium. I asked him whether he had an overall message to impart to his viewers.
“Yeah,” he said, smirking. “It’s Not Art."

I’m not sure when it first hit me, but it was around the time I discovered someone’s shit lying in the hallway outside my room: Shanghai’s a mess.
My foray into the depths of Shanghai began, innocently enough, at a summer opportunities fair in the Gutman Library. It was the winter of my freshman year, and among the Wall Street firms and nonprofit organizations giving their best summer sales pitches, one option stood out: a summer program that paired 30 international college students with seven-week internships in Shanghai. Perhaps I wanted an escape. Perhaps it was the picture of the Shanghai skyline that did it. But for whatever reason, I applied for the program. A getaway, I reasoned, could never hurt.
Six months later, I was staying in a hotel in the heart of Shanghai’s Red Light District. The lights dim, the corridors dirty, and the rooms reeking of “noodles, sweat, and fart,” as one reviewer on TripAdvisor put it, the New Asia Hotel wasn’t your standard three-star hotel. We returned from nights out to find stray cats wandering the hallways. Pimps offered us prostitutes in the lobby, and, when we declined, pestered us through the elevator and up to our rooms. My coworker Juan had some linen stolen from his hotel room, with the staff reception being no help. And on one occasion, as previously alluded to, we found shit lying in the hallway.
After living in the city for a few weeks, I discovered the only rule in Shanghai: There are no rules. It’s difficult to distinguish news headlines from horror stories—KFC’s Ice Dirtier than Toilet Water; Tainted Milk Powder Kills Children. In Shanghai, you can trample children on the subway if a seat opens up. You can steal someone’s taxi if you jump in the back seat before he does. And don’t even bother standing in lines.
In my head, I had an understanding of how the rest of my time in Shanghai would play out. Maybe I had seen too many movies, but I figured this would be one of those stories where the protagonist finds himself in an undesirable situation and, only after removing some negative aspect of his personality, begins to enjoy it. Yet as the days dragged on, this possibility began to disappear. Shanghai wasn’t any more bearable.
One day, whether due to the triple-digit temperature or to my coworker finding himself the victim of a $150 scam, I finally broke. Almost on a whim, a few friends and I bought tickets to Beijing, about 800 miles from Shanghai, and decided to spend a weekend there. Our expectations weren’t high—we had started to refer to Shanghai as Shanghell, and we were already toying with puns for Beijing. We were unprepared and departed without a plan, treating our voyage not as a visit to Beijing, but rather a three-day respite from Shanghai.
Or not. When I arrived in Beijing, I wasn’t sure whether to hail a taxi. It was customary in Shanghai for taxi drivers to swindle tourists by driving around in circles, and my wallet wasn’t deep enough to cover much more than a one-hour trip to the city center. But lacking other options, I headed to the taxi stand and summoned the next car. I sat down in the front seat, and before asking for my destination, the driver greeted me in his broken English and offered me a cigarette. Shocked by this display of human decency, I declined by using the phrase I had been trained to use for turning down scammers in Shanghai: wŏ bú yào. The nicest gesture I had received from a stranger in months came from a taxi driver who offered me a cigarette. Welcome to Beijing.
After a brisk taxi ride, I arrived in the city center. Something about Beijing felt inherently different. It wasn’t any cleaner or less polluted than Shanghai, but Beijing reverberated with a certain energy that was nonexistent in our previous city. Instead of busy streets and loud expanses, there were hutongs, picturesque clusters of narrow, pedestrian walkways that were impossible to associate with anything besides 1940s China. There was no loud music or obscene displays of wealth, just calmness and a richness of culture.
We spent the first day walking around Beijing. The air had cleared up, and we toured Tiananmen Square, which, although the site of a certain event in 1989, is the world’s third largest city square. When we got lost in the hutongs, a group of locals were eager to point us in the right direction. They smiled when they talked, eager to hear what we thought of their city. And no one ever asked me if I wanted a prostitute.
We saved the Great Wall for the final day. Though most tourists visited Badaling, a sight on the Wall that was open to the public and featured large crowds and unnecessary entertainment like zoo animals, my friend Austen and I decided to visit an unrestored part of the Wall that wasn’t officially open to the public. We had read about it on some sketchy blog we found on the later pages of a Google search result, and after a train ride, two buses, and an hour-long hike, we reached our improbable destination.
I experienced an indescribable awe that day. It wasn’t quite like reaching the top of a mountain, where part of the joy is enjoying the view from a height you worked so hard to conquer. Rather, I was treated to the sight of nothing but a crumbling wall stretching on for miles and miles. Things were calm; my phone was off, and we had nothing in our pockets besides a bit of cash and some snacks we snuck with us from an all-you-can eat breakfast buffet. For two hours, maybe three, the Great Wall of China belonged to us—two tourists trying to get away from Shanghai.
I eventually returned to Shanghai, which, surprisingly enough, hadn’t improved while I was away. But I didn’t care as much. I was able to recognize the group of amazing people, both international and Chinese, I had the opportunity to spend seven weeks with. There are still some leftover mysteries from that summer, however. I don’t know why I decided to go to Beijing that weekend, much less why I was in China in the first place. I still don’t understand certain Chinese customs, and my Mandarin is no better than it was before I visited. Yet I was fortunate enough to learn one important truth: Sometimes you need an escape. Sometimes you need to get away.
Just don’t go to Shanghai.

In Holden Chapel’s 269 years of existance in Harvard Yard,  the space has served as a clubhouse, dissection theater, chapel, rehearsal hall, morgue, lecture hall, museum, medical school, gallery, military barrack, storeroom, laboratory, fire engine house, and even the seat of the Province House of Representatives. All of those things in a tiny little rectangle of space.

The initials in reverse are those of Marian Alice Appleton, the wife of George von Lengerke Meyer, who was the sister of McKim’s late wife Julia. It is said that she donated money to help complete the gate when McKim ran out of funds, and thus McKim hid her initials on the gate.

“Taken as a whole, education seeks to do two things: help young persons fulfill the unique, particular functions in life which it is in them to fulfill, and fit them so far as it can for those common spheres which, as citizens and heirs of a joint culture, they will share with others.”
— General Education in a Free Society: Report of the Harvard Committee, 1945
An art historian, a physicist, and a scholar of Romance literatures huddle together over sandwiches, discussing the possibilities of interactive teaching. Gathered from disciplines that rarely intersect, these three professors have given up their lunch hours to trade pedagogical ideas. They are attending an informal workshop held once a semester, each centered on topics such as integrating digital technology or nontraditional assignments into curricula. These meetings aren’t part of a “big flashy initiative” to dramatically change the undergraduate curriculum, says Stephanie H. Kenen, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, but are rather a “certain kind of slow but steady underground current of conversations about teaching.” These workshops are hosted by the Committee on General Education, and this is the kind of plodding progress that typifies the Program in General Education.
For students at the College today, Gen Ed is a constant for all, no matter their academic and extracurricular interests. Yet it’s a program still in it’s infancy, just the latest step in a series of attempts the College has made to carve out for its students a meaningful undergraduate education
Harvard College’s curriculum began as a rigid program in which all students took a nearly identical array of courses and was revolutionized at the turn of the 20th century, when then-president Charles W. Eliot promoted “spontaneous diversity of choice” and allowed undergraduates to choose most of their classes freely. In the following decades, the University instituted the concentration system and the first distribution requirements.
Then, during the summer of 1945, in the waning months of the Second World War, a Harvard committee composed of professors and administrators published a report entitled “General Education in a Free Society.” This report, more commonly known as the “Redbook,” detailed a philosophy that formulated an upheaval of the Harvard College curriculum. The Redbook curriculum, which was the first iteration of General Education at Harvard, was based on lofty democratic goals. To prevent the horrors of the war from recurring, it argued that students would need a sophisticated understanding of not only the world but also of their place in it. In the early 1980s, though, the Core Curriculum replaced General Education with a program focused on “ways of knowing” that aimed to train students to think along differing disciplinary lines.
Thirty years later, the Task Force on General Education released a series of recommendations that led to the institution of the Program in General Education—the College’s second stab at doing Gen Ed right. The Task Force envisioned a curriculum that would reinvigorate academics for the 21st-century student. The resulting Gen Ed program has been praised for allowing pedagogical creativity, but also faces criticism from frustrated professors and disinterested students stuck in classes filled beyond their capacity. Now, as the program is up for its first five-year review, the very same questions about the role of a college education in changing times and beyond campus remain contested. If the Redbook curriculum of 1945 was a sweeping, idealistic reconceptualization of undergraduate education, today’s Gen Ed seems by comparison far too quiet to fully realize its goals of rejuvenating academics at Harvard College.
SEEKING A NEW PATH
By the time Gen Ed was implemented in 2008, its predecessor, the Core, had become unwieldy, full of restrictions that frustrated students and professors alike. Strict limitations governed the amount and kind of work that professors could assign in Core classes, complicating the ways in which they were able to design syllabi. The Core also limited the flexibility of the curriculum for undecided students and rendered it difficult to switch concentrations. Requirements were dependent upon department, but few departmental courses counted as Core requirements.
“The menu of student options was very small. You needed to satisfy a requirement in a specific area, in a given semester—and there might be only 10 courses or less offered,” says Louis Menand, an English professor who co-chaired the original Gen Ed Task Force.
The fundamental problems of the Core, however, lay not in the technicalities of its implementation, but instead in its very conception. “The Core suffered from what I call academic narcissism,” says Harry R. Lewis, a computer science professor and former Dean of the College from 1995-2003.
Menand explains that the Core focused on teaching students how to think like academics in different disciplines. The Gen Ed Task Force, in response, “flipped [the rationale of the Core] on its head,” Menand says. “Instead of bringing the students into our world as scholars and researchers, we made our scholarship and research relevant to the lives that students will lead [after college].”
The road to developing a new curriculum was a long one. As early as 2004, a committee of about 20 faculty members and administrators had started meeting every week and continued to do so for two years, even during the summer, hoping to devise a solution to the problems of the Core. The plan proposed by this committee—a simple distribution requirement—never went to vote.
Discussions of a new plan of study at last began to solidify in 2006, when the Task Force in General Education replaced the committee, with Menand and philosophy professor Alison Simmons as its co-chairs. This Task Force was a group of six professors, two undergraduates, and an administrator, Kenen. “Partly just because of [its smaller] size, we were able to make a lot more progress than the very large committee,” says Simmons of the Task Force, also citing the presence on the committee of only one administrator, Kenen, who is now Administrative Director of the Gen Ed program. “I think that gave us a certain amount of liberty to start thinking creatively.”
For the Gen Ed Task Force, thinking creatively meant questioning the very purpose of college-level education and re-evaluating the place of a general curriculum in an atmosphere of increasing pre-professionalism. The statistic that fewer than 10 percent of Harvard students go on to careers in academia sparked the reconsideration of the importance of strict disciplinary training, which had been essential to the Core.
“You can see Gen Ed as trying to realize that vision in the kind of clear-headed awareness that our students are not going to go on to become like us,” says philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, current chair of the Committee on General Education. “Some percentage will go on to become pointy-headed academics like Stephanie [Kenen] and me… But a lot of them are going to be doing very different things. And you still want the courses to stick.”
The committee aimed to place Gen Ed in a distinct role between concentration requirements and electives, the other two components of undergraduate academic life, according to Simmons. If concentration requirements encourage specialization and depth, and electives offer broad exploration unfettered by curricular specificity, Gen Ed classes were meant to link the academic experience with the world beyond.
The Task Force aimed to do this by creating courses with curricula that would break out of the self-referential mold of traditional academia. The lengthy category titles (although “a bit baroque and pretentious,” for Lewis) were intended to cut across disciplines to create categories that did not align exactly with University departments. Such categories “would jar you into thinking about why you’re doing what you do,” Simmons says.
The Task Force’s discussions raised difficult questions about the place of different modes of thought in an essential undergraduate education—questions which became tied up with interdepartmental tensions. “It was a political thing,” Lewis says. One of the proposed Gen Ed requirements that was never realized was “Religion and Faith,” for which Simmons and others advocated; some faculty, however, feared that the requirement would place undue emphasis on religion in the secular environment of the College. The category, though, was intended to examine religion through philosophical, anthropological, and historical lenses.
The Task Force ultimately decided on the creation of the eight categories familiar to all undergraduates today: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World. One of these courses must engage with the “Study of the Past.”
The Task Force was disbanded before the Gen Ed program went into effect in fall of 2008. Today, its work continues through the Standing Committee on General Education, a group composed of faculty members, undergraduates, and Kenen that explores pedagogical issues in bi-weekly meetings, in which they discuss proposals for new Gen Ed classes. It is largely through these meetings that Gen Ed works to carry out its mission of making a broad curriculum also a stimulating one.
A CURRICULUM REBORN
When Katherine K. Merseth, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education, submitted her first proposal for a United States in the World course, she had already spent six months developing its syllabus with a research assistant. The Committee on General Education, however, asked her to revise the proposal to make it better suited for a general audience of undergraduates. It would take three more tries before her course was, at last, approved.
“It felt a little bit like I was shooting in the dark,” Merseth says of her experience adjusting her proposal. The review process led her to broaden the scope of the course, give it deeper historical context, and create “more of an intellectual backbone,” she says. Despite her frustration with the long process, “in hindsight it’s a stronger course because of that.” Her class, titled USW 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” is highly praised by students and received an overall Q-guide score of 4.46 out of a possible 5 in the fall of 2012.
Caroline Light, a lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, says her course, USW 26: “Sex and the Citizen” has changed enormously over the years she has been teaching it as a result of mentoring from the Committee. “I’ve worked really hard to particularly sculpt the assignments around what I perceive to be the students’ needs and expectations—for instance: level of challenge, pacing, experience with digital technology,” she says. “I worked to make the course a better reflection of what the students are expecting and needing intellectually.” Today, Light herself serves on the Committee on Gen Ed.
Even professors who have not yet taught Gen Ed classes cite the program as a source of pedagogical inspiration. Chemistry and chemical biology professor Tobias Ritter, who joined the Committee on Gen Ed this semester, says he thinks his recent membership will improve his own teaching. “I’m already thinking about how I can change my current [non-Gen Ed] class to implement what I’m learning about new teaching techniques… through those proposals—through my colleagues—that otherwise I wouldn’t even have had access to.” For Ritter, one of the key lessons offered by Gen Ed is the importance of clarifying why students are learning what they learn—a question he believes is often lost in the standard shuffle of teaching.
Another strength of the Gen Ed program over the Core is its commitment to interdisciplinary teaching, says Andrew Berry, a lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology who has taught two separate Gen Ed classes over several years. The Science of Living Systems course he teaches with History of Science Department Chair Janet Browne, “Understanding Darwinism,” thrives on the collaboration of two professors of different disciplines, he believes. “You can’t [teach in a historical context] all the time in a science course, but it gives a better appreciation of the idea if you look at the struggles and hurdles to get over before getting to that idea,” he says. “And vice versa; you get a much better appreciation of the history if you have a fairly sophisticated understanding of the idea.” The class earned an overall Q-guide score of 4.29 in the spring of 2011, with one evaluator commenting on the value of this interplay: “The Browne-Berry double-act is priceless.”
The Gen Ed program is often the space in which experimentation in pedagogy is discussed and develops. A section of the Task Force’s 2007 report is specifically dedicated to the topic, emphasizing the importance of rethinking course structure and making assignments interactive.
Physics and history of science professor Peter Galison’s class titled “The Einstein Revolution,” a Science of the Physical Universe Gen Ed, incorporates elements of the flipped classroom, a system in which lectures become digitally enabled homework and class time is devoted to interactive assignments and discussion. The flipped classroom, Galison says, is “particularly well-suited to Gen Ed because the Gen Ed courses are very deliberately not focused on a single specialized group. It really has to address people from every discipline.”
Today, Kenen says, the Gen Ed program is able to inspire critical thinking—like during its meetings over lunch—about how to teach students whose academic backgrounds, technology use, and peer culture may feel alien to some professors. “[There’s] sometimes concern and sometimes excitement about how to be an effective teacher in a changing environment,” Kenen says. “There aren’t obvious places to have that sort of conversation because the faculty are so busy doing other things.”
GENERAL EDUCATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS
Despite its potential to energize classrooms, Gen Ed is often a source of frustration for many students who do not understand the logic behind its requirements. Arpon P. Raksit ’15 describes the confusion of friends who have taken Economics 1011a: “Microeconomic Theory,” instead of the course Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.” Both courses fulfill an Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed requirement, but only Economics 10 counts for United States and the World. Although he believes these students who take the former class learn just as much about U.S. economic policy as they would in Economics 10, these students cannot receive USW Gen Ed credit for their higher-level course. “Things like that seem silly,” he says.
For the Gen Ed Committee, courses in the program must do much more than simply cover material in a given category; they must provide students with both breadth and depth of understanding of that category. The Committee begins its process of course review by comparing proposed syllabi to the description of the intended function of its category. “One big question [the Committee asks] is always: If this was the only class a student took in this category, would that be sufficient?” says Ritter.
As Raksit’s example suggests, though, this method carries the risk of rigidity, a characteristic of the Core program that the designers of the Gen Ed program sought to improve. And while Berry’s interdisciplinary approach and Galison’s innovative class structure signal Gen Ed’s success in promoting some of the teaching practices outlined by the original Task Force, the program struggles to realize some of the other goals set forth in the 2007 report.
Large class sizes, an issue the Task Force had cautioned against, remain a point of contention for students and faculty. Because Gen Ed classes are taught for a college-wide audience and there are a limited number offered each semester, many inevitably draw large crowds. These large classes often suffer from a dearth of adequately-trained teaching fellows, leading to highly variable teaching in sections. Large classes can also result in the pedagogical challenges that Gen Ed aimed to improve, as they limit direct interaction between professors and students. And yet other Gen Ed classes, often those that maintain a reputation for rigor, are kept disproportionately small, leading to a lopsided distribution of students between classes.
Course workload and professors’ expectations also vary widely across courses. “If…your professor’s likely to ask you what you thought about last night’s readings, you might move it up in your priority list,” says Merseth, who frequently cold-calls on the students in her USW class and places heavy emphasis on activity-based learning. “But if it’s just a sit-and-passively-get kind of class, then I wouldn’t do the readings either.”
Not all professors teaching in Gen Ed, however, have the same expectations. Instead, often “there’s a little bit of a race-to-the-bottom pressure [on professors] to reduce the amount of work and the intensity of the course requirements in order to attract student enrollments into the course,” says Logan S. McCarty, lecturer on physics and chemistry and chemical biology.
This situation often creates a feedback loop in which neither students nor professors strive for high levels of engagement in Gen Ed courses. Of course, such a system is far from the intentions of the Gen Ed program and the interests of most professors. Yet an “unspoken contract” can develop, McCarty explains, in which students expect minimal workload, and faculty are willing to teach as long as students enroll in high numbers.
Consequently, the tenor of Gen Ed classes tends to be markedly different from that of concentration-specific courses, in which students are more likely to enroll out of genuine interest. “The best thing that I experience in my Math classes or my Computer Science classes is that everyone is extremely interested in the material and very invested,” says Raksit, a mathematics concentrator. “I think that’s almost entirely absent from the Gen Ed classes I’ve taken.”
BEYOND THE IVIED WALLS
McCarty attributes the oft-minimal importance students place on Gen Ed classes to a student culture that emphasizes the extracurricular over the academic. Among extracurricular and vocational commitments, Gen Ed is placed at the bottom of an increasingly long list of priorities.
And if students are doing much of their learning outside of the classroom, the program’s emphasis on making academia relevant outside of students’ particular interests may miss the mark: Some students argue, in fact, that an awareness of the wider world is best taught outside of the classroom instead. “I think a lot of the skills that go into things that aren’t academia are more on the level of communication,” says Raksit. “That’s not necessarily something that you have to teach in Gen Eds.”
So while the Report of the Task Force on Gen Ed from 2007 details that an important component of its mission is to provide “a general education curriculum that is responsive to the conditions of the twenty-first century,” it cannot account for the fact that twenty-first century students work in a college environment in which “the amount of space…for academic work has diminished,” according to McCarty.
Kenen points to Gen Ed’s potential to affect students’ current lives. “A lot of learning happens in the extracurricular world, a lot of intellectual learning, practical learning—being in the world learning—and the disconnect between that and the academic lives of our students is sometimes surprising,” she says. “It’s certainly surprising to the faculty.” But somewhat ironically, the Gen Ed program is in many ways directed at the needs and interests of a student body that is already looking outward—but beyond the classroom walls. The Gen Ed vision of integrated extracurricular and academic realms still seems distant.
THE WHEELS OF CHANGE
For some students, the goals of Gen Ed have been more fully realized. Like Raksit and others, Cara M. Weisman ’14 didn’t always appreciate the Gen Ed system. As a molecular and cellular biology concentrator, she couldn’t understand why an English class she had taken on Oscar Wilde, her favorite author, didn’t satisfy her Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding requirement.
After working on the Committee on General Education, however, Weisman says she has come to understand the criteria that separates Gen Ed classes from simple electives. “I think I’m actually much more positive about what the Gen Ed is trying to do, because all of its goals seem reasonable,” she says.
Perhaps this will be Gen Ed’s greatest difficulty in the years to come: Beyond implementing its mission, the program may struggle to communicate its goals to the students it tries to serve. To become invested in the program, students must understand its rationale. “I think creating a culture and atmosphere of receptivity is really important to the Gen Ed,” Weisman says, “and I don’t think that’s possible unless they really get the word out about why they think that [the program] is important.”
Barr Yaron ’14, another member of the committee, agrees. She would like students to possess “a clear sense of the purpose of each class in the Gen Ed program, why it’s in that category, and why it’s in the Gen Ed family.” Through understanding the restrictions and possibilities of Gen Ed, Yaron believes, students will become excited about its mission.
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, whose work for the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee has also given him reason to think about Gen Ed more closely, is quick to recount the story of how Diana Eck’s Culture and Belief course, “Hindu Worlds of Art and Culture,” changed his perception of Indian politics. Although Goyal is from India and has focused his studies on government and politics, the Gen Ed system injected a new and surprising perspective into his studies, reshaping the boundaries with which he approached the topic at hand. “[CB 28] helped me understand one more facet of Indian politics, which is really the intersection between religion and politics—in my own country,” he says. “That’s the beauty of a Harvard education.”
The unspoken promise of Gen Ed was just this kind of success story that Goyal describes: an institutionalized opportunity to rethink thinking and relearn learning. The Gen Ed program of today, however, for all its advances, does not go so far as the radical reinvention of 1945’s Redbook curriculum. The Redbook, printed by Harvard University Press, sold thousands of copies in its first month of printing. It was a report meant to be read—by students and by educators, at Harvard and across the nation.
Most of today’s students at the College, though, have never read the 2007 Task Force’s report on Gen Ed, and the vast majority of them will never serve on the Standing Committee in Gen Ed, in which they might examine the system more intimately. This means that many will have no knowledge of the basic principles that underlie their curriculum. These students simply see eight categories that need to be crossed off a list: eight boxes to check. For these students, it seems, faculty conversations over lunch may not be enough to overcome curricular stagnation and make general education a source of intellectual stimulation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A Harvard Divinity School student, and co-author of a new book, discussed the state of American health care Wednesday and addressed the question of why, even though the American health care system is costlier than that of any other nation, American health outcomes pale in comparison to those of residents of other countries.
 
“The American Health Care Paradox,” a new book co-written by Harvard Divinity School student Lauren A. Taylor, tackles this question by recognizing a tendency for the U.S. to spend disproportionately more money on health care than on other social services which might affect health. Taylor presented her book and fielded questions at the book release event.
 
After snacking on wine and cheese and taking their seats, the audience listened as Taylor explained the issues at the crux of the paradox.
 
“High spending, not-great outcomes,” Taylor said. “That’s the paradox. If you want to talk about ink spilt, there is a lot of ink spilt on this issue.”
 
Despite the abundance of literature on this paradox, Taylor’s book illustrates the fact that the misallocation of resources toward health care over social costs is not reflective of the factors that have been found to lead to health outcomes. The top three factors she cited were behavioral patterns, social circumstances, and genetic predisposition, while health care accounted only for a tenth of the contributions to overall health.
 
In writing the book, Taylor collaborated with Elizabeth H. Bradley ’84, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
 
“We’re very much a complementary pair,” Taylor said, adding that Bradley’s background in economics and epidemiology aligns with her interests in the history of science and public health.
 
As a student at the Divinity School, Taylor said she used her knowledge of culture and values in the U.S. to explain the seemingly counterintuitive investment approach to health care, comparing values in America to values in places like Scandinavia and Western Europe, which have drastically different health care systems.
 
“We found this through field study: we have a very narrow sense of what health is,” Taylor said. “Health, to us, is freedom from disease produced through one mechanism, and that is good health care.”
 
In anticipation of the interview circuit that accompanies non-fiction book releases, Taylor expressed some trepidation about taking on the controversial and politically charged issue of health care in public.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Researchers from Harvard, together with members of a group created by the Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center, released a report last week that proposed ways to expand access to clinical trial data.
 
The report--published online in The New England Journal of Medicine--outlined the possible benefits and risks, ethical and legal issues, and logistical questions associated with expanding access to participant-level data, which have, in the past, been considered confidential by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates clinical trials of drugs conducted in the US.
 
Addressing concerns about sponsor-supported results, the authors stated that expanded access to clinical data could allow for a greater scientific innovation and a more accurate representation of a product’s safeness and effectiveness.
 
“Our experiences with Vioxx, Avandia, and other widely prescribed drugs that were revealed to have serious safety risks show how important it is to give independent scientists access to clinical trial data,” said Michelle M. Mello, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health and lead author of the report, in a press release.
 
While Mello emphasized the importance of providing independent scientists with access to clinical trial data, she also cautioned against the risk of revealing participants’ identities and providing too much information, which might strain trial sponsors.
 
“The question is, how can we achieve the powerful public health benefits of data sharing while protecting research participants’ privacy, avoiding ‘junk science,’ and minimizing burdens on trial sponsors?” Mello said in the release.
 
The report also discussed current initiatives to expand data access. For instance, the European Medicines Agency recently announced that it will start providing participant-level data that is submitted for regulatory purposes.
 
The authors recommended that new regulations targeted at expanding data sharing should be applied to trials of all approved prescription drugs, medical devices, and biologics in a way that preserves research participant privacy and treats sponsors and researchers “evenhandedly.”
 Although the report does not come to a conclusion about how access to data should be expanded, it emphasizes that the expanded access to data is a question of how the transparency should be achieved, not whether or not it will.

With the development of a more stable form of a unique material, Harvard professors are now closer to finding a way to mask the thermal signatures of objects.
The research, conducted by applied physics professor and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences fellow Federico Capasso, is still in the experimental phases, but promises to have exciting real world applications down the road.
  Every object emits a thermal signature—a certain amount of infrared light—that can be recognized by a thermal detector. That unique signature has practical applications—police, for example, use thermal imaging to find the location of concealed suspects before entering a building.
 A previously undiscovered, stable form of Vanadium oxide, the unique material identified by scientists, is unusual in that as its temperature varies, its thermal signature changes in unusual ways. While normally thermal signatures, as displayed by thermal detectors, would appear red, orange, or yellow at high temperatures and blue and green at lower temperatures, as it approaches the range of 75-85 degrees Celsius, vanadium oxide begins to appear in the blue-green spectrum again, even though objects at that temperature normally appear strongly red.
According to Mikhail A. Kats, a lead author of the study and graduate student member of Capasso’s team, when the team started its research, advancing thermal camouflage was not the goal. Only when research began to uncover this property of vanadium oxide did Capasso and his team began to investigate the possibility.
“Slowly we moved to a slightly different direction; we started working on light absorbing structures in the infrared spectrum” said Kats. 
The team can now reliably reproduce its results and is working to expand the range of temperatures vanadium oxide can be effectively controlled.
Capasso’s team’s work was made possible by the research of Shriram Ramanathan, a materials science professor at SEAS. According to Ramanathan, vanadium oxide is normally highly susceptible to internal stresses and cracking, making it difficult to work with. The research that Capasso and his team conducted was only feasible with reliably resilient samples. Ramanathan developed a new technique for producing vanadium oxide and as a result, he said, “stress generation can be carefully controlled...and we can get very reproducible results.”
Ramanathan said that with his technique, he thought there was “a good chance” that vanadium oxide coating might be offered for objects as usable products in the near future. 
Kats said that such vanadium oxide coatings might be in use within five to ten years, but cautioned that there is still work to be done. 
“We need to be able to control the [temperature] range over which this effect happens” he said, adding that thermal signature control can and will be achieved for much lower temperatures in the future.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 31, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted study author Mikhail A. Kats as saying that his team’s findings counteract the law of thermodynamics. In fact, Katslater wrote in an email, while objects typically emit greater amounts of light as their temperature increases, his team demonstrated a structure that exhibits the opposite effect.

With the approval of Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan two weeks ago, the Harvard-Allston Task Force is now shifting its focus to finalizing a community benefits package linked to the IMP. Simultaneously, Harvard is preparing for the development of the residential and retail complex at Barry’s Corner, the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard Street.
 
Although the BRA board approved the University’s nine-project, ten-year plan two weeks ago, members of the BRA emphasized that the IMP is a long-term zoning document that does not examine the impact of each project in the plan. Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that each project will receive individual review before its construction.
 
The Barry’s Corner project, which received approval from the Boston Redevelopment Authority last April, will begin a 30-day site-preparation period in December. After this preparatory period, buildings on the current site will be demolished to open space for the facility that will include 325 housing units and over 40,000 square feet of retail space.
 
Leslie G. Cohen, senior vice president for Samuels & Associates—the firm charged with constructing the retail and residential commons—said that she did not think that this demolition process will unduly disturb the community. 
 
Cohen also said that Samuels & Associates plans to break ground in early spring. The building is expected to be ready for occupancy by the fall of 2015.
 
“How that project goes off is going to show a ton of people that these things can go well,” said John Cusack, a member of the task force.
 
Cusack spoke of the excitement some Allston residents feel over breaking ground on development projects that have been in the planning stage for years.
 
“That was a really hard thing in the neighborhood when [construction on Harvard’s science complex] stopped,” he said, referring to President Drew G. Faust’s decision to pause construction of a billion-dollar science complex in Allston in 2009.
 
Cusack said he sees the Samuels project as an important test that could instill confidence from the community for Harvard’s future construction projects. 
 
“It’s going to be one heck of a white elephant if that doesn’t [go well],” Cusack said.
 
John A. Bruno, another task force member, expressed the need to address the potential infrastructural strain of the influx of residents to Barry’s Corner. Bruno also mentioned the importance of including housing in the community benefits package associated with the University’s approved IMP.
 
He said that people have a greater stake in the community with home ownership, although he raised the need to include affordable housing and rentals in a community benefits proposal.
 
A revised community benefits proposal is due to BRA by Nov. 20 for board review. The task force’s proposal will respond to a $28 million community benefits package Harvard put forward earlier this month.

A new Harvard study published in the Journal of Animal Ecology reveals that predator animals are less active on most moonlit nights, while prey animals that exhibit visual acuity and have more habitual cover, such as lemurs, are more active.
 
Many nocturnal prey animals perform activities under the cover of darkness to protect themselves from predators. Scientists traditionally suspected that these prey animals are less active on bright nights when increased moonlight enhances predators’ ability to detect them.
 
However, the new study conducted by Harvard research associate Christopher D. Golden ’05 and University of Alaska-Fairbanks professor Laura R. Prugh found that moonlight does not necessarily increase predation risk—the extra light also gives prey increased ability to detect predators.
 
“What we found was that if predators were benefited by moonlight, then the prey may also benefit,” Golden said.
 
The study examined the effects of moonlight on the activity of 59 nocturnal mammal species. The researchers investigated factors such as habitat cover preference, visual acuity, taxonomy and trophic level—an animal’s position on the food chain.
 
“Our results were unanticipated because we had thought that the effect of moonlight would be moderated by the influence of a species’ trophic level,” Golden said.
 
Golden and Prugh said that they were surprised to discover that trophic level did not play a huge role in predation risk in animals. Instead, the scientists found that prey species with vision as their primary sensory system were more active in the moonlight, whereas prey species with other primary senses were less active.
 
“The ways in which species find and detect each other was a primary determinant of the way in which moonlight influenced behavior where those who rely on sight were the most affected, Golden said. “Secondly, taxonomy was a major influence as well perhaps explaining that there are some evolutionary or adaptive roots to the role of moonlight in behavior.”
 
Thus, primates like lemurs increased their activity on moonlit nights while predator activity and  the activity of some prey animals with evolutionary predispositions away from moonlight  including rodents, rabbits, and bats fell.
 
Golden also suggests that human behavior may also have an effect on the predator-prey dynamic through the use of artificial lights during nighttime hours.
 
“With urbanization ever increasing and city lights pouring out into wild areas, it is possible that these artificial lights are having similar or stronger effects than moonlight on the behavior of organisms,” Golden said.
 Golden believes his and Prugh’s study begs scientists to reconsider the popular expectation that predator behavior drives that of prey. He instead suggested that the prey’s reduced activity may reduce the activity of predators due to predators’ reduced ability to hunt successfully when the prey stays hidden.

Twenty students packed Winthrop House’s Tonkens Room on Wednesday night to brainstorm ways to improve life at Harvard for queer students.  The town-hall-style meeting was sponsored by the Queer Advisory Council, a student-run branch of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life established this fall.
“The hope [of the event] is to get a wide range of perspectives from across the undergraduate community regarding what’s working and what stands to be improved,” said Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16 , interim co-chair of Council.  “Different folks have different experiences and so the purpose of the town hall is to get all of those out and use these voices as a tool for whatever things the QuAC is working on for the rest of the semester.”
Blecher-Cohen began the meeting by passing out a form to each attendee inviting them to write one thing they would like to talk about or see improved in each of five categories: BGLTQ/Queer Communities, Campus Climate, House Life, Institutional Policy, and Resources.  Each attendee then introduced themselves, providing their first name, house, and preferred gender pronouns.
Students at the meeting discussed concerns ranging from the shortage of institutionalized space for queer students identifying as females, to the hetero-normative nature of student-led “Community Conversations” seminars during Freshman Orientation, to the lack of resources for sexual assault victims in the queer community.
Participants also recommended solutions for many of the problems they identified.
For example, attendees proposed that the College create a unified website featuring descriptions of all BGLTQ support groups on campus to provide freshmen better guidance.  They also suggested that the College publish each fall a list of queer faculty members prepared to support students.
“The meeting succeeded in bringing out a pretty diverse section of the community,” said Ivel Posada ’14, co-chair of the Queer Students and Allies board.  “I thought that it enriched the conversation in really substantive ways.”
Despite the event’s focus on addressing problems at the College, participants maintained an upbeat tone.
“Coming into Harvard as a freshman, I think it’s really great that there’s so many venues for people to express themselves and to get involved in the queer community,” said one attendee, who asked to remain anonymous.  “Especially for people coming from backgrounds where that wasn’t always an option, it’s one of the best things that I’ve seen at Harvard so far.  It’s nice to be involved in an intellectual and progressive discussion.”
The QuAC’s next meeting, which will be open to the public, is scheduled for Saturday, November 2 from  2 pm to 4 pm in the Office for BGLTQ Student Life.

According to a new study conducted at Harvard Medical School, structured exercise programs may be as effective, or even more useful, than medication to treat cardiovascular conditions.
 
Huseyin Naci, a visiting fellow at the Medical School, and John Ioannidis, adjunct professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, evaluated and synthesized the results of 305 previous studies to compare the benefits of drug and exercise regimens on disease outcomes. 
 
After identifying four conditions for which exercise has been studied as a preventive technique—coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and type-2 diabetes—Naci and Ioannidis compared the efficacy of drugs used to treat these conditions to previously-reported effects of exercise. 
 
They found that structured physical activity was more effective than drug use in the treatment and prevention of strokes, and equally effective in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes.  Diuretic drugs were more successful than exercise, however, in treating heart failure.
 
The study is the first of its kind to use statistical techniques of network meta-analysis to compare these different health interventions.
 
“There is a lot of literature on the medical benefits of exercise alone,” said Naci. “There’s also quite a lot of literature on the life saving benefits of some drugs, but there really isn’t much comparing them directly, so that’s the rationale for doing this study.”
 
While exercise may facilitate treatment of some ailments, Naci emphasized that patients should always consult with their doctors before choosing to forgo medication. The findings “do not imply that people should stop taking their medications, because it’s just one study,” he said.
 
But the researchers hope their initial study will inspire continued work, especially in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies developing many of the drugs of interest.
 
“[Our study] will trigger debate, which is really important,” said Naci. “In cases where we have evidence of exercise, exercise seems to do really well in comparison to drugs, but there are still a lot of instances where we don’t know how exercise fares against drugs.” 
 
The study was published in the British Medical Journal earlier this month.

According to a panel of Harvard faculty members and students, the “inanity” in the killing of Trayvon Martin was not the outcome of the trial, but the laws that promote situations like it.
 
The discussion, held Wednesday evening, was organized by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and Cabot House. It was the first in a series of panels on race and justice created to analyze the implications of the Martin case on race relations in the U.S. and within the Harvard community specifically.
 
Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager, was shot and killed February 2012 in Sanford, Fla. by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. After facing charges of second-degree manslaughter and murder, Zimmerman was acquitted in July.
 
The five-person panel consisted of Ronald S. Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School and Winthrop Housemaster; Timothy G. Benson, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School; and three undergraduates. They analyzed the social and psychological ramifications of Florida’s “stand-your-ground” law,  which gives individuals the right to defend themselves with deadly force without any requirement to evade or retreat from the dangerous situation. The law was influential in the defense of George Zimmerman.
 
“The stand-your-ground law was written in a way that demanded the verdict,” Sullivan said.
 
The other panelists agreed that the law did not uphold justice in Martin’s case, and outlined other aspects of the trial that they believed were troubling.
 
“The case seemed to be thrown in a way by the prosecution,” Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15, one of the panelists and president of the Harvard College Black Men’s Forum, said, which led to witnesses being “unprepared for the onslaught of the defense’s cross-examination.”
 
Sullivan added that the law has significant psychological impacts that promote tragic outcomes, stating that “it provokes a frontiersman-like mentality in people.”
 
Benson concurred with Sullivan, noting the “dynamic between power and privilege.” He said that Zimmerman felt empowered by his position as a neighborhood watch volunteer and thus thought he had the right to act in a certain way.
 
Attitudes towards African Americans also played an important role in the Martin case, according to Sullivan, who cited figures that showed there is a statistically higher likelihood of white attackers being acquitted when the victim is African-American than when the victim is white.
 
“Blackness often serves as a crude proxy for criminality,” Sullivan said.
 
Differential attitudes toward minorities persist here at Harvard too, according to S. Allen Counter, a professor of neurology and director of the Harvard Foundation.
 
“What eludes our white friends is the concept of racial humiliation,” Counter said in an interview with The Crimson following the event. “They say things that they wouldn’t say to white colleagues.”
 
For Counter, the aim of these discussions and of the Harvard Foundation in general is to approach the issue of racial bias in the Harvard community in a “civil manner.” This series of panels on race and justice is just one example of the approach, he added.
 “The Foundation wants to see a Harvard where students don’t have to be distracted by race,” Counter said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each fall for the past four years, hundreds of undergraduates have vied for a seat in a Science Center lecture hall for the perennially popular course, Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.” Some students are food enthusiasts eager to sample the cooking of famous chefs or learn the science behind their favorite recipes, while others come looking to fulfill one of their science General Education requirements.
But enrollees in this year’s version of the course were exposed to more than just the cooking demonstrations and problem sets they were expecting. This fall, course instructors debuted a new set of online course materials, including pre-recorded lecture videos and comprehension questions derived from SPU27x, the online equivalent of “Science and Cooking.” This virtual version of the course, open to anyone with an internet connection, is hosted on HarvardX, the subset of Harvard and MIT’s virtual education platform edX devoted to online courses taught by Harvard faculty. 
While SPU27x has seen the highest enrollment of any HarvardX course offered this fall, reaction to this year’s on-campus course has been mixed. Halfway through the semester, some students have already dropped the class, saying they find the virtual course materials to be disappointing.
“When I finally got lotteried in, I was really excited about it, but this edX component turned me off,” said Denise Acosta ’15, who dropped “Science and Cooking” after the second week. 
“Science and Cooking” is one of several courses that have been restructured this year with the help of online pedagogical tools, and given that faculty leaders of HarvardX have repeatedly emphasized their goal of enriching the classroom experience, this year’s set of virtually enhanced courses is likely to be just the start of a gradual process of greater experimentation in Harvard classrooms.
Although HarvardX’s proponents claim that virtual education has the potential to transform the traditional lecture format, the process of bringing HarvardX to the brick-and-mortar classroom is still in its very early stages. This semester, the third since Harvard and MIT announced the launch of edX, many students are questioning whether these new models of instruction are enhancing—or detracting from—the learning process.
INTRODUCING THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM
This year’s version of “Science and Cooking” is being taught as a “flipped classroom”: a teaching style in which online materials deliver instruction that would have otherwise been covered during class time. Several other Gen Eds—Culture and Belief 22: “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization,” History of Science 121: “The Einstein Revolution,” and Societies of the World 12: “China”—are also experimenting with the flipped classroom format for the first time.
Although the flipped classroom model often requires students to spend extra time on course material, faculty members say that the new structure is intended to enrich the learning experience. “On principle, it’s not my view to add work,” said applied physics professor Michael P. Brenner, who co-teaches “Science and Cooking.” “We should be enhancing the class.”
Mary E. Wahl, head teaching fellow of “Science and Cooking,” said that having students watch lectures videos outside of class allows course staff to utilize Thursday lectures as a recitation section to go through sample calculations for weekly problem sets. 
Similarly, University Professor Peter L. Galison, who teaches “The Einstein Revolution,” said that assigning online videos for homework allows him utilize lectures in a more interactive way. Students in his class currently sit in groups of six to facilitate weekly discussions during class time.
For his part, classics professor Gregory J. Nagy said that while online components in “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization” demand greater work from students, they benefit both his work as a teacher and his students’ work as writers.
“I’m getting much more thinking and much more incisive writing from my students, even if some of them would say it’s adding extra work, but I think that middle step where we use [the HarvardX platform] is a real enhancement to the quality of the essays than Harvard students get the chance to write,” Nagy said. 
‘TURN ON, TUNE IN, DROP OUT’
Nevertheless, many students have claimed that new online course components add little to their mastery of course material and sometimes bear minimal relation to material covered in the classroom.
Jessica P. Menjivar ’15 said she dropped “Science and Cooking” after the second week because she felt the “unexpected level of work” failed to adequately prepare her for the assignments. 
“I made the decision [to drop the class] when I was doing the first p-set, and I felt very unprepared despite watching all the online videos and going to class,” Menjivar said. “I did not expect the first p-set to take so long if I had done all the prep work.”
According to A., a senior in “Science and Cooking” who asked to be identified only by his first initial out of concern that his comments could adversely impact his grade, course staff initially indicated that the HarvardX version of the course would merely provide supplementary information for problem sets and the midterm. 
But this turned out not to be the case, according to A. “The videos are more tangential and not directly relevant. Because of that, people are not spending the time they’re meant or purposed to,” he said.
Moreover, without a lecturer to demonstrate in person what needed to be learned, students have expressed confusion over which material they would be held responsible. “The videos contained things you didn’t have to know,” Acosta said. “They went into detail, and it wasn’t apparent or obvious about what detail you had to know.” 
LEARNING AMONG ‘STRANGERS’
As online components play a more significant role in undergraduate courses, some students have also expressed concern over a lack of direct interaction with faculty and teaching staff. 
Nagy’s “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization” course, for example, no longer has a section; instead, groups of students assigned to a particular teaching fellow sit in a semi-circle on stage during each lecture to discuss class readings in front of their fellow students, who can also choose to participate.
Although these types of classes act as a substitute for sections, direct student interaction with teaching fellows in the new format occurs solely through email and designated office hours. 
“The edX course really takes the human connection out of classes,” said Sean M. Frazzette ’16, speaking about this year’s version of “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization.” “I feel like talking through ideas [in section] is much more beneficial than self-assessments online and weekly emails to, in some cases, strangers.”
Students in "The Einstein Revolution” described similar feelings of isolation as course activity increasingly moves into the virtual realm. 
“We're given material each week through the lecture videos and are tested on it without being able to ask the professor to clarify or explain concepts,” said Ben, a student in “The Einstein Revolution” who asked that his name be changed because he was worried that his comments could adversely affect his grade in the course. 
According to Galison, the new version of “The Einstein Revolution” is still in its early stages of experimentation. “No one knows how to do this,” he said. “I’m learning new things all the time...I’m constantly going back to the students, asking what’s working, what’s not.”
Ben acknowledged that virtual learning does have the potential to enrich courses on campuses, but said that current uses of online course materials have failed to contribute positively to the undergraduate experience.
“As Harvard students, we come here to learn from and interact with professors personally,” Ben said. “Let's cut out the middle man.”
FOSTERING FEEDBACK 
Behind the scenes of Harvard’s new “flipped classrooms” is a collaborative effort at the University to evaluate their impact on pedagogy and the student experience. 
Staff from the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, and the HarvardX research team are conducting focus groups and surveys on each flipped classroom course this semester, according to Andrew D. Ho, research director at HarvardX.
A survey of students in “China” due to be released in November showed relatively positive opinions about new online modules for the course, Ho said. 
“I was surprised to the degree how positive people were,” said Ho, who is also an associate professor at the Graduate School of Education. “On average...[the students] found them to be very useful.”
Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX and director of the Bok Center, said that the pedagogy behind active learning is based on a vast body of social science literature. In particular, Lue noted that educational research has shown evidence of the initial difficulties of switching to flipped classrooms. 
“It’s well-documented that the first time you do a flipped classroom, it's uncomfortable because it's so different,” Lue said.
As Harvard’s online presence continues to expand—HarvardX plans to add nine new courses over the next year—on-campus incorporation of online materials will continue, with feedback from ongoing efforts to determine the best methods for conducting undergraduate classes.
“We are in active research mode of constant improvement, and we have systematic data collection going on,” Ho said. 
STANDING BY BRICKS AND MORTAR 
Although the flipped classroom has become an increasingly common structure for Harvard courses in the past few years, some professors stand by more conventional methods of teaching. 
Two of the on-campus courses available to undergraduates that have been or are currently being offered on the HarvardX platform, Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice” and Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” are still taught in the traditional live classroom format.
"I have never required or even encouraged on-campus students in ‘Justice’ to watch my online lectures before class,” government professor Michael J. Sandel wrote in an email, pointing to the crucial role of student participation in his lectures.
“To have students watch online lectures in advance would risk dampening the spontaneous, unpredictable, and open-ended quality of the discussions we have in Sanders Theater," Sandel wrote. 
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, who signed a letter asking for more faculty oversight over HarvardX, echoed Sandel’s sentiment. Although Hall said that the evaluative components of virtual courses can be very beneficial for students, teaching should only be done in person. 
“As far as I'm concerned, nothing can properly substitute for what I do in lecture,” Hall said.

Students and tourists alike better watch out as they walk through the Yard this week, because the Harvard women’s rugby team (3-2, 3-1 Ivy) is on the hunt for an Ivy League Championship, and they will do whatever it takes to get there.
“Our coaches have been stressing keeping the intensity and visualizing tackling people that we walk by on the streets to get in that mindset of having to do it on the field,” co-captain Brandy Machado said.
In rugby, it can take many tries to win a game. However, for the women’s rugby team it only took one try to make an impact in its inaugural varsity season. The squad heads to Dartmouth this weekend to compete in the women’s rugby Ivy League Championships.
The Crimson, seeded second, will face third-seeded Brown in the first round on Saturday. No. 1 seed Dartmouth will be facing fourth-seeded Princeton. If it wins on Saturday, Harvard expects to play Dartmouth in the final game on Sunday for the league title. The Big Green is undefeated so far this season.
Going into the season, the Crimson had high expectations. Seeing as the team had experienced recent success, winning the USA Rugby Collegiate Division II National Championship in 2011 as a club team, they hoped to continue that pattern in 2013 with their varsity status.
“This is exciting for us because [winning Ivy Championships] has been our primary goal for this season,” fellow co-captain Ali Haber said.
By beating Princeton on October 19th, Harvard was guaranteed an automatic spot in the tournament rather than being forced to compete in a play-in game. The week allowed the team to rest and spend more time on strategy.
“We’ve been trying different game plans, putting people in different positions, and trying to add different plays to our list,” Machado said.
Prior to consecutive wins against Princeton and Brown, the Crimson had an up-and-down regular season, with early losses to Quinnipiac and Dartmouth straddling a victory against Yale. The two most recent wins have given confidence to the team and built momentum going into the most important weekend of the season.
“We are hungry for more of that,” Machado said. “We haven’t tapered off. We are working on building from that so we can do it again against Brown and whoever we play after them. It’s fueling the fire.”
The last time Harvard faced the Bears, the team came out victorious with a final score of 57-7. Xanni Brown was key to the victory as she scored more than half of Harvard’s points. The senior co-captain leads the team in tries for the season with 12 and looks to be a major asset throughout the tournament. Machado also had three tries in the match and is also one of the team’s high-scorers for the season.
“We have a lot of speed in the back and the forwards which is not true for a lot of teams,” Haber said. “We also have some huge kickers which can be helpful in many situations.”
Although the team has focused heavily on its matchup against Brown in the first round, the Crimson has also been studying Dartmouth’s strategy, as the Big Green will likely be the opponent in the final round.
When Harvard played Dartmouth earlier this season, things did not go as the team would have hoped. The Crimson dropped a close match by a final score of 10-5.
“We know they will have new tricks up their sleeve, but we will too,” Brown said.
Despite holding the Big Green to only two tries, Haber wasn’t pleased with the way things went and adds that the team is hungry for a rematch against their Ivy foe.
“We came out a little bit weak in that game,” Haber said. “Our goal is to show them what they missed out on.”
Expectations are also high for the women, as it is their chance to prove that they have taken advantage of their newly instituted varsity status. Compared to past seasons when they were known as the Harvard Radcliffe Rugby Football Club, the team has received an abundance of new resources with varsity funding. They are the only team in the Ivy League to have gained this status.
“We feel a little bit more responsibility to show what we’ve gotten out of all these resources,” Haber said. “We are getting a lot more resources from our school than any of these other teams are, so that should show in how we play the game.”
Despite Harvard’s resource advantage, the Ivy League has been very competitive this year. Amongst the four teams competing this weekend, there have been several very close games.
“It’s really anybody’s championship to take home,” Brown said.

After a close 3-1 loss to defending national champion Princeton last weekend, the Harvard field hockey team moved on and prevailed last night, earning a 1-0 win over Northeastern in the Huskies’ last home game of the season.
“Princeton was a tough loss, but I think we still played really well against them,” sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson said. “I think being able to compete with one of the top teams just gave us all confidence that we could be playing a lot better, so coming into this game, we knew we could play better, and we just tried to prove that.”
Freshman Marissa Balleza continued her impressive rookie campaign, scoring the game-winner with just four minutes left in regulation. With no defenders in sight, Balleza received a nice pass from junior Kaitlyn Boudah and chipped the ball high into the right side of the netting past Northeastern goalkeeper Cara Ahlgrim.
“The first half was a little slow,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We didn’t have that many shots or short corners. But we picked it up in the second half and were eventually able to score and come home with the win.”
Balleza, with her ninth goal of the season, also extended her point streak to seven consecutive games. The rookie is proving to be one of the brighter spots on a squad that feels itself improving as the season continues.
“The score might not show it, but I think we did a lot better at spreading the field and connecting our passes,” Jacobson said. “It took a while to get started and get in the motion of things, which seems to be our common problem. But I think we’re getting there, and I think overall it was a good game.”
Northeastern dominated the opening half, as the Crimson took some time to get themselves going. The Huskies held a 10-4 advantage in shots and had seven penalty corners before halftime.
However, they just could not get the ball past senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield. After allowing three goals against Princeton last weekend, Hatfield returned to the field against the Huskies and made seven saves to preserve the shutout.
“She made some incredible saves,” Painter said. “I think they had eight short corners, and she just had so many saves and just really set us up well and put us in a good position to win.”
Painter nearly put the team ahead with only one minute left before halftime, but her reverse stick shot went wide of the net, and the teams entered the break still knotted at 0-0. Harvard then rallied in the second half, rattling off six shots in the final thirty-five minutes.
“We knew we needed to score as soon as possible,” Jacobson said. “We were a little on their heels and we were a little more defensive [during the game], but I think at the end, we knew we had to be really offensive and get in the circle and score, so we just went all out.”
The Crimson defenders also clamped down, stifling a Northeastern offense that last year scored four goals in a 4-1 win over Harvard. Despite having nine penalty corners to the Crimson’s four, the Huskies were unable to capitalize on a single opportunity, and only got off two shots in the second half.
“It was still our game, even though it was tied,” Painter said. “We really felt that if we picked it up a little bit, we could come home with the win. Northeastern traditionally has been a very competitive opponent for us, and so we really just wanted to take home this win to get ready for this coming weekend.”
With about ten minutes to go in regulation, Northeastern had perhaps its best chance to take its first lead of the game off its eighth penalty corner of the contest. However, Hatfield refused to yield and managed to keep the Huskies off the board by kicking away freshman Emmy Zweserijn’s one-on-one opportunity.
In the final minutes after Balleza’s tally, Northeastern could not regain momentum, and Harvard held on for the 1-0 win. Having avenged last year’s loss to their crosstown rivals, the team now looks to return to Ivy League play this weekend against Dartmouth.
“We played a very tactically sound game,” Painter said. “But moving forward, especially in practice on Friday, we really need to focus on the basics. We really need to connect our passes and work on our outletting and our shooting because if those things aren’t on, Dartmouth is going to be a very difficult opponent to beat.”

Fact: no one is ever too old to trick-or-treat.
 
If the five-year-old inside of you wants to go knocking on doors and asking for candy this Halloween, don’t try to fight it. The Harvard Square Business Association recently released a list of places in the Square handing out treats this Thursday night.
 
The offerings from a few shops in particular caught our eye. Follow the Honey is handing out spoons of local raw honey, just in case those cute little bear bottles at the Farmer’s Market have been catching your eye. The Just Crust is giving out “candy for kids, and free slices to chaperones!” College students could fit into both categories, so… we get both? And Subway is serving up chocolate chip cookies right out of the oven! Mmm…
 
And if you end up feeling bad about all the candy you’ll be eating, you can always make a trip to the Wellbridge Athletic Club, where healthy treats will be handed out.
 
Honestly, these businesses are probably expecting trick-or-treaters young, innocent, and unravaged by the horrors of Lamont all-nighters. But who doesn’t love candy? If you feel like going trick-or-treating this Halloween, then dress up, dress warm, and find wish-fulfillment in Harvard Square.

The eagerly anticipated piece of surrealism and wit from Donald H. Pfister, Interim Dean of the College, appeared in undergraduate mailboxes on Tuesday afternoon and changed the administrative email game once again, offering intense revelations on subjects as varied as gigantic pumpkins and Instagram.
The subject line, a subtle interpolation of the popular Anglophilic meme of “Keep Calm and (Additional Instruction)” to “Keep Calm and Go Sox,” acts as a bitingly skeptical rebuff of conformity and literary convention.
Pfister next delves into his professorial goings-ons, offering a detailed description of his class’s apple experiments. The Dean even offers a spoiler to those in his course, revealing that “coming on Halloween I will be mentioning the world record pumpkins.” With the kind of technical flourish we have come to expect from Pfister, he embeds a link to the Topsfield Fair, where said pumpkins were put on display earlier in the month.
The highlight of the email is undoubtedly Pfister’s advertisement of his Freshman Parents' Weekend tour of the myriad varieties of trees in Harvard Yard.
No Pfister communiqué would be complete without an erudite literary allusion, and, true to form, he again references how much he "enjoy[s] reading a good mystery." (I also recently learned that my mother bought "How the Light Gets in: A Chief Inspector Gamache Novel," Pfister’s recommended text from last month’s letter, for a plane flight between Denver and San Francisco. Is a merger with Oprah’s Book Club in the works??)
Pfister’s letters captivate the community with their trailblazing honesty, candor, and intellectual depth. I wait with bated breath for what new innovations and insights are in store for the next missive.

Happy Halloween! To celebrate the holiday, here are some throwbacks to remind us of the days back when we made maps with our friends rating which houses had the best candy:
“Monster Mash” by Bobby “Boris” Picket & The Crypt-KickersIt’s hard to forget the catchy pop tunes of the Groovie Goolies and the iconic monster trio of Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie. Jamming to songs from the 60s is also obviously the best way to kick off your Halloween.
“Casper the Friendly Ghost Theme Song”Everyone loves a cute ghost who was a hipster before it was even cool, refusing to conform to expectations that he must scare people. Plus, remember when he fights an evil wizard with young Hilary Duff in the movie Casper Meets Wendy?
“Ghostbusters” by Ray Parker, Jr.This famous song teaches you who you’re “gonna call” in any remotely creepy situation. Listening to it will probably make you want to don a brown jumpsuit and a backpack vacuum.
“The Addams Family Theme Song”We dare you to resist the temptation to snap while listening to this song. Also, it’s hard to forget the scary-looking but oddly endearing Uncle Fester who would not stop sticking lightbulbs in his mouth.
“I Want Candy” by Aaron CarterYou can't object to this dreamy childhood popstar and his extreme desire for Candy. We know that you want candy, too.
“Build Me Up Buttercup” by The FoundationsThere’s no way to refuse a sing-a-long to this old school classic jam. You know you used to jam to this in the shower (and probably still do)... and there’s buttercup in the title, so obviously it’s appropriate for Halloween.
“Scooby Doo Theme Song”Who wouldn’t want to spend their Halloween listening to this classic theme about one of the best talking dogs out there? Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
 
One of the most stressful aspects of the college application process involves narrowing down the number of colleges on your list. Many private college admission counselors will craft a hand-tailored college list for their student clients—it’s one of the many perks of hiring an expert. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford their fees, and for this reason, the Crimson Admission Blog has compiled a guide to creating your very own college list.
1. Start early!
High school is already hard enough. Don’t let creating a college list become an additional stress factor in your life. Creating a college list can be difficult at times, but should ultimately be an exciting process. By starting early, you can ensure that it will not cause undue stress in your life.
2. Brainstorm your ideal college
Be sure to dream big and not limit yourself during this process. How do you imagine yourself as a college student, and what college best fits that vision? It is also important to think beyond the generic qualities of a college (college size, college type, strength of academic programs, location, etc.) and consider the holistic college experience. You’ll call this place home for the next four years, and factors like the student body composition, residential & dining life, class structure, educational values and philosophy, and even weather are more important than you might think.
3. Ask around for college names
Ask your circle of support (teachers, guidance counselors, family, friends, etc.) about their college lists, and if they have recommendations for you. They all likely have some experience in evaluating colleges. More importantly, they know you, and would have insights into what college may suit your tastes.
At the same time, be careful to not let your circle influence what college ends up on your list. In the end, your college shortlist and ultimate decision should be your own.
4. Expand Your List
There are over 4,000 colleges in the United States. That means that although the names you have heard from your support circle is a good starting place, it is also crucial to keep an open mind and broaden your options to colleges you might not have considered or even heard about.
Some college search engines with good filter options (this is where brainstorming comes in handy!) are:
bigfuture by The College Board
ACT College Search
College Prowler
5. Narrow down your list through preliminary research
You should have compiled a substantial list of names now. Do some preliminary online research on each (online college profiles as well as the colleges’ official admission websites are useful places to start), and eliminate all the ones you feel confident do not match you, until you have a handful more that you eventually want to end up applying to.
6. Finalize your list through research, research, and (more) research
It is now time to give each college an in-depth look. Visiting is always a good idea, but if you can’t, learn as much about these colleges as you can—ask past and current students, request brochures, trawl their websites, take virtual tours, visit the pages of the departments and extracurricular activities you are particularly interested in, etc. It might even be helpful to create a college comparison spreadsheet (it might be nerdy, but it works!). No matter what, as your list narrows down, your research on each college should get more rigorous. Again, your brainstorm might be helpful here.
7. Keep your list balanced
It is important to both dream big and be practical with your list. Generally speaking, you have at least two “reach” colleges, two “likely” colleges, and two “safety” schools (one an admission safety, and one a financial safety), for a total of six colleges. However, each person is different—ultimately, the length and exact composition of your list is up to you.
While creating your list, keep in mind the cost of sending each your scores and applications—but don’t let this limit you! If applying to all the schools on your list would be a financial burden, ask your school and do research on how to receive fee waivers.
In the end, your list should have two qualities:
First, it should be short enough that you will be able to put effort into each application without too much stress, but it should be long enough that you can reasonably expect several good options come April.
Second, you should be happy going to any of your colleges. It’s fine to have a dream school, but if you can’t honestly picture yourself at a college on your list  (whether it be a safety, likely, or reach school), it has no place on your list.
And most importantly, don’t freak out! Remember: creating your college list might be challenging at times, but in the end, it should be exciting.
