After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Obama agreed to a meeting that set presses running around the world. His controversial decision to speak with the Dalai Lama generated anger and threats from China. However, despite this vehement response, Obama’s choice to stick by his word and meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader was an admirable one. We agree with the president that the United States should not acquiesce to China’s demands.
On his trip last year, Obama announced to China that he would meet with the Dalai Lama. He then declined to meet in October due to the Chinese government’s anger. These past four months, however, did not signal an attitude change on the part of the Chinese government. The country’s resistance to climate change negotiations and refusal to float its currency remain large concerns for the United States. Since ignoring the Dalai Lama has not been effective in establishing a more bilateral relationship with the Chinese government, it is no longer in the United States’ interest to avoid dialogue with Tibet in hopes of pleasing China.
We recognize the economic security that the Chinese government has provided the United States during this recession and understand that China remains our largest creditor. Thus, Obama must be mindful of how his meeting will be portrayed by the media; it would be prudent for him to choose his words carefully.
While China has the potential to act vindictively and refuse to cooperate with the United States in light of the Dalai Lama visit, there is no reason for the meeting to impact the two countries’ economic and environmental conversations. The Chinese government should not conflate these separate issues.
Obama’s recent Nobel Prize, coupled with the Dalai Lama’s moral leadership, should propagate robust ways in which to address the deplorable situation in Tibet. While the presidential visit does not aim to snub China and bring complete autonomy to Tibet, it does have great potential to create a dialogue about human rights violations in the area.  In the past year, Tibet has been a grand beneficiary of infrastructure programs from the Chinese government. While these efforts have helped bring homes to the region, Tibet still suffers numerous human-rights violations, ranging from torture to large numbers of missing people. Obama has a responsibility to bring these issues to the international community, and meeting with the Dalai Lama is the first step in this direction.
For too long, the United States has been yielding to the Chinese government with regards to the issue of ethnic minorities and human rights. Last year, Hillary Clinton even stated that addressing Chinese human rights couldn’t take precedent over other crises. This is simply not an acceptable diplomatic message to send, especially from a nation that prides itself on protecting freedom.  Obama’s meeting with the Dalai Lama is not just a formality; it sends a strong signal that human rights issues will be addressed, even if China demands otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Controlling the puck wasn’t enough. Neither was generating scoring opportunities. The No. 6 Harvard women’s hockey team (15-5-4, 11-5-2 ECAC) just couldn’t get the puck past Yale goaltender Jackee Snikeris in the first period. But a pair of back-to-back Bulldog penalties changed the tone, and Yale (9-13-3, 7-10-1) would never fully recover in the Crimson’s 4-3 victory Saturday afternoon at Bright Hockey Center.
Despite faster skaters and more scoring opportunities, Harvard couldn’t find the back of the net for almost the entire first period, and the Bulldogs generated just enough fast-break opportunities to give the Crimson a scare. Were it not for the strong play of Harvard’s defense and freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy, the game might have taken a different turn.
“Their goaltender did a great job for them, and it took us a little bit of time to figure that out,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.
But Yale’s speed deficit caused it to resort to other means—holding and hooking—and it was these compensation efforts that did it in.
“We were a faster team, and we were able to create some power plays for ourselves by moving our feet,” co-captain Cori Bassett said. “As a result, they had to hold on a little bit, and that’s what got us some power plays.”
Alyssa Clarke was sent to the penalty box at 18:27 for holding. Twenty-two seconds later, she was joined by Jamie Gray, giving the Crimson a 5-on-3 advantage.
Fifty seconds into the second power play, Bassett fired the puck from the perimeter. This time, Snikeris couldn’t stop it, as senior Randi Griffin buried the co-captain’s slapshot with 21 ticks left on the clock.
But even though the period ended, Harvard wasn’t finished capitalizing on that power play. When play resumed in the second with the Crimson up by one goal and one skater, Harvard wasted little time. Freshman Jillian Dempsey scored 39 seconds into the period.
“Everyone was sharing the puck and moving the puck nice and crisp and hitting the open player,” Dempsey said. “I was just there for a rebound and was able to bring it home.”
But power plays came back to haunt Harvard two minutes later, as the Bulldogs were able to convert a man-up situation of their own. Bray Ketchum weaved her way through the four Crimson players left on the ice and beat Bellamy to make the score 2-1.
But, once again, Yale couldn’t stay out of the box, and soon enough Harvard found itself with the advantage.
Junior Leanna Coskren was able to widen the margin back out to two, slicing the puck past Snikeris from the left corner.
And the Crimson just kept coming, using its superior speed to create more shot opportunities as it owned a 16-5 shot advantage in the period. Harvard didn’t need a penalty for its final goal of the night, this one coming from freshman Kaitlin Spurling.
“I think one of the best things about this year is that if it comes down to the end of the game, we can look to anybody and anybody can put the puck in the net,” Bassett said.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the only ones putting the puck in the back of the net in the third period were Bulldogs. Yale had finally figured out how to stay out of the penalty box, and Snikeris was playing like the stalwart she had been in the first period.
And though the Crimson still dominated the puck, its inability to convert came back to haunt it in the final five minutes of regulation, after Stone had pulled Bellamy in favor of junior Kylie Stephens.
Ketchum was able to slam home her second goal of the night off a rebound at 15:41, but the real scare came three minutes later when Harvard co-captain Kathryn Farni was sent to the penalty box.
Five seconds later, it was a one-goal game when Samantha McLean fired a slapshot past Stephens.
“We lacked a little intensity at the end,” Stone said. “Our kids would want to have that back.”
And for the first time all game, momentum had shifted to the Bulldogs. But all the Crimson had to do was keep the puck out of the net for a minute. Though the Bulldogs had the puck in the final seconds, they wouldn’t cross the blue line, and the Crimson escaped with a one-goal victory.
“I guess I wish we’d finished a little stronger than we did,” Stone said. “But you know, it’s okay—a win’s a win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each April, Dean Fitzsimmons announces a freshman class more ethnically varied than any previous one. Ethnic diversity has become a justifiable, if crudely expressed, obsession for Harvard and its peers. A separate, if related, diversity is that of nationality—yet this seems to be a more secondary concern. Less than one in nine Harvard College students comes to us from abroad.
I thought of this disparity while reading the announcement of The Crimson’s 137th guard, along with the hometown of each executive, on Jan. 25th. I was struck by the profound contrast between the extent of these two diversities on The Crimson’s new staff. In ethnic terms, the 137th guard represents quite possibly the most diverse aggregation in the newspaper’s history. The president is Asian-American, the business manager African-American, and virtually every prominent ethnic group at Harvard is represented.
Yet, just as the constitution of The Crimson reflects the growing ethnic diversity of both the Harvard College student body and the United States itself, the newspaper remains a deeply American institution. Only four of the 137th guard’s 95 executives—with apologies to an editor who hails from London, England but was principally educated in Manhattan—went to high schools outside the United States. The troubling conclusion is that The Crimson is less than half as international as the student body as a whole. It would be irresponsible at best for the leadership of The Crimson to not consider both the reasons for this and its implications.
Many student groups at Harvard are American almost by nature. It is easy to see, for instance, why most foreign students choose to join the Harvard International Relations Council over the College Democrats or Republicans. At first glance, The Crimson does not fit neatly into either camp. Its primary beat is the Harvard campus itself, something that surely ought to interest all Harvard students equally. Moreover, the journalistic skills acquired while working on The Crimson are applicable to print media in any country.
If one looks closer, however, it is evident that The Crimson’s content boards all operate from an American standpoint. International affairs are typically considered on the editorial page when they affect Washington’s foreign policy. The activities of the International Relations Council and Woodbridge Society, two of Harvard’s largest student groups, are usually ignored on the news pages, which diligently report events run by the IOP, Dems, and Republicans.
In a kind of vicious cycle, the absence of foreign students from The Crimson’s staff only serves to exacerbate the lack of internationally-focused content from its pages. In a year on the arts board, I am the only South Asian writer of any nationality that I can recall and one of precious few foreigners—surely this goes somewhere to explaining why foreign films and music are rarely featured in the Arts supplement. Similarly, the international affairs content on the editorial page, such as it is, can be ill-informed; take, for instance, the many op-eds written by American students after the Nov. 2008 terror attacks that variously and falsely suggested that Indian Muslims had identical political values to Muslims elsewhere and that there was little evidence for Pakistani involvement in the attacks.
The Crimson should make an effort to change the inherently American focus of its staff. Where foreign students have joined the Crimson, they have often enriched it immensely: “Foreign Intelligence,” Pierpaolo Barbieri ‘09’s reasoned and enlightened column, substantially enhanced the editorial page during its run. Barbieri drew our attention to regions of the world usually ignored by headline news and shied away from superficial, poorly informed analysis of the kind that followed the Mumbai attacks.
In the long run, the top leadership of The Crimson would do well to acknowledge this trend and explore ways to counteract it. Fifty years from now, a third of the student body may well be international—and The Crimson, hopefully, will have become more international with it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Gaza Strip is a windswept sliver of the eastern Mediterranean Coast, bordered by Israel to the north and east and Egypt to the southwest. The territory is 360 km2 with a population of over one and a half million. Half of the population is under age 15 and four-fifths is under age 50. Gaza has the fifth-highest rate of population growth of any territory in the world. Unsurprisingly, it is among the most densely populated places on the planet, with the Strip’s refugee camps reaching 74,000 people per km2  (compared to less than 30,000 per km2  in Manhattan). For years the rate of in and out migration to and from the Strip has been essentially zero. Such a tragically unique area of the world deserves much more intensive study than Gaza has received.
The Strip provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of de-development and military occupation—especially the extended and entrenched occupation that can be seen from Western Sahara to Tibet—on the occupied population.
To fulfill the practice requirement of my Master of Public Health degree, I decided to conduct an epidemiological analysis of spatial and temporal all-cause mortality in the Strip since Aug. 2005, when the Israel Defense Forces redeployed to the periphery of Gaza and Israel’s settlements there were withdrawn.
Unfortunately, the U.S. embassy in Cairo let politics get ahead of academic inquiry. I tried to enter the Gaza Strip to conduct my research in December and January. Egypt’s border with Gaza is normally closed, but Egypt does have a mechanism for allowing foreigners into the Strip: The citizen’s embassy faxes a copy of the person’s passport and their reason for travel to the Director of Palestine Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I asked the director’s office if embassies have sent these requests in the past. “Yes,” they replied, “we get them all the time.” Indeed, the Israeli press reports that 15,000 foreigners entered the Strip via Egypt in 2009.
Despite the existence of this mechanism and its regular employment, the U.S. embassy refused to send a fax to the ministry with only a copy of my passport and a letter from the Harvard School of Public Health explaining my reason for travel to Gaza. “We do not offer that service,” the Chief of American Citizen Services told me. “You don’t help Americans communicate with the Egyptian government?” I asked indignantly after having been in Cairo for two weeks. “Not about traveling to the Gaza Strip,” she replied.
No government should have the power to decide what one can or cannot study. I am not dismissive of the security concerns of the United States and Egypt, and my request was entirely reasonable—I did not ask the embassy for endorsement or special assistance. On the contrary, on Dec. 27, the first full day I was in Cairo, I went to the embassy and told them why I was in Egypt. They brought me a sworn affidavit, which I willingly signed, stating that I understood that the State Department had determined that travel to the Gaza Strip was unsafe. The affidavit explicitly states, “I assume the risk for myself…I also understand that the Embassy cannot provide me with consular services in the Gaza Strip.”
This is entirely reasonable. Having met many of the internationals who are attempting to enter the Strip, I can say that some are thrill seekers who want to “go where the action is,” as one put it to me. The Mezan Center for Human Rights, the respected Palestinian non-governmental organization that I was scheduled to work with, expressed reservations about having me in Gaza for exactly this reason. Hardly anyone doubts that people who are going to Gaza because they saw bombs exploding there should be told that the Marines will not rush in to save them when they get themselves into trouble.
But I am not an overgrown child seeking out a real life action movie. I will walk into Gaza with my eyes open and a deep understanding of the political and military situation there. I have studied the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for nearly ten years, I have edited a peer-reviewed book on the subject, and I have lived and worked in both Israel and the West Bank for extended periods of time.
Indeed, I confess that I dread seeing the human misery of Gaza in person, eating the contaminated and inferior food grown in a wrecked environment, drinking the saline, contaminated, and infected water, and walking through hospitals starved of medicines and surgical equipment. Research in a place like Gaza is inherently risky. But the work of academics like myself is important, both to me personally and to such disparate fields as public health and strategic analysis. I understand that travel to a land under siege and ruled by force is dangerous. But I accepted these risks. Why did the U.S. government block my work?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having already beaten Yale, 3-2, on Jan. 12, the Harvard men’s hockey team had its sights set on a season sweep of the Elis Saturday. With this weekend’s game tied 2-2 in the third period, it looked as if the Crimson (6-13-3, 6-7-3 ECAC) would have a chance to accomplish its goal.
But a third-period surge by No. 8 Yale (14-6-3, 10-4-2) led to three unanswered goals and an eventual 6-3 victory for the Bulldogs at Ingalls Rink in New Haven, Conn.
“I think that in the game overall we had spurts where we played real good hockey, but we didn’t play the full 60 minutes,” sophomore Alex Killorn said. “We also ran into some penalty trouble, which ended up hurting us in the end.”
Yale seized control of the contest in the first period, outpacing the Crimson in shots. The Bulldog attackers peppered junior goaltender Ryan Carroll, who finished the game with 41 saves. The numerous offensive chances created a 17-4 advantage in shots and two-goal lead for Yale by the end of the opening frame.
“I thought we got off to a bad start in the first period,” senior Doug Rogers said. “I think we were surprised by the speed they brought to the game.”
Harvard rebounded in the second period, inching back into the game with a power play goal by junior defenseman Chris Huxley. The scoring play started on the stick of junior Mike Biega, who found his brother, freshman Danny Biega, with a pass. The younger Biega then slid the puck to Huxley at the blue line. The defenseman wound up and launched a slapshot that lasered its way through traffic and past Yale goalie Billy Blase.
Early in the third period, Killorn found the back of the net to even the score at two. The sophomore’s seventh goal of the season came off assists from senior Chad Morin and freshman Louis Leblanc, who leads the squad with 19 points and 10 goals.
“Basically in the second period and the beginning of the third we were playing the hockey we know how to play,” Killorn said. “We were putting it in their zone and working it in their own zone. We were outplaying them. We thought we had a good grasp of the game, [but] we seemed to get away from that in the third period.”
Despite Harvard’s surge, the Bulldogs snatched the momentum and blew open the game with three unanswered goals. Yale’s Brendan Mason gave his team a 3-2 lead, when a shot on the power play deflected off a Crimson defenseman and past Carroll. Tom Dignard’s high slapshot on a two-man advantage then extended the Eli lead. For Yale’s fifth goal, Broc Little put the game out of reach with an individual effort where he beat a Crimson blueliner down the ice and lofted a shot over the shoulder pad of Carroll.
“We battled back and brought it to 2-2,” Rogers said. “They got one there that was a lucky bounce, then we took more penalties, and it messed our flow up, and we couldn’t recover from there.”
With the score 5-2, sophomore blueliner Ryan Grimshaw tallied a goal—his first of the year—but the effort was too little, too late. After coming up short on a 6-on-3 power play, the Crimson conceded an empty-net goal at the end of regulation that sealed the game for the Elis.
Yale benefited from a balanced offensive attack, which featured goals by six different players. Bulldog Sean Backman paced the team with two assists and the final goal. Little also registered a multi-point game with a goal and an assist.
Yale finished with a 47-23 advantage in shots and converted on three power plays. Harvard, on the other hand, could only muster one score off seven Eli penalties.
A prominent trend for the Crimson this season has been its third-period struggles. These problems surfaced again against Yale, as Harvard conceded four goals in the final frame to its ECAC rival. The Crimson has been outscored, 36-20, in the final period this season.
With the win, Yale moves into a tie for first in the ECAC. Harvard now sits in eighth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team (6-13-3, 6-8-3 ECAC) will head to Boston tonight to take on Northeastern (9-15-0, 6-11-0 Hockey East) in the consolation final of the 58th Annual Beanpot Tournament.
In recent years, neither team has been able to wrest the Beanpot crown from Boston University or Boston College, who have split the honors since the 1992-93 season, when the Crimson defeated Boston University, 4-2. The Huskies’ drought goes back even farther to the 1987-88 season.
“I think it’s definitely the pinnacle fan-wise, and the venue is unbelievable,” sophomore forward Alex Killorn said. “I think it’s the best experience all year, unless you get to the Frozen Four or something like that.”
This year will be no different. Harvard hopes to rebound after an embarrassing 6-0 loss to No. 14 Boston College in last week’s semifinal round that also saw the team commit a season-high 17 penalties.
Staying out of the box will be critical for the Crimson should the team hope to overcome a resurgent Huskies team.
Harvard’s play against the Eagles disintegrated as the game wore on. Though BC’s Ben Smith scored early on in the first on a power-play attempt from close range, the Crimson battled back to take offensive control in the final minutes of the period.
Killorn muscled past two Eagles defensemen to inspire an all-out attempt to even the score. It was the closest Harvard would come to finding the back of the net.
After netting two even-strength goals in the second, the Eagles scored three in an unruly third period to pull away from an increasingly disorganized Harvard.
Frustration reached a breaking point when six players were whistled for various penalties within a two-minute period, leaving as many skaters in the penalty box as there were on the ice.
“I think we have to implement some discipline into our game,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “Not taking penalties, as far as I’m concerned, is a discipline thing. I think everyone on the team’s been guilty of it. It’s really a mindset and committing to being disciplined.”
Since last week’s Beanpot opener, the Crimson has split its road games this weekend against Brown and No. 8 Yale. Most noticeably, junior goaltender Kyle Richter—who started against BC—has been pulled in favor of classmate Ryan Carroll.
Carroll had a total of 68 saves this weekend.
“I think Ryan and Kyle have both done really well for us,” Rogers said. “It’s tough for them sometimes because in games where we don’t play well they see a lot of tough shots.”
Despite cruising over the Bears, 5-2, on Friday night at Meehan Auditorium, Harvard still fell victim to the same mistake that cost it the game against the Eagles. The Crimson committed 13 penalties for a total of 48 minutes.
Harvard cleaned up its act against the Bulldogs, committing just five penalties, and came back from two goals down to tie the game by the beginning of the third. But the Crimson couldn’t hold on against Yale, as the Bulldogs scored four goals in the third to skate to a 6-3 win.
“The night before at Brown, we had a few power-play goals, and we felt pretty confident,” Killorn said. “Yale had a better penalty kill then Brown. We didn’t outwork them when we were on the power play to create second-chance opportunities.”
Northeastern marches into tonight’s game after a close 2-1 loss to Boston University last week in the first round of the Beanpot and a commanding 5-1 win over Merrimack.
Against last year’s NCAA champion Terriers, the Huskies battled back to tie the game at 1-1 halfway through the third with a one-timer from senior Kyle Kraemer before BU scored the winning goal with about five minutes left in regulation.
Northeastern then coasted to a 5-1 victory over Merrimack on Friday. The Huskies were led offensively by Kraemer and junior captain Tyler McNeely, who teamed up to provide assists on two goals in the first. McNeely also netted a goal for himself later in the game.
“We haven’t played Northeastern,” Killorn said. “We know through video and reputation that they are a pretty hardworking physical team. They are going to be coming out playing real hard.”
Limiting the Kraemer-McNeely duo and staying out of the penalty box will be the keys to a Crimson victory tonight. The puck drops at 5 p.m. at TD Garden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Smack in the middle of a grueling 16-day, eight-game stretch of hockey, it’s hard to blame the Harvard women for being a little tired.
Though the No. 6 Crimson (14-5-4, 10-5-2 ECAC) looked far from its best on Friday night, it still played well enough to hand visiting Brown (2-17-4, 0-14-3) a 4-1 loss at Bright Hockey Center.
“It wasn’t pretty,” junior Kate Buesser said. “It’s a win, but I definitely don’t think we should feel real great about it.”
Freshman Kaitlin Spurling’s goal with 1:22 to play in the second proved to be the game-winner and turned the momentum in Harvard’s favor for the balance of the contest.
Less than two minutes after the Bears’ Victoria Smith had tallied her first collegiate goal to tie the game at one, Spurling took a pass from co-captain Kathryn Farni and skated up the right boards.
Pulling up in front of the net, Spurling made a nice move on Brown goaltender Katie Jamieson and went top-shelf for the 2-1 lead.
“It was a great effort—an outside drive that we’ve been talking to the kids about, and she did a nice job of picking the corner,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “It was good, sort of gave us some energy.”
The tally sent Harvard into the locker room on a high note, and the team came out to play a tighter third period and put the game out of reach.
“Goals just fire up the team, and I think that’s exactly what happened this time,” Buesser said. “We just got...I wouldn’t say rolling, but we did start to put a few more pucks away after that.”
Buesser got in on the action just over two minutes into the final frame. Picking up an outlet pass from co-captain Cori Bassett, the junior took a shot from high in the offensive zone.
The puck ricocheted off of Jamieson’s pads and flew high in the air, confounding the Bears’ defense. When it fell back to the ice, some lucky bounces put it across the goal line.
“I think it hit one of their players and the goaltender, and it just bounced in,” Buesser explained. “It’s kind of a fluky goal, but again, a goal’s a goal, so it was nice to actually have it.”
Playing with the two-goal lead, Bassett and Farni drew a pair of back-to-back penalties midway through the third—giving Brown a chance to get back in the game.
“It was disappointing that we got two penalties right there, which I thought were tired, sort of frustrated penalties,” Stone said. “I thought we deserved them both.”
But through 54 seconds of 5-on-3 play, Harvard’s junior trio of Ashley Wheeler, Leanna Coskren, and Buesser stood strong, backed up by a few nice saves from rookie netminder Laura Bellamy.
The Crimson was never really tested again after that penalty kill, and the squad added an insurance tally with 30 seconds to play.
After the Bears’ Samantha Stortini was whistled for high sticking with just over a minute left, Harvard set up on its power play.
Coskren sent in a pass from the blue line, and senior Randi Griffin reached out to tip it just inside the left post to make the final score 4-1.
But though the Crimson’s offense began to click in the third period, the first half of the game was remarkable more for Harvard’s lack of chances.
The Crimson mustered only nine shots on goal in the first period against a Brown squad that typically allows over three goals per game.
“I think it’s partly Brown—their goaltender did a good job,” Stone said. “We did nothing to take their goalie’s eyes away. Our puck support was not good, we were too far away from everybody. We were just not on our toes today.”
Harvard did get on the scoreboard with a minute to play in the opening frame, when freshman Josephine Pucci grabbed a pass from classmate Jillian Dempsey in the left circle and buried the puck with a high shot.
“The freshmen are really stepping up right now, and that’s exactly what we need them to do,” said Buesser, who was credited with the secondary assist on the play.
While Pucci, Dempsey, and Spurling provided offense, their classmate Bellamy recorded 22 saves to earn her fourth-straight win.
Bellamy currently stands third in the country with a 1.22 goals-against average and has not allowed more than a goal in a game during the unbeaten streak.
But even though the game will ultimately go down as a win for Bellamy and her teammates, the Crimson is not content to settle for its inconsistent performance.
“We’ve seen ourselves play a lot better, and I think it’s disappointing to come out like that,” Buesser said. “A win’s a win, but we’d rather a little different effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it took much longer than expected, the Harvard men’s hockey team finally figured out a way to build a Bear trap.
After Brown, a 12-seed, shocked the fifth-seeded Crimson with a series sweep at Bright Hockey Center in the 2009 ECAC playoffs–and then followed that up with a 4-1 defeat of Harvard on Dec. 1–the Crimson finally got some redemption.
Senior forward Doug Rogers scored two goals and added an assist for Harvard (6-13-3, 6-7-3 ECAC), who took down the Bears (7-13-3, 5-8-3) on Friday night by a score of 5-2 at Meehan Auditorium in Providence, R.I.
Captain Alex Biega, junior forward Sam Bozoian, and freshman forward Louis Leblanc also added goals for the Crimson, whose five goals tied a season high and was the most since an Oct. 30 win over Dartmouth.
After junior goalie Kyle Richter struggled in a 6-0 loss to Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot Tournament last Monday, junior Ryan Carroll was back in net for the ECAC matchup.
Carroll was solid in goal, saving 27 of 29 Brown shots.
Until Saturday’s loss to Yale, the goaltender had allowed two goals or less in six consecutive games.
Harvard—which has often struggled after taking an early lead this season—was able to get on the board first at 9:04 in the opening period in a 4-on-4 situation.
The tally came when Rogers collected a rebound off an errant Biega shot. He then backhanded the puck off the skate of Brown goalie Mike Clemente and into the net.
Two minutes later, Biega again fired a slapshot from the left point. This time, it wasn’t wide, as it blew through a crowd and by Clemente. It was the captain’s second goal of the season.
But the Bears were able to strike right back at 14:31, when Jeff Bunivow scored off a one-timer from the left faceoff circle after a nice pass from teammate Jesse Fratkin.
As the first period wound down, Brown had a chance to tie the game on the power play, including an 80-second two-man advantage, but Carroll was able to make two saves off shots from Fratkin and Aaron Volpatti.
Missed chances by the Bears on power plays was a recurring theme throughout the night.
“We kind of committed to getting shots on net and limiting our turnovers,” Rogers said. “We were lucky [to win] with a lot of penalties. Had Brown converted on some of their power plays, it might’ve been a much different game.”
The Crimson was able to get off to a quick start in the second period, when Bozoian tipped a shot from senior Chad Morin from the middle of the blue line into the net at 2:33.
It was Bozoian’s first goal of the season, and he later picked up his first assist of the year on Leblanc’s shot.
But the Bears did not go quietly, as they were able to once again make it a one-goal game at 3-2 when Francis Drolet scored on a wraparound with five minutes to go in the second.
The rest of the period was scoreless, but the Bears opened the third on a power play after freshman defenseman Danny Biega was given a game misconduct after a hitting-from-behind call. The Crimson finished the game with 11 penalties.
“I think if we want to win games at the end of the season, especially when playoffs come, we’re definitely going to have to cut down on penalties,” Rogers said. “We have to play smarter. I think we make some poor decisions in certain situations, especially penalties in the offensive zone.”
But Brown quickly picked up two penalties of its own, giving it six for a total of 23 penalty minutes in the third period alone.
Leblanc took advantage at 3:30, when Bears backup goalie Volpatti couldn’t get on top of a rebound, leaving the freshman with a partially-open net.
It was Leblanc’s 10th goal of the season, which leads the team, and his sixth in seven games.
Carroll continued his strong play in net throughout the third period, and the Crimson was able to put the game away with a five-minute power play for the final 3:45 of the game.
“It was one of the weirder games I’ve ever played in,” sophomore Alex Killorn said. “There were three five-minute penalties. It seemed we were always on the power play or penalty kill.”
Rogers added his second goal of the evening on an empty net with 17.5 seconds remaining.
For Harvard, the focus is now on consistency. After going four games without a loss, the Crimson lost the two games previous to Friday night’s contest.
“We just have to stick to our game plan, to just trust each other, trust the system to execute,” Rogers said. “I think we get into trouble when we play a lot of one-on-one. If we play as a team, move the puck, and come out with 100 percent effort, we have the ability to win a lot of games. That’s easier said than done but if we can do that we’ll do very well here down the stretch.”

To some athletes, the annual Beanpot signifies feats of skating and shooting. To others, like these four burrito-loving Harvard students, it means chewing and devouring—fast.
In Qdoba’s annual Rice and Bean Pot Burrito Eating Contest, Ryan K. Burke ’10, Daniele M. Pellegrini ’11, Tyler D. Sipprelle ’10, and Christian D. Wood ’11 took top honors at yesterday's Harvard-only competition. The team, which completed the relay-style burrito eating competition in just 3 minutes and 30 seconds, will go on to compete against the winning teams from Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern University on Wednesday, Feb. 10.
The team beat out 11 other competitors at Harvard by consuming one burrito apiece at lightning speed—an average of 52 seconds per person.
"I think we’re the favorite coming into the finals," said Sipprelle of his team, which had the best qualifying time out of the four schools' championship teams. "We’re gonna go out there and win."
Sipprelle told us that he and Burke, who each had entered the competition in the past, determined earlier this year that they would compete for the top prize, a week-long trip to Mexico. They took about half a dozen hopefuls to Qdoba and held tryouts, selecting Pellegrini and Wood to complete their "all-star team."
After selecting their teammates, they practiced. "We all did a burrito the day before and brainstormed a little bit on what made for good form: pretty small bites, chew as little as possible," said Sipprelle, a former Crimson sports editor.
The most difficult aspect of the event? "The competition burritos are a little tough to eat. They’re kind of dry and dense. You really have to work your way through it," said Sipprelle, a self-professed burrito lover who says Qdoba’s are the best in the Square.
It’s a good thing that these students enjoy the Qdoba creations—they’re going to be eating a lot of them over the next few days.
"The Harvard Qdoba manager is very much on our side," Sipprelle said. "He said we can come in much as we want in the next three days and eat free burritos to practice."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two days after the earthquake in Haiti last month, the Red Cross had received $5 million in text message donations. After a week, total mobile donations ballooned to $30 million. Haiti relief efforts may not have generated as much aid money as other recent natural disasters, but the devastating earthquake marks a watershed moment in electronic aid.
Electronic donations have been increasing steadily over the past decade. While old-fashioned donations have declined recently due to the recession, online giving actually grew in 2009. One online charity portal, Network for Good, reported that the number of donations nearly doubled last year, and the dollar value of donations increased by 42 percent. However, trends in online giving, including cutting-edge methods like text-message donations, vary markedly from traditional non-profit donations, and their growing importance will have a significant effect on the quantity and character of charity worldwide, and not necessarily a positive one.
A 2006 study by Network for Good found that the dynamics of online donations particularly benefit disaster victims. People instinctively want to help when they see news coverage of a humanitarian disaster, and the ease of online giving leads to impulse donations. Clicking a mouse or sending a text certainly isn’t as onerous as writing and mailing a check, and it allows donors to act immediately, while their emotional response to the news is still fresh.
In addition to a rise in number of donations, online gifts tend to be larger, which reflects the nature of the technology. A study by Blackbaud found that online donors tend to be younger people with higher income, a group that matches the demographic of internet-savvy people in general. While offline giving still makes up the lions’ share of charitable donations, online giving will likely grow to surpass it, which means that the amount donated each year will also keep growing.
Increasing the quantity of individual donations through technological means is unquestionably a positive good. Even the most cynical scrooge would admit that domestic charities make our cities more livable and that foreign aid boosts our country’s reputation abroad. However, the shift to online forms of charity will lead not only to more aid dollars but also to fundamental changes to how the aid is administered.
For instance, online donors may be less particular about their choice of charity. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because niche or religious charities can sometimes impose irrelevant political or cultural values on foreign aid, such as religious organizations restricting condoms in regions devastated by AIDS. Yet the reality is that web legitimacy is easy to fake, and certain charities that accept online donations may simply be frauds. The FBI warned donors last month to ignore unsolicited emails, avoid sending personal information via e-mail, and be wary of people claiming to be surviving victims, which is a testament to the scope of the problem. In fact, the perception of fraud has likely discouraged many donors from giving. Beyond outright fraud, some charities may be simply ignorant about the region they purport to be helping. Many misguided donors sent warm scarves and other winter clothing to victims of the 2004 tsunami, despite the fact that nearly all who were affected lived in the tropics.
Online giving is also problematic in that it tracks very closely with news coverage. An initial flurry of donations follows the initial reports of a disaster, as donors click on links embedded in news stories. But as the stories move off the front page, online donations dry up, even though aid is often still needed. Add to that the issue of some mobile donations not reaching the aid organization for months, and growing electronic donations may cause further distortion to the temporal pattern of relief aid.
Further, the spread of online giving runs the risk of devaluing charity by making it routine or even trivial. If future generations come to believe that charitable donation merely means typing “HAITI” on a Blackberry keyboard as a knee-jerk response to sappy news coverage, it may become harder for aid organizations to recruit dedicated employees and volunteers who are willing to devote their life to a cause.
Finally, if online giving grows at the expense of offline donations, causes that don’t get much news coverage, like ending homelessness or stopping deforestation, may begin to lose funding as public attention shifts to the issue of the week. Some research shows that online donors tend to spend less when they later send an offline donation, although it is unclear how this will affect the overall distribution of charity dollars in the long run.
If nothing else, the fact that online donations track so closely with media coverage means that the newspapers and broadcasters may soon have even more control over which relief efforts receive aid dollars. This puts an even greater burden of responsibility on media outlets to cover the regions that need the most help.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton’s defense—holding its opponents to a national-best 54 points per game—had a singular objective in mind Friday night.
Wary of the threat presented by co-captain guard Jeremy Lin and his fearless forays to the hoop, the Tigers clogged the middle of the lane and dared Harvard to make open shots.
“They packed it in a lot,” rookie forward Kyle Casey said. “Every time Jeremy drove, they were triple- and double-teaming him.”
The Crimson was not up to the challenge, particularly in the first half. The hosts shot a middling 7-of-27 from the floor in the opening 20 minutes, allowing Princeton to pull away to a 29-20 lead at intermission.
“We didn’t really have a good rhythm,” Casey said. “For some reason tonight we were a little stagnant and taking shots we weren’t used to taking.”
The majority of the squad’s troubles took place behind the arc, where Harvard missed all but three of its 15 attempts. Most crippling was a string of seven straight long-range misses over a span of six minutes late in the first half, a drought coinciding with a 13-0 run by the Tigers.
Of the seven Harvard players to attempt a three in the first half, only shots by Lin and sophomore guard Oliver McNally found the bottom of the net.
BIG HOLES TO FILL
The shooting woes were exacerbated by the fact that three of the Crimson’s top four frontcourt players were in the worst place possible—on the bench and out of uniform.
Starting big man Keith Wright missed his first game of the season with a case of Achilles tendonitis, which first flared up in the team’s league opener against Dartmouth. Wright said before the game that he is scheduled to see a doctor on Wednesday.
Fellow sophomore Andrew Van Nest was sidelined with a case of pneumonia that had kept him at University Health Services for three days and left him unable to practice throughout the week. He expressed hopes that he would be able to return to action today.
Those injuries, plus the loss of senior forward Pat Magnarelli to a high ankle sprain suffered at Dartmouth, meant that the Crimson was forced to rely on a rotation of only three front-court players.
After providing valuable minutes off the bench all year, Casey received his first start of the year and experienced a rough shooting night, going 3-of-9 from the field, including three missed three-pointers.
Classmate Jeff Georgatos—averaging just over four minutes per game coming into the night—was called into action for 13 minutes, but the forward had no points or rebounds.
Co-captain Doug Miller was his usual workman-like self, picking up two early layups in the first three minutes of the game, but went scoreless after that. Miller also collected five rebounds.
The lack of an inside presence limited Harvard’s offensive options, but it wasn’t making any excuses.
“We don’t have the depth that we used to have; we don’t have bigger bodies, and it hurts,” Lin said. “But we have enough guys to win this game.”
SLOW AND STEADY
With their opponent struggling to put the ball in the basket up until the last few minutes, the Tigers had no such troubles.
Predicated on ball movement, the traditional Princeton offense went an efficient 9-of-18 from the floor in the initial 20 minutes.
Coming out of the locker room, the squad’s philosophy grew more conservative. Looking to protect its lead—which reached 14 with 12 minutes to play—Princeton did its best to make the most of every possession, content to hold the ball into the late seconds of the shot clock.
Defensive breakdowns by Harvard eventually left shooters wide open, and they hit on several open looks from behind the arc. The Tigers sank four of the five three-pointers it attempted in the second half.
Once the desperate Crimson turned up the defensive pressure, Princeton began to break down with the ball, committing multiple shot clock violations and missing wide-open looks. But with Harvard forced to foul, Princeton took advantage of strong free throw shooting to put the game away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In need of a win after back-to-back conference losses and forced to overcome a series of injuries to core players, the Crimson had a lot to ask of its young talent on Saturday night. Harvard’s underclassmen guards provided the answer the Crimson needed, and with a sold-out crowd blaring its support from the stands, the crew pushed Harvard to a definitive 80-66 win at Lavietes Pavilion.
Although their efforts were felt most during the final minutes of the game—when three players racked up four consecutive three-point shots to crush hopes of a Penn comeback—a large cast of guards put forth consistent efforts throughout the night to keep the Crimson comfortably ahead of its Ivy opponent. Sophomores Oliver McNally and Max Kenyi, along with freshmen Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster, helped keep the Quaker offense at bay while keeping the momentum—and score—in Harvard’s favor on the other end of the court.
Curry lit it up early for the Crimson, scoring five points in under a minute during Harvard’s 12-2 opening run. Curry’s shooting cooled down in the second, but the freshman looked comfortable running the Crimson offense in his first collegiate start; Curry tied for a game-high six assists and racked up three steals on defense.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker reflected positively on Curry’s play, especially the guard’s defensive stand against Penn’s premier player, Zack Rosen.
“I was very pleased,” Amaker said. “He’s guarding arguably the kid that’s in the running for Conference Player of the Year in Rosen. He’s as good as anybody in our league. That’s an incredible matchup for any player, let alone for a freshman making a start after coming off of two losses.”
Kenyi walked out onto the court as a starter for the first time since he was injured in the fall. After being sidelined due to an MCL injury in November, Kenyi made a clear case for a successful recovery, putting up nine points and leading all Harvard players with seven rebounds.
The sophomore snagged an offensive rebound several minutes into the second half that translated to two points and helped stifle Penn’s rally efforts. At 17:42, freshman Kyle Casey launched a mid-range jumper that kissed the rim and bounced off. Kenyi then slipped into the box, leapt up to make the board, and converted on the ensuing, uncontested layup.
“Job well done by those two kids [Curry and Kenyi] in their assignments,” Amaker said.
BIG TIME PLAYER
With the majority of Harvard’s big men watching from the bench with injuries, co-captain Doug Miller also heeded a call to step up for the Crimson on Saturday night. The forward played a largely offensive role to start the game but was consistent throughout the night on defense as one of Harvard’s few options in the frontcourt.
“Doug’s been our leader all year,” Casey said. “He works day in and day out. I’m not really surprised he stepped up big for us tonight.”
Although Miller contributed a quiet nine points, he made his presence know at in the paint throughout the night and led all players with four offensive rebounds.
Working around a lack of big men, Amaker appreciated his co-captain’s efforts, particularly the 32 minutes Miller spent on the court.
“That’s a lot of minutes for Doug,” Amaker said. “Give all these kids credit for stepping up.”
FOUL PLAY
Free throws made the difference for the Crimson in the first half. Although Harvard led by nine, both Harvard and Penn made an equal number of buckets from the field. The Quakers narrowly edged out the Crimson in shooting percentage.
Penn’s downfall came in the 12 fouls it committed, which translated to 13 points for Harvard on 16 shots from the charity line. Throughout the first half, the Crimson committed only six fouls. This difference represented an important turnaround from the night before, when Princeton racked up 15 points off of free throws in a game decided by one possession.
The tables turned in the second half as Harvard reached the bonus mark with 3:28 to go. Penn’s 87 percent free-throw percentage and 15 points off of fouls alone in the second half chipped away at the Crimson’s lead and nearly allowed the visiting team to mount a successful comeback effort.
“I thought they were tremendous in using the foul line to get back in that ball game,” Amaker said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
 
CORRECTION: February 8, 2010
An earlier version of the Feb. 8 sports article "NOTEBOOK: Young Guns Power Crimson to Victory" stated that sophomore Max Kenyi played "for the first time since the Crimson’s third game of the season." In fact, Kenyi's appearance was the first start since his MCL injury in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off two straight losses for the first time this season, Harvard needed to change its luck.
Crimson coach Tommy Amaker put three new players into the starting lineup, and the move paid big dividends, with all three making contributions as Harvard (15-5, 4-2 Ivy) defeated Penn (3-15, 2-2 Ivy), 80-66, at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night.
“[Coach Amaker] said [that] to get back to where we were and what we do, it starts on defense,” said freshman forward Kyle Casey, who started for the second time this season.
Rookie Brandyn Curry—for the first time in his career—and sophomore Max Kenyi—for the first time since his knee injury in November—joined Casey in the starting lineup along with co-captain regulars Jeremy Lin and Doug Miller. The young trio scored the Crimson’s first 10 points, and Harvard jumped out to a 12-2 lead.
“We came out on fire,” Casey said. “A lot of intensity, a lot of passion. We locked them up early and got out to a good lead.”
Casey, a two-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week, scored 13 points on the night in addition to grabbing six rebounds. Fellow freshman Curry scored nine points, directing the offense while guarding Quaker point guard Zack Rosen.
“I was very pleased with their play,” said Amaker of Casey, Curry, and Kenyi.
“Look at Brandyn Curry’s line,” he said. “Six assists, one turnover, three steals. And he’s guarding arguably the kid that’s…in the running for conference Player of the Year in Rosen.”
Kenyi, coming off a knee injury that sidelined him for twelve games, had his finest game of the season, leading the team with seven rebounds and adding nine points.
But despite the Crimson’s hot start, the Quakers managed to hang in the game. Trailing 37-22, Penn forwards Jack Eggleston and Dan Monckton combined for three free-throws and then, with three minutes remaining in the first half, Monckton hit a three-pointer from the left corner to cut the lead to nine.
Harvard pushed its advantage to double digits again, but a pull-up jumper from Quaker guard Rob Belacore from the left elbow at the buzzer made it 41-32 at halftime.
Up to that point, Penn had done a good job containing Cousy Award finalist Lin, holding him to 0-of-6 shooting and forcing three turnovers. But in the second half, the senior was more assertive.
Six minutes into the period, Lin took the ball from the top of the key and drove hard down the middle of the lane for an uncontested lay-up. A little over two minutes later, the senior knocked down a three-pointer for the right corner, and in the ensuing possession, he drove and dished to Miller for an easy two. The stretch was part of a run that pushed Harvard’s lead to 17 points midway through the half.
Penn answered with an 11-0 run of its own, highlighted by a thunderous dunk in traffic by Eggleston.
“You give them a lot of credit for how hard they played—fighting back, being down by a lot, getting back in,” Amaker said.
The Quakers cut the lead to six points with five minutes remaining, but freshman Christian Webster hit a three from the right wing to give the Crimson some breathing room.
Sophomore guard Oliver McNally followed with two threes in the next two minutes to ice the game. McNally, who came off the bench for the first time this season, went 4-of-5 from deep and finished with 14 points.
“Coach wanted to go with something different, so I just have to fill whatever role he gives me,” McNally said. “I [came off the bench] all last year, so I know how to do it.”
The win came in front of another sellout crowd, the fourth in five games at Lavietes.
“A lot of us had that in high school, coming from good programs,” McNally said. “Last year [the fan support] was kind of there, starting to build, but it’s really shown [this year] that all the students are coming out and really get into it—it means a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One weekend, two Ivy League games, the same score. Playing No. 8 Penn (5-7, 1-5 Ivy) on Saturday, the Harvard men’s squash team easily handed the Quakers a 7-2 loss. Just one day later, the numbers reversed as the Crimson fell to No. 4 Princeton (9-2, 5-1), 7-2.
In the team’s final weekend at Harvard’s Barnaby Courts, the Crimson (5-3, 4-1 Ivy) lost its undefeated conference status and chance at a sole Ivy League title, but gained much-needed experience before entering into the championship part of the season.
“[This weekend] gives us a lot of courage to get ready for Yale [next week] and have a stab at sharing the Ivy title,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said.
PRINCETON 7, HARVARD 2
The second of Harvard’s weekend matchups was less forgiving for the Crimson, as only co-captain Colin West and junior Richard Hill in the No. 1 and No. 2 positions secured victories.
“Today’s match was a match that was always going to be tough,” Bajwa said.
Hill started the day on the right path, coming back with three quick victories in a row after losing his first game, 11-8, against the Tigers’ Christopher Callis. With Callis hitting too low in the final game, Hill picked up an 11-5 win.
Playing on the same court, West took the first two games, 11-7 and 12-10, before falling 11-5 in the third. After going back-and-forth in the fourth game, West left Princeton’s Todd Harrity sprawled on the floor after attempting to reach the co-captain’s final shot.
“Colin [played] a top-four player in college, maybe three,” Bajwa said. “He hasn’t had matches like that, so in some ways it looked critical, but on the other hand, it was a good thing him getting these tougher matches...Getting this match and having to push a lot more than 3-1, 3-0 is in some ways a blessing in disguise for him to be ready for Yale’s match and leading the team.”
The closest match of the day, though, wasn’t West or Hill, but rather that of No. 9 freshman Alexander Ma, who came back from a two-game deficit against the Tigers’ Nikhil Seth. Winning the third and fourth games, 11-8 and 11-9, Ma seemed poised to take the whole match before Seth came back with three final hard shots to win the last game for Princeton, 11-9.
“Very close matches, but you know [Princeton] is deep, much deeper than [us],” Bajwa said. “Today they had their No. 2 missing and yet they can bring up players of such strength. But our guys had some very good, rewarding matches.”
HARVARD 7, PENN 2
Hill and West had similar success in the beginning of the weekend, defeating Penn’s Danny Greenberg and Mark Froot respectively. This time, though, Harvard’s top two players were not the only ones with success.
Junior J. Reed Endresen was among four other Crimson players to win 3-1, after he bested his opponent Trevor McGuinness, 7-11, 11-5, 11-7, 11-7, in what many considered the most entertaining match of the day.
“The team did really well,” co-captain Frank Cohen said. “I think that people came up when they needed to for the most part, and we played well on the whole.”
Harvard’s freshman Jason Michas and junior Eliot Buchanan in the No. 5 and No. 6 positions, respectively, secured 3-1 wins, as did Endresen, Ma, and senior Alex Lavoie at No. 10.
Sophomore William Ahmed, playing at No. 8, also tallied a victory for Harvard, defeating Brooks Russell, 3-0.
“Every match where it could have been a tough match, [Dartmouth, Cornell, Penn] they have made it look easy,” Bajwa said. “And they have gotten better at it.”
For Lavoie, as well as West and Cohen, the matchup against Penn marked the last home win in their college careers.
“It definitely hasn’t hit us yet,” Cohen said. “It was nice to be recognized for the work we put in over the four years...That was nice, but it doesn’t feel like it’s over yet because we still have a lot to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors from across Harvard’s graduate schools and members of the private sector gathered at the Harvard University Center for the Environment last Friday to discuss issues surrounding water access and subsequent challenges for sustainable urban development.
Presenters talked about water usage reduction and the burgeoning problem of water scarcity, as well as the effect of climate change on growing sea levels and how to protect cities from potential flooding.
The roundtable meeting was held by the Working Group for Sustainable Cities, founded in 2008 by Martha Schwartz, a professor in practice of landscape architecture at the Graduate School of Design.
The Group’s mission is to synthesize various areas of expertise to create dialogue surrounding sustainable development of cities both environmentally and economically.
“It is clear that water is the central natural resource that is going to have the greatest global impact in the next century,” Schwartz said.
Recognizing the need for a theoretical approach, the group spent the first part of the meeting discussing technologies that gather evidence of climate change and how to effectively interpret evidence collected.
The group also considered strategies for better management of water resources and the ethical issues surrounding the decision to rebuild cities in zones prone to flooding.
Other issues brought up at the meeting included how to effect policy change with regards to efficient water management and climate change when existing policies are in conflict.
“We need to create infrastructure that will cross all sorts of jurisdictional boundaries,” Schwartz said.
Professor of Environmental Health and Human Habitation John D. “Jack” Spengler said that the wide variety of perspectives presented at the meeting was important.
“You come away with a new insight to different problems,” he said. “For practitioners there is a lot of cross value where they learn from different projects and how they have approached them.”
Spengler added that combining the knowledge of academics from different disciplines allows the Working Group to find solutions to problems that are fundamentally interdisciplinary in nature.
“[We need] to create interfaces across disciplines, break down silos, bring different interdisciplinary schools into this,” Spengler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A second straight weekend of back-to-back ranked opponents? No problem.
The Harvard women’s squash team (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) had a full weekend slate at the Barnaby Courts, but the top-ranked squad emerged as the only undefeated team in the Ivy League. The team hosted No. 3 Penn (11-2, 5-1) and No. 4 Princeton (6-3, 4-2) over the weekend, a two-day span that was significant on many levels.
After beating the Quakers, 8-1, and the Tigers, 6-3, the Crimson is now in position to claim sole possession of the Ivy League title next weekend against Yale and boasts the top-ranked player in the country in freshman Laura Gemmell.
“The Princeton women, today was the first time that they have played with full strength,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “So our result speaks volumes about how well our team is doing. We are still working towards our full strength and we played the strongest Princeton team that anybody has played all season. The women will go to win the Ivy League title outright.”
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 3
Coming into the matchup with the Tigers, the Crimson knew that it was going to be anything but easy. It was the first time all season that Harvard didn’t win by at least seven matches, but the encounter had sentimental value as well.
“[Sunday] is a big match for me because we lost to Princeton last year,” sophomore Nirasha Guruge said, referring to last year’s championship loss. “Harvard has just been losing to Princeton over the past years and it’s a big game for everyone who was there last year. It’s our chance to get back at them for beating us.”
Guruge held up her end of the bargain, keeping her opponent at bay to win, 11-4, 11-9, 11-8. Freshman Natasha Kingshott continued her solid play this season with a 3-1 victory over the Tigers’ Neha Kumar. Co-captain Johanna Snyder won her match at the No. 7 spot, but her counterpart didn’t have the same luck.
At the No. 6 position, co-captain Katherine O’Donnell couldn’t turn the tide twice, losing the first of two highly-contested games by scores of 12-10. Princeton’s Kaitlin Sennett finished the bout with an 11-8 win. It was a disappointment for O’Donnell on Senior Day, marking the last game at the Barnaby Courts for the two talented captains and classmate Sandra Mumanachit.
The Crimson also suffered losses at the No. 3 and 4 positions. Junior June Tiong tried to fight back in the third game but couldn’t overcome the Tigers’ Jackie Moss, losing her match, 11-6, 11-8, 12-10. Princeton’s Emery Maine also looked sharp as she defeated junior Alisha Mashruwala in a sweep, 11-8, 12-10, 11-7.
HARVARD 8, PENN 1
Against Penn, Guruge took center court as she sought to avoid playing a five-set match for the second Saturday in a row. She faced the Quakers’ Nabilla Ariffin in what started out as a close matchup. Guruge set up a 9-6 lead, but Ariffin did not let up easily.
With the game tied at nine, Guruge kept her cool and smashed home a hit to end the first game, 11-9. The second game was also close, but Guruge still emerged victorious, 11-8. In the end, Ariffin just didn’t have enough in the tank to keep up with a resilient Guruge, as the Penn No. 2 player fell in the final game, 11-1.
While Guruge’s match was taking place, freshman Sarah Mumanachit faced the Quakers’ Christina Matthias in a match that could have gone either way. Mumanachit had to battle her way through the first two games, winning each by a score of 11-9, before taking part in a tough third game.
The two players kept trading shots before Mumanachit built up a 10-7 lead, positioning herself for a comfortable win. But Matthias gained an edge, winning three points in a row to send the game to extra points. More mistakes followed, setting up a 12-12 draw, but Mumanachit gathered her energy to finally close out the game, 14-12.
No. 1 Gemmell solidified her status as the top player in the country after defeating last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year Kristen Lange in three games, 11-3, 11-9, 11-7. The hard-hitting Lange fell rather easily in the first game but kept up with Gemmell in the second.
The freshman prodigy showed the crowd what the hype was all about and kept her cool in the third game, closing out the day for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Justin R. Timberlake knew he would be receiving the Pudding Pot, but he didn’t know that Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, and Lance Bass would be on hand to help him bring his sexy back.
Facing an enthusiastic audience in a packed New College Theatre, Timberlake accepted his Man of the Year Award from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Friday night, and in the process, wore a bra with gift boxes affixed at the breasts, danced in a reunion with his former ’N Sync bandmates, and fed Britney Spears pudding.
Entering a dimly lit theater as a band played jazz in the background, Timberlake, wearing a grey J. Lindeberg suit with a matching grey fedora, sat in the center of the fifth row and endured a relentless roast from Pudding producers Stephen L. Rola ’11 and Kelly M. Conley ’11 that touched on almost all aspects of his career.
Rola joked about Timberlake’s beginnings as a cast member on “The Mickey Mouse Show” alongside future fling Spears, which he said “marked the first but not the last time Britney would open for our Man of the Year.”
Rola then listed the titles of some of Timberlake’s songs—“FutureSex/LoveSounds,” “Sexy Ladies,” “SexyBack,” and “Love Sex Magic”—prompting Conley to quip that she was looking forward to a future song from him titled “Sex Sex Sexy Sex Love Sex.”
With a shake of Rola’s hand and a kiss on Conley’s cheek, Timberlake took to the stage, but the humor was not to cease, as Rola misidentified him as a singer in the Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees. Soon enough, though, Rola realized who he was—“the guy who put his ‘d’ in the ‘b.’”
Timberlake’s digital short from “Saturday Night Live” continued to be a running joke in the performance. In an effort to bring Timberlake’s “sexy back,” a Pudding cast member said he would have to do a reprise of the sketch. He said the box would be perfectly sized in hopes of being environmentally friendly. Timberlake was then handed a giftwrapped package about the size of a ring box attached to a belt, which he placed around his waist.
Faux cameos were abound in the roast, with Lady Gaga—whose sexuality Rola said was described by ’N Sync’s song “Bye, Bye, Bye”—making an appearance and Spears—dressed in a puffy, pink plaid skirt and pigtails—singing “One, two, three, those are the bypasses I need.”
Throughout the roast, Timberlake’s countenance ranged from inquietude to imperturbability. In the end, he told the audience he never felt more like a man and that the award was “cooler than any Grammy or Emmy or,” at which point the audience cut him off with applause.
Later in a press conference, Timberlake said that the key to being successful was to “continue to be inspired,” calling 2010 “the decade of the entrepreneur” and asserting that the youth have a strong role in that.
“I think more and more young people are starting to go against the grain, and I think it’s because they’re not afraid to be inspired,” he said.
At the press conference, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker gave Timberlake the award of “Cantabrigian of the Year.”
Timberlake joins a list of celebrities dating back to 1967 who have received the honor of Man of the Year, including Bill Cosby, Clint Eastwood, and last year’s recipient James Franco.
Following the roast, the Pudding debuted their 162nd production, “Commie Dearest.”

CORRECTIONS: February 10, 2010
An original version of the Feb. 8 news article "Hasty Pudding Roasts Timberlake" incorrectly described the clothing worn by the actor playing Britney Spears.
In addition, the article stated that the actor sang "One, two, three, lose the bypasses I need." In fact, the lyrics were "One, two three, those are the bypasses I need."

With the ECAC Championships looming next weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team used Saturday’s match against Boston College as a chance to show the tennis world what the young team can do, cruising to a 6-1 victory.
“Overall we played a solid match and I think we’re going to be ready to go come ECACs,” Crimson coach Traci Green said.
Harvard (3-1) started the afternoon in the Murr Center by sweeping the Eagles (2-4) in the three doubles matches to take the opening point.
Freshman Sophie Chang made quick work of her opponent at No. 5, taking the match 6-1, 6-0 in under an hour.
“I was hitting really deep and exploiting [my opponent’s] weaknesses and maximizing my strengths,” Chang said. “That helped me get off the court quickly.”
The rest of the Crimson took Chang’s example and fed off her performance.
“Sophie has been playing with a lot of focus, a lot of energy, a lot of intensity, and it’s contagious,” Green said. “That’s the part I like about it the most. So if she can continue to do that, she’ll help herself and everyone around her.”
Hideko Tachibana at No. 2 soon followed her fellow freshman’s example. After taking the first set, 6-2, Tachibana quickly fell behind 2-1 in the second set. Not to be outdone, Tachibana stole back the momentum while approaching the net with a cross-court backhand that sliced across the service boxes and well out of reach of her opponent to take the game. She went on to win the next four games to take the match and give Harvard its third point.
“She’s a ball of energy,” Green said. “We’re fortunate to have two elite players on our team, Hideko and Holly [Cao]. Their energy rubs off on everyone else, and as long as we can keep them healthy, I think we’ll be a force to be reckoned with.”
On the top court, sophomore Holly Cao, ranked first in the Northeast Region, won the clinching point for the Crimson. After falling behind 4-2 in the first set, she came back to win it 7-5 and then dominated the following one by a score of 6-1.
“Holly is a special player,” Green said. “Once again she came through for us. She clawed her way back and won the first set and then won the second set pretty easily.”
At No. 6, sophomore Samantha Gridley earned a victory in her first singles appearance of the dual-meet season. Gridley battled through a number of long rallies to down her opponent, 6-1, 6-2.
“I hadn’t played singles this season yet, so I was a little nervous coming out,” Gridley said. “After I lost the first game, I slowed down a little bit and just started playing more consistently and then was able to build up and hit harder and harder and more winners. You just have to be patient, work your cross-courts, hook them off the court, and then wait until the court is open to go down the line.”
Green commended Gridley on the way she persevered through her match.
“Sam is one of those fighter-type players,” Green said. “She will fight for every ball. She’ll be out there as long as she needs to be. That’s the kind of person you need out there.”
Junior captain Samantha Rosekrans, the only Harvard player to take the court against the Eagles in the past, opened her match at No. 4 with four consecutive winning games. Her fortune soon turned for the worse, though, as she dropped the next 12 games to lose in two sets.
Freshman Kristin Norton finished the afternoon for the Crimson in style at No. 3. After taking the first set 6-3, Norton fell behind 5-3 in the second before storming back to take four straight games and the match. The win moves Norton to 3-1 at No. 3 singles this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the student members of an environmental action group who camped out in Boston Common last fall will not face charges, it is likely they may be arrested for future protests, one of which they have already planned for this spring.
Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Gerald Stewart recently offered a one-time deal to drop all criminal charges and issue a $50 fine for each infraction, according to joint Law School and Kennedy School student Craig S. Altemose, the founder of Students for a Just and Stable Future (SJSF), which coordinated the sleep-outs last fall. The Boston police had issued trespassing citations at five different sleep-out protests last fall, where SJSF members pushed for the Massachusetts State Legislature to introduce a bill for 100 percent clean energy by 2020.
But the District Attorney’s office has stressed that the deal to not charge SJSF members will not hold if they break Boston Common’s 11 p.m. curfew again, according to Jeffrey M. Feuer, who is coordinating the pro bono legal support for the group through the National Lawyers Guild.
“If we do it again, the penalties will likely increase, and we are planning on doing it again,” Altemose said.
“We’re recommending that everyone takes the deal,” he explained. “There will be plenty of opportunities later on to get misdemeanors on our records.”
Though the legal and academic repercussions are still unclear for future protests, SJSF representatives said they are committed to continuing the sleep-outs this spring. In their push for the state legislature’s passage of the clean energy bill, SJSF members have planned a final sleep-out in Boston Common the night before Earth Day in April.
Group members said they are worried there may be academic repercussions at Harvard if they are arrested off campus at a climate change protest.
In a recent interview, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison did not eliminate the possibility of Ad Board hearings if SJSF members are arrested.
“We would never go after a student for protesting,” Ellison said. “But if it’s illegal protesting...that’s different.”
He stressed that there is no blanket policy requiring an Ad Board hearing after a student is arrested but added that the College does review off-campus arrests.
Ellison met with an SJSF representative last fall to discuss the College’s policies and encouraged them to keep their protests within legal bounds.
The dropped charges and fines will not lead to any marks on students’ permanent records, so the College will not take action on previous sleep-outs, according to SJSF member John E. Beatty ‘11.
Nonetheless, SJSF member Jonathan M.L. Rosenthal ’13 said he is concerned that an off-campus arrest may lead to an Ad Board hearing and potential suspension.
“I like to think that nonviolent peaceful protest wouldn’t be frowned upon, but nobody knows what the Ad Board is going to do,” Beatty said.
Seventeen Harvard students stood before the Boston Municipal Court this week to answer a summons for trespassing on Boston Common, where they were told that they would not be charged. Overall, 176 SJSF members either are going or have gone to court for one to five citations each, according to Altemose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW) released an open letter to its members and the Harvard community on the afternoon of Friday, Feb. 5, criticizing the University and the Deans for not being specific in their communications about the current budget crisis and for not seeming to have a universal plan to deal with fiscal concerns.
“Official communications from University leaders, issued periodically as the budget crisis unfolded, did not suggest a unified University approach to the financial difficulties,” HUCTW officials wrote in what they said was the first in a series of five open letters to the University community. “The President, Vice-Presidents and Deans wrote in generalities about the need to manage resources prudently while maintaining Harvard’s high standards and ambitious agenda.”
Additionally, HUCTW wrote that the state of the University’s finances might be improving, which, it said, made its members hopeful that the current cuts would not be permanent.
“If the University financial picture continues to improve, we can expect to see an increasingly urgent hope among our staff members that the current situation is not Harvard’s ‘new normal’” HUCTW officials wrote.
The University responded to these claims by issuing a statement which acknowledged the potentially detrimental impact of the budget crisis, but was also optimistic about Harvard’s relationship with HUCTW going forward.
“The University has been working hard to navigate an extraordinarily difficult economic environment since the collapse of the global financial markets more than a year ago,” the statement read. “Still, we are hopeful that the good working relationship that exists between the HUCTW leadership and our Labor Relations team will yield a constructive dialogue and that negotiators will be able to reach an agreement that benefits both the HUCTW and the rest of the Harvard community.”
HUCTW wrote that they are specifically concerned about the effects of diminished staffing, citing the 7 percent decrease in employees in HUCTW jobs, which translates to roughly 340 fewer staff members.
“It’s really being felt very strongly in many parts of the University,” said HUCTW director Bill Jaeger. “It’s a real shock to the system.”
HUCTW officials claimed that they have received complaints from Union members about the increased workload created by layoffs, early-retirement packages, and attrition.
A University official who wished to remain anonymous said that the increase in workload is a burden that all Harvard employees have had to address.
“All business plans developed around the reductions in force considered the impact on workloads,” the University official said. “All faculty, administrators and staff have had to adjust their workloads over the past year.”
The letter also mentioned the union’s “serious concern” regarding the effects of budget cuts on “quality of our work, employee health, productivity, opportunities for learning and professional development, and work-life balance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Television personality Stephen Colbert is distantly related to Elizabeth Alexander, the African-American poet who read at President Barack Obama’s inauguration, Oscar-award winning actress Meryl Streep, and Queen Noor, the queen consort of Jordan.
This is just one of the “astonishing” results of the research done by Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. for his new four-part television series for PBS, “Faces of America.” The series traces the family trees of 12 famous Americans, using both historical documentation and DNA analysis, and is challenging Americans to reexamine their history in a uniquely personal way.
“No matter what the laws were in the daytime, no matter how societies tried to enforce sexual segregation, when the lights came down, everybody was sleeping with everybody,” Gates, a professor and director of the Director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, announced to a charmed audience at “The Colbert Report” on Thursday night where he appeared to promote the series.
While working on the program, Gates learned that television personality and cardiothoracic surgeon Mehmet C. Oz ’82, who is Muslim, and Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, and Tony-award winning director Michael I. Nichols, who is Jewish, have a common ancestor.
“It’s sort of like the biblical story of Abraham,” said Gates, referencing the father of the monotheistic faiths and his two sons—Isaac, the founder of Judaism, and Ishmael, the founder of Islam.
Gates described this discovery as emblematic of the purpose of the project.
“Faces of America is my way of celebrating what for me is the true triumph of American democracy, which is our diversity, our ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity,” Gates said. “And we can now measure that diversity, in a sense, through genealogy and genetics.”
Gates noted that “Faces of America” is not without its bittersweet moments.
In one episode of the series, the journalist Malcolm T. Gladwell, who is of Jamaican descent, learns that his fifth great-grandmother was a free black woman who owned slaves.
“That’s a pretty heavy thing to realize for a black person,” Gates said. “There are painful things and there are joyous things, but that’s what our past is, it’s a combination of tragedy and triumph.”
Gates said that he was inspired to create the show when he received a letter from a woman of Russian descent in response to his series “African American Lives” that focused on tracing the family histories of prominent African-Americans. The woman wrote to him asking if he would do a follow-up, exploring the genealogies of Americans of all races, not just African-Americans.
“At first I thought, this is not my job description,” Gates said.
A few weeks later, however, Gates found himself at a dinner party at the home of Martin Peretz, editor of The New Republic, where he spoke to Yo-Yo Ma ’76—who appears on “Faces of America”—about Ma’s recent trip to China where he visited an ancestral cemetery. The combination of the woman’s letter and Ma’s touching description motivated Gates to move outside his “job description” and engage with the issue of American heritage as a whole.
“Genealogy is just as important in every culture,” Gates said. “Everybody, everywhere cries when you resurrect their ancestors...Ancestry has never been as important to Americans as it is today.”
The first episode of “Faces of America” will premiere on Wednesday night at 9 p.m. on PBS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton Economics Professor and Nobel Laureate Paul R. Krugman compared the Obama administration’s fiscal policies to the government’s policies during the Great Depression in a speech at MIT on Friday, predicting a prolonged recession with high unemployment for years to come.
Krugman faulted the Obama administration for declaring a freeze on non-security discretionary spending and making a second stimulus package politically impossible, drawing parallels to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s decision to reduce government funding in 1937, which resulted in another “severe recession.”
“To the extent that there was fiscal policy, it was halfhearted, it was pulled back,” he said of the government’s policies in the 1930s. “There was the famous mistake of 1937, when FDR was convinced that the recovery was solid and no longer needed all that support from the government.”
Krugman similarly described the Obama administration’s stimulus as “halfhearted,” explaining that the mere existence of a large government and the move to rescue the financial sector each had more of a stabilizing effect on the economy than the stimulus itself.
In a brief interview with The Crimson after his speech, Krugman said that he wishes there were “more heterodox voices” in Obama’s economic team. But he reserved praise for Christina D. Romer, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, saying, “As far as I know, she wanted a bigger stimulus.”
Krugman, who had advocated for a larger stimulus in his columns for the New York Times last spring, said in his speech that politicians did not realize that “doing what you think of as a more careful, cautious policy is actually extremely risky because you really have one shot at this—no more.”
He said that the fading effects of the stimulus—which will reach its peak impact over the summer—and the Obama administration’s impending budget cutbacks add up to “a pretty significant turn towards contractionary policy taking place over the next year or so in the face of a deeply depressed economy.”
Krugman noted that the unemployment rate in the average financial crisis rises for almost five years before starting to decline.
“Policy is acting as if the problem has been just about solved, whereas the reality is that mass unemployment is a likely feature of the economy for quite some time to come,” he explained.
He added that statistical estimates show that students who graduate into a bad job market now will be worse off “even 20 years later.”
In response to a question from the audience, Krugman critiqued President Barack Obama’s recent proposal to break up large banks for not addressing “the essence of the financial crisis.”
While he criticized the government during much of his speech, he also faulted economists for forgetting or misinterpreting the past.
“I’ve used the phrase that we’re living in the dark age of macroeconomics,” Krugman said. “Barbarism was they never knew better. [The] Dark Age is people forgot what the Greeks and Romans knew, and to some extent that’s where we are in economics now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s tough to win a match if you’re not on the mat.
The carousel of injuries that has hampered the Harvard wrestling team all season proved to be the deciding factor again this weekend, as the Crimson fell to Princeton and Penn in a set of Saturday dual meets at the MAC. Even worse for the home team, though, was that the Harvard (2-10-1, 0-2 Ivy) grapplers’ usual spark and resilience seemed to be missing against the Crimson’s Ivy foes.
“We just didn’t wrestle well,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We’ve just got to get out and fight, we’ve got to fight more, that’s all it was. It’s a matter of fighting positions.”
Weiss noted that Crimson grapplers consistently found themselves out of place, making them vulnerable to falls. The ability of the Tigers and Quakers to put up big wins led to lopsided scores—with Princeton winning 35-10 and Penn dominating 41-11.
“I felt like we were a little lackluster today,” co-captain Louis Caputo said. “We just want guys to stay in good position...I think a big weakness is our bottom wrestling. We’re giving up a lot of team points from that, [from] getting pinned.”
PENN 41, HARVARD 11
The fate of the Crimson’s Saturday afternoon match became clear in the first bout against Penn (8-4, 2-0). Freshman Steven Keith (125 lbs.)—one of Harvard’s standout performers so far this year—was overwhelmed in his second contest of the day.
The Quakers’ Mark Rappo sprung from a headlock to earn an early takedown and would not relent. Rappo negated Keith’s tremendous escapability by consistenly corralling the young grappler. Each time Keith got his legs under him, Rappo would keep hold of his opponent’s foot. When Keith finally did break free, the Penn standout earned two more takedowns and a five-second pin, pushing the bout out of reach. Rappo finished with a major decision to put the Quakers on top for good.
“Steven had a tough couple matches,” Weiss said. “But he’s going to be fine. I know he’s going to turn it around and come right back.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the rest of the lineup did not inspire as much confidence.
Rookie Chad Eason (125) again wrestled above his weight class, suffering a fall to Bryan Ortenzio in just 38 seconds. Three other Harvard grapplers faced defeat in the same manner, as Penn demonstrated why four of its nine competitors are ranked in the top 20.
But the Crimson’s ranked grapplers did not seem intimidated. The Quakers refused to trot out a wrestler against co-captain and top-ranked J.P. O’Connor (157), leaving No. 6 Caputo to vent his frustration at the team’s struggles. The Crimson standout, who moved to 15-2 on the day, dominated his bout from start to finish—a stark contrast to the rest of the squad’s performance.
Penn’s Harrison Cook opened the bout aggressively, attacking Caputo’s legs and bringing him to the ground, but it was the Harvard competitor who wound up on top, earning two points with his quick feet. From that point Caputo did not relent. The grappler forced Cook into back-to-back pins to close out the period and easily escaped at the start of the second to push his lead to 9-0. The two wrestlers did not spend much time in neutral position, though, as the Crimson co-captain notched another takedown and transitioned into a pin to extend the advantage to 14. As Cook struggled to escape, Caputo closed out the match with a final pin, logging a 17-0 technical fall to bring his winning streak to nine straight matches.
“I felt good,” Caputo said. “These guys came out ready to bang, but I was feeling a lot better than I was last week. I was pretty happy with my performance.”
PRINCETON 35, HARVARD 10
The co-captains could be satisfied with their morning effort as well, as both extended their hot streaks against the Tigers (6-8, 2-0). The match once again spiraled out of control early, as Princeton notched two falls in the first two matches. Coupled with a forfeit at 141 pounds and a major decision against rookie Paul Ligori in his return from an ankle injury, Harvard found itself down 22-0 before O’Connor took the mat. Undeterred, the co-captain continued his march towards the top of the Crimson’s all-time wins list with a strong showing. No. 1 O’Connor racked up 14 points against the Tigers’ Dan Scotton and proved that he remains difficult to score on, as the co-captain cruised to a 14-0 major decision.
Coupled with his forfeit win later in the day, the effort moved O’Connor to 22-0 on the season and 119-16 for his career.
Caputo also started the day solidly, earning a 6-1 decision against Kurt Brendel, but the most encouraging sign for Harvard came in the heavyweight division. Sophomore Spencer DeSena—competing for the first time this month—posted a dominant 7-0 win to earn the Crimson’s only win from a non-captain on the weekend. If the squad hopes to compete more effectively as a team, it will need such performances from less experienced grapplers as it advances through the Ivy slate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Snowmageddon” was not the only blizzard to hit Pennsylvania this weekend. A flurry of lethal three-pointers struck Philadelphia on Saturday evening, as the visiting Harvard women’s basketball squad (12-7, 3-2 Ivy) took the city by storm.
In a game where the Crimson never trailed and led by as much as 28 points in the second half, it is fair to say that Harvard hardly broke a sweat, winning 66-40 against Penn (1-18, 0-5 Ivy). The Crimson rose above .500 after a dominating performance against the Quakers, and it was thanks to a solid three-point shooting effort that Harvard was able to distance itself from its opponent. The Crimson made 10-of-20 three-pointers, while Penn was not able to hit any in 15 shots from behind the arc.
“We’re a better team, first of all,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “But even teams that are struggling become dangerous, and we have to look out for that. I think we responded well after a disappointing game against Princeton. It was a great defensive effort.”
The game started with both teams trading baskets before the Crimson pulled away to set the tone for the match. Harvard was able to distribute the ball and get everyone involved in a 10-minute stretch that opened up a 19-point gap for the visiting team.
Defense also played a role, with sophomore Brogan Berry stealing the ball twice in the 16th minute and junior Jackie Alemany swiping the ball right after to expose the Quakers’ weak ball handling. After consequent substitutions by both teams, Alemany blocked an attempted shot to keep Penn from gaining any momentum. Five minutes later, the home team still couldn’t come up with a basket, letting the game slip away, 21-2.
The Crimson only hit 39.4 percent of its shots in the first half, demonstrating the crucial role its stifling defense played to keep the Quakers from retaliating. Penn could only hit 29.6 percent on the court.
With 2:01 left in the first half, the Quakers cut down the deficit to nine after Penn was able to retrieve the ball off of Alemany’s second block of the game to score an easy bucket.
Harvard made a couple of substitutions to finish the half strong. A missed jumper by Penn and the 13th defensive rebound of the half led to a quick two-point conversion by junior Emma Markley, making the score 28-17.
“We were struggling with defensive rebounding,” Berry said. “So we made an effort to come out with a defensive mentality, and we were proud to keep them at 17 in the first half.”
Another missed shot led to the Crimson’s final possession with nine seconds left. Alemany dished out the ball to the perimeter, where she found junior co-captain Christine Matera, who made it rain from the perimeter all night long. She finished 5-of-8 on three-point shooting and led the team with 19 points on the night.
“She had a great weekend on both nights,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a junior co-captain, so we expect that from her.”
The second half opened with no surprises. Berry sunk a jumper with an assist from Matera to start up the Harvard offense, but the Quakers’ Jess Knapp responded with a three-point play of her own. Knapp, a starter for the entire season and leading rebounder on the team, took the most shots for Penn but was largely ineffective, only making two of her 11 attempts and finishing the game with five points. The case was different for the Crimson, which improved its shooting percentage to 50 percent, causing further distress to an already weakened opponent.
After Matera hit a three-pointer with 15 minutes to play, freshman Elle Hagadorn also scored a trey of her own to deepen the Quakers’ deficit. Penn was never able to get the margin under 20 points after that point. Berry didn’t help the Quakers’ cause by sinking another three with 14 minutes left in the half.
Harvard easily took the rest of the contest as the Crimson never led by less than 22 points. Alemany made a three-pointer with 2:52 left on the clock to extend the gap to 28, and the squad coasted to its third Ivy win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is no easy feat for a basketball team to beat two opponents by double digits in the course of a week.
But it’s even harder to maintain that dominance and consistency heading into the next game. One week after soundly defeating Columbia and Cornell by 18 and 16 points, respectively, the Harvard women’s basketball team (11-7, 2-2 Ivy) traveled to Princeton, N.J., on Friday night, feeling confident as it took on the Tigers (16-2, 5-0 Ivy).
The momentum from the previous week failed to carry through, though, and the Crimson fell to Princeton, 74-53.
“I don’t know what it was,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We practiced well all week, I felt like we were ready, and we started the game strong.”
What made the difference so stark was actually quite obvious: rebounding.
While the Crimson owned the glass against Columbia, which has the nation’s leading rebounder in Judie Lomax, Harvard was unable to control the boards against Princeton.
The failure to do so—the Crimson was out-rebounded, 55-39—ultimately made the difference between a win and a loss for Harvard.
“The rebounding between last week and this week was a complete 180-degree difference,” junior captain Christine Matera said. “Our biggest problem is our inconsistency with rebounding.”
Delaney-Smith was much more frank in her analysis of the loss.
“If [the players] want to lose games because of rebounding, then that’s up to them,” Delaney-Smith said. “As a coaching staff, we can no longer do any good. Rebounding is an attitude, not a skill, honestly. We’ve done technique work, we’ve done everything we can do. To lose such an important game when one of the large factors was rebounding is extremely disheartening, and the team knows that.”
The problems began piling on for the Crimson early on in the game when junior forward Emma Markley picked up two quick personal fouls.
The calls were questionable, but the damage was already done—Markley found herself on the bench for most of the first half, and Harvard, without a true inside threat, was unable to establish its presence down low.
“Obviously it is a setback with having Emma on the bench both offensively and defensively,” Matera said. “At the same time, we’re confident that whoever comes into the game will step up. Whether it’s Jackie [Alemany] or Claire [Wheeler], we just need someone to come in, step up, and play defense and rebound.”
The Tigers’ fast-paced tempo on offense and its knack for creating turnovers on the defensive end allowed them to take control in the first half, despite being down 10-4 early in the game. As a result, the Crimson, with Markley watching from the bench, began to break down offensively, going scoreless for over seven minutes late in the period.
“We started having breakdowns, and that’s what Princeton’s good at doing,” Delaney-Smith said. “You have to play the full 40 minutes against them. We were right there play-for-play, but then, all of a sudden, a breakdown happens, and we’re down by 10. We can’t recover from them.”
At halftime, Harvard had lost the hot shooting hand it had found just a week ago, making only 29 percent of its field goal attempts. Overall, the Crimson finished shooting just 28.4 percent from the field.
Harvard’s poor shooting did not seem to affect Matera, though, who went 4-for-5 from the field and 9-for-9 at the free throw line. “Miss Consistency” was also perfect from outside the arc in her 19-point performance, making both of her three-point attempts.
“Her consistency is even more admirable, given the fact that she’s also a captain for the team, and she’s worked really hard at being consistent with her leadership,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Matera] was tough, she shot well, and she was smart. She did a good job in the game.”
While Harvard was largely a one-woman show, Princeton had no difficulty distributing the ball among its players. By game’s end, four Tigers were in double digits. Most notable was sophomore guard Lauren Edwards, who finished with 19 points, seven rebounds, and four assists.
“[Princeton’s] definitely well-rounded,” Matera said. “They work hard to get boards. They also take the ball to the basket, and they have depth on the outside. Their point guard is doing everything to set every one of them up.”
The Crimson cut the Tigers’ lead to 10 in the second half after three-pointers from Berry and Matera, but in the end, Princeton’s consistency was simply too much for Harvard to handle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot of skiers have come through Harvard in the last 30 years, but never once in those years did the Crimson women’s alpine ski team place sixth in the giant slalom, as it did this past weekend at the University of Vermont Winter Carnival in Stowe, Vt. The Harvard ski team’s overall ninth place finish was the only disappointment on an otherwise banner day for many Crimson skiers.
“It was a very successful weekend,” said Harvard alpine coach Tim Mitchell. “Our women’s team [had] their best finish ever as far as I know.”
What made Mitchell even more optimistic about the weekend was that his skiers proved so successful without their top athlete in the event, freshman Meg Luck.
“She hurt her elbow before we left,” Mitchell explained.
Instead, the team’s other athletes stepped up to deliver personal-best performances, most notably freshman Catherine Sheils, who finished 18th, and sophomore Caroline McHugh, who finished 22nd.
The women’s success was mirrored by their Nordic counterparts, who had three top-25 finishers in the 5k classic.
“We haven’t done that in 20 years,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “That’s an outstanding result for us.”
Just as in the alpine races, a freshman led the way. This time it was Alena Tofte, a rookie from Duluth, Minn., who placed 18th overall in the classic event despite falling over at one of the turns.
“That probably cost her five or ten seconds,” City said.
And four or five places, given that Tofte’s time was only thirteen seconds slower than 13th-place finisher Elizabeth Guiney of UNH.
Next on the board for the Crimson was senior Audrey Mangan, who finished 20th, followed by another freshman, Esther Kennedy, who placed 24th.
Unfortunately for Harvard, the Nordic team, which finished seventh overall in the classic event, was unable to match its success when it competed yesterday in the 10k free, where it placed 10th as a team without Mangan. But for City, the breakthrough performance on Saturday was enough cause for optimism.
“We’re heading in the right direction,” he said. “We’re at the point where we cut down on training. Everyone’s skiing as fast as they can. Most skiers are heading in that direction.”
The men’s Nordic results were not quite as history-making as the women’s, as the squad finished 11th in the 10k classic and 10th in the 15k free. But like the women, they too showed improvement, with freshman Anthony Ryerson’s 41st place in the 10k classic leading the team over the weekend.
“That’s a solid day for him,” City said.
The men’s alpine team, meanwhile, struggled with the same issue that has plagued it all season—putting together clean races. The group finished 10th in both the giant slalom and the slalom.
“They’re skiing extremely fast,” Mitchell said. “The encouraging part is that instead of the guys having a bunch of mistakes, it’s just a few mistakes. They’re getting much closer to a clean run.”
But the skiers were given one last day to prove themselves against the collegiate field, where Sheils and sophomore Kevin McNamara had their best finishes of the weekend.
Yesterday was an exhibition day as the races don’t officially count for Carnival scores. But the individual placement impacts athletes’ starting position in Carnival Races. Thus, the entire collegiate field stays the extra day to try to secure a strong starting position, which will allow them to ski when the conditions are fastest. The day is also an opportunity for reserves to see competitive action, which makes the field bigger and deeper than it is in the official season races.
And for Sheils, yesterday’s exhibition was an opportunity to make a statement. The freshman had crashed in the official slalom race, but on Sunday she stayed on her skis and finished third overall in the collegiate field.
McNamara also improved greatly over his Carnival performance, earning a combined score of 22nd following a 38th-place finish in the giant slalom and a slalom race in which he did not finish the day before.
“It’s good to do these [extra] races,” Mitchell said. “Both [Sheils] and Kevin see, ‘This is how well I can compete against the field.’ Everyone’s really looking forward to racing at Dartmouth next weekend.”
There we’ll find out if history repeats itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot can happen in three years. In 2008 at the debut of the annual Battle of Beantown Invitational, the Harvard men and women’s track and fields team failed to make a dent in the competition, finishing fourth of four.
Oh, how things have changed.
Last Saturday at Gordon Indoor Track, both the men and women’s squads finished ahead of local rivals Boston College, Boston University and Northeastern, taking home not one but two Beanpot trophies.
“It’s been a great progression for both programs,” said Harvard head coach Jason Saretsky. “Each year they’ve climbed the ranks relative to the other Boston Division I schools, and it was just a fantastic effort for both the men and women to pull off the victory.”
While the men had a relatively easy time on the track, finishing well ahead with 166 points in comparison to Boston University’s second place score of 119, the women’s team faced a tougher challenge.
Going into the final event of the invitational, the 4x400 relay, the Crimson was ahead by a slim two points.
“It was pretty exciting,” Saretsky said. “When the gun went off it seemed pretty clear it was going to be between us and BC. We had a two-point lead, but if they beat us we would lose by two. I was really proud of the girls for the way they competed and how they pulled out that victory to ensure the team win.”
“It was like we were running it ourselves, because we were just so excited,” said women’s co-captain Katrina Drayton, who watched from the sidelines. “I know everyone was ecstatic, just pulling for them, encouraging them all around the track.”
In addition to the 4x400 relay, the women’s track and field teams also took home gold in three other events, all won by freshmen. Olivia Weeks posted an 11.96-meter mark in the triple jump to win the event, while classmate Ashtynn Baltimore captured an NCAA provisional qualifying time in the 60-meter hurdles despite placing second.
“It’s such a big, intense rivalry. Everybody did their part and performed really well,” fellow freshman Carlyle Davis said. “The entire atmosphere, the entire track meet was everyone cheering everybody on, busting out the big moves, it was pretty exciting.”
Davis, who anchored the 4x400 relay squad, had a good day herself, crossing the line in a solid first position in the 500-meter run. Her time of 1:13.60 was not only a meet record, but a potential school record as well, pending verification.
On the men’s side, early wins in the long jump and weight throw led to more and more momentum going into later events.
“The guys just did a great job of feeding off of each other and taking one success and building off of it to the next,” Saretsky said. “Sometimes in sports it just has a way of snowballing like that where things just kept going our way. It ended up being a little bit more of a decisive victory than I expected it to be.”
Freshman Kenneth Wang Kan got the ball rolling with wins in both the long jump and triple jump, earning marks of 6.93 and 14.37 meters, respectively. Classmate Jeremy Gilmour placed first in the 3,000-meter run, while junior Brian Hill and co-captain Justin Grinstead finished 0.57 seconds apart in the 500-meter run to grab first and second place.
The Crimson also boasted a number of IC4A qualifiers, as sophomores John Dingus, Steven Geloneck, and Darcy Wilson all made strides in their respective races.
Co-captain Jack Brady also enjoyed a standout performance, setting a meet record in the weight throw, and the 4x400 men’s relay team matched its female counterpart, as the group secured gold in the final event to officially give the Harvard men their second-consecutive Beantown title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to see where a season is going to go after only four games, but for the Harvard women’s water polo team, this spring looks promising. The Crimson (4-0) began the year undefeated after taking down all four of its opponents at this weekend’s Harvard Invitational at Blodgett Pool.
“The first four games, it’s always interesting to see since you have no idea how it’ll come out,” sophomore goaltender Laurel McCarthy said. “It’s really nice to have these [next] two weeks knowing that we can win together but knowing what we need to work on too.”
Ten different players scored in the two-day event, led by sophomore Devan Kennifer, who tallied 15 goals total. Kennifer’s classmate, McCarthy, made 10 saves the first day to help Harvard fight back from deficits in each of the four games.
The Crimson’s freshman class contributed considerably in its first games as Harvard athletes and looks to take on a stronger role as the team moves further into its season, including a rematch with Iona in two weeks.
“We know what we do well, we know what we need to fix and improve,” Crimson coach Eric Farrar said. “I think [Iona] will be a very different team in two weeks, as will we, so we will see how it goes.”
HARVARD 11, IONA 8
Harvard’s final game of the Invitational was also its hardest, as the Crimson remained stuck at 4-4 going into the half.
“This was a great game because it was a real test of character,” McCarthy said. “It’s the fourth game of the weekend and people are tired and people start to play a little more grabby and get a little more aggressive.”
It wasn’t until the final eight minutes that Harvard turned the heat on, outscoring the Gaels, 5-2, eventually grabbing an 11-8 victory.
“The last one was us not having our best stuff, hitting pipes all over the place, generating a lot of chances but not sticking the ball away,” Farrar said.
Kennifer netted five goals, while the freshman duo of Elise Molnar and Aisha Price tallied two apiece.
“It may not have been as pretty as we wanted it to be but we got it done,” McCarthy said.
HARVARD 10, NYAC 8
Playing earlier in the day against the New York Athletic Club, the Crimson again found itself tied at four going into halftime. This time, though, the tie was a relief for Harvard after being down 4-1 in the first two quarters.
“Our competition was a bit stronger today,” Farrar said. “[They’re] older, experienced, a masters team including one Harvard grad, so that was nice to win that.”
Price and Kennifer both recorded a hat trick while four other players scored as Harvard held on to the win.
HARVARD 15, SIENA 9
The night before, the Crimson was again down against its opponent.
“A little bit of a character test early in the year, [we] got down 4-2 and weren’t playing very good defense here,” Farrar said. “We had to make a couple of adjustments, but the kids did a great job, adjusted, took their punch and then outscored them 12-3 over the next two quarters.”
Freshman Molnar scored five goals in her second collegiate game, while Kennifer netted four and Price scored two.
“Our freshmen played phenomenal,” McCarthy said.
HARVARD 16, VILLANOVA 2
Villanova’s goaltender had no idea where to look in the first matchup of the Harvard Invitational, as 10 different Crimson players scored in a Harvard blowout.
“It was a pretty hard preseason, and I think we were all just excited to play someone beside ourselves,” Molnar said. “We just really came out with a lot of energy.”
Molnar scored one as Kennifer tallied her first hat trick of the year. Co-captain Kristina Bergquist, junior Patricia Smith, sophomore Monica Zdrojewski, and Price each netted two as well.
“We were very effective compressing and getting a fast break in the game,” Farrar said. “Villanova had trouble swimming us.”

Men's Health has released a report ranking America's top 100 drunkest cities. Beating out competitors such as New York City, Los Angeles, D.C., and Chicago, Boston came in at number 100—the least drunk of the list.
We were surprised too.
The rankings were calculated using numbers of deaths caused by alcoholic liver disease, numbers of binge drinkers, DUI arrest rates and penalties, fatal car accidents involving intoxicated drivers, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving report cards.
With 51 colleges and universities in the Boston metropolitan area, you wouldn't think that Boston would be dead last on the list, but several of the factors were based on driving-related statistics. So the calculations may have skewed the data by overlooking the role of Boston's public transportation.
Until someone comes up with a more scientific ranking system, though, let's drink to Boston's A+ grade!

The list of student grievances about dining halls is growing: first it was overcrowding in Adams, now it's late-night vacuuming in Cabot. This latest complaint lit up Cabot's House open list last week when one resident fired off a missive over the deplorable fact that workers vacuum its dining hall at or around midnight, a time when many students are trying to study.
This injustice was brought to light after vacuuming commenced minutes before 11 p.m. But not just that—there were also cups missing from the dining hall!
"It's also 10:53 and they're out of cups to drink with," the student wrote. "No, we can't have someone replenish the cups, but God forbid we go one night without vacuuming."
And thus the debate raged. Might the House library suffice for those studious night owls?
"I think the library is a false solution," another student wrote, adding also that "while we're complaining about the dining hall: there is a serious need for more coffee, or for student-enabled operation of the coffee machine."
Another voice of reason: "How about we all join Harvard's already established, maybe not in use now, Idea Bank, to have our concerns voiced and fleshed out and demand that the UC take it to FAS?"
Just when things could not have gotten any worse, the original whistleblower on Cabot's abusive vacuuming practices added this nugget: "Man, I'm sure glad Harvard's not laying any workers off, because it's not like they're just sitting around looking for things to do, like vacuuming for example."
But this point went a little too far for at least one resident, who responded, "Oh come on.  Don't take it out on the workers.  They're working hard, and (in this case) during late hours, too."
Anyway, the debate seems to have been settled by Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris, who has arranged to move the vacuuming schedule to 3 a.m.
"...Mike has arranged for the vacuuming in the DH to take place at 3am and not before," Harris wrote in an e-mail to Cabot. "I'm sure there is someone who will not be happy with that, but we very much hope that holding off on the noise until 3 will serve most of you."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update 11:26 a.m.
Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter '61 will deliver the keynote address at this year's Commencement on May 27, the University announced this morning.
Souter, a Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law School graduate, stepped down from the high court in June after nearly two decades of service.
University President Drew G. Faust praised the former Lowell House resident's independence on the court in a statement.
“The dedication, humility, and commitment to learning with which he has pursued his calling should be an inspiration to any young man or woman contemplating a career in public service,” Faust said.
Appointed in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, Souter came to be regarded as a moderate liberal during his 19-year tenure on the bench. By the middle of his term, Souter frequently voted with liberals on issues including the death penalty, worker rights, and limiting abortion restrictions.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Souter served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court and as an Associate Attorney General in the state. He was briefly on the U.S. Court of Appeals before being appointed by Bush.
Souter—who was replaced on the court by Sonia M. Sotomayor—said during this year's annual Constitution Day event that he planned to undertake a variety of part-time jobs, such as returning to the First Circuit in Boston, where he spent just one day hearing cases before starting his tenure at the Supreme Court.

CORRECTION: February 25, 2010
Due to an editing error, an original version of the Feb. 9 news article "David H. Souter To Headline Harvard's 2010 Commencement" stated that former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 retired to his family farmhouse in Weare, N.H. after stepping down from the high court in June. In fact, though Souter was known to frequently return to Weare during his tenure on the court, upon retirement he bought a house in nearby Hopkinton, where he now lives, according to the New York Times.

If, after two weeks back on campus, you’re starting to get sick of dining hall food once again, tonight might be a great night to treat yourself to a meal in the Square—and help fund a Harvard-based charitable endeavor, too.
Uno Chicago Grill in Harvard Square will donate up to 20 percent of the cost of your meal to Harvard Habitat for Humanity if you bring this flier to the restaurant tonight. The proceeds will help 12 Harvard students and two resident tutors travel to El Salvador to construct a house for a needy family over spring break.
The students, who have been planning their philanthropic voyage since October, need to raise about $11,500 to finance the trip, according to Harvard Habitat for Humanity Co-Director Dan A. Driscoll '11. The group is also planning several other fundraisers to collect the necessary sum.
Driscoll said he hopes that at least 200 people will come to Uno’s for the event tonight, which would garner $400 for Habitat if each person buys a $10 entrée. He pointed out that any drinks purchased during tonight’s karaoke time at Uno’s will also generate funds for Habitat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Signing up for the halftime free throw shooting contest at Friday night’s men’s basketball game against Princeton seemed like the perfect idea. I was gung ho, and it’s not like I was going to get chosen anyway, so I would be spared the humiliation of actually having to shoot free throws before a crowd. Besides, I couldn’t back away from a challenge. But as it so happened, I was one of the two contestants chosen and was told to come down to the court with two minutes to go in the first half.
A lot of people are bad at free throws. I wouldn’t exactly be the first person to miss her shots in the halftime contest. Except I didn’t have any excuse—I played basketball in high school. Actually, I’d played basketball since first grade. But I’d never been good at foul shots. It wasn’t my form—my technique was solid, the product of lots of extra practice. But I always got too nervous to actually calm down and make a shot.
I wish I could say that Friday was my magic night, and I started shooting lights out, but the opposite happened. I couldn’t catch a break—my shots went straight at the basket, but I didn’t put enough power on some of them, and I neglected backspin. The only shot that managed to go through the basket was the one at the final buzzer, when I realized three things: I couldn’t win; I still had no skills from the line; and, basically, I had just completely humiliated myself.
And so I started retreating back into the crowd, completely embarrassed, looking to be enveloped by the “White Out.” But it turned out I wasn’t done—there was still one more task. Grudgingly I walked to the center of the court, thinking, ‘Oh okay, I guess I’ll…accept my prize? Yeah, I’ll take the foam finger and wear it proudly for the rest of the game, as well as Saturday’s game.’ At the end of day, was one Crimson foam finger worth humiliating myself in front of a sold-out crowd? Of course it was! Everyone loves free stuff, and a little public humiliation is a small price to pay.
I guess I should’ve learned my lesson. But who are we kidding? I’ll be back. I can’t say I’ll be better than ever, or that I’ll find my foul shot and take home the t-shirt. But what’s the worst that can happen—I make a fool of myself? I do that all the time anyway. I might as well get a prize for it.
