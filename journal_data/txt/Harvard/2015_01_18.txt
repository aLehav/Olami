After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex S. Jones, longtime director of the Kennedy School of Government’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, will leave his position in July, the center announced on Tuesday.
Jones joined the center in 2000, making him its longest-serving director, according to Nancy Palmer, the center’s executive director. Before coming to Harvard, Jones was a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for The New York Times and a host for NPR’s “On the Media” and PBS’s “Media Matters.”
“When I became director of the Shorenstein Center, it was called the Shorenstein Center of the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, and it reflected that the focus was on the traditional news media,” Jones said. “In the 15 years since, the world has changed dramatically. Now, the media encompasses much more than the traditional media.”
Jones said that during his tenure, the Shorenstein Center evolved in the face of disruptive 21st century technological advances but still maintained its focus on “high-quality journalism and journalistic values,” which he referred to as the “spiritual and moral role” that the Center occupies.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, who himself is leaving at the end of the academic year, said that it is this vision for the future balanced with a strong passion for ethics that is most striking about Jones.
“This is a man who believes deeply that the role of a free press is absolutely vital for the accountability, for the success, for providing meaning in democracy,” Ellwood said.
Ellwood pointed to the promotion of the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting as one of Jones’s most notable achievements. Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson said that Jones took the Goldsmith awards “to another level,” raising their prestige to just below that of the Pulitzer Prize and “meticulously” ensuring their integrity and subjectivity.
Palmer also pointed to Jones’s work in securing the center’s financial future and his work towards the Journalist’s Resource website as key milestones of his career.
Reflecting on the future of the center, Jones said that its “mission will be to stay relevant in a world that’s going to be changing in ways we can’t be sure of.”
As for himself, Jones said that while he has no explicit plan for the future yet, he is confident he will figure it out.
“I’m filled with gratitude to have the honor and the opportunity to have been the director of this center,” he concluded.
Ellwood said he intends to start the search process for Jones’s successor shortly.
“These things usually take a significant amount of time, and we’ll see who we find and where we are in the process as the transition to the new dean comes,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Offensive efficiency was the story of the night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday, as it took just 25 shots for the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s ice hockey team to net six goals.
That theme would continue over the course of the weekend—except on Saturday, it was the visitors doing the brunt of the damage. Needing just 22 shots to net five goals, St. Lawrence (11-10-2, 7-4-0 ECAC) ruled the night, cruising to a 5-1 victory over the Crimson (11-3-2, 7-2-2).
“I thought we came out with good energy,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The puck just found the net too easily for them in the first period…. We gave up some easy opportunities, and I think from top to bottom throughout the lineup, we could have played better.”
The Crimson had 47 shots in the contest, 39 of which came over the final two periods. But Harvard could not find a way to solve freshman netminder Kyle Hayton, who stopped all but one of the shots that came his way.
Before the Crimson could put one past the rookie, the Saints had already opened up a three-goal first period lead. Harvard has now surrendered multiple first period goals in four straight games after holding opponents to a goal or less over that span in its first 12 contests.
St. Lawrence got things started seven minutes in, as junior forward Tommy Thompson began moving his way along the right boards. At the right circle, Thompson dropped the puck off to Saints’ captain Gunnar Hughes, who launched a shot past Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek to give his side an early lead.
Following the game, Gunnar—a native of Westwood, MA. and the son of Harvard hockey alum George Hughes—said that given his family ties, his matchups against the Crimson bring out the best in him.
“These games always mean a little bit more,” Hughes said. “I just get that extra fuel to play these guys, and I kind of build on it every year.”
Continuing to create pressure, St. Lawrence tacked on two more just over a minute apart midway through the frame.
On the front end, despite having just 45 seconds of power play time to work with following an expired four-on-four, the Saints made the most of their opportunity. With one second remaining on sophomore defenseman Victor Newell’s holding penalty, St. Lawrence defenseman Gavin Bayreuther found the back of the net from the left dot.
One minute later, the Saints were attacking again, as sophomore defenseman Mike Graham fired a shot on net from the right circle that went airborne off the body of Michalek.
After scanning his surroundings, the junior goaltender failed to find the airborne puck, but senior forward Patrick Doherty did not. Once the puck landed, St. Lawrence’s leading point-getter tapped it in, promptly putting an end to Michalek’s night.
“[Michalek] just didn’t have it, and that happens,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, [that’s] just a position where it’s a lot more noticeable when you don’t have it.”
With Michalek making an early exit, Donato called upon freshman goaltender Merrick Madsen in relief. In the first appearance of his college career, the rookie made 11 saves on 13 attempts.
After having one goal overturned earlier on, Harvard officially got on the board nine minutes into the second period on its third power play opportunity of the game. After the Crimson won the draw, the puck squirted out to the blue line where sophomore center Tyler Moy rocketed one past Hayton.
Helping to create the chance was junior forward Jimmy Vesey, who nearly got his stick on the puck while creating a screen in front. But the goal would be credited to Moy, bringing Vesey’s streak of 15 consecutive games with at least one point to an end.
Contributing to the lack of offensive production for Harvard was the absence of three of its top scoring threats. Sophomore forwards Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone remained sidelined with injuries, while junior defenseman Patrick McNally joined them for the second consecutive night.
“We caught a Harvard team that was pretty undermanned—missing a lot of [its] good players,” said St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel. “[We] took that into account, but I really liked the way our team came out.”
Despite being outshot, 39-11, over the final two frames, the Saints put an end to the Crimson’s comeback attempt in the opening minutes of the third period.
Trailing by two goals, Harvard underwent a setback when junior forward Brian Hart was ejected for a game misconduct penalty for making contact with the head of St. Lawrence forward Drew Smolcynski. On the subsequent power play, Saints’ forward Brian Ward put the game out of reach. Sophomore forward Alexander Dahl would tag on one more to conclude the scoring.
With the win, St. Lawrence moves into third place in the ECAC—just two points behind the Crimson for second. Harvard remains four points behind Quinnipiac, who sits atop the league with 20 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team encountered little choppy water this Saturday, as it built on its undefeated conference record in Providence.
The Crimson (6-1, 5-0 Ivy) took on both Brown (3-3, 1-3) and Penn (4-4, 3-4) in its first Ivy League meet of the new year, beating the Bears, 175-124 and the Quakers, 158-141.
Harvard came into the meet defending both its 2014 Ancient Eight championship and its unblemished conference record. However, having not raced a conference meet since November 2014, this meet marked a move from preparation to performance.
The meet also served as a bridge from the team’s challenging winter training to the high pressure meets that await as the season comes to a close: H-Y-P and Ivies.
“Training camp is really grueling and it’s nice that we can come back and compete at pretty close [to our best],” junior Danielle Lee said. “With a little more rest we’ll be able to perform really well at both H-Y-P and Ivies.”
Lee started off the meet with a third-place finish in the 200 freestyle. She later took first place in the 200 backstroke, while sophomores Marissa Cominelli and Maggie Chory, along with junior Kendall Crawford, gave the Crimson three more top-six finishes in the event.
A consistent top-three finisher, Lee attributes much of her success to the supportive environment created by her teammates.
“The cheers that we do get us really pumped up and [co-captain Stephanie Ferrell] does a really good job pep-talking us up before our individual events and our relays,” Lee said. “The atmosphere, the team cheers, and team support really help me to go the extra mile.”
Crawford and Chory competed in the 100 back as well, finishing fourth and sixth respectively. However, the top Harvard finish in this event came from freshman Kristina Li, who completed her laps in 56.47 seconds, beating out Penn’s Lauren Church by 0.12 seconds.
Another Crimson freshman proved victorious in the meet’s longest distance event—the 1000 free. Rookie Regan Kology touched the wall first, and she was followed by sophomore Ashlee Korsberg to give Harvard the top two places.
Korsberg took home another silver in the 400 individual medley, this time behind freshman Geordie Enoch. Enoch’s other performance of the day was a sixth place finish in the 200 butterfly.
“The freshmen have been pivotal in our success,” Ferrell said. “The team really feeds off of that excitement that the freshmen have. It’s always fun being a freshman and just putting yourself out there and seeing what you got. We’re really excited to watch them perform so well.”
But as the younger team members were making waves, various upperclassmen put up times worthy of the podium as well.
Ferrell finished first in the 100 breaststroke, nearly three full seconds ahead of the Quaker’s Sydney Tan. In the 200 breast, Ferrell, who has notched multiple first-place finishes in the event this year, was disqualified, and Penn swept the top three positions.
Another upperclassman notched a gold-medal finish in the 500 free, as junior Sherry Liu’s time of 4:57.31 prevented a second Quaker sweep.
Crimson divers finished the meet sweeping both events. In the three-meter competition, freshman Hannah Allchurch took first with a score of 304.10. Second went to classmate Jing Leung, who was followed by sophomore Elina Leiviska.
In the one-meter contest, Harvard took the top four spots. Leiviska finished first, followed by Allchurch, Leung, and senior Schuyler Moore.
Even with impressive individual performances and two more wins under its belt, the Crimson views this meet as just one more lap in the contest that is its season.
“We used this as the final stretch before the end,” Ferrell said. “We’re getting ready for that and using this meet as another stepping stone towards that end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 29 Harvard men’s tennis team opened its 2014-2015 spring season on Saturday with two convincing victories at the Murr Center on Saturday.
The Crimson defeated William & Mary, 5-2, and Marist, 6-1, in what was the team’s first action since the conclusion of the fall season in November. The pair of wins came after the team had only two days of practice since returning from winter break.
“We decided to put the team under pressure right away, and everybody came back really ready from their break,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We were happy with the way most of them came back. I think that having that deadline right away, having to play yesterday, was good for people.”
Senior Denis Nguyen won three matches for the Crimson (2-0 overall, 0-0 Ivy), and the freshman trio of Xavier Gonzalez, Grant Solomon, and Kenny Tao picked up a total of four victories.
“This is one of those really great years where the freshmen have come in and [brought] terrific spirit to the team without a sense of entitlement,” Fish said. “Even though these freshmen are highly competitive for positions, the upperclassmen are handling it really well, which is a mark of a really good team.”
The Tribe (1-2, 0-0 Colonial) and Red Foxes (0-1, 0-0 MAAC) were no match for a Crimson team that had eleven of its players pick up wins on Saturday.
“We have a really deep team,” senior Alex Steinroeder said. “We have 14 guys on the team who are all really good and can play. I think that’s one of our big strengths.”
HARVARD 6, MARIST 1
In its second match of the day, Harvard was able to win five of the six singles matches and all three doubles match to cruise to a victory over Marist. The Crimson’s singles lineup featured four players who did not play singles against William & Mary.
Junior Nicky Hu, freshman Kenny Tao, sophomore Andrew Ball, and senior Shaun Chaudhuri each picked up straight set victories for Harvard from the one-through-four positions. Junior Kelvin Lam lost in a tiebreaker to Marist freshman Timo Tanzer from the fifth position. Gonzalez wrapped up the singles action with a 6-3, 6-2 victory.
At first doubles, Nguyen and sophomore Sebastian Beltrame won, 6-2, as did Steinroeder and Solomon from the second doubles spot. Tao and junior Conor Haughey made it a Harvard sweep with a 6-1 victory.
HARVARD, 5, WILLIAM & MARY, 2
Nguyen, the 57th ranked collegiate men’s singles player in the nation, started Saturday off right for the Crimson. Harvard’s No. 1 player made quick work of William & Mary’s Christian Cargill, defeating the freshman, 6-4, 6-2.
Playing from the No. 2 position, Steinroeder fell behind Tribe senior Will Juggins, 5-0, but stormed back to win the set, 7-6, and took the second set, 6-4. Sophomore Brian Yeung was able to get the same result as Nguyen and Steinroeder, winning the first set, 6-4, and the second, 7-6.
Solomon picked up the other Crimson singles victory in the first spring mtach of his career with a 6-4, 7-6 win over fellow first-year Lars de Boer from the No. 5 position. Chaudhuri and Ball both fell in straight sets. Chaudhuri lost to sophomore Damon Niquet from the fourth position, while Ball was defeated by freshman Alec Miller.
Harvard was able to win two of the three doubles matches to pick up the all-important doubles point. The tandem of Nguyen and Yeung, ranked seventh nationally, won, 6-2, in the top doubles match. Beltrame and Hu picked up a 6-4 victory to secure the point for the Crimson. Solomon and Haughey fell to Tribe sophomore Addison Appleby and Niquet, 6-3.
“It ended up being the perfect day of tennis,” Fish said. “Guys got a lot of reps under pressure and had some very close matches. And close matches, when you come out on top, that’s good for confidence.”
