After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Transportation Services will add a 5:15 a.m. weekday shuttle from the Radcliffe Quadrangle to Harvard’s Allston athletic complex and incorporate the Inn at Harvard as a shuttle stop starting this fall, Director of Transit and Fleet Management David E. Harris Jr. announced Monday. Service during move-in week and senior week will also increase starting in the 2014-2015 academic year.
Harris outlined many of the changes, some of which will come as early as the Sunday of move-in week, in an email to Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, which Goffard forwarded to a UC email list and to The Crimson.
Traditional weekend route service and two shuttles on the “1636’er” Quad-Mather route will be available for the first time during the late afternoon and night throughout the entire week before classes start and on Labor Day. The evening van service will also operate during that time period, excluding the holiday.
In addition, in the week leading up to Commencement in May, students will be able to take advantage of regular shuttle route service between houses and the Yard. And beginning Sept. 2, an additional 5:15 a.m. stadium run will be added to complement the 5:40 a.m. weekday route already in place.
In an interview with The Crimson, Harris described additional upcoming changes to the shuttle schedules and lauded the modifications, which he said were the result of collaboration with Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich and the UC.
Normal shuttle routes passing the river houses will begin incorporating the Inn at Harvard as a regular stop in an effort to accommodate Dunster House residents who will be living in the building as their house undergoes renovations, Harris said.
The updates add to many others that have been implemented in recent years after the Office of Student Life and UC partnered in 2012 to survey undergraduates on desired improvements to shuttle service.
The 2012 report, co-authored by Goffard and former Adams House representative Tyler J. Cusick ’14, did not explicitly recommend introducing shuttle service in the weeks before or after the official academic year, but did state “while not a top priority, there is a small need for early morning shuttle service between 4 a.m. and 5:40 a.m.” as one of its five recommendations to the OSL.
While Goffard acknowledged the slow pace of change in negotiating with Harvard Transportation Services, which has tried to incrementally recover from 2009 budget cuts, he described the most recent wave of changes as a “big positive step” in transportation improvements.
At the same time that the new offerings will be introduced, however, the 1:20 p.m. shuttle departure from Memorial Hall and 1:30 p.m. departure from the Quad will be eliminated, Harris said.
Harris added, however, that these modifications were chosen very carefully to offset costs, and that “statistics tell us that those [times] have lower ridership numbers.”
Harris further characterized the overall changes as a “win-win situation for everybody,” noting that the only added cost to the University will be that of fuel and non-labor-related expenses.
“We feel as if it’s a marginal amount of cost to get a significant increase in service,” he said.
Pforzheimer House resident and varsity swimmer Ty W. Rocca ’16 said Tuesday that he relies heavily on the shuttle to get to 6:30 a.m. morning practices, and that the new 5:15 a.m. will be helpful on certain occasions when the team needs to arrive at the pool earlier than usual.
But with a sharp increase in the number of swimmers living in the quad next year, Rocca said he wished the shuttle would offer similar early morning service to the stadium on weekends, especially during the winter.
“I think the 5:15 a.m. shuttle is good, but I think we could also use a weekend shuttle because people have morning practice on Saturdays,” Rocca said.
And while Goffard said the Council has not had much direct involvement in transportation conversations since he and UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 assumed their roles, Harris still commended the service he says the UC still provides.
“The Undergraduate Council continues to play more and more of a role in being a very effective medium...of getting student feedback to the Office of Student Life,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seymour Slive, a former director of the Fogg Art Museum and fine arts professor emeritus, died on June 14, two weeks after receiving an honorary degree at Harvard’s 363rd commencement. He was 93.
Family, students, and colleagues remembered Slive as an energetic and passionate man who was engaged with art at Harvard in numerous roles.
William W. Robinson, curator of drawings for the Harvard Art Museums, emphasized Slive’s ability to do multiple jobs at one time.
“[He] invented multi-tasking before anybody heard the word,” Robinson said.
Before coming to Harvard, Slive hoped to be an artist, according to his eldest daughter Katya Slive.
“He always told a story that he had a mentor that wanted to take him to Paris and his mother nixed it,” Katya Slive said. “He always had a bit of a bohemian spirit.”
After fighting in World War II, Slive attended graduate school at the University of Chicago through the G.I. Bill. In the mid-1950s, he began teaching at Harvard.
Slive taught an introductory fine arts course, and, according to Katya Slive, he was voted most popular teacher multiple times.
“He was a passionate teacher,” Katya Slive said of her father. “His greatest joy was teaching kids who were going into science and law because he knew they were really bright and wanted to give them an insight into the humanities.”
Robinson echoed her sentiment.
“Especially as an undergraduate lecturer he knew how to keep it lively,” Robinson said. “He inspired a lot of undergrads and advised a lot of Ph.D. candidates who went on to propagate the field.”
Slive’s area of expertise was 17th century Dutch painting, and his scholarship includes definitive works on the Dutch painters Jacob Van Ruisdael and Frans Hals.
Bruce L. Edelstein, a former student of Slive’s, characterized two seminars he took with Slive as eye-opening experiences.
“To see Golden Age landscape painting through his eyes was to become attuned to everything that is important, innovative, and exceptional about the representation of the natural world by seventeenth-century Dutch artists,” Edelstein said.
Slive approached understanding art by focusing on the physical object rather than symbolism, practicing a method known in the field as connoisseurship.
“The real meat of his scholarship really took the object as his point of departure,” Robinson said. “He was the most engaging writer amongst living art historians.”
Edelstein added, “His critical eye made an indelible impression on me, pointing out changes in condition and obvious interventions by restorers…. I learned more about connoisseurship during the two courses that I took with Prof. Slive than in any others that I took as a graduate student.”
Aside from teaching and his research, Slive also spent many years as director of Harvard’s Fogg Art Museum, serving in that role from 1975 to 1982.
According to colleague James S. Ackerman, a former fine arts professor, Slive played an important role in bridging the gap between the museum and faculty.
Perhaps Slive’s biggest accomplishment in the museum world, Ackerman said, was his “more or less one-man campaign” in the early 1980s to build the Sackler Museum at Harvard.
The renovations underway at the Fogg Museum currently also include many features that Slive supported, including in-house conservation labs and study rooms, according to Robinson. The revamped Fogg, now in a complex that will house collections from Harvard’s three art museums, is slated to open this coming November.
Throughout Slive’s prolific professional career, those who knew him said that he remained an energetic and generous person.
“He was a very jovial person, he always greeted everyone with a smile and enthusiasm,” Ackerman said. “He had great respect for his colleagues.”
Edelstein recalled Slive as an attentive mentor with extraordinary humanity.
“He was warm and approachable, concerned about his students but also deeply interested in the world at large,” Edelstein said.
Katya Slive said that as a young girl, she thought that everyone loved their job, but when she grew older she realized her dad was unique, particularly in his love for his work.
“He wasn’t a snob—he had very rigorous standards but he was also accepting of all sorts of people,” Katya said. “Our household was always known for being warm.”
“He leaves a big deep hole,” she said.
