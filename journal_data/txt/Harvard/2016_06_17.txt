After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For singer-songwriter Kristin Welchez, working in the music business is nothing new. What is different, however, is her moniker. While she led the acclaimed rock unit Dum Dum Girls under the name Dee Dee, Welchez now goes by Kristin Kontrol—her solo project that is currently making a “quantum leap” (as Pitchfork describes it) onto the music scene with the recent release of her debut album, “X-Communicate.” Prior to her June 17 performance at Middle East, The Crimson spoke with Welchez about her move away from Dum Dum Girls and her musical inspirations.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to become Kristin Kontrol instead of continuing as Dee Dee with Dum Dum Girls?
Kristin Welchez: After the tour [for “Too True”] finished and I had a chance to rest for a second and look back, I was starting to recognize that maybe that record had not gone over quite like I thought it would…. I tried the most with “Too True” to push the sound in a new direction. I always try to make progress and expand on the sound of the record from album to album, but I think with that one I took it the farthest that I’d taken it. So it was the first time that I was starting to feel like, okay, well, there’s a lot of people who listen to Dum Dum Girls and regard Dum Dum Girls as almost a set thing; that isn’t necessarily going to change…. [But] how does that work with what I want to do—which has always been to grow and make progress and evolve? How is that going to work if I’m trying to expand and the context of Dum Dum Girls has more power than the songwriter of Dum Dum Girls? [….] I decided to start writing music and approach it differently than I had with Dum Dum Girls because I wasn’t going to be constrained…. It was like, “I’m not going to be limited by the aesthetic. I’m not going to be limited by the sound. I’m straight up just going to make whatever music I feel like making.”
Fast forward to having finally figured out the songs after about six, seven, eight months of writing…. Ultimately it was like, “Okay, guys, here’s the record I made. It definitely can’t be played as Dum Dum Girls are now…. It’s definitely a different kind of music.” I didn’t want to change Dum Dum Girls because [they are] almost an archetype, so I decided to just cut [them] loose…. To try to articulate it simply: I felt like I had reached the limit of where I could grow artistically within the context and the confines of Dum Dum Girls…. When I had the record completed, it was just a matter of figuring out a new home for it, and it was one of those sort of revelatory moments where it was two-fold in terms of outgrowing something. I had outgrown the mold of Dum Dum Girls, and I had also outgrown the need for an alter ego—which essentially I started with as a security blanket because I had never written my own songs before, and I had never sung in my own band before. I have dealt with confidence issues [and] stage fright my whole life, so in taking my first baby steps out there, it was really helpful to flip the switch and have this character because it was empowering and sort of allowed me to flex an extrovert muscle that had been dormant until then. Now, almost 10 years later, I’ve obviously grown up quite a bit. And I just realized I want to view my music as myself. It’s just time.
THC: Still on the topic of switches—could you talk about your transition from writing and performing ’60s-inspired garage rock to more ’80s synth pop?
KW: Well, I wouldn’t simply say it like that…. When Dum Dum Girls started and I was learning to play guitar… I was learning covers and a lot of those ’60s hits—sort of that era of songwriting [where] you had songwriters where that was 9 to 5 for them. It was very formulaic in that way, and that was a really accessible tool in learning how to write my own song. I would learn a Neil Diamond song or very simple Beatles song… then I could play and sing a song, and it was pretty encouraging because it was like, “Okay, I didn’t write this song, but I’m capable of performing it, so let me take these strings and chords and put them in a different order and see what happens….” I tried with each Dum Dum Girls’ album to expand on the songs to reflect the fact that I was learning how to play guitar better, to practice the craft of songwriting….
With this record, I’ve definitely seen that it’s been distilled down to synth pop or super 80s or whatever. There are obviously a lot of references from that era, but there are a lot of other references as well that aren’t as dominant or aren’t as well known. For me, the record kind of reflects a pretty wide scope of all the music I like. You have the first song, “Show Me”; it was on the more emotional side. I wanted to write a simple, direct song that was hopeful, which was honestly something I had never done before. So lyrically I was going for simple and memorable and hopefully impactful. And sonically I was going for minimal, but also that really great mid-tempo dance beat which is kind of a big thing in freestyle music…. I was listening to a lot of Robyn, and she has a song called “Show Me Love,” and that was a very literal inspiration. And I was also listening to the Susie and the Banshees’ song “Kiss Them For Me,” which also references that mid-tempo freestyle percussion rhythm. [With] the next song, “White Street,” I wanted to write a Kinks-esque guitar rest because I had never done that, and then the producer, Kurt, put in a lot of shoegazey guitar sounds. The next song, “Don’t Wannabe,” was my krautrock jam… but [we] made it a bit lighter and electronic….
I could go down the list and tell you [all the musical influences]—the most obvious ones [are] Madonna, Janet Jackson, Kylie Minogue, Robyn, Kraftwerk, [and] some lesser-known obscure ’80s synth pop stuff: Cocteau Twins, Kate Bush. Then you pop in some reggae, some Ace of Base—it’s all pretty varied to me…. I was very classically a West Coast kid in the ’80s. In kindergarten, my favorite song was the “Loco-Motion” cover by Kylie Minogue. I started taking dance lessons in kindergarten, and I was obsessed with the more dance-based pop stars like Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson. And Madonna was the world to me because I was raised really Catholic. I remember the first time I saw the video for “Like A Virgin,” it just, like, blew my mind because I was like, “Ah, this is me!” That became the high-bar for what a pop record’s effect could have on a person.

Janelle Monáe stole the show on Boston Calling’s final day. With her tangibly emotional vocals and contagiously upbeat dancing, Monáe is one of the few artists whose studio work cannot do full justice to her incredible live performance.
The show began with an instrumental introduction. The band was dressed in white suits and shirts, and two backup singers swayed side to side in white crop tops and black high-waisted jeans. After some minutes of the crowd screaming and cheering for Monáe to appear, she was wheeled on stage in a stretcher-like apparatus, draped in a black-and-white stranded woolly short coat over a schoolgirl-like outfit of a white shirt paired with suspender straps, a black skirt, and thigh-high socks. She wore round-framed sunglasses and bright red lipstick, and her hair was done in her signature large pompadour. The set was clean with no colors apart from black and white, creating a retrograde stylistic effect that was reminiscent of the last few decades of the previous millennium and very characteristic of Monáe.
As the show began, Monáe leapt to her feet and came to life with precise energetic movements and a beat to which the crowd could not help but dance. She opened with “Givin’ Em What They Love,” her voice strongly compelling and soulful; the infectious rhythm of her performance was hard to resist. She sang and danced in seamless combination, going through hits including “Electric Lady,” “Tightrope,” and “Yoga.” Monáe also performed covers of James Brown’s “I Got You (I Feel Good)” and the Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back.” Between songs, Monáe announced, “Tonight is dedicated to the fearless,” and urged the audience to choose freedom over fear. In a speech prefacing her song “Cold War,” she encouraged them to practice respect and equal treatment to others regardless of race, gender, or sexuality. She reminded the audience to stay aware of what is going on in the world and to “know what you’re fighting for.” Her words granted deeper meaning to her music and tied in a sense of greater responsibility.
Monáe ended with a touching tribute to the recently deceased Prince, whom she called her “mentor and idol” and “the greatest rock star of all time”: a vibrant and moving cover of “Let’s Go Crazy.” The audience’s cheering and high energy continued long after. Monáe had created an emotionally charged atmosphere and experience that cannot be replicated through a studio recording.

Boston Calling 2016 constituted the end of an era. In May of 2017, when the festival next occurs, it will take place not at City Hall Plaza but at Harvard’s athletic complex in Allston. As Harvard’s stadium seats over 30,000 people, this relocation may allow the festival to attract bigger artists than it ever has before, and it could signal an attempt to reach the scale of more famous festivals. The festival is also looking to expand the diversity of its programming: It featured comedy alongside music for the first time this year, and in 2017 will add a film festival curated by Natalie Portman and a visual art show.
But the move to Allston is bittersweet. The City Hall location has given Boston Calling a unique character, given how well the site is integrated with the city. This year, as in previous years, the Brutalist architecture of City Hall provided an intriguingly textured backdrop for light shows that expanded the performance space far beyond the stage. It is unclear whether the festival will be able to carry this tight association between performance and setting to Allston.
And it's not only the location that is changing. A number of artists this year deviated from the more conventional sorts of performances that Boston Calling has previously hosted. Sia stood completely still onstage and played pre-recorded videos on the stage-side screens; Robyn performed remixes of her hits; Sufjan Stevens used outrageous set pieces and costumes. These performances succeeded to varying degrees. Stevens staged a hilarious, engaging romp; on the other hand, Sia completely lacked any stage presence. It’s certainly not in and of itself a bad thing to afford artists more creative liberty in their performances, and perhaps future instantiations of Boston Calling will provide further evidence of the advantages of such a strategy, but Sia’s performance evidences its considerable risks.
Historically, Boston Calling has focused on crafting a lineup of indie-oriented artists known for their stage presences and the quality of their live performances—like Courtney Barnett this weekend, or the Avett Brothers last September. The choice of bigger names like Sia and Robyn as Friday and Saturday headliners, respectively, seems to indicate a deviation from this precedent. Given that the festival is expanding next year, perhaps the pop and indie sides of Boston Calling will successfully coexist. At the very least, the festival is clearly at a crucial juncture in its growth, and next May should show the sort of event it will ultimately become.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On the third and final day of Boston Calling, the weather took a chilly turn, remaining cloudy and in the 60s all afternoon and evening. Festival-goers opted less for the Coachella-worthy outfits common on previous days and more for the classic New England sweatshirt and leggings combination. The rain did hold off until after midnight, however, so though it was windy and cold, it stayed dry.
The Sunday lineup opened with local rapper Michael Christmas. He was followed by French singer and dance group Christine & the Queens, who delivered an upbeat and fun performance, easing the audience into a dancing mood. Next Unknown Mortal Orchestra gave an instrumentally impressive set. They played song after song with little talking in between, and often the singing felt more like an accompaniment to the elaborate guitar melody. By the time Vince Staples ran onto the stage amidst a heavy beat, the crowd had grown considerably in size and risen in energy. Staples, looking casual in a blue sweatshirt and jeans, had the crowd jumping and clapping at his command as he walked back and forth, rapping into the microphone.
My ears were ringing from the bass of Staples’s performance, so I took a break afterwards. I watched Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires from the balcony of the VIP area. The Government Center plaza was filling up as the bulk of the festival-goers arrived. Charles Bradley was followed by The Front Bottoms, who gave a humorous performance with witty and at times snarky lyrics.
I decided to check out the comedy entertainment around the back. It was a much smaller stage, with around 50 people gathered. Many of them seemed to be hanging around while eating dinner as the stage was set up near the food vendors. While the comedians were difficult to hear over the music unless you were standing close to them, this new addition to Boston Calling seems promising, even if the main focus remained on the musical set.

I returned to the main stages in time for Elle King, known for her hit “Ex’s and Oh’s.” With laidback humor, Elle encouraged the cheering crowd to drink and have fun. Janelle Monáe had the whole audience dancing to her infectious beat with her energetic and moving performance, closing with a tribute to Prince. The sky grew dark as the three sisters of HAIM swayed side by side to the tunes of the guitars slung over each of their shoulders. The evening capped off with Disclosure, who wrapped up the weekend with their 2013 hit, “Latch,” to which the riled-up audience screamed along, jumping and dancing under flashing lights.

Christine & the Queens
The French singer-songwriter Héloïse Letissier encouraged acceptance and being comfortable with oneself throughout her performance. She moved with precision and rhythm, and her voice was soothing and moving. Despite her early scheduling, the crowd was energetic. The backup dancers (the Queens) displayed some impressive break-dancing, and their movements seemed as important an element of the performance as did the music. Letissier ended by singing “Happy Birthday” to one of the dancers and told the audience to “Stay freaky” as they walked off the stage. Though one of the less commonly known artists in Sunday’s lineup, Christine & the Queens left a strong impression with their fun performance.

Elle King
Elle King delivered an unapologetic, assertive performance on Sunday. In a fringed black leather jacket over a t-shirt bearing the words “Just Right” and bright blue boot-cut jeggings, hair dyed purple and turquoise to match her pants and rainbow glitter-encrusted eyelids, King exuded confidence. She stopped to take sips from a plastic cup full of beer and admitted to the crowd she was never sober in the “drinking town” of Boston. She called herself “a chain-smoking, hard-drinking woman,” and belted out her hits, including “Ex’s and Oh’s,” in her unique throaty voice with captivating control and mastery. With Elle King, the night had truly begun.

Vince Staples
Vince Staples got the crowd worked up and energetic with a performance that mixed focused rapping with bantering humor. He chanted “Bounce!” and the crowd chanted back, jumping to his catchy beat and heavy bass. He urged the crowd to stay in school and listed some of Boston’s prestigious universities, prompting the crowd to shout back the ones he missed. And he rapped about his ascension from humble beginnings with a pointed determination that seemed to show he was proud of his success but did not take it for granted. Staples, who claims to have never done drugs or consumed alcohol, also counseled the audience to say no to these substances—then shouted, “But if you are high, make some fucking noise!” In that way, Staples created a dynamic and engaging atmosphere—one that remained even after Staples leapt off the stage and finished his performance, standing in the front of the crowd gone wild with cheering.

HAIM
HAIM had a tough act to follow after Janelle Monáe, but their performance did not disappoint. The three sisters from LA stood in a line on stage behind their microphones, each with a guitar slung over her shoulder. Their voices were soft, but the crowd was swaying and clapping to the rhythm of their music. Though HAIM’s studio work is more pop-driven, their live performance possessed considerable rock elements, which lent a more artful flavor to their music. Christine & the Queens made a surprise appearance, dancing behind the three sisters as they performed a cover of Prince’s “I Would Die 4 U.” Later, it was just the three girls in front of large mirror sheets, rocking to their intense guitar playing, welcoming the darkening night with an impressive performance.

City and Colour

Doubtless, Dallas Green (a.k.a. City and Colour) is a talented songwriter and instrumentalist. His discography, while as a whole quiet and mellow, bursts with understated emotion. But what stood out by far in Green’s performance at Boston Calling on Saturday was the purity and strength of his voice. So though Green was far from the most energetic performer at Boston Calling, he was still a joy to see live. The studio versions of his songs are indeed beautiful, but his lives, supported by impressive quality of his voice, are vastly more so.

Courtney Barnett
Only one album into her music career, Courtney Barnett has already garnered widespread praise and a Grammy nomination, and “Pedestrian at Best” off of her debut is easily one of the best rock songs to come out in recent years. However, as a lesbian—like Barnett—I found her music to be only the second most exciting part of her set. Historically, queer female musicians have become popular only within the queer community; even Tegan and Sara, who have recently become relatively well known, have been making music for decades. But at Boston Calling, Barnett was enthusiastically watched by a mostly male crowd, a signal that queer female musicians need no longer be defined by their sexuality. Melissa Etheridge will always be known as a lesbian musician, but Courtney Barnett, it seems, is seen as just a musician.

There’s nothing quite like that moment at a concert when you hear the first notes of a song you know by heart. For the next few minutes, you can sing along unabashedly, your mediocre voice overpowered by the artist’s own—for a few minutes it’s only you, the artist, and a song you adore.
In her headlining set on Saturday, May 28, of Boston Calling, Robyn did not afford her fans many of these moments. She made the unconventional move of performing not the original studio versions of her songs but remixes, each of which was done by a different one of her “favorite artists in dance music,” according to an email sent to the press. Because of dance music’s focus on beats instead of vocals, Robyn was singing less than half of the time she was on stage, and the mixes did not, in general, leave her lyrics intact. Even her most ardent fans would have had trouble singing along.
But what both they and Robyn novitiates could do was dance. Every mix was well constructed and eminently danceable; they would all do wonderfully in a club setting. Robyn herself, an engaging performer and talented dancer, took full advantage of this feature. She spent much of her set dancing and leaping across the stage—movements that became even more entertaining with the aid of the large mirrors she used as set pieces. Frequently a backup dancer joined her on stage; and despite the almost 90-degree heat, the dancer valiantly moved in time to the beat the entire time that she was on stage. As a concert, Robyn’s remixed performance was somewhat bizarre; as a dance party, her performance was wildly entertaining.
About two-thirds of the way through her set, Robyn did throw a bone to those who had hoped for a straightforward concert. The version of “Dancing on My Own,” a remix by Cassius, for the most part retained the song’s lyrics in their original order, and the crowd sang along enthusiastically. The remix moved much of the song from a major to a minor key and added a more persistent and danceable beat. “Dancing on My Own” thus represented something of a best of both worlds: danceability and singability blended together in a single remix. Particularly given that the song is one of Robyn’s best known, “Dancing on My Own” constituted perhaps the most enjoyable and participatory moment of the evening.

While Boston Calling has in the past hosted now-world-famous, mainstream artists on the upswing of their popularity—Kendrick Lamar was the festival’s third headliner in 2013, less than a year after the release of his major-label debut—most of the biggest artists it has previously attracted have a decidedly indie bent. Sia, then, is the festival’s first veritable popstar. On the remainder of her tour in support of her new album, “This is Acting,” she plays mostly arena shows; for her, Boston Calling is a relatively small venue.
Perhaps as a result, Sia’s performance differed radically from the others that the festival has hosted. As she sang on a podium—completely still, given that she probably has a difficult time seeing through the bangs that cover her face—dancers acted out what resembled music videos onstage. The screens showed not live footage of the performance but pre-recorded and edited studio footage of the same dances and skits. The skits featured well-known actors like Paul Dano and Kristen Wiig, as well as Maddie Ziegler, the dancer from the viral music video for “Chandelier;” nevertheless, some nearby members of the audience were at least temporarily convinced that the screens showed an extremely well-shot version of what was happening on stage. The videos coordinated impressively with the onstage dance, and the vague narrative portrayed a nice feature, but they also made Sia’s set feel like it wasn't really a live performance at all. For almost everyone in the audience, save those quite close to the stage, the screens dominated the visual field. Because Sia was motionless and had almost no stage presence, the screens easily attracted the majority of the audience’s attention. The experience was thus more akin to watching a series of music videos with thousands of other people than a live show.

Sufjan Stevens’s set at Boston Calling on Friday was an elaborate exercise in risk. From absurd, over-the-top costumes and set pieces that seemed assembled from parts bought at A.C. Moore to the two female backup singers to whom Stevens frequently ceded the stage, various aspects of the performance might have come off horribly. Instead, they came together to create a ridiculous, high-energy romp and the highlight of the weekend’s offerings.
But Stevens’s riskiest decision by far involved the timing of his performance. Other than the headliners, the artists at Boston Calling do not have the luxury of long set lengths. Nevertheless, Stevens chose to perform the majority of “Impossible Soul” off of 2010’s “The Age of Adz,” a 23-minute track, near the end of his set; as a result, he performed only 12 songs, five of which were from “Adz.” His Boston Calling performance was, then, an apt complement to his previous tour, on which he performed 2015’s brilliant “Carrie & Lowell” in its entirety. Even for those who didn’t see Stevens’s previous tour, the set and “Impossible Soul” in particular were remarkable. He began the song by putting on an enormous pair of silver wings and climbing a similarly colored structure, from which he sang in autotune. By the end, he and his backup singers were bouncing about the stage in capes to which were attached dozens of balloons, both the traditional sort and the long kind used to make balloon animals. Stevens used the varying textures of “Impossible Soul” as a substrate for one of the most flamboyantly performative moments of the entire festival.
Which is not to say that Stevens’s set was unremittingly energetic. After a fiery performance of “Vesuvius,” Stevens moved toward the melancholy, telling the audience, “I think I’ve earned the right to sing a song about death, if you don’t mind.” The rendition of Stevens’ most popular song, “Casimir Pulaski Day,” that followed was true to the recorded version, but its contrast with the electro-influenced songs that came before it lent it greater power.
Stevens is a musician known for his tightly and innovatively written pieces, and rightly so. A priori, one might not have tapped his show to be one of the standout performances of the weekend—much of his early music qualifies as “white guy with guitar,” albeit the best the genre has to offer. But from the soothing of “Seven Swans,” with which Stevens opened his set, to the electronic moments of “Impossible Soul,” Stevens is nothing if not unconventional, and his set was as unconventional as they come. As Boston Calling took a more mainstream bent, Stevens successfully relished in the strange.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will seek to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the University mishandled a sexual assault investigation and violated anti-sex discrimination law Title IX—but will keep a key document in the proceedings private, according to court records filed last Friday.
Harvard filed its initial response, which indicates the University will seek to throw out the complainant’s claims instead of settle, four months after after Alyssa R. Leader ’15 initially opened the lawsuit in federal court. The University sought to keep private the contents of a 79-page report on Leader’s case from the University’s Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, citing the “highly personal, confidential, and sensitive” nature of the document.
“We expect to file a motion to dismiss in the coming days. The motion to dismiss will be a public filing,” University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement. “In order to protect the identities of all parties involved in Harvard's investigation, we have sought to seal, with the agreement of Ms. Leader, the ODR report, which is an exhibit to the motion. That is the only piece that will be sealed.” 
Usually, court proceedings are public documents, but Leader agreed to seal the ODR document, according to the filing. The judge, Denise J. Casper, officially approved the motion Thursday.
Leader captured national media attention in February when she opened the lawsuit charging that Harvard approached her complaint of sexual assault with “deliberate indifference.” In the 29-page complaint, Leader alleges that a male College student—referred to as “John Doe 1”—sexually abused Leader during a “dating relationship” and then subsequently intimidated and harassed her in Cabot House after the relationship ended.
Harvard also motioned to have several outside lawyers represent the University in the case. Harvard asked the court to allow Danielle C. Gray, a Harvard Law graduate and a former staff for President Obama, and Apalla U. Chopra, an attorney at O'Melveny & Myers LLP, to represent the University. While Harvard does have a legal office of its own, the University “routinely hires outside counsel to handle litigation,” according to deLuzuriaga.
Leader’s suit recounts a number of interactions she had with Harvard administrators about the complaint over the course of two years and alleges misconduct at multiple levels. According to the suit, she reported Doe to the director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in 2013 and 2014 and met with Cabot Resident Dean Tiffanie L. Ting in November 2014. The suit alleges that Ting discouraged Leader from filing a formal complaint and declined to remove Doe from Cabot.
In 2015, Leader reported Doe to ODR, opening a formal investigation that ultimately found Doe “Not Responsible” on all claims of rape, assault, abuse, harassment, and retaliation. Leader contests this conclusion in her suit, charging that Harvard’s investigative process in her case violated Title IX and Harvard’s own policies, which went into effect in 2014.
To counter this claim, Harvard will turn to the investigative process and seek to demonstrate that it did not violate Title IX or its own investigative procedures. A key piece of evidence will thus be the lengthy ODR report about Leader’s case.
But Harvard argues that making this final report public would threaten the privacy of the students who participated in the investigation. The report and its appendices “contain hundreds of pages of highly personal and private text messages, emails, chat messages, and photographs of Harvard College students and Leader’s private journal,” according to the filing.
Harvard also expressed concern about revealing the identities of Doe and other students named in the ODR’s final report, arguing that releasing personal information “may have a chilling effect on student and other witness participation” in other sexual assault investigations at Harvard.
In a separate filing, Harvard also motioned to dismiss the charges against the University’s Board of Overseers—its second-highest governing body—on the grounds that the Board “is not itself a corporate entity with any legal status,” according to Harvard’s primary brief. The University asked to list the “President and Fellows of Harvard College” as the sole defendant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A district court judge in New Mexico ruled against Harvard in a copyright infringement claim the University brought against the author of a Native American research novel late last month.
Harvard sued author Steve Elmore on three grounds: copyright infringement, breach of contract, and violating trademark policies at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology during the time he was a researcher there. Thus far, the court ruled specifically on the copyright infringement aspect of the lawsuit. 
At issue in the suit was whether Elmore—an antique dealer and researcher of Native American pottery—broke copyright laws by commissioning the illustration of several pictures of Native American pottery for his book, In Search of Nampeyo: The Early Years 1875-1892. Harvard argued that the illustrations, which were based off photographs from a previous Peabody Press publication, violated copyright infringement laws that precluded Elmore from reproducing the patterns.
Since the lawsuit was filed, an injunction has been placed on Elmore’s book until the suit’s resolution, preventing copies of the book from being disseminated.
Elmore called the suit against him “frivolous and vindictive and without merit” in a press release. In response, Pamela Gerardi—Deputy Director of Curatorial Administration and Outreach at the Peabody—wrote in an emailed statement that “Harvard Peabody has no interest in banning Mr. Elmore’s book. We do have an interest in enforcing the contract he signed not to publish his research photos and to require proper attribution.”
Elmore was unable to be reached for comment for this story. Linda Wiener, a research assistant to Elmore and the lead writer of a blog that has chronicled the legal battle, said that the resolution of the lawsuit has affected more than just Elmore and the University.
“To say the simplest thing, they [Harvard] didn’t make that pottery,” Wiener said. “The Native American community was furious about Harvard trying to gain copyright to Native American designs.”
A change.org petition urging Harvard to drop its lawsuit against Elmore has thus far garnered over 1,100 signatures.
Elmore’s partnership with the University began in 2010, when Elmore was reportedly approached by an employee who asked him to compile a manuscript based off the Museum’s Keam Collection, a depository of Native American pottery. According to Wiener, he consequently entered a “work for hire” contract with Peabody Press—the publishing arm of the Peabody—which conferred the rights of the content of his manuscript to Harvard.
According to Wiener, upon examination of the collection, Elmore realized that the pieces of pottery assembled were the work of a single artisan, rather than a host of workers, as the Museum had originally assumed. His resulting work, which pinpointed the artisan as Nampeyo—a Native American woman—went through several rounds of peer review at the Peabody Press before it was rejected for publication.
In a letter to Elmore, the University wrote that it would return “all rights” to “all versions of the manuscript submitted to the Peabody Press,” and encouraged him to seek publication with a company that did not specialize in academic writing. In addition, the Press said that it would provide Elmore with “10 to 15 high quality photographs” to use in publication without any cost to the author.
According to Wiener, Elmore declined the offer to use said photographs because they were of a “very poor quality” and commissioned an illustrator to draw facsimiles of the original pottery for his new book—rendered in color—which he then self-published.
In Harvard’s eyes, those facsimiles represented a breach of their contract with Elmore. Harvard’s legal argument rested on the “reasonable person” standard— one that argued that if a reasonable person looking at both the original picture and the illustration deemed them the same, then the illustration constituted an infringement on the University’s copyright. New Mexico District Court Judge Robert C. Brack offered a decisive difference of opinion, arguing that “reasonable minds could not find substantial similarity between the two” images.
“Consequently, the images based on the Historic Hopi Ceramic photographs do not infringe on Harvard’s copyright, and summary judgment for Mr. Elmore is appropriate,” Brack wrote.
Though judgement has been passed on the copyright infringement facet of Harvard’s suit, a decision has yet to be made on whether Elmore breached his contract with the Peabody Museum, which allows researchers to take photographs of exhibits, but prevents them from using them for anything other than their personal research.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote “In this case, we have merely asked that Mr. Elmore republish his work with publication-quality images and with proper attributions of individual pottery pieces… as he had previously agreed.”
Mediation between the Museum and Elmore is set to begin in early fall, according to Gerardi. In the event that the suit cannot be settled in mediation, the case will go to trial sometime during the winter, according to Gerardi.
For Gerardi, the case represents a potential turning point in the museum’s history of research policies. Museums like the Peabody at peer institutions typically do not allow researchers to photograph exhibits, according to Gerardi. The ultimate ruling on the case could, she said, cause museum administrators to revisit the policy in light of their ability to enforce the ban on reproducing photographs taken while researching at the museum.

CORRECTION: June 27, 2016
A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Pamela Gerardi's last name. It also misnamed the Harvard Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
