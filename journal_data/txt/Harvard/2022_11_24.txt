After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
As an undergraduate member of the Student Labor Action Movement, I am writing in response to your “Let Them Eat Toast” editorial from November 14th, which had some criticisms of SLAM and unionized HUDS workers’ campaign for hot breakfast.
The sticking point of hot breakfast in “every” versus only “some” upperclassmen houses is no reason for Crimson editors or students to reserve support for our campaign. UNITE HERE Local 26, a union representing HUDS workers, and SLAM are both open to a return of hot breakfast that does not reach every house — we just want to increase its availability. Those who see a limited expansion as more sensible are welcome within and should support our coalition as we await a response from the University to our petition.
The Board cites low usage of hot breakfast offerings as another reason against expansion — indeed, that was an original reason for the 2009 cut, with only 30 percent of students cited as taking advantage of any kind of breakfast at the time. Yet 30 percent of 7,000 is still 2,100 students every day.
Hot breakfast is a service students are fundamentally entitled to, for health and for basic quality of life. Hot breakfast is expected from any institution claiming to provide people with room and board; whether because they are an athlete, eat a late lunch, or merely want to eat well before a long day, students who need a filling start to their day should not have to settle for “cold” breakfast options due to sparse access.
Most critically, the Board’s determination that Quincy dining hall workers are not actually “overwhelmed” in the morning was condescending, dismissive, and not up for the Board to determine. If Editorial Board members who have visited the Quincy D-hall during breakfast find it less than packed, they should inquire further into reasons for workers’ claims, rather than make assumptions and call workers’ grievances — which catalyzed our campaign after being raised by the workers themselves to SLAM — “hyperbolic.” SLAM is happy to refer skeptical parties to HUDS workers with firsthand experience of Quincy in the morning to confirm that they are, in fact, overworked.
Given the widespread desire from students for more hot breakfast and from already-employed HUDS workers for better hours, my colleagues and I within SLAM see the expansion of hot breakfast as a solution to overworked Quincy staff. Just hiring more workers would not solve the issue that the Quincy kitchen does not have the room to cook for the current number of students, according to staff there. Editors concerned about the million-dollar annual cost of hot breakfast and whether the money would be better spent elsewhere can check out this recent Crimson article.
While the Editorial Board’s commentary on our work is appreciated, their arguments are ill-founded and harmful to a campaign based on legitimate grievances from both workers and students. I hope you will reconsider your opinion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social media generates uniformity. While scrolling through social media feeds, it often looks like the whole world is following a particular trend, especially when a sentiment is duplicated by multiple independent posts. On my YouTube feed, for example, everyone is moving to New York. On Sidechat, everyone loved the HUDS Diwali dinner. Other niche digital communities range from Alabama Rush TikTok to culture around specific Twitch streamers.
Although we each inhabit a distinct digital space — after all, they’re individually curated and tailored by an algorithm — these spaces overlap surprisingly often. This is because recommendation algorithms and virality promote homogeneity by providing limited choice. When Spotify makes personalized playlists, it’s really an algorithm choosing the music, which often comes down to specific, exploitable metrics like rhythm or even the artist’s gender. Artists know that a song needs to perform well on Tiktok to blow up, so today’s Billboard hits increasingly sound the same. In turn, hit songs last longer and reach more people because millions of listeners rely on algorithmic recommendations daily. In this data-driven cycle, whatever captures user attention wins, creating what some call a “streaming monoculture”.
Beyond generating a broad monoculture, social media also has a deeper function of collectivizing niche communities by relating to inner thoughts. Personally, I like aesthetic, slice-of-life TikToks with reflections about living mindfully as a young adult. Watching these videos feels as if I’m listening to a close friend speak, but in reality, many have tens or hundreds of thousands of views. These seemingly deep, personal reflections become widespread ideas in the collective consciousness, so even our deepest ideologies are influenced and homogenized. This collectivizing function enables an alternative to the natural sphere of family and local community that is flexible, modern, and hyperconnected. In this new social world, individuals choose social communities that understand them and are no longer limited by a local community consensus.
This is how trends like “that girl” become an entire self-sustaining tenet of popular culture. (If you’re unfamiliar, “that girl” involves a productive, healthy lifestyle of waking up at 5 or 6 a.m., going to the gym and making an oat milk latte before starting your workday, and so on.) Each idea feels like a relatable lifestyle or opinion, but the trend has attracted millions of people: 16-year-olds striving for it, smaller creators imitating it, and brands marketing to it.
For individuals who don’t live around others striving for this lifestyle, the limitation of physical community is removed. On their smartphone, each person can access others with similar thoughts, feelings, goals, and struggles, and it’s suddenly possible to pursue a very specific lifestyle that drastically differs from their present environment by drawing from the comfort of a digital community. Social media can create communities out of these separate pockets of like-minded people, overcoming the pluralistic ignorance that leads people to ignore the fact that others like them exist. Once someone enters a subculture, the digital content ultimately shapes their physical world, and it becomes a tangible facet of life through repeated exposure to social media.
In itself, shared ideas and digital subcommunities aren’t evil. They arguably accomplish the exact purpose of social media by connecting like-minded people worldwide over shared interests to supportive communities and relevant resources. At the same time, however, they’re creating a pervasive monoculture in popular culture and our inner thoughts and attitudes. For a society that claims to value depth and diversity of thought, algorithms and social media won’t lead us there.
Even on an individual level, homogeneity of thought is ultimately harmful to our sense of connection. Algorithms operate solely on popularity and data, which means directing users towards similar others. There’s no incentive for a recommendation algorithm to provide you with a short-term challenge or discomfort that eventually pays off in a long-term perspective shift, and algorithms don’t optimize for that kind of gratification. Ultimately, we as passive users are harmed if we are unable to connect with different people in the offline world. As curators of our own social communities in the hyper-connected world, we bear responsibility for supplementing online connection to similar people with challenging, in-person connection to our local communities. Otherwise, we risk losing community-based connection altogether.
Most people on public transit or in public spaces look at their phones when encountering others. Even at Harvard, the norm is social segregation and forming like-minded friends through clubs and sports, which is a natural reflection of human psychology to group together. However, if we have a desire to build deeper communal connections past the algorithm-created monoculture, we have to change our passive approach to an active one.
Lately, I’ve been surprised by the amount of unpredictable, beautiful interactions I can have with strangers and people I typically wouldn’t talk to. Often, a barista or a tourist on the T has a lot to share. During these interactions, I find that they’re not complete strangers — they inhabit the same world I do, they like the same sports teams and hiking trails, they have opinions on cities that I’ve always wanted to visit because they’ve lived there for years. There’s a lot to learn from the world out there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Lavietes Pavilion saw men’s basketball action was eight months ago when an already playoff-eliminated Harvard closed out its 2021-22 Ivy League season with a 54-76 loss to Dartmouth. The uninspired home atmosphere during that game may have left the Crimson ready to leave a frustrating string of narrow losses in the past and look forward to a new season.
On Sunday afternoon, Harvard (4-1) finally had the opportunity to take the court at Lavietes Pavilion again. The Crimson took full advantage of that chance, dominating inside the paint by making 70.7% (29-of-41) of its two-point field goals and opening the 2022-23 home campaign with a convincing 69-59 win against Siena College (2-2).
The performance, deserving of a standing applause from the home crowd, capped off another solid team display and a fourth win in five games to start off the season.
The win against the Saints comes four days after a hard-fought 70-69 away win against Northeastern. In both games, Harvard’s opponents entered with recent narrow losses, a run of difficult games ahead, and an inclination that winning was not a desire but a necessity.
Coach Amaker reflected on how those circumstances made for some challenging games.
“I was really impressed,” Amaker said. “It's been a tough stretch for our guys with the travel, the competition, and the tournament. Coming back home after that and having to play at Northeastern and playing teams that feel like they have their backs against the wall, it's a dangerous position to be in. That's why I'm really proud of our kids for these last two games.”
The stand out player on Sunday afternoon was undoubtedly first-year forward Chisom Okpara. Okpara recorded a career-best 24 points as well as eight rebounds (both game-highs) in his first career home game for the Crimson.
“It was really exciting, it’s just surreal that I’m really here,” Okpara reflected.” I took it in before the game, I was in awe. I always wanted to play here and now I actually am. It was a really fun, really humbling experience.”
When asked about his confident performance, perhaps characteristic of a player with more than four games of college basketball experience, Okpara credited his teammates, coaches, and family.
“They say you worked really hard for this, take this opportunity,” Okpara said. “Play your heart out. If you play hard everything will take care of itself. If I have 0 points and 10 rebounds I’m fine; 0 rebounds and 20 points I’m fine. 0-0, I’m just playing hard. Whatever happens, happens, just play your best.”
Okpara certainly made the most of Sunday’s opportunity, going 10-for-13 on two-point field goals, 1-for-2 from 3-point range, and making 3-of-4 free throws, earning high praise from coach Amaker.
“We have a saying in our program that I think he’s adopted brilliantly,” Amaker said. “It’s that when you're willing to fit in it’s amazing how well you’ll end up standing out. He’s been throwing himself into what we need him to do and not worrying about anything other than that, and he’s blossomed and now he’s actually standing out.”
Siena started the game aggressively, sinking the first three-pointer of the contest in 20 seconds and roaring out to an early 11-2 lead. After a brief timeout, senior forward Chris Ledlum subbed in and helped switch up the tempo for Harvard, sparking a 9-0 run in which the Crimson pulled the score back level at 11-11.
Harvard traded field-goals with the Saints and entered into the last six minutes of the first half with the score even. The Crimson then switched on, sparking an offensive frenzy to pull ahead for the first time in the game. Relentless defense forced the Saints into four turnovers on four Crimson steals, of which Harvard capitalized on. Ledlum converted an old-fashioned three-point play and slammed home a dunk, and sophomore guard Louis Lesmond added another two-pointer off an assist from co-captain Luka Sakota. The result was a 13-3 Harvard run, enabling the hosts to go into halftime with a 35-27 advantage over the Saints.
From this point Amaker’s squad never looked back. In the second period, Siena was able to pull back within two points of the Crimson to set the game at 45-43 with just over 10 minutes to go but fell short of regaining the lead. Harvard proceeded to go on another 12-2 scoring run behind a pair of two-point field goals from Okpara and six consecutive points from junior co-captain Sam Silverstein, who would go on to finish the game with 13 points and a career-best five steals. The Crimson closed out the game without letting its lead shrink to less than eight points.
Ledlum also recorded a career-high four steals and added on another 18 points and four rebounds to continue his excellent start to the season.
“He’s our best player, he’s the guy that we have to play through and put things on his shoulders, and he’s able to deliver, so I’m expecting that of him,” said coach Amaker when asked about Ledlum’s contribution.
With the game coming to a close and little more than a minute on the clock, Silverstein nearly caught the Saints off guard, diving onto the floor in an attempt to salvage a loose ball and prevent Siena from regaining possession. The energetic move, with the Crimson up by nine points, drew cheers from the crowd and demonstrated the hard-working culture that coach Amaker and his players frequently point to as a reason for the Crimson’s success so far this season.
"In the past couple of games we have really focused on our culture,” Okpara said. “We go through film and walk through what the other team does, but it all comes back to how we start and what our culture is. A team with culture that consistently reflects its culture will go far."
Harvard continues play with another home game this Friday against Loyola University at 2:00pm before traveling to the Bronx for a matchup with Fordham on Sunday.
