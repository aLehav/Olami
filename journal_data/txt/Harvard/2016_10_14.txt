After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since her original debut on YouTube in 2008, Miranda Sings has captured the hearts and laughs of audiences worldwide. The YouTube channel featuring Colleen Ballinger’s idiosyncratic character has attracted over 1.1 billion views and 7 million subscribers as of this month. In addition, Ballinger has released “Self-Help,” a New York Times #1 best selling book in the persona of Miranda. Her celebrity status has led to multiple awards and appearances on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.”
Netflix wasn’t going to miss out on jumping on this superstar. Original series “Haters Back Off!” will become available on Netflix tomorrow. The title contrasts with one of her classic catchphrases, “Haters make me famous!”, inspired by many of the detractors who first responded to the satirical YouTube channel.
Miranda, the main character of the show, will have the same persona as the star—a hilariously conceited and untalented young woman—of the YouTube sensation but unveiled in a different environment. Instead of her usual tutorials and commentary, this show will provide a contextual background on Miranda in her home.
The cast will star Ballinger as Miranda Sings, but will also feature new characters never before seen on YouTube. Angela Kinsey will play Miranda’s mom, Bethany, and Steve Little will play Miranda’s Uncle Jim. Erik Stoklin joins the cast as Patrick, the boy-next-door and Miranda’s best friend. Francesca Reale will play Miranda’s sister, Emily, and Chad Lamar Shepherd will portray Keith, the local pastor.
The show will be one of the first to turn a YouTube personality into a scripted series.Though the show received much anticipation from publications such as TechCrunch as well as Miranda Sings’s fans, it has picked up a less-than-ecstatic review on CNN. Tune in on Netflix to see what the buzz is about, but until then, the haters had better get ready to back off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Flashes of refugee camps in Syria; children covered in the ashes of bombs. Over the last few months, images like these revolving around the refugee crisis have been inundating televisions and newsfeeds. At a time like this, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s adaption of “The Trojan Women” might be more relevant than ever.
Euripides’s Greek tragedy follows the fate of the women of Troy following the sack of their city by the Greeks during the Trojan War. In particular, it delves into the fall of the Queen of Troy, Hecuba (Sumner N. Perera ’19); her daughter,Cassandra (Celia Kenney ’20); and her daughter-in-law, Andromache (Caro P. Ribeiro ’18), after they have lost not only their respective husbands but also their freedom and daily lives. As the story progresses, we see these once-proud women delivered into the depths of despair as they are handed off to Greek generals either as concubines or slaves—the play centering on their feelings and thoughts.
In choosing to adapt this play, director Federico Roitman ’18 found Jean-Paul Sartre’s adaptation, translated by Ronald Duncan, to be the most accessible to audiences because its contemporary language would add to the more recent conversation regarding foreign policy and global. “I wanted to do a show that spoke to more than just the refugee crisis, but the US’s role in foreign policy issues throughout history,” he says. Roitman hopes his projection design will highlight the contemporary issues upon which this play touches. “One thing I will be doing is incorporating a lot of news and documentary footage talking about Iraq, talking about the refugee crisis, talking about Vietnam and US foreign policy in general,” he says.
Producers Stephanie N. Ferrarie ’18 and Kyle J. McFadden ’18 did not want to necessarily limit the scope of the play to the U.S., a choice reflected in their set design and costumes. They choose neutral, modern clothing paired with a set based on a gray color palette. “The set needed to be nondescript, a neutral environment where you can set a story about war regardless of the location and the time period,” Ferrarie says, “especially with Federico’s projections evoking the idea of the refugee crisis now or the war in Iraq, which can be translated into the devastations caused during the Trojan War by the Greeks.”
For Perera, who plays Hecuba, the most fascinating questions engendered by the show regard human resilience and faith. “When things go extremely wrongly, people’s faith is tested, and this show definitely highlights that,” she says.
McFadden says Roitman’s energy and fascination with the play’s powerful themes have made the show exciting. “Our director has this sort of passion which really infects the whole team and makes the show that much better,” he says.
Roitman is quick to note that this is not a canned lecture on politics. “Ideally, this is going to be a spark that inspires a desire to learn about these issues, to get informed about these issues, and to talk about these issues,” he says.
“The Trojan Women” will run from Oct. 13 to 22 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.

Garth Nix is a New York Times best-selling author of young adult fantasy series, including “The Keys to the Kingdom” and “The Old Kingdom” series. His most recent novel, “Goldenhand,” is the next installment of “The Old Kingdom” series.
The Harvard Crimson: What made you revisit the “Old Kingdom” series—were there any unanswered questions or stories you felt were left unfinished in “Abhorsen” and the prequel, “Clariel?”
Garth Nix: It was not really about questions unanswered, at least on my part. I have stories that sort of stick in my head for quite some time, and in fact with the Old Kingdom, I’ve had a number of stories floating around for a long time. Typically when I’m writing one of them, I think of several—there are probably half a dozen books I could write coming out of each of them in the past, and I make notes and I think about those stories and eventually one of them will rise to prominence and I’ll decide I have to write it. But I guess I was always thinking about going on with what happened to Lirael and Nicholas Sayre. It’s a big world, I guess, and there are so many story opportunities to go back to and write a story either connecting to existing books or gaps I left between books. There are so many stories to tell that it’s very easy to return.
THC: In “The Old Kingdom,” a large aspect of the titular characters is how they deal with fear in the darker fantasy world you’ve created. Did you conceptualize the characters as fearful, or is their fear a realistic consequence of the world you built?
GN: It’s certainly something I work very hard at. I think for fantasy to work it needs to feel real; it needs to have a very solid foundation in reality. Of course, one of the best ways to do this is to make the characters feel real. In terms of them being in a fantasy world, I do tend to write my stories following the main character. I often don’t know much about my fantasy world until I start writing and not very much about the character either. I typically start with how I imagine a person in a situation, sort of like a frame picked out of a film, where I don’t know anything that’s gone before or coming after, and then I explore fleshing out the story and then the world and inevitably what happens to that character. But of course, [for] the Old Kingdom books, I’ve written them over many years and now there are five of them and several stories so I do know a lot more about the world. Normally, I start with a character in a very basic setting and explore with the character.
THC: What were the first film stills for the stories?
GN: There’s always a number of images in my head. For “Sabriel,” in 1995, I think they were a few key things. One was a picture of the wall with snow on one side and the green lawn on the other side so it looked like summer on one side and winter on the other. And that actually was a real photograph of Hadrian’s wall, and that gave me the idea for the wall that divides the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre and how the seasons are split and it’s actually a separate world when you cross the wall. So I think that gave me some of the ideas. The actual opening scene of “Sabriel,” when she’s standing outside the school gates and the rabbit has just been run over and she’s in uniform—I had this fantasy world setting, and I had this young woman who was in her last year of school, and something’s just happened, and I didn’t know how it all fit together, but I found out as I wrote the book. For “Lirael,” I’m not entirely sure except probably the glacier of the clayr where she lives. A society of women who see the future. Probably one of the key images there was of her standing out as still wearing the uniform of a child even though she’s not when everyone else has graduated to wear the uniform of the clayr. She’s the only one stuck in a child’s uniform even though everyone else is younger than her. The image of her really standing out in this society.
THC: What books were inspirational to your world-building or helped define your breed of fantasy and science fiction?
GN: You could probably mention any significant science fiction or fantasy author in the ’60s and ’70s. Other writers in other genres, especially historical fiction. People like Rosemary Sutcliff, Mary Stuart. Some more obvious things like Robert Graves’s memoir of World War I. That was quite important as there is a sort of World War I trench warfare element to the Old Kingdom. Nonfiction, some of that as well. I’ve always read a lot of history and mythology.
THC: The political themes in “Abhorsen,” such as the refugees in Ancelstierre, feel particularly potent and relevant in recent political climates. Were more topical plot points like that a way of using fantasy to explore reality?
GN: Part of trying to make the books feel real is to have things within your fantastical country that are very relevant to what is happening in our world or what happened in our world because, of course, the plight of refugees is something that’s been occurring for a very long time. I think in the real[ity] of the novels, the particular substitute of the Southerling refugees being forced across the wall, really to get rid of them, is actually a reflection of what was happening—and is still happening—in Australia, where the government was turning back refugees on boats and was really doing everything possible to not let them come to Australia and get rid of them and get them to various other islands. So that was a reflection of that shameful activity. I’m not sure I was consciously trying to make a political statement, but in the way I wanted my fantasy world to feel real, I made connections to the real world and an aspect that got in the book and was a reflection of what was going on.
THC: Which places in your novels would you most like to visit?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Based on Paula Hawkins’s 2015 best-selling novel and directed by Tate Taylor (“The Help,” “Get on Up”), “The Girl on the Train” is formulaic, lab-bred, mainstream thriller material. Emily Blunt plays Rachel Watson, the titular Girl who spends mornings not-so-surreptitiously sipping clear alcohol out of a water bottle, obsessing over her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux), and gazing longingly through the window of her train at a couple whom she deems “the embodiment of true love.” When Rachel learns that the woman in the couple has gone missing, she finds herself playing amateur Sherlock for a murder mystery buried in the recesses of her drunkenly faulty memory. While a few actors churn out excellent performances, a lethal combination of over-the-top characters and an underwritten script derails “Train” from the start.
Despite Emily Blunt’s best efforts, “The Girl on the Train” fails to deliver a new version of the same melodrama we’ve seen time and time again. Sure, nobody expected the film to reinvent the wheel, but at the very least it’s supposed to make some conscious effort to subvert its genre’s clichés in a meaningful way. Instead, the crux of the story hinges on tried-and-true thriller tropes: abusive husbands, crazy childless women, alcoholism, homicide. Ultimately, what could have been a fascinating subversion of the thriller genre becomes the unsurprising story of a trio of women who are victims of their own narratives.
Stuffed to the brim with B-list celebrities, “Train” misses the mark for great acting. As Megan, the doomed half of the mysterious couple, Haley Bennett sheds the theatrical tears of an actress who knows she looks pretty when she cries. Rebecca Ferguson’s Anna is one-dimensionally annoying. Justin Theroux’s Tom is predictable in a way that makes us wonder why Rachel and Anna are even fighting over him. And Lisa Kudrow’s Martha is the new character materialized in the transition from book to film—unnecessarily, needless to say.
Other than Laura Prepon as the best-friend comic relief and Allison Janney as the probing, no-nonsense Detective Riley, the film’s main saving grace is a delightfully unhinged Emily Blunt. Gazing into the camera through heavy-lidded, eyeliner-smudged eyes, Blunt delivers lackluster lines with admirable conviction: “She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved”; “The booze just broke us”; “I’m afraid of myself!” She does the best she can with Erin Cressida Wilson’s cringe-worthy screenplay, but it’s disappointing to watch an actress with demonstrated talent not being used to her full capacity.
The clear highlights of “Train” are the unintentional moments when viewers can see the holes in its artifice: a melodrama so synthetic it becomes comical. Scenes that incite scattered laughter include (but are not limited to) a bizarrely eroticized therapy session featuring screaming in Spanish and seductive finger-sucking; a panicked Blunt ditching a baby swaddled in blankets on the grass; an unsolicited zoom on Luke Evans’ pelvis; and an over-the-top, grisly tussle involving a corkscrew. Hilarious, yes, but in a movie that bills itself as a thriller, the scenes are utterly out of place.
Maybe, though, Taylor’s film owes its undoing to its written predecessor. After all, an adaptation can only be as good as its foundation, and Hawkins’s 2015 bestseller was as predictably trite as they come. The saddest part is that the film has all the components and potential to be something special—a director with proven talent, a versatile leading lady, a highly-buzzed release—but falls prey to its own formulaic narrative. With “The Girl on the Train,” audiences are allowed a glimpse through a window at something that could have been great. But when we crane our necks to get a better look, we’ve already hurtled past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whatever you set out to do, you usually justify it by telling yourself or others something along the lines of “I want to make a lasting legacy.” But what exactly does that mean?
It seems to me that when most people talk of legacy, they mean to create some sort of object that would last forever and speak to one’s achievement, like a Roman statue that attested to an emperor’s greatness. However, like many objects of history and great achievement such as the Great Wall of China or the Mona Lisa, there is a tendency for these things to deteriorate into rubble and residue.
So it’s hard to say that legacy in any line of work would last forever. But it’s tempting to want such a thing. Just take a look at the conversation around President Obama’s last year in office.
Commenting on the President’s speech at this year’s Democratic National Convention, Vox’s Matthew Yglesias ‘03 makes the argument that the President likely considers that this election will make or break his legacy. If Clinton wins the election, “Obama’s America” will be preserved. If Trump wins, “it will all wash away as a strange anomaly.” However, such terms inadequately describe the impact of the President’s efforts.
On one hand, to think that Obama’s America could be preserved if Clinton won the presidency overestimates the power of the presidency. Just as Reagan’s America existed for a moment and no longer exists today, Obama’s America will disappear and transform into something different.
On the other hand, believing that the President’s work would be completely washed away if Trump won underestimates Obama’s impact. His efforts to provide healthcare, mend the economy, and wage a war on terror have affected many people and will continue to have residual effects in the future.
However much one wants to believe that the impact of one’s work will be eternal—or however much one wants another’s legacy to be obliterated—it is unrealistic to put things in such terms.
How, then, should people view their work and its legacy? I suppose that when people say they want to make a lasting impact, what they are really talking about is wanting to leave behind a certain kind of residue.
What do I mean by residue? Let us take as an example a typical Harvard student. A typical student might have an A- GPA, belong to one or two extracurricular activities that they put a substantial amount of time into, take an internship or two, and have a close group of friends with which they spend most of their time. In each of these efforts, students leave behind a residue of themselves as a result of the time they devoted.
You might not consider the work or the impact of a college student to be all that significant. But these very small efforts make up college life. Contributing in section, volunteering for a few hours for PBHA, or simply eating lunch with your block mates all leave behind small amounts of residue that contribute to a heap left behind by generations of typical Harvard students. And it is this heap that, every year, incoming freshmen come to know and graduating seniors take a piece from to take with them.
Looking at work and its impact this way, the efforts of a college student can be considered just as important as the efforts of the President. Although the President’s work does leave behind a large amount of residue, it is in no way wholly constitutive of the American people’s present or future experience. It is simply another amount that contributes to people’s lives, which are accumulations of pieces of countless other people.
This kind of impact and legacy may not seem as grand as a project that will last forever. However, one’s work can live on in other ways. Even if, say, Trump were to be elected president and reverse many of President Obama’s executive orders, we might still think about the President’s efforts in terms of residue and conclude that his executive orders could live on as inspiration for future legislation, court cases, or even grassroots movements. Even if your life’s work cannot live on literally, people will take what they can from your legacy and build from there.
Similarly, what we do here at Harvard could live on in many ways. That paper you wrote for class could turn into a senior thesis. The friend that you always had long conversations over lunch with could turn into a business partner. These residues act as the basic materials for building deep, meaningful lives. Given this, I think it’s important to always keep the following question in mind: What residue would you like to leave behind?

The summer after freshmen year was chock-full of new experiences. They were the kind of experiences that you read about in American road novels. Traveling worldwide and taking plane ride after plane ride reminded me of trashy teen romance films about travel, parentless escapades, and a reckless summer.
As if I were living a Kerouac novel or an “Eat Pray Love”-esque movie, I met people who played protagonists in their own lives, and fleeting co-stars in mine. In Manila, I met an artist who developed his own style of art and recently opened an art studio catered for people with autism. In Indianapolis, I met a budding public speaker who has delivered speeches at multi-million dollar fundraisers. That same weekend, I met an actress whose show ran for six seasons and won both Golden Globe and Emmy awards.
What unifies all these people who crossed my path? It’s not just their excellence. Rather, they all have intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).
In the United States, there are over 6.5 million individuals with IDD. There’s been broader representation of people with IDD in popular media in recent years, and these long awaited representations have been slowly changing perceptions of people with disabilities. But even with the progress we’ve made, we still do not view people with IDD as full-members of our society. This is clearest when looking at the widespread lack of employment for people with IDD.
Unemployment rates for people with disabilities are at 85 percent—levels that for any other group of Americans would be unacceptable. Studies have shown that people with IDD aid in the general productivity of a work environment. Employers also reported that the number of challenges faced by an employee with IDD were much fewer than those expected at the time the individual was hired. It turns out that the reason that people with IDD are not hired is not because they lack ability, but because people assume they lack ability.
This insight highlights the main problem that this country has with people with disabilities. The biggest challenge for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities is not their disability, but rather the way people treat them because of this disability. We do this when we drop the r-word casually, forgetting the way our words belittle people. We do this when we infantilize our friends with disabilities by talking down to them or assuming we need to speak for them. In any instance where we forget to focus on an individual’s ability, we’re creating problems for people with disabilities that would otherwise be nonexistent.
In 1988, Gallaudet University—the only institution of higher education catered to deaf students and the hard-of-hearing—faced weeks of protest when a non-deaf individual was chosen as president over a deaf candidate. While this incident was exceptionally hypocritical, our own university falls into a similar inability to view individuals with IDD as capable of meaningful employment.
For the first time in my life, my campus community does not reflect the broader American landscape that is filled with people with IDD. Part of this is the fact that avenues to higher education for people with IDD are limited; for example, Harvard lacks any sort of program for the mainstream education of students with IDD. But this is beside the point, because it’s not the only way Harvard can welcome people with IDD into the community. One of the simplest and most empowering things the University can do is to hire individuals with IDD.
There is an abundance of jobs that individuals with disabilities have the ability to compete for. There’s no reason I shouldn’t run into workers with IDD in Widener Library or when visiting a professor in their departmental office. Our community can be better and hire a more diverse workforce. It’s not a groundbreaking recommendation, but it may take time for Harvard employers to see it as a priority. Doing our part to help create opportunities for people with IDD is critical, and employers must approach that task seriously, both here on this campus and nationally.
Waiting indefinitely for others to employ people with IDD would feel disillusioning to me, were it not for the fact that many students who graduate from Harvard will hold positions of power once they make careers for themselves—roles in which we can directly open up opportunities to people with IDD. At that point, as we sit behind mahogany desks with the responsibility of making hiring decisions, I hope we consider applicants who happen to have intellectual and developmental disabilities. We must shift our perspectives so that we see them as productive members of society, unlike the way they’ve been viewed for decades. When that choice is on our desk, I hope we don’t diss ability.

Whether you call it the Devil’s lettuce or mary jane, marijuana and the government policies surrounding it have been on the tip of policymakers' tongues in recent years. The drug has been legalized for recreational use in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, and twenty one states allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. This November, five states will vote on legalizing marijuana, with the issue on the ballot and leading in polls in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nevada. Voters in all these states should choose to abandon the United States’ current set of failed drug policies and support legalization.
It’s a well-established fact that the initial impetus for criminalizing marijuana was the targeting of minorities and people of color. In the 1930s, pseudoscientific claims linking the use of marijuana with violence and social deviance in so-called “racially inferior” groups, especially Hispanics and African-Americans, led to the widespread outlawing of the substance throughout the nation.
Four decades later, President Richard Nixon made clear in the Oval Office tapes that his War on Drugs doctrine was in no small part influenced by a desire to associate marijuana use with groups he disdained, like hippies and African-Americans.
The legacy of those policies are manifested in the nation’s overflowing prison population. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, at 716 per 100,000 people, costing on average more $30,000 per inmate each year. A disproportionate number of those incarcerated are people of color.
And though African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, blacks are far more likely to face legal consequences for possessing or selling drugs. Even more startlingly, whites are 32 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. These numbers reveal a startling truth: The racist foundations of our criminal justice system are far from gone.
Despite these consistently hard-line policies toward marijuana, the illicit narcotics trade persists, though the overwhelming majority of marijuana arrests are for non-violent, personal possession. States like Massachusetts have taken a positive step forward through the decriminalization of marijuana, but civil penalties for possessing the drug remain.
Ultimately, the United States should treat marijuana as it does alcohol and tobacco. While evidence about marijuana use is difficult to come by due to its legal status, scientific studies have given no reason for policy makers to treat it differently than other dangerous substances.
Indeed, beyond its ameliorative effects on the criminal justice system, legalizing marijuana would also provide municipalities and the Commonwealth with significant benefits. Chief among these is the tax revenue that would become newly available, as Colorado’s experience with legalization has shown.
While we are still concerned about the potential danger of people under the influence of marijuana driving a car, this concern is also relevant when discussing alcohol policy. Recent research is also building toward the creation of a device able to detect recent marijuana use in a person’s breath. A marijuana breathalyzer, similar to the ubiquitous test used for drunk drivers, removes a potential roadblock to legalization.
Rather than continuing to fund the War on Drugs, a policy that has done more to increase violence than stem it, the United States should reorient its priorities towards the regulation of marijuana under a well constructed legal framework. This November, Massachusetts voters have a chance to put the Commonwealth in the lead on this issue. They should take it, and vote yes on Question 4.

Visitors can transform four large metal sculptures in Chuck Hoberman’s 10°, a new exhibit at Le Laboratoire in Cambridge.
Hoberman, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Design, created the works after receiving an invitation from David A. Edwards, the founder of Le Laboratoire and a professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Edwards and Hoberman conceptualized 10° as an experiment, as well as an exhibit.
“We do experiments, in general—we alternate pretty much between contemporary art and design,” Edwards said. “We invite leading artists and designers to frontiers of science and knowledge where intuition and cultural exchange have high value and is very connected with where the world’s going.”
Visitors can manipulate each of the four structures in the gallery by pressing on large levers. The sculptures resemble origami in their geometric design and their transformable shape.
“I hope that the experience of people visiting the exhibit is really unlike anything that they’ve ever experienced before,” Hoberman said. “Things that are engaging and accessible [don’t] at all contradict the depth of the intellectual content and the research component.”
Edwards said the exhibit reflects broader trends in engineering and architecture of works inspired by nature, and the use of organic forms and materials.
“One of the things... that has been fascinating in engineering, architecture, and design in the last 10 years is the role of function in design as opposed to simply form,” Edwards said.
Hoberman is the namesake of isokinetic sculptures such as the  Hoberman Sphere and the Hoberman Arch, displayed in Salt Lake City, Utah, during the 2002 Winter Olympics. He thinks of his works as “living systems” with which viewers can interact.
“The sculptures [at the exhibit] are offering something that’s a very unusual experience, where you can interact with something that is both multiples of your own body size and your own weight, and yet you can make them transform in size and shape through space with kind of a light touch,” Hoberman said. “It’s a very unusual experience and one that points to a lot of other fascinating possibilities for future technologies as well.”
The installation runs Sept. 29 to Jan. 6 at Le Laboratoire in Cambridge. It is partially funded by the GSD, and admission is free.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has finalized the list of academic areas moving across the Charles River to its new Allston complex, the steel frame of which should be visible on Western Avenue starting around next March.
Four teaching areas—bioengineering, mechanical engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering—as well as the soft materials and robotics units make up the final list of groups that will move to Allston, according to SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff. Applied physics, Applied Mathematics, and Environmental Science and Engineering will remain in Cambridge.
The Allston complex will serve two-thirds of SEAS faculty and is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020. Currently, construction involves reorganization of below-grade steel of the existing foundation on site, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president of public affairs and communications.
“Around March or slightly later, we’re looking to go for the full permit for the actual, full steel construction. You will begin to see steel rising from the building and a greater presence of cranes above ground,” he said.
The importance of collaboration with departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences factored into the decision of which areas will stay in Cambridge, Karoff said.
“Environmental Science and Engineering are integrally linked with Earth and Planetary Sciences, so their proximity and co-location are critical to the kind of work they do,” Karoff said. “Similarly, Applied physics and Physics as you might imagine are closely collaborative and also rely extensively on the Center for Nanoscale Systems that’s in the LISE building.”
Three SEAS faculty members are leading an effort to rethink the use of spaces opened up by the move and the operation of the SEAS areas remaining in Cambridge, according to Karoff.
The Harvard endowment’s lackluster returns in recent years will not affect the complex’s construction timeline.
“The entire Allston campus remains a top priority for the University. Construction is already underway at the Science and Engineering Complex, and financing for the project is assured,” University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students calling on Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry met Thursday with two members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and discussed Harvard’s move away from coal investments—a reflection of declining profits in the industry.
The two Corporation members—William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow, and Paul J. Finnegan ’75, the University's treasurer—maintained during the meeting that Harvard will not divest from the fossil fuel industry, according to Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18 and Isa Flores-Jones ’19, two members of Divest Harvard who attended the meeting.
However, Lee and Finnegan did acknowledge that coal investments are not currently financially prudent, and that Harvard does not invest in the coal industry at this time, according to the two student activists. The University has not committed to divesting from the coal industry.
Logan T. Houck ’19, a members of Divest Harvard, also attended the meeting.
In the last few years, activists have repeatedly called on Harvard to divest its $35.7 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry, and University leaders have, in turn, rejected that call. They argue that divestment would be too of political a move for an academic institution and emphasize that Harvard funds research to study global climate change and sustainability. Divest Harvard has staged a number of protests in the last several years; in April, four students were arrested in the Boston Federal Reserve building during a protest of the Harvard Management Company’s investment in fossil fuels.
Harvard divestment activists also filed a lawsuit in 2014 arguing investments in fossil fuels violated the University’s charter. Last week, the Massachusetts Appeals court reaffirmed a lower court decision ruling Harvard was not legally required to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
Harvard’s move out of coal comes as returns in the coal industry have seen a sharp negative drop. Commodity prices have fallen due to a shift in demand towards cleaner energy sources and a flooding of the energy market with cheaper and often cleaner sources of energy, such as shale gas.
In an emailed statement, Lee wrote that the Corporation—specifically its Committee on Shareholder Responsibility—has met with Divest activists several times.
“We discussed the broad range of activities the University has undertaken to address climate change,” Lee wrote. “Harvard has made clear its position on divestment, while confirming that we welcome the opportunity to hear a variety of views on the question.”
Finnegan and Lee could not be reached for further comment. Harvard Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Paul Andrew declined to comment on the University's investments.
Drecker-Waxman maintained that divestment is a significant political statement Harvard should make.
“While it’s really good and we appreciate what Harvard is doing on its campus, there’s a lot more that needs to be done and it needs to be done politically,” Drecker-Waxman said.
Divest Harvard was not the only campus group that used the meeting as an opportunity to push its cause to members of the Corporation. Harvard University Dining Hall workers, members of the Student Labor Action Movement, and members of the Boston-based union UNITE HERE Local 26, aware of Divest Harvard’s meeting ahead of time, demonstrated outside Wadsworth Hall as their dining hall strike stretches into its second week.
Those picketing on behalf of the dining hall workers wanted to put pressure on the governing board members, according to SLAM member Allyson R. Perez ’17. The University and the dining hall workers have disagreed about wage levels and healthcare benefits over the course of months of negotiations.
“If they were to express support for a fair, affordable solution for HUDS workers, this strike would be brought quickly to an end,” Noah R. Wagner ’18, a member of SLAM, said about the Corporation.
In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that “Harvard continues to be willing to negotiate in good faith, and the University has put several proposals on the table toward the goal of achieving a fair and reasonable resolution.”
Ahead of the meeting, SLAM members also circulated an email to undergraduates with phone numbers and email addresses of some members of the Corporation, urging students to call and write to the members in support of the dining hall workers. On Thursday, SLAM members encouraged undergraduates in dining halls to call the Corporation.
“Whether they choose to act on that information now or later is unclear and outside of our control, but we’ve made an attempt to really communicate that message clearly and ask for a dialogue,” Wagner said.
Negotiations between the University and the dining services workers have not yielded a new contract yet, and the strike could continue for some time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Susan M. Collins, a Republican U.S. Senator from Maine, lamented the effect of partisanship on the federal government at an event at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
Collins, who was introduced by University President Drew G. Faust, called for a greater willingness to compromise in politics and more personal relationships among politicians. The event was moderated by Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Collins said she has become frustrated by a lack of bipartisan cooperation in government.
“When you see the Supreme Court be talked about in terms of a liberal bloc and a conservative bloc… It’s not supposed to be a political branch of government the way Congress is,” she said. “When you see the President resort to using executive orders and bypassing Congress, that is frustrating to people and not the way our institutions should work.”
She also criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, and predicted that her party would have to reckon with Trump’s candidacy after the election.
“After this election, I think you’ll see a reassessment of where the Republican Party should be and a self-examination of what we should stand for,” she said. “I think that’s going to happen regardless of what happens in the presidential election.”
Collins announced that she would not vote for Trump in an op-ed in The Washington Post in August. On Thursday, she reiterated her reasons for not supporting Trump, citing his divisive rhetoric.
“One of the areas where I was most upset with Donald Trump was one when he criticized the judge from Indiana who is of Mexican American heritage,” she said, referring to Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. “To me, that shows such a disrespect for the role of the judiciary as well as this particular judge who has an outstanding reputation that I was very troubled by.”
Collins also discussed the role of gender in politics, and recounted how meeting Margaret Chase Smith,  the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress and represent Maine in either, inspired her to become involved in politics.
“I was so proud that she was my senator, and I thought, women can do anything,” she said. “I think that was the first step on my journey to the Senate, and 25 years later I did run for the Senate and today I sit at Margaret Chase Smith’s desk on the Senate floor, which gives me goosebumps even as I say it.”
Daniel S. Menz ’19, who grew up in Maine, said he enjoyed Collins’ talk.
“I am immediately proud of my state’s civility in the political arena,” he said. “Our senators and representatives… are some of the most open-minded and bipartisan representatives in the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 15, 2016, at 12:09 a.m.
Student volunteers at the Y2Y overnight homeless shelter in Harvard Square were concerned earlier this week by a reduction in food donations from Harvard’s dining halls because of the ongoing strike.
Lily M. Velona ’18, one of the shelter’s advocacy directors, said the student-run organization learned last week that HUDS dining halls would decrease its typical weekly donation of leftover from 14 boxes to around one box. The shelter will open for its first night of the season on Oct. 15.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email, “With half the dining halls open, there is less food left over.” Six House dining halls have closed this week because of the strike.
When HUDS director for culinary operations Martin Breslin found out about the shortage of donations, he took immediate action. Breslin met with a Y2Y volunteer Friday morning to offer frozen HUDS meals to the shelter.
“It’s something very near and dear to my heart, so one thing I would never ever do is have any shelter be short of food,” Breslin said. “That would never happen under my watch. Ever.”
The shelter is currently prepared for its opening night Oct. 15. Y2Y administrative director Anais Carell ’17 said the organization is “grateful” for HUDS’s extra donation, which she said is “representative of how generous HUDS has been with us.” Carell added that HUDS donated kitchen equipment to Y2Y last year, which helped the shelter open its doors.
Cambridge non-profit Food for Free, is the intermediary that HUDS uses to send food to the shelter. DeLuzuriaga wrote in an email that Food for Free is responsible for handling the donations.
Food for Free Executive Director Sasha Purpura confirmed this, saying that Food for Free did not inform HUDS management that they had received far less donations, since the process occurs in individual dining halls and is removed from the administration.
“If somebody would have known, it would have been us. And we knew and we told the shelter,” Purpura said.
Purpura said HUDS typically donates its surplus to Food for Free, which then would donate about 14 boxes to Y2Y. Although “essentially one box” was donated to Food for Free in the last week, Purpura said the reduction was not a conscious decision on the part of HUDS management.
“There are fewer dining halls and it is staff that is unfamiliar with the process. Nobody involved is saying ‘hey, we don’t care about donating,’ but this is not simple,” Purpura said, adding that it took a long time for HUDS workers in the past to “get the process down” for distributing the surplus to Food for Free.
Purpura said Food for Free called Y2Y to let volunteers know it will donate other food it has in its reserves, although it will not be already prepared, which is what Y2Y typically receives. But Velona said she expected to be notified by the University, since Y2Y is under the Phillips Brooks House Association and is recognized by Harvard.
The shelter is open from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m. and provides a large dinner, a place to sleep, and breakfast the next morning for roughly 22 to 27 homeless young adults per night. Volunteers also provide meals at the door to those not spending the night.
Velona said Harvard dining hall leftovers make up nearly all of the meals served at the shelter’s dinner, which are often a guest’s first meal of the day. A member of the Student Labor Action Movement and a supporter of the HUDS strike, Velona voiced her frustration about the food shortage to friends in Local 26, the Boston-based labor union representing HUDS employees. In response, some workers who have received food donations offered to give them instead to the shelter—a gesture Velona called  “an incredible show of solidarity.”
Adams House cook Edward B. Childs said workers on strike were “upset” to hear about the decrease in food donations. He added that HUDS workers have a special “compassion” for the homeless.
“We have family, friends who may have been homeless at one time or another,” Childs said. “Some of us have been homeless at one time or another,” he added, referring to HUDS workers.
Purpura said HUDS management and workers have both been “amazingly supportive of food donation” and that she has been “blown away” by the University’s support.
“It’s genuine. They got this program going—all of them. The management very much included,” Purpura said.
Velona said as of Thursday the shelter had been reaching out to local organizations for food donations.
“We might have to dip into our budget but we’re hoping to scramble together donations,” she said Thursday.

CORRECTIONS: October 14, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly implied Harvard University Dining Services Management is directly responsible for overseeing donations to Y2Y. In fact, individual dining halls donate to an intermediary, the Cambridge non-profit Food for Free, and that nonprofit then handles notification of donations to Y2Y. This article also incorrectly indicated Y2Y is currently "scrambling" for food; in fact, they were concerned earlier in the week but are prepared for their opening night Oct. 15. This article also incorrectly indicated that the Unviersity directly oversees PBHA, an umbrella organization of which Y2Y is part. While the Unviersity recognizes PBHA, it is a separately incorporated non-profit organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush discussed education policy on Thursday night at the Graduate School of Education. He spoke about charter schools, standardized testing, and his somewhat controversial support for the Common Core Standards Initiative, among other topics.
The event began on a light-hearted note. “It is kind of fun being out of political life,” Bush said.
Bush turned more serious discussing growing economic inequality in America. He lamented the lack of discussion about how to address both inequality and education.
“More and more people are being left behind in this time of awesome abundance,” Bush said. “If you’re born poor, it’s possible you’ll never have a job, unless we alter the path giving people the capacity to achieve success.”
Bush also engaged in a discussion with Martin R. West, an associate professor of education at GSE. West asked Bush about his support for the Common Core, which  has drawn opposition from the Republican Party.
“I’m for higher standards... We have to dramatically change the path we’re on if we’re going to allow for this country to continue to be a chance for people to live a life of purpose and meaning,” Bush said.
Bush also stressed the importance of school choice and standardized test-based school accountability. He discussed his efforts to expand choice and improve accountability as governor of Florida.
According to event organizers, over 400 people attended the event hosted by GSE’s Askwith Forum.  Two hundred of those attendees watched a live-streamed video of the event outside the venue.
Nick P. Eynon ’20, was among those who attended the talk. Eynon said that although his own views on education issues differ from Bush’s, he appreciated the former governor’s perspective.
“As a student from Florida, I appreciate him giving relevant examples from a time I can relate to personally... I appreciate what Governor Bush brought to the discussion, and I felt like it was very informative for students coming from all party backgrounds [and] all beliefs,” Eynon said.
Bush is currently serving as a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. During his stay at Harvard, Bush will give talks on a variety of policy issues and co-teach an HKS course called “The Political Economy of the School.”
Bush ended the night by giving advice to students who hope to go into education.
“Be big; be bold. Our education system has not had meaningful change in the last 100 years,” Bush said. “We have these huge social challenges now and you all will have the chance to decide if this is the system you want.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard’s top administrators, from University President Drew G. Faust to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, have quoted Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical “Hamilton,” Annette Gordon-Reed, a professor of history and law, has criticized the musical’s depiction of America’s founding narrative as historical truth.
In a blog post published on the National Council on Public History's website in April, Gordon-Reed critiqued the play’s presentation of the Revolutionary period. Though she said in an interview that she loved the musical and that it was a “brilliant” work of art, Gordon-Reed noted that Alexander Hamilton was not a “real abolitionist” but rather a “definite elitist, for the one percent.” She described the play’s representation of the historical figure as an attempt to make him palatable to a contemporary audience.
Despite the musical’s casting of black and other actors of color, its lack of black characters, Gordon-Reed said, presents the Revolutionary period as more “white” than it in fact was.
Gordon-Reed said she is fulfilling her duty as a historian in making a series of observations about the musical, but  “would not change a line” of it. She said the national discussion about the production is productive, noting especially the upcoming documentary the “Making of Hamilton,” which she says treats the play as a “brilliant creation”, rather than historical truth.
While not necessarily disagreeing with Gordon-Reed, other faculty members emphasized other positive impacts the play has had on America’s perceptions of race and the country’s own history.
Music professor Carol J. Oja praised Miranda’s aesthetic choices, noting that amid a political climate marked by discrimination, “the brilliant young cast of Hamilton is busy writing immigrants and the reality of slavery into national narratives.”
Assistant professor of English Derek Miller said he agrees with many of Gordon-Reed’s criticisms, but warned that “no one should approach any text as the definitive truth about anything.”
“Asking a play to be all things all of the time leads to not just bad but to incoherent art,” Miller said. He noted that even reading Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton, on which the musical is based, would provide an incomplete picture of the period in American history it covers.
Miller said that the discussions of race inspired by “Hamilton” are important in a creative field traditionally dominated by white artists.
He pointed to the recent Broadway revival of “The Color Purple,” a musical that deals with the subject of race in America, as a similar example.
Hannah Farber, a visiting assistant professor at Boston College who studies early American history, said Miranda’s lyrics and music bring out the vitality of the ideals of the American Revolution
“You see the American Revolution as a set of ideas that are powerful, but cannot to retained by the people who claimed them,” she said.
Faculty members agree about the importance of discussing the musical, particularly the issues evoked in its lyrics, “who lives, who dies, who tells your story”.
Faust reminded the departing Class of 2016 last May that those question are not just for historians.
“Who will tell your story? You,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four sections of Law School students voted to use discretionary funds to host lunch events with striking dining hall workers, despite the reservations of school administrators.
Last Wednesday, Harvard University Dining Services workers began their historic strike after a months-long contract negotiation stalemate with the University, and shortly thereafter several first-year students began floating the idea of using section funds to provide food to workers.
First-year Law students are divided into seven subgroups—called sections—of students who take all of their mandatory first-year courses together. The office of the Dean of Students allocates sections discretionary funds to use for community-building activities each year.
Section social committees began discussing the proposal to use funds to buy food for the striking workers with their respective sections last week. According to Law School spokesperson Michelle B. Deakin, those discussions inspired “robust disagreement.” First-year law student and social committee member Zach Sosa said some students raised concerns about the use of funds potentially alienating students who disagreed with the strike.
In the midst of these discussions, Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells circulated an email to section social committee members cautioning them against deciding in favor of using funds to support strikers.
“Administration is not providing food at any of our events during strike periods. We were not planning on bringing outside food for any events,” Sells wrote in the email. “It does not seem to make sense for us to encourage with Section Funds for students to bring in food to feed workers who are on strike.”
She expressed concern that debate over the issue “seems to have become quite divisive” and stood contrary to the community-building intention of the funds. Sells encouraged students to use the funds to hold events featuring HUDS speakers or solicit personal contributions to purchase food instead.
Sections conducted online polls to decide the question, and four ultimately decided to use school funding to hold meal events, while other sections chose to pool individual student donations. One section used these personal contributions to buy 24 boxes of pizza for workers last week, according to Local 26 union spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.
For first-year Law student Alexandra Rawlings, using section funds rather than personal contributions was part of the point of the proposal.
“Half of the point was like ‘Hey, you guys won’t use your money to take care of your employees, but we want to use it to do that’ so that symbolic decision—which didn’t actually happen for my section—was pretty important,” she said.
Sosa’s section decided to use school funds to purchase pizza and sodas for a lunchtime discussion it held with HUDS employees Thursday in Harvard Yard. Students asked workers about their demands and the current status of bargaining sessions with the University—negotiations which both Harvard and union representatives said are unlikely to end soon.
Sosa said the event was proposed as a means of engaging with workers and involving first-years in Law student efforts to support the strike.
“The whole section idea really just came from a group of 1Ls who wanted to find a way for us to get involved as well as to supplement some of the activism the second and third year Law students are doing,” he said.
Law School student groups Reclaim Harvard Law and the Harvard National Lawyers Guild have released statements publicly endorsing the strike, and held a speakout event featuring HUDS workers in the school’s student lounge last month. They also published a joint statement last week in favor of a proposal for a HUDS-specific task force on diversity. Most recently, the Law School student government passed a resolution Wednesday in support of the strike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of a tumultuous election cycle that has shattered the conventions of American political campaigns, a glaring concern among commentators and political pundits has been changes to the tone of American political rhetoric.
Following the heated Presidential town hall debate on Sunday, some Harvard professors expressed concern that the 2016 Presidential campaign has set new standards for norms of aggression and deception.
“I do think this election has crossed a line,” said Theda Skocpol, professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard, referring specifically to Donald J. Trump’s threat to imprison Hillary R. Clinton as well as his accusations that the election is “rigged.”
To History professor Jill Lepore, such inflamed rhetoric can be traced back to the debates of the primary election, and has carried over and increased in the general election campaign. “Trump just changes everything when he walks into the Republican primary debates,” Lepore said, noting that the format of the current debates has only exacerbated this trend.
“The medium is a difficult one in which to have the sustained views and exchange of one another’s positions,” Lepore said. “And pretty much everyone is opposed to the town hall format, which so far has been the worst of these debates.”
According to Thomas Patterson, a Harvard Kennedy School professor, such inflamed rhetoric in the last debate has in fact been a characteristic strategy of the Trump campaign.
“The politics of outrage shifts well into the news model and the media have essentially acted as megaphones,” Patterson said.
English professor Stephen Greenblatt characterized Trump’s prose as often incoherent, even sometimes lacking “subjects and predicates and arguments,” citing George Orwell on the importance of  clarity in political writing.  Still, Greenblatt noted, Trump’s support base remains intact, indicating that it is not necessarily the candidate’s expression of any clear sequence of ideas that draws his supporters.
While noting that Trump is certainly an extreme example, Patterson cautioned against tying the increase of vitriol in political rhetoric specifically to Trump. Rather, Patterson sees Trump’s popularity as the natural product of a party which has spent the past 30 years upholding a platform “against everything.”
For better or worse, Skocpol thinks that the future of political rhetoric hinges on the results of the election and how close Trump comes to winning the presidency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 12:49 a.m.
After more than a year of tense, private back-and-forth between the College and single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, a town hall Thursday provided students their first open forum to express their views on the University’s place in undergraduate social life.
In a spirited but civil meeting, Music professor Kay K. Shelemay and Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich fielded 90 minutes of questions and comments, most of them critical, on the College’s new policy that will penalize involvement in final clubs and Greek organizations. 
The event was billed as an opportunity for students to provide input on the implementation of the unprecedented policy, which starting with the Class of 2021 will bar members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from student leadership positions, varsity captaincies, and College endorsement for fellowships. But many of the questions and comments focused on the value of the policy itself.
While a number of students and Harvard affiliates have voiced their support for the policy, few seemed to have attended the town hall, where no student offered an unreservedly positive opinion of the administration’s sanctions. About 40 people were in attendance at the Tsai Auditorium in CGIS South.
Friedrich specified at the beginning of the meeting that students who spoke at the event did so off the record, though many agreed afterwards to have their questions quoted in this article.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who attended the event for about a third of its duration, briefly discussed the policy before opening the floor to questions and comments. The questions that followed often cast the policy in a harshly negative light.
Shelemay—one of the two co-chairs of a committee to oversee the policy’s implementation— spoke of her commitment to nondiscrimination, noting that, to her knowledge, she was only the 39th female faculty member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to earn tenure. She hesitated at times, however, to offer a full-throated defense of the administration’s policy.
After one attendee asked whether his all-male final club affiliation should disqualify him from eligibility for the Rhodes—one of the key tenents of the policy—Shelemay said, “I hesitate to speak for Dean Khurana, and I did not design the policy.”
The College did hold several private meetings with leaders of final clubs and Greek organizations last year, as well as some town halls on “inclusion” more generally. However, there was no town hall specifically geared toward soliciting student opinion on potential penalties for unrecognized social organizations.
“[My question is] why this town hall that has generated such meaningful questions and conversations did not take place before the policy was announced to us in May?” Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 asked.
After addressing another of Sachee’s questions, Shelemay asked if Friedrich “want[ed] to speak to why it wasn’t held earlier.”
Following laughs from the audience and seconds of silence from Friedrich, Shelemay continued the discussion.
“Oh dear, never mind. Clearly no one thought of doing it last spring but it’s nice that we’re doing it now,” Shelemay said.
“I’m sorry it wasn’t held before,” she added.
After the meeting, Friedrich declined to provide an answer as to whether, in retrospect, he would have held a town hall on the policy before its announcement.
“We’re at a place where we’re prepared to talk about the implementation of the policy that has been enacted,” Friedrich said, adding that the decision to host a town hall “wasn’t my call.”
Though the committee will not submit its final recommendations on implementing the policy to Khurana until the spring, Shelemay offered some indication that she would prefer enforcement of the policy to be “built on trust.”
“I don’t think any of us want a McCarthy-esque sort of committee outcome or process,” she added in response to a question about whether the policy could require students to inform on their peers.
A pending faculty motion opposed to the policy was also a topic of discussion at the town hall, with one student asking whether the motion, if passed by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, could strike down the policy. Shelemay and Friedrich expressed uncertainty on the motion’s potential efficacy, echoing previous comments from administrators.
Of the few comments and questions not explicitly critical of the policy, many focused on the perceived social isolation of the freshman year experience. Vimal S. Konduri ’17, an inactive Crimson News Editor, advocated new College-maintained social spaces “for freshmen especially.”
“We understand the need for more space,” said Shelemay, asking for more suggestions on how the College could create social space “for freshmen and for sophomores as a way to get into and enhance campus social life so that they’re not driven to these spaces off-campus or at least outside the official bounds.”
Students also referenced Yale’s model, in which incoming freshmen receive a residential college affiliation before arriving on campus, as a possible way to improve the first-year experience.
“It would be useful to look at Yale, because they do have the residential college in place but at the same time they do have the freshmen together in one central space,” said Konduri.
At the outset of the meeting, Shelemay described the committee’s make-up of around  15 students and 15 administrators and faculty. The committee will be split into three subcommittees focused on “Governance and Implementation,” “Communication and Benchmarking,” and the creation of alternative social spaces.
Though the final membership of the committee has yet to be announced, Shelemay said many members of the committee attended the meeting. Eliot Faculty Dean and University Professor Douglas A. Melton, the committee’s other co-chair, was unable to attend the meeting.
President and Vice President of the Undergraduate Council Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17, who provided advice to Shelemay and Melton on the student make-up of the committee, were also in attendance.
“I think a lot of people have concerns, which we knew,” Rather said after the town hall. “We did have a selection bias of sorts and we’re still figuring out ways to have more town halls but also different kinds of communications.”
After the meeting Shelemay expressed optimism about the committee’s future, noting that she was “not surprised” by how many of the questions were critical of the policy.
“I thought people were frank. I thought they were thoughtful. I thought they were civil,” said Shelemay. “I thought it was as good as it could be because it’s preliminary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hurricane Matthew has hit the Caribbean and parts of the Mid-Atlantic region hard, and while far from the storm, Harvard has felt its effect as well.
On Thursday evening, a group of Harvard students gathered on the steps of Memorial Church for a candlelight vigil to honor those affected by the storm.
Students gave emotional speeches about the deadly consequences of the storm. Abena N. Oworae ’19 led the group in prayer, and the Kuumba Singers concluded the night in music with “Hold on Just a Little While Longer.”
So far, Hurricane Matthew has led to the loss of at least 34 lives in the United States and more than 500 in Haiti, according to the Associated Press. Initial estimates put the cost of the hurricane’s damage at close to $10 billion.
Daniela Muhleisen ’19, who organized the vigil, began the evening by explaining the storm. “Hurricane Matthew swept through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in the Dominican Republic, in Cuba, and especially in Haiti, where cholera cases have been on the rise and another crisis is imminent,” she said.
While the storm hit far from Cambridge, some students have been personally affected by the storm. Stephanie Dufresne ’20 said her family has felt the hurricane’s impact. “I have family that lives in Haiti and my dad was also visiting Haiti at the time,” she said. “Especially my mother’s side, they were affected the most because they live in a town called Jeremie and it’s close to the water.”
Haiti also suffered significant damage from an earthquake in 2010. Dufresne noted that  the latest natural disaster came while the country was still recovering. “People are still trying to recuperate from the damages from the earthquake and not a lot of these people have enough money and resources in order to get a new home as quickly as possible,” she said.
John Matthews ’19, social and outreach chair of the Caribbean Club at Harvard, offered words of support and comfort for those affected at Harvard. He urged those who felt overwhelmed or required emotional support to reach out to the organization. “We are here for you, just as we are here for Haiti,” he said at the vigil.
The emotional highpoint of the vigil came when attendees brought candles to the steps of Memorial Church and lit each others’ wicks. They gathered solemnly in a circle, comforting one another.
Muhleisen concluded the vigil by urging attendees not to feel pity but to pray for strength among those affected.
“There are so many ways to pray. We gather here today to do so. For those who have lost their lives, their homes, their families, and their friends. We are coming together to honor their resilience and to extend our thoughts and and our prayers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fly-By, a quick to-go lunch option for upperclassmen in the basement of Annenberg Hall, temporarily shut its doors Thursday because “the meals were not delivered at a safe temperature,” according to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
Students have expressed concerns about food quality in the understaffed dining halls that remain open during the historic strike of dining services workers, and some have reported undercooked meals. DeLuzuriaga did not provide additional details about why Fly-By was shut down, but said professionals regularly inspect the open dining halls to ensure food safety. She added that there were no reported food safety violations in dining halls Wednesday night.
Although Fly-By will reopen Friday, the unexpected closure was a surprise to some students. Several undergraduates tried eating at Fly-By before midterm exams Thursday only to encounter shut doors.
Leore Lavin ’17, said she relies on Fly-By for lunch every day. “Their veggie chili sustains me daily,” she said. But on Thursday, Lavin said she was “surprised” to see Fly-By closed.
Eliza Ennis ’19 headed to Fly-By before an 11:30 a.m. class, but learned from other students in the basement that workers had told them to eat upstairs in the freshman dining hall. While dining hall restrictions on open upperclassmen Houses have been lifted during the strike, Annenberg remains freshman-only.
“I went up and ate in Annenberg for the first time in two years, which is crazy,” Lavin said.
Although Lavin ate in Annenberg, she was unable to find a quiet spot to do an assignment. Ennis said she also felt inconvenienced by Fly-By’s sudden closure because she had less time to eat and had to take bowls of food with her to class.
“If they had told us ahead of time, it wouldn’t have been a big deal,” Ennis said. “It was just because they didn’t let us know that it was a little bit confusing.”
Some students who did not realize Annenberg was open to them left for class hungry.

Harvard’s dining services union launched an online fundraiser to provide “material support” for its striking workers.
The University’s dining halls have been closed since last Wednesday, when Harvard’s dining hall workers reported to the picket lines in a historic strike. Now, as HUDS employees enter their second week of picketing, they are asking for financial support from Harvard affiliates.
Citing Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment, UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union representing Harvard’s dining services workers—called on supporters to donate to the union’s “Strike Assistance Fund,” which will provide for necessities like groceries, diapers, and workers’ utility bills, according to the fundraiser’s website.
“Harvard dining hall workers don’t have Harvard’s billions to fight,” the fundraiser’s homepage reads. “They need you.”
While employees and Local 26 have used Harvard’s historic capital campaign as a rallying cry,  University officials have argued that they cannot simply pull money out of a $7 billion pot to pay the workers more, because many donations to the fundraising drive are restricted.
As the strike continues into its second week, Harvard’s dining hall workers are feeling its financial impact.
In an interview Tuesday, the union’s lead negotiator Michael Kramer contrasted the HUDS workers’ ability to financially sustain the strike with the University’s.
“If it was simply a question of money, the University is going to win that contest with just about anyone,” Kramer said.
As of Thursday evening, the fund had garnered over 120 contributions of undisclosed amounts.
A group of alumni in a similar donation drive have pledged to cease donations to the University and instead direct any monies to the union’s Hardship Fund. According to Local 26 president Brian Lang, that fund will pay the striking employees $40 per day.  On average, HUDS employees make $21.89 per hour during the normal work week.
The fundraising campaign marks the latest in a series of efforts the union has made to solicit donations and other support from Harvard affiliates. In an interview last week, a union spokesperson said donations of food and cash from faculty members, alumni, and other anonymous individuals, had been streamed in since the union first began its historic strike. In addition, the Student Labor Action Movement—an undergraduate group that supports the employees—has disseminated information about the negotiations and marshaled undergraduates to the worker’s side.

At the Conference on Race and Justice in the Age of Obama, academics, activists, and government officials engaged in a heated debate about whether President Barack Obama effectively addressed race-related issues during his administration.
The conference, sponsored by the the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Kennedy School, spanned two days and featured four panels.
During the opening panel on the second day, “Obama’s Legacy: Opportunity and Opportunities Missed,” panelists discussed the opportunity Obama had to draft impactful legislation, and addressed criticisms of his presidency.
Mary F. Berry, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in Africana studies, said Obama’s healthcare policy has left millions of poor Americans without health insurance.
“There is an egregious failure in the Affordable Care Act that left a hole wide enough for a truck to drive through, so that the Court can find that Medicaid did not have to be expanded,” she said.
The panelists also discussed the need for education and criminal justice reform, which Shermichael V. Singleton, a Republican political analyst, considered a shortcoming of Obama’s presidency.
“For the people who gave you a majority of their votes both times, and haven’t received anything in return, you mean to tell me that you can’t focus on making it easier for them to have access to a quality education?” he said, referring to the black voters who supported Obama.
During a panel examining “The State of Civil Rights Under Obama,” Megan M. Francis, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, said that certain human rights issues abroad, such as drone strikes and torture, have intensified in the last eight years.
Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, argued that despite Obama’s limited executive powers, his administration’s Justice Department is working resolutely to advance civil liberties.
“A president can’t wave a magic wand and say, ‘Civil rights, repair!’ That doesn’t happen. The executive is constrained in very real ways,” he said.
Audience members said they appreciated the range of opinions voiced during the panels, which included both Republican and Democratic speakers.
“The exchange was particularly thoughtful and actually surpassed my expectations in terms of the breadth of opinion,” said Michael Schoenleber, a political consultant from the Boston area who attended the event.
It is significant that the conference took place before Obama left office, said Kahlil G. Muhammad, co-chair of the conference and a professor at the Kennedy School.
“This is a conversation that should be happening before November 8, so people know what to do on November 9 and every day after that,” he said.

Harvard football (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) has not lost an away game since November of 2012. Let that fact sink in.
Sixteen times the Crimson has boarded an uncomfortable bus, arrived at an unfamiliar field, and faced unfriendly fans. And in every single case, the team has left with a victory.
Harvard’s most recent road disappointment came against Penn nearly four years ago. Which means that, save for a few fifth-year seniors, no Crimson player knows the feeling of returning home after a loss. Only Ohio State boasts a longer active road streak at 19 games.
“[Winning 16 road games] is hard,” Murphy said. “How do I know it’s hard to do? Because it’s the longest road winning streak in Ivy League history. That’s how I know.”
This Saturday’s matchup at Holy Cross was supposed to challenge the run. On paper the Crusaders boasted a bulky front seven and an offense powered by an electric quarterback, senior Peter Pujals.
Heading into the 2016 season, Pujals had already put together a resume worthy of his school’s Hall of Fame. He had started for Holy Cross since freshman year and improved the team from 3-9 to 4-8 to 6-5 in consecutive seasons.
As a sophomore, junior, and senior, Pujals was elected team captain. He had landed on the All-Patriot second team in 2014 and All-Patriot League first team in 2015. Everything had seemed to portend a momentous 2016 campaign.
Then the future shattered. All it took was one snap—a benign third down late in the second quarter against Dartmouth. He limped off the field with what coaches have since characterized as a lower-leg injury. Pujals has not returned, and the Crusaders (2-4, 1-2 Patriot) have gone 1-2. Football can be a cruel sport. However, Holy Cross still possesses dangerous weapons.
In particular, wide receivers Jake Wieczorek (senior) and Richie DeNicola (sophomore) will test the Crimson secondary in a way that no one else has, with the possible exception of Brown wideouts Alex Jette and Troy Doles. Both Weiczorek and DeNicola topped 100 receiving yards in two of the Crusaders’ first three outings.
Production has slowed since Pujals’ departure, but the tandem remains dangerous. Notably Weiczorek averages 19.8 yards per punt return.
On defense, Harvard will battle these speedsters by trotting out an energetic secondary. Collectively these safeties and defensive backs refer to themselves as “knuckleheads,” a nickname that emerged after years of coaches berating mistakes in practice.
Junior safety Tanner Lee and others have adapted this identity to their own purposes—occasionally secondary members celebrate big plays by knocking on their helmets.
“We have to make sure that no balls get thrown over our head,” Lee said. “In the past few games, we’ve let a few deep balls over our heads, so that’s what we’re working on.”
Last week against Cornell, Lee grabbed two score-preventing interceptions. Such turnover dominance tends to lie at the heart of the Crimson’s success. Since 2000, the program has gone 32-0 when not coughing up the ball.
The offensive line has played a similarly crucial role. Last year’s three-peat champions sported three offensive linemen who would go on to sign NFL contracts—Anthony Fabiano, Adam Redmond, and Cole Toner.
Forced to fill these gaps, the 2016 offensive line has struggled at times but shown signs of improvement. Last week the unit opened up sizable holes, allowing junior running back Semar Smith to tally three touchdowns.
“We have tremendous potential,” junior lineman Larry Allen said. “We could be near, up to, and if not equal to the line from last year. I know that sounds ridiculous, but we can.”
And then there are the other senior presences: quarterback Joe Viviano, halfback Anthony Firkser, defensive tackle James Duberg, and defensive tackle Doug Webb. Largely thanks to the Viviano-Firkser combination, for example, Harvard sports the highest third-down efficiency rate in the FCS at 58 percent.
Any team seeking to derail Harvard’s 16-game road train must overcome these old-hand talents. Pujals or not, the Crusaders face a tall task on Saturday.
Then again, so does the Crimson in adapting itself to a new environment. As Murphy indicated, no matter how long a streak Harvard has built, winning away from home remains a challenge.
“It’s something we always talk about—embrace the things that are harder,” Murphy said. “The most important thing we do as coaches is building adversity skills. Why? Because as hard and grinding a sport as football can be, life at times can be a heck of a lot harder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For as long as I can remember, sports have been an integral part of my life. I was, and still am, the kid that obsessively played, watched, and read about every event or sport from basketball to tennis to football to the king of all, futbol.
I’m convinced that the first thing my parents gave me when I was born was a soccer ball, because I’m crazy about the beautiful game. Growing up in Mexico for the first five years of my life, I was immediately exposed to a passionate view of the sport and even when I moved to Utah, I retained said passion.
I would make my dad go with me to the local park when he got out of work so I could kick a ball around and do drills. I played for a long time before injuries kicked in and I’d beg to go to Real Salt Lake games, especially when Mexican clubs were visiting. To this day I still love watching soccer, waking up early on Saturday and Sunday mornings to watch whatever games are on.
So naturally, when I joined The Crimson, I had my eye on covering soccer and by junior fall, I was the men’s soccer beat writer. Despite getting what I wanted, however, I can’t help but be disappointed.
No, not because of the team itself. Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer’s team has played well since he came in my freshman year and is in the midst of a five-game unbeaten streak right now. I’m frustrated because of the lack of fans.
One of the most exciting aspects of sports is the fanbase that electrifies the venue. Relating back to soccer I think of The Kop and the “You’ll Never Walk Alone” chant at Liverpool’s Anfield, the massive tifos at Borussia Dortmund’s Westfaldenstation, Roma’s infamous CUCS and many more. These traditions make every game a chilling experience and intimidate the opposing team mercilessly.
At the last men’s team’s home game versus Cornell, it was practically a home game for the Big Red, whose fans outnumbered the Crimson’s about 4 to 1 by my calculations. Despite the addition of two new stands at Jordan Field, no game has seen students fill in the original stand let alone the new ones. I could tout Harvard’s 4-0 victory in that game and people would likely continue to not show up.
Unfortunately, this isn’t isolated to men’s soccer. Across the board, Lavietes, Bright-Landry, Harvard Stadium, the MAC, Blodgett, and many other locations are full of empty seats. It’s ridiculous that aside from parents, events will often be dominated by opposing fans that travel or are alumni living around the area. The memories of ice hockey, football, and even basketball games where the opposing fan section drowned out ours are still fresh and, as a sports fan, I find them bewildering.
Whenever I bring this up to friends, the most common argument I hear back is “people here just don’t care that much about athletics, they don’t think it’s a big deal.”
I find it hard to believe that out of a student body made up of about 6,700 students there aren’t at least a few hundred if not, say, maybe a thousand interested in sports. With about a fifth of the College participating in a varsity sport, there’s clearly an interest. That number doesn’t even take into account people like me who don’t play a sport at the varsity level but still enjoy watching them or play club sports.
But Julio, why should Harvard students care about athletics? Surely they have something better to do with their night like work on a p-set or catch up on all the readings they haven’t done.
What makes sports great is their ability to bring a community together. There’s been plenty of talk lately around campus about making inclusive communities and social spaces that everyone can be a part of and hang out in without any pressure to behave in a certain manner. Why can’t those social spaces be Harvard sports?
Every year, people look forward to Harvard-Yale because, aside from being an excuse to drink early, it brings the feeling of a community to the undergraduate population. That weekend it’s Harvard versus Yale and we’re all a part of Team Harvard. You get to see friends you may not have seen in months and share a few too many drinks before ending up in hospital beds next to each other. It’s a social space and activity everyone can participate in as much as they wish.
Why can’t this extend to the rest of Harvard sports? All you need to get into most games is a student ID or a ticket you can get for free. The athletics department has made an effort in distributing tickets at the Houses and providing tailgates with free food, entertainment, and other incentives (including some dope Nike shirts at basketball last year) open to everyone before the game. It doesn’t matter who you are or how much you know about the sport; at the end of the day everyone is there as a Harvard student supporting the team.
When you’re stressed out from studying or need to take a break from the routine of readings and p-sets, events like these are a chance to go out with friends and enjoy some time off. While complaints for more social spaces are definitely valid, there’s huge potential in sporting events turning into said social spaces.
Ok, you might be thinking, that’s reasonable. But why should I stay for the game? What if I just grab free stuff, hang out with friends, and leave?
At a school like Harvard where we value hard work, effort, determination, and celebrate it, it’s perplexing to me why we don’t do the same with athletics. Though the perception of the Harvard athlete is a subject that one could possibly write a thesis on, I’d be hard pressed to find a student here who doesn’t think hard work is commendable.
While I won’t assume my experiences speak for all athletes, one of the most rewarding things for a competitive athlete is to have people watching them while they play and show off the fruits of their hard work. Imagine training for hours every week in the morning and afternoon on top of having to balance a Harvard workload just to have almost nobody show up.
Talking to athletes and coaches after a game, the gratitude and sincerity with which they say thanks to us or the fans that do show up is amazing. It’s the rowdy—and potentially a bit drunk—fanbase, the support, the people cheering you on that make all those 5 a.m. alarms or late night practices worth it. Just like we enjoy having our intellectual success validated by being accepted into a school like Harvard, athletes often long to be accepted by a fanbase that embraces and supports them.
So, the next time you see a rep from the athletics department handing out tickets, an email advertising a game, or see a post or invitation from a friend that’s on a team to go to their game, please seriously think about going.
Grab a few friends and some snacks, walk across the river, forget about school for a little bit, and just enjoy being at a Harvard athletics event. With 42 varsity sports at Harvard, there’s bound to be one you’ll enjoy.

You took a photo with it when you were five. You keep your head down as you pass it and push through a tour group. You drunkenly peed on it your first weekend of freshman year. Whoever you are, wherever you go, the John Harvard Statue will always hold a special place in your heart.
Here’s what we overheard at this iconic campus landmark on Wednesday afternoon. How does it compare to your John Harvard experience?
“Don’t touch the foot!” yelled by disgruntled students rushing past. They are sick of their front Yard serving as a tourist destination sunrise to sunset. One even more disgruntled student followed with: “Support the strike!” If a tourist doesn’t know the health threat posed by the foot, how would they know to support the loyal HUDS workers who don’t add meat to our banana bread pudding? But we appreciate the commentary.
“Does it really work if we’re not students here?” They heard the warnings from well-intentioned students. They heard their tour guide say: “This statue is left unguarded on a college campus 24 hours a day”. They even read the Trip Advisor review titled: “Do not rub the foot of the John Harvard statue”. And yet almost every tourist rubbed the foot. We at Flyby just don’t get the appeal. But we get a hint from the old man who proudly rubbed the foot and proclaimed: “Scholar.”
“And that is not John Harvard.” Every time, the tour group erupts into laughter. But seriously, haven’t you all seen The Social Network and memorized the PSK’s punching ritual? One guy shouted: “Is that for real?” A young boy approached the tour guide and called the statue a liar. The omnipotent Crimson Key tour guide responded, “It’s not a lie in itself, it’s more a lie in the words, or maybe it’s a lie in the way you interpret it.” This is a Harvard student at her finest.
“We need another picture, everybody’s in the way.” “Everybody” is the kid late to math lecture who didn’t have time to take a detour around the statue. “Everybody” is the Chinese tour group swarming around the foot. And it’s not just the statue that attracts photos – a student doing her Ancient Greek homework was the subject of a few candids. Little did the photographers know she was watching and reporting on their every move.
