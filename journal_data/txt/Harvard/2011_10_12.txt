By definition, the longtime CEO of the second biggest company in the world is a figure of rather significant political import. But even so, I was surprised at the speed with which mourning over Steve Jobs’ passing gave way to fights over whether he was a paradigmatic success story of American capitalism or a greedy megalomaniac who made shiny toys for the rich. National Review’s Kevin Williamson immediately seized upon Jobs as an example of a daring entrepreneur who meddling politicians would like an “even stronger whip hand over.” Lefties like Grist’s Dave Roberts, by contrast, dismissed Jobs’ record, saying he “unquestionably made life better & more wondrous … for wealthy people.”
The shared assumption of both the right-wing and left-wing responses is that Steve Jobs is just another capitalist, whether that be an admirable quality or a sign of moral depravity. Would that it were so. The kind of capitalism practiced by Jobs is of a wholly different—and superior—moral character to the kind of capitalism that has dominated the world for the past decade or more. Treating him as a typical profiteer is to misunderstand badly what he did, and why it was important.
Over the past 40 years or so, computers have gone from a relatively obscure tool of business to an absolutely essential component of daily life. Thirty percent of the world’s population has access to the Internet today; just five years ago, that figure was 16 percent. And given that the vast majority of residents of rich countries are now online, those figures are only going to go up as poorer countries develop. No one person can take credit for a cultural transformation of this scale. But it’s hard to think of a more essential figure in the shift than Steve Jobs.
The Apple II, as one of the first successful personal computers, helped spur the initial home computing craze in the late 1970s. The Macintosh took developments in graphical user interfaces that had been developed by the Xerox PARC lab and commercialized them. Without Jobs’ initial effort to push the Mac to market, it’s hard to know if Microsoft would have decided to follow Apple’s lead and push Windows, their own operating system with a graphical user interface, to market. If you use a computer that has menus and windows and a mouse or trackpad, then you probably have Jobs to thank.
This is not even to mention the plethora of non-computing achievements—from popularizing digital music players and convincing record labels to sell music online to founding Pixar and producing one of the most consistently excellent catalogs of any movie studio ever—for which Jobs can claim credit. The point is that Jobs made stuff that mattered and pushed competitors to do so as well. Apple, under his leadership, worked like a capitalist enterprise is supposed to work, making profits not through rent-seeking or gamesmanship but by making products that people actually wanted. Sure, Apple’s own products mostly serve a mostly high-end niche, but their introduction spurred the creation of new, better products at all price points.
This would be admirable at any time period, but Jobs’ record is especially remarkable coming as it did at a time when more of the American economy than ever before is devoted to socially useless pursuits. Concurrent to the IT boom that Jobs helped usher in, the financial services industry was also exploding in size, amounting to a third of all corporate profits by the middle of the last decade. Any idea that this was the result of genuine financial innovation, as opposed to deregulation and capture of government by banking interests, should have been put to rest when the crisis hit in 2008.
But finance was, and remains, a good industry to be in if you want to get filthy rich. As the economist Tyler Cowen has noted, the number of financial executives and other investors making over $100 million a year in 2004 was nine times the number of CEOs of public companies making that amount. The top 25 hedge fund managers that year made more combined than every CEO of an S&P 500 company put together. The lesson is clear. If you want to become rich in early 21st century America, you shouldn’t make things, or provide real services to people, or otherwise make a “dent in the universe,” as Jobs often said was his goal. You should instead take out huge loans and make crazy bets on financial instruments.
That’s why Jobs was important. He was a model of wealth acquired not due to highly leveraged, socially prestigious gambling, but due to actual inventiveness. For those of us who still think that regulated capitalism is still something worth saving, that’s something to celebrate.

We as a country seem to no longer understand what taxation is. Perhaps we never did. Public figures right and left talk about taxes as though they were theft, as though they were charity or as though tax money still belongs to the taxpayer. These metaphors represent dangerous misconceptions, and they lead to bad law. So long as we talk about tax in a faulty way, our public debate ignores the proper meaning of government and has a misguided debate.
First of all, taxation is not charity. Most recently, the response to Warren Buffet’s New York Times editorial about the under-taxation of the “mega-rich” demonstrates the prevalence of this misconception.  Senator Mitch McConnell, for example, made this allegation while proposing that Buffet “can send in a check” if he believes that the tax rate on the ultra-rich is too low. Offering to let the rich pay more, but only if they wish to, misrepresents debates about taxation. Taxation is not another charitable cause for people to support as their consciences dictate. It’s an obligation that every citizen has to support the government.
People who argue for lower taxes aren’t being uncharitable. They’re making a case, rightly or wrongly, that Americans should hold onto more of our money individually rather than pooling it in our collective organization, the government. Similarly, those like Buffet, who want higher taxes, aren’t overflowing with “liberal guilt” or charitable spirit. They’re well aware that they could write the Internal Revenue Service a check. But to do so would be fundamentally different than agreeing collectively to a different tax rate. Higher-tax advocates simply believe that in order to sustain the functions of government, everyone must contribute more through taxes.
Similarly, taxation is not theft. The trivial argument goes like this: “Theft” is a crime, and the law defines what is and is not a crime. However, there’s also a deeper moral reason why taxation in our country is not theft. In a representative democracy, when you are taxed, you haven’t forfeited your assets. You’re moving them from your private account to the social account, in which you have a share. Your government is not like your landlord. It’s like your family. Like your family, you contribute to a joint account, so that you can collectively pursue important goals. Taxes aren’t theft, any more than your spouse with a lower-paying job is robbing you. Taxes are how we participate in society.
That doesn’t mean that taxes can’t be unfair, unjust, or unbearably harsh. A classic example would be special taxes on the members of a minority group or religion, or taxation without representation. Such taxes can certainly be wrong. But they still do not constitute theft. They should be abolished, but they don’t undermine the legitimacy of taxation in general.
Both of these misconceptions lead back to a fundamental misunderstanding. Tax money is not “mine” or “yours” or “theirs.” It’s ours. Tax money isn’t being taken from us by some shadowy force outside of our control, as in the case of theft. And it isn’t something that we freely participate in, like charity. Instead, taxation is the process of shifting money from the American people in their private capacities as workers, owners, producers, and consumers to their public capacity, as citizens and government to accomplish a common goal. This does mean tax money is spent on projects that individual payers disagreed with. But if the government never does something you disagree with, you’re living in a dictatorship. And you’re the dictator. Democracy means spending money on collective projects, many of which we benefit from, and all of which we agreed upon as fairly as we are able.
These misunderstandings don’t simply lead to foolish and circular public debates. They lead to bad policy. The government of the U.S.A. is the collective process whereby we, as citizens, decide on the great projects of our society and organize to carry them out. It’s only because we can organize together, all Americans contributing to these great efforts, that we can care for our old and sick, defend our country (and others) from attack, land on the moon, and support one of the highest standards of living in the world. It’s only with collective investment in police, schools, and infrastructure that it’s possible to create the hugely profitable businesses and comfort for ourselves and our families that we take for granted.
When we forget that this is the nature of government, our collective voice and unified power, when we treat taxation as theft, charity, or private purchase, we allow our government to collapse into the petty-minded thief that we imagined it to be. It’s only by remembering the true meaning and purpose of taxation and government that we can continue to achieve great things as a society.

The death last week of Harvard Law School Professor Derrick A. Bell Jr. gives us cause to reflect on the issue of faculty diversity, one of the causes Professor Bell championed in his time at Harvard. In terms of both research and teaching, a diverse faculty is more capable of fostering an academic environment that reflects the broad range of human experience. It can provide a source of intellectual role models for an increasingly diverse student body, and, due to the considerable amount of public influence Harvard professors wield, a more diverse faculty not only enhances the University’s intellectual environment, but can also influence and improve society in general.
While it’s true that the number of female and minority faculty has been increasing consistently since the office of Faculty Development & Diversity began tracking faculty demographics in 2003, these groups still represent a startlingly low percentage of the professorships. Although women make up an insufficient 25 percent of the Harvard faculty, blacks and Latinos each compose a mere three percent. Harvard ought to seek out distinguished scholars of these groups so that our faculty can reflect the diversity of amazing intellect Surely our intellectual environment would be enriched by a larger presence of women, blacks and Latinos in our research and teaching.
It is our belief and experience that a diverse faculty increases the quality of teaching.  Inevitably, a class in literature, history, or anthropology would be informed, in part, by the perspective and identity of the professor. Our learning experience should not be limited by the presence of an overly homogenous faculty. As students, we should be given the opportunity to benefit from diverse perspectives. Additionally, the research produced at Harvard will be similarly enhanced through a greater diversity of experience.
A more diverse faculty would also provide more role models for female, black, and Latino students who comprise a significantly larger portion of the student body than the faculty.  It is important for students to see academics of a similar background in prominent positions in Harvard’s scholarly community, so that members of those groups can feel welcome pursuing a career in academia.
To the end of making this increase in faculty diversity possible, Harvard ought to adopt programs that support women and minority faculty members. Such steps might include increased family benefits such as daycare and paternity leave. Harvard ought to ensure that administrative support for a diverse faculty is never lacking. We have faith that Harvard is committed to diversity.  It is clear, however, that more needs to be done to diversify the faculty, which now suffers from unfortunately low numbers of women and minorities. Harvard ought to do whatever it can to attract impeccable scholars who represent historically disadvantaged groups.

As I walked back to my room alone on the night of Oct. 5, my iPhone’s tiny screen, clutched between my hands, lit up the darkness. It was through that screen Steve Jobs had invented that I learned of his death. As a technology geek who has followed Apple almost religiously (and bought their products in a similar fashion), I knew that the world had lost one of its greatest flames.
I was more surprised, however, that so many the world-over also felt such loss at Jobs’s death. Roommates who never cared about technology shared their sorrow with me; sad blog posts and Facebook statuses filled the Internet; flowers and notes of condolence were pasted to the glass walls of Apple stores from Manhattan to Shanghai. In a way that no other head of state, celebrity, or CEO could do, the man that few people really knew seemed to touch the lives of nearly everyone.
Although everyone has his or her own reason for admiring Jobs, the biggest reason for his widespread popularity and influence was that he was the ultimate advocate for the modern consumer. In a time when many companies emphasize profits and not customers, by focusing on aesthetics, affordable price points, and perfection in accessibility, Jobs changed the technology industry to fit what consumers—not executives or engineers—wanted. That is why we loved him.
From the beginning of Silicon Valley, when computers were ugly and “designed strictly by engineers,” as former Apple vice-president Donald Norman remembers, “the Apple II had some charm to it. It was the first personal computer that had professional industrial designers.” With Steve Jobs at the helm, Apple continued that legacy of making products that were not just functional, but beautiful: products that consumers want to use and to be seen using. Unlike those of other technology companies, 25 percent of Apple products were inducted into the New York Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection. Paola Antonelli, senior curator of the museum, recalls that the beauty of her first Mac made it special and more than just a computer: “I took it out of that brown, padded carrying case with the rainbow-colored Apple logo,” she said. “It wasn’t just something I worked with; it kept me company. It had such personality and such life.”
My fondest memories of Jobs’s keynotes—and the moments that certainly garnered the most applause—were the moments after all the magic of the new product had been revealed. “Now, this product used to cost $X,” Jobs would say. “But we think we can do better than that.” The old price would be smashed away on-screen, revealing the new accessibly low price-point. Most famously, he negotiated a 99-cent-per-song price for iTunes music that forever made it cheaper for consumers to purchase music digitally compared to purchasing entire physical albums, which was the established business model. At his last keynote speech in June 2011, he unveiled iCloud, a no-hassle wireless synching software, explaining that he had decided to make it completely free because he wanted all users to take advantage of it. Jobs made it possible for consumers to share in his magic.
Beyond making his product’s prices accessible, Jobs worked tirelessly to simplify and streamline the user experience. He was famous for the phrase “It just works,” and he was obsessive about making sure there was no hassle for consumers. Perhaps most famously, only six weeks before the original iPhone was to be announced, Jobs ordered engineers to change drastically the design of the phone, converting the screens from plastic to glass. Although from an engineering standpoint plastic was less fragile and easier to make, Job’s “instinct went the other way,” as he insisted that plastic touch screens, prone to scratches, would irritate users and be seen as a design flaw. Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive summed up Jobs’s philosophy: “Never cut corners and make sure the customer gets an experience that is an absolute delight.”
Since his death, some have decided to deify Jobs for his long list of innovations and influences. This is not the reason, however, that he should be remembered. In his 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech, he said that “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.” Steve Jobs was a mortal man who lived every day knowing he would die, and that gave him the courage to challenge the way business was run so that consumers worldwide could share in the magic of cutting-edge technology that he loved. His famous commercials encouraged us to “think differently”—and he ought to be remembered because he did.

A year after the programming initiative Hack Harvard launched on campus, a similar-sounding enterprise has taken root at Yale.
This year, third-year Yale Law School student Will T. Gaybrick ’07—who took Computer Science 50, the popular introductory course, when he was an undergraduate at Harvard and graduated with a secondary field in computer science—is running Hack Yale.
Gaybrick said the Yale version, unlike Hack Harvard, will be centered around a computer science class run by a group of students for a range of skill levels.
“[Hack Yale] is different in the sense that it’s basically a class,” said Jackson M. Kernion ’12, who participated in Hack Harvard last winter and is now on its board. “I think the general pull is similar though. They recognize, as Hack Harvard recognized, that there’s a great opportunity these days for building web apps.”
Much like Harvard’s CS50, Hack Yale has a “no experience necessary” stamp on the program—a claim that Gaybrick said is “100 percent honest.”
But unlike CS50, the course leaders are not getting paid, the program is not funded, and the students are not receiving any course credit.
“The kids don’t have to do this,” he added. “They want to.”
Gaybrick led the first lecture of Hack Yale last Wednesday. The initiative, held on Yale’s campus, is designed to teach students with any level of computer science knowledge how to program over the course of one semester.
The 50 undergraduates enrolled in the course were chosen out of a possible 500 applicants, according to Gaybrick. They meet once a week in lecture groups of 25, and an additional 30 students are taking the class remotely.
“Tech barriers have gotten lower and lower,” Gaybrick said. “People [can] get up and running pretty quickly.”
Gaybrick said he recalled how CS50 could “take you from zero to webmaster.”
Gaybrick said that he and the other five students who run Hack Yale like to “keep it small so [they] can be hands on with them.”
Hack Harvard took place for the first time last winter during Optional Winter Activities Week and was promoted as an incubator for a small group of students interested in programming and marketing a single idea.
Kernion described it as an opportunity to “intensively learn stuff you can’t learn in class. That’s the big draw.”
Kernion said that participants “get a lot of resources,” and expand upon a strong base of computer science knowledge, as opposed to starting from scratch like many students do with Hack Yale.
He also said that Hack Harvard doesn’t “take any issue” with the shared name.

Budding politicos and reinvigorated Harvard Republicans gathered Tuesday night at the Harvard Kennedy School where they watched Herman Cain steal the limelight from frontrunners Mitt Romney and Rick Perry during the Republican debate at Dartmouth College.
Some students came to support their favorite candidates, while others said that they were not fans of the Republican party but still wanted to gain an understanding of the other side of the political spectrum.
“I think it’s important to look at both sides of the picture,” Will F. Poff-Webster ’14 said.
A few minutes after 8 p.m., shouts erupted from the crowd as moderator and television talk show host Charlie Rose introduced each candidate. Romney received the most vocal support from the debate watchers.
Throughout the debate viewers chuckled as the candidates’ faces contorted—sometimes with mock exasperation, other times bordering on outright frustration—as they listened to their opponents’ criticisms.
But perhaps the greatest outburst of laughter came when former Ambassador to China John Huntsman likened Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 plan—which proposes a nine percent income tax, a nine percent business tax, and a nine percent sales tax—to the price of a pizza special.
Said Benjamin D. Sprung-Keyser ’15, “I guess I expected that there would be a greater focus on Herman Cain and that more questions would be addressed towards him.”
There was also cascading laughter after Cain bluntly told moderator and Bloomberg reporter Julianna Goldman, “The problem with that analysis is that it’s incorrect,” in response to her contention that his 9-9-9 plan would not be revenue neutral.
“You’ve gotta give the man some credit for just going all out there,” said Isaac C. Dayno ’15. “I think they really put him in a corner though; what else was he supposed to say?”
Audience members clapped when Romney mentioned Harvard Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw and his economic policies.
Attendees at the viewing enjoyed free pizza and drinks that were provided by the Institute of Politics for the event. But not everyone was especially happy with the amount of attention that certain candidates received throughout the debate.
Corinne H. Curcie ’15 said that she found it “ridiculous” that the hosts “have not been giving [Ron Paul] the opportunity to speak,” even though “he has been winning all the straw polls.”
Four members of the Harvard Political Review were live blogging the event from their laptops.
The crowd expressed varying opinions of the debate as they left the JFK Junior Forum.
But some took the more heavily discussed ideas to heart. When asked how he would rate the debate on a scale of 1 to 10, Petey E. Menz ’15 responded, “I would give it a 9-9-9.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The director of the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College charted trends in university systems across the globe during a talk Tuesday at Harvard.
In particular, Director Philip G. Altbach said poor people around the world continue to see growing access to higher education. He used the United States as an example: “From the 1960s up to today, we see a tendency of higher education in the United States moving from being only accessible to elites, to including general masses of people, and ultimately towards the direction of being universally accessible.”
Altbach, a professor at Boston College who focuses on educational leadership and higher education, also said that students are increasingly going abroad for their educations—opting for semester-long study abroad programs or full-time enrollment outside their home countries.
While students are becoming more mobile globally, large numbers are especially flocking from Asia to English-speaking countries.
Altbach said that, among other reasons for students’ newfound mobility, they often can’t find the education they are looking for in their home countries.
Meanwhile, some countries are shaping their university systems to attract the best and the brightest from around the world.
“Germany had for a long time treated all its universities equally. The end result is that most German universities lagged behind in global rankings,” Altbach said. “In response to this problem, Germany began to adopt the differentiating system which focuses resources on certain distinguished universities. This strategy has indeed increased the positions of a number of German universities on global rankings,” he said.
In response to one question about the need for universal higher education, Altbach said there have been arguments from both sides.
“I can’t really say whether it’s necessary,” Altbach said. “But I can say that the higher education nowadays is indeed moving towards that direction.”
The lecture was hosted by Harvard Graduate School of Education Comparative Higher Education, a student-run organization that plans to hold seminars and discussion panels throughout the year.

Before their Tuesday afternoon practice, members of the Harvard varsity wrestling team posed for a picture on the steps in front of the Malkin Athletic Center. But instead of sporting their team uniforms in this photo, the athletes came in gay pride attire and rainbow pins that read “Proud Ally.”
In honor of National Coming Out Day, the men chose to wear the pins in solidarity with the BGLTQ community.
Harvard College Queer Students and Allies co-president Emma Q. Wang ’12 said that this year the student group wanted to emphasize the importance of coming out as an ally.
“Sometimes it’s difficult to be very vocal as an ally,” she said. “We want them to feel included because they play such an important role.”
According to wrestler David J. Lalo ’13, it was a non-resident tutor in Lowell House, Robert Joseph “R.J.” Jenkins, who inspired the team to participate in National Coming Out Day.
“[R.J.] has made a tremendous impact across our team,” Lalo said. “We wanted to show him we support the LGBT community.”
Jenkins, who is openly gay, said that he casually brought up the idea of wearing the pins one day while speaking with several athletes in the Lowell dining hall.
He said the men responded positively to his proposal.
“I started to imagine it as an opportunity for them to come out as allies,” he said. “To think about a day for allies to come out and say, ‘I accept these people in my life. I accept them for who they are.’”
The athletes said their close relationship with Jenkins compelled them to show support for the BGLTQ community.
“He’s been a mentor and an advisor,” said wrestler Steven M. Keith ’13, who wore a shirt that read, “Some Kids R Gay. That’s OK.”
Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, director of the Sexuality, Gender, and Human Rights program at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, remembered that when he was an undergraduate, BGLTQ-identified individuals faced a stigma in the Harvard community.
“A lot of us wanted to distance ourselves from those courageous souls,” McCarthy said.
While House tutors and other faculty members provided a support system for BGLTQ students, McCarthy said solidarity was not as public then as it is today.
Jenkins said the athletes are leaders in the effort to combat discrimination against BGLTQ-identified individuals.
Wearing a shirt that said, “Some Dudes Marry Dudes. Get Over It,” Anthony J. Buxton ’13, a varsity wrestler, said he had received smiles from people on the street.
“There is a much larger community of allies who are willing and ready–even eager–to stand with their LGBT peers,” McCarthy said.

European Union senior diplomat Pierre Vimont stressed the need for the region to come together and establish a unified political vision during a talk at the Center for European Studies on Tuesday.
Vimont, a longtime official in the French government, is currently serving as the executive secretary general in the EU’s External Action Service, a department launched last year with the goal of developing centralized foreign policy positions.
Vimont emphasized that common political goals will be critical to the long-term stability of the region. He hopes the External Action Service will play a key role in unifying the member countries’ disparate interests.
“We have a large role, but we don’t know exactly what we want to do with this role,” Vimont said.
According to Vimont, the EU currently uses “a patchwork approach” when responding to foreign policy issues. He said the body lacks a strong political “espirit de corps” that supports the EU’s collective interests.
“We do not always see eye to eye across the 27 European states,” he said.
Vimont said the External Action Service’s unique skill set is best suited to deal with some of the issues facing the EU today, such as security and economic uncertainty.
“The External Action Service has the great advantage of having at its disposal many instruments that national services do not have,” he said.
According to Vimont, the EU has consistently faced difficulty crafting long-term foreign policy in part because its central leadership rotates every six months.
Vimont believes the External Action Service has the potential to bring unprecedented stability to the EU, as Catherine Ashton—the EU’s first high representative for foreign policy—will be the consistent face of EU foreign policy.
Improving relations with strategic partners such as China and the U.S. is one of Vimont’s priorities for the External Action Service’s second year of operation.
“It would be great if the External Action Service could be the branch that comes out with a few of these new ideas, pushes initiatives, and shows its innovation,” Vimont said.
“With all the hurdles, uncertainties, skepticism that we have been facing, the External Action Service is alive and kicking,” Vimont added.
Pietro Rabassi, an Italian graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he attended the lecture to get a better understanding of the politics in Europe.
“The lecture was a very good was to understand what the EU is doing in the long term. It was interesting to see the point of view from the inside,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, an Institute of Politics visiting fellow, is on campus this week to urge students to consider careers in public service.
Rendell has held various political positions over the past three decades, serving as district attorney of Philadelphia, mayor of Philadelphia, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and chairman of the Democratic Governor’s Association, in addition to his two terms as governor.
Rendell acknowledged today’s terse political climate, citing the younger generation’s important role in effecting social change.
“I think my generation has become stuck in this quagmire,” Rendell said. “And the only hope is if this generation now starts making change through the ballot box by organizing and working on campaigns.”
Frustrations have grown over government gridlock between Democrats and Republicans in Congress since the 2010 election, and approval ratings are at an all time low. Those on the left argue that President Obama has not been heavy-handed enough in settling legislative quarrels.
Rendell, an Obama supporter, acknowledged a failure in the President’s messaging in the years since his election. But he noted an important shift in Obama’s rhetoric over the last few months.
“The tone changed from the speech he made when he introduced the Jobs Bill,” Rendell said. “He was strong, he was aggressive [in that speech]. And he made the case to the American people that he failed to do with the stimulus and with healthcare reform.”
Rendell also said that the President has achieved several considerable legislative wins in the last few years, suggesting that frustrations on the left may be shortsighted.
“He has extended healthcare to 31 million Americans. No one else has been able to do that. He made education loans more affordable. He did credit card reform,” Rendell said.
But he also said he understands the central complaints of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has spread to numerous cities across the country.
“[The protesters] have a salient point, and that is that the gap between the rich and poor, between the rich and the middle class, has exploded in the past decade or decade and a half,” Rendell said.
He added that the income disparity is antithetical to the United States’ values. But even as he urged the protesters to move forward with their initiatives, he said he is wary of their tactics.
“I’d love to go down and say, ‘We understand your point, and it’s a good one. But other than that, why are you staying here? What do you have to gain?’”
Rendell said that those occupying Wall Street should instead direct their energy to campaigning and reforming government.
“Revolutions don’t happen that way here. Change happens in this country through the ballot box,” Rendell said.
He said he is visiting Harvard as an IOP fellow to encourage students to participate in the political process.
“The reason I’m here is to get smart, idealistic, young people to get involved in government in order to bring about the changes we need,” Rendell said.

Restaurants whose Yelp ratings increase by one star can expect to see their revenue increase by more than five percent, according to a study conducted by Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Michael Luca.
By combining restaurant ratings from the user review website with data from the Washington State Department of Revenue, Luca discovered that a one-star rating increase on Yelp leads to a five to nine percent increase in revenue, regardless of the actual quality of the restaurant itself.
“Very small amounts of information can have an impact in the restaurant industry because there isn’t a lot of information out there,” Luca said.
Luca controlled for restaurant quality by taking advantage of how Yelp rounds ratings. For example, an actual rating of 3.25 will be rounded to three and a half stars on Yelp, while a rating of 3.24 will be given three stars. By exploiting how similarly-rated restaurants appear unequal due to how stars are displayed, Luca was able to test the effects of how Yelp users perceive restaurant quality.
Luca also found that changes in a restaurant’s score had a relatively larger effect on independent restaurants, whereas a rating change had only a minimal effect on the profits of chain restaurants with established reputations.
In fact, online rating systems may hurt chains. Without them, diners would have had to rely on the chains’ established reputations, but with services like Yelp, they can access reviews of independent restaurants that previously would not have had exposure, Luca said.
Luther Lowe, the director of public policy at Yelp, praised the results of the study.
“It’s heartening to see what we do is helping small business owners,” Lowe said. “Yelp’s mission is to connect people with great local businesses.”
Luca said the restaurant industry in particular is ripe for crowdsourced reviews because of the high number of restaurants and the limited resources about them.
It was another source of restaurant information—hygiene scores—that, in part, spurred Luca to investigate the impact of Yelp. He said he was unsure whether crowdsourced information would be seen as less reliable than ratings given by government agencies or experts.
But people generally trust ratings on Yelp, particularly when there are more reviews for any given restaurant, according to Luca.
Lowe said Luca’s findings support the use of crowdsourced reviews for more than just restaurants.
“Dr. Luca’s paper has exciting implications for other industries,” Lowe said. “They are exciting findings because it demonstrates Yelp ratings are an important parameter on consumer choice.”

Voters headed to the polls Tuesday to cast their ballot in Liberia’s presidential election, picking from a 16-candidate field that includes two Harvard graduates.
Both graduates, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Winston A. Tubman, are widely considered the race’s frontrunners.
The National Election Commission began counting votes when polls closed at 6 p.m. Tuesday and will announce the final results on Oct. 26. If no one receives a majority in this round of voting, a runoff will take place on Nov. 11.
The Liberian news organization FrontPageAfrica.com reported that despite heavy rains, voter turnout was high and the election was peaceful, assuaging fears of violence.
Sirleaf, a 1971 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School and the University’s commencement speaker last spring, has held the office since 2006 and is the first and only female head of state in Africa. Last Friday, she won the Nobel Peace Prize, along with two other female African activists. [LINK1] According to the Nobel Committee’s website, “she has contributed to securing peace in Liberia, to promoting economic and social development, and to strengthening the position of women.”
Tubman, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1966, attended the Celebration of Black Alumni conference, titled “Struggle and Progress: Leadership in the 21st Century,” at Harvard in September. [LINK2]
Sirleaf, the incumbent, heads the Unity Party, while Tubman represents the Congress for Democratic Change. Tubman’s campaign is perhaps better known for the other half of its ticket, vice-presidential candidate George Weah. A former soccer star and celebrity among Liberian youth, Weah ran unsuccessfully for president against Sirleaf in 2005
Ishac Diwan, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School, explained that while many Liberians are concerned about issues such as corruption and unemployment, it is difficult to predict the election’s winner.
“I wouldn’t bet on anyone,” Diwan said. “The opposition is divided. There are various egos. It’s hard to come together.”
He also said the Nobel Peace Prize announcement’s impact on the election is still to be seen.
“I’m sure it will affect [the election]; the question is by how much,” Diwan said. “People are judging [Sirleaf] by how much their lives have been affected.”
In her Harvard commencement speech last May, Sirleaf urged graduates to be “fearless about the future,” raising difficult moments in her life and path to the Liberian presidency, especially with regard to the gender barriers that she faced as a female African politician.
She also noted at the time that she was preparing to run against another Harvard graduate, Tubman, who she called “the strongest opposition contender.”
“The relationship between Harvard and Liberia is thus secured and in good hands,” Sirleaf said in her speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 13, 2011, 2:52 a.m.
Despite a shaky economy, Harvard raised a record setting $639 million during the 2011 fiscal year, the third-largest amount ever accrued in the University’s history.
Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, attributed this rise in financially uncertain times to the loyalty of Harvard’s donors.
“We are fortunate to have a dedicated community of alumni and friends who are unwavering in their support of the University,” Rogers said in the release. “They are loyal, they are passionate, and they are
generous, and, for that, we are profoundly grateful.”
This year’s fundraising haul marks a 7 percent increase from the previous fiscal year’s $597 million. Current-use gifts also rose 12 percent from $248 million in fiscal year 2010 to $277 million in 2011. Current-use gifts are gifts for a specific purpose to be used during the year they were received.
But despite this rise, 2011 numbers have yet to return to pre-financial crisis totals. The University collected $651 million in the 2008 fiscal year.
In fiscal year 2008, current-use gifts amounted to $236 million, and in 2009 they totaled at $291 million.
This general rise in fundraising may reflect the University’s increased efforts to reach out to donors as it prepares for its upcoming multi-billion dollar capital campaign. Harvard’s capital campaign is currently in the “quiet phase,” the period during which the University solicits large gifts from donors prior to making the campaign public.
Rogers said that though the University has the capital campaign in mind, Harvard has yet to set priorities or a timeline for the campaign.
This reference to an “eventual” capital campaign marks the first time that Alumni Affairs and Development has publicly acknowledged the existence of the campaign in an official statement.
“We continue to make progress in the planning process, which includes academic and financial planning and prioritization,” Rogers said in a press release.
Several of Harvard’s individual schools—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Harvard Business School, and the Graduate School of Education, saw increased fundraising totals as well.
During fiscal year 2011, which ended June 30 of this year, the Business School and FAS both received major gifts from alumni. The Business School received $50 million dollars from Ratan N. Tata for an executive education building, and FAS received $10 million dollars for the Humanities Center from Anand G. Mahindra ’77.
During fiscal year 2011, Yale raised $862 million in new gifts and commitments. However, this number should be attributed in part to Yale’s capital campaign which will end on Sept. 17 after five years and a total of almost $3.9 billion raised.

Once a baker for the Leverett House grill, selling four gooey chocolate chip cookies for a dollar, Joanne B. Chang ’91 will be providing an indulgent treat for Harvardians once again this Friday as the creator of a massive birthday cake for Harvard’s 375th Celebration.
The giant, H-shaped birthday cake will be made of 63 individual red velvet sheet cakes that are 26 by 18 inches each.
The cakes will be laid on top of a 6-foot high platform. The entire cake will be frosted with Swiss meringue vanilla buttercream.
“We thought red velvet was the most appropriate, given Harvard’s color,” said chef Martin T. Breslin, the HUDS director for culinary operations. “And vanilla frosting is always in high demand.”
According to Breslin, a committee in charge of planning the 375th Celebration unanimously agreed that Chang would be an ideal candidate to bake the cake.
“Joanne is a terrific baker, and we know the quality of her product will be delicious,” Breslin said, emphasizing Chang’s focus on meticulously selecting her ingredients.
Breslin first met Chang in 2007 on the Food Network’s “Throwdown with Bobby Flay,” when he served as a judge for the show and Chang appeared as a challenger. In the episode, Chang triumphed over Flay with her “Famous Stick Buns.”
Breslin said the committee initially had a number of ideas for the celebratory cake, including an architectural design. But because architectural cakes are difficult to serve—and full of icing, which obscures the taste of the cake itself— Breslin said the committee decided to commission a simple, yet delicious, cake for the celebration. Chang was selected for the job soon thereafter.
With a degree in Applied Math: Economics under her belt, Chang spent two years as a management consultant before entering the culinary world.
“I wanted to try cooking to see what it’s like to work at a professional kitchen,” Chang said.
Her career began with a stint as a garde manager at Biba Restaurant in Boston. However, Chang said she was not completely satisfied with the chaotic nature of working to prepare orders quickly during the restaurant’s bustling meal times.
Chang followed her sweet tooth instead, deciding that work as a pastry chef might better suit her tastes.
She took a job as an assistant to the head baker of Bentonwood Bakery in Newton and as a pastry chef at Rialto in Cambridge. Then, in 1997, Chang was hired to work in the cake department of the critically-acclaimed Payard Patisserie and Bistro in New York City.
Chang returned to Boston a year later to pursue her dream of opening up her own pastry shop. In September 2000, Chang opened Flour, a bakery and café, in Boston. She is currently the owner of three branches of Flour as well as Myers + Chang restaurant, which she operates with her husband.
Chang said she enjoys the creative aspects of cooking, and producing something that goes directly to the customer.
“Baking has a clear, direct gratification,” she said.
Chang added that she began baking the 375th Anniversary cake several weeks ago, baking two sheets of cakes every other day. The cakes are delivered and stored at a Harvard kitchen, where they are kept at a very low temperature in order to maintain their quality.
The final cake, which is expected to feed up to 5,000 people, will be situated in Tercentenary Theater, and will be served to guests throughout Harvard’s  375th birthday celebration. Desserts prepared by local vendors will also be served.
In addition, the event will include a musical performance by Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and an open bar for all individuals 21 or older.

NEWTON, Mass.—Despite surrendering two goals in the first half against No. 14 Boston College (9-3, 2-2 ACC), the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-8-1, 0-2 Ivy) may have outplayed its ranked opponent in the first 45 minutes of the match at Newton Campus Field Tuesday afternoon.
And although the Eagles did not score again in the second half, the Crimson believes it did not play up to its full ability in the latter 45, preventing a second-half comeback in its 2-0 loss.
“I didn’t think we had the better of the play in the second half,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “We didn’t really create enough opportunities to even put ourselves back in the game.”
Boston College junior midfielder Kyle Bekker put the Eagles on the board early with a fifth-minute goal that Junot called “brilliant.”
Bekker and junior forwards Charlie Rugg and Kevin Mejia passed the ball back and forth before Bekker finally fired a 25-yard curling shot to the right side into the net.
The Crimson responded with two consecutive shots—but no goals. A header by co-captain Tim Linden was saved by Boston College junior goalkeeper Justin Luthy.
Then, seconds later, sophomore forward Connor McCarthy missed wide.
Harvard would outshoot the Eagles, 6-5, in the first half, with six different players taking shots.
But the defense could not contain Bekker, who found the back of the net again in the 41st minute.
This time, he didn’t need assistance from his teammates—his shot deflected off of a Crimson defender and into the goal.
Two goals down at halftime but confident in its first half of play, Harvard hoped to mount more pressure when it retook the field. But the Crimson came out flat, allowing Boston College to dominate possession and take 15 shots to Harvard’s nine for the match.
“From a playing standpoint, we were fairly confident that we could create more shots,” Junot said.
But the confidence did not translate to success, resulting in what the Crimson players recognized as a disappointing final 45 minutes of play.
Harvard bested the Eagles, 2-1, in corner kicks overall, and Austin Harms recorded four saves for the match, but the Crimson’s fall in quality of play ultimately prevented any hope for a second-half comeback.
“The quality definitely dropped in the second half,” said junior forward Brian Rogers, who had two shots in the second frame. “If that happens against a team like BC with that kind of talent, then they can really take it to you, and I think that’s kind of why we had the outcome that we did.”
In the end, it wasn’t Harvard’s first-half deficit that was disappointing for the team, but rather its inability to continue playing at a high level in the second half.
“In the second half, fitness got us a little bit, and I thought Boston College increased their level of play and actually had the better of the play,” Junot said.
Junot was not left searching for answers after the loss.
“If there was a primary factor that changed the game, it was fitness for us,” said Junot, who believes that health and fitness problems prevented the Crimson from maintaining its first-half play later in the game.
This is nothing new for Harvard, which hopes to build on the positives from the loss against the Eagles before it resumes Ivy League play against Brown on Saturday.
“I thought we played a good first half,” Rogers said. “But as has been our problem the whole year, we didn’t put a full 90-minute performance in.”
The game has likely reinforced a valuable lesson for the Crimson: consistent play throughout the game is crucial to the team’s success.
“This was just a momentum game,” Rogers said. “We know our season will be decided by the Ivy League [games], but we can take what we did in the first half against one of the top teams in the country, that we can go blow for blow with them.”
The game also drew attention to an issue that has plagued Harvard all season, but once solved, will allow the Crimson to enjoy the success it briefly had a glimpse of during the first half on Tuesday.
“If we can improve on our fitness, we’re good enough to stay in contention with any team in the country,” Rogers said.

For Harvard junior quarterback Colton Chapple, stepping into the spotlight has become second nature.
“I’m just helping out the team,” Chapple said. “[Senior quarterback] Collier [Winters] went down in Week 1, and I wanted to pick up right where he left off. It’s great to be able to go out there and play.”
In his first three starts of the season, Chapple has done more than just fill the role of his injured teammate, leading Harvard to three consecutive victories.
But it was Chapple’s most recent outing that permanently etched his name into the record books.
“Cornell is a defense that you have to throw over to beat,” Chapple said.
And throw he did.
Chapple completed 28 of 38 passes for 414 yards and four touchdowns in the Crimson’s 41-31 victory at Cornell on Saturday.
The performance ranks as the second-highest single-game yardage total in Harvard football history.
Chapple’s offensive onslaught shattered his previous career high of 207 yards, which he set in a home game against Brown earlier this season.
In a performance blemished only by a single interception, Chapple torched the Big Red defense, passing for more than 20 yards nine times and averaging just under 11 yards per completion.
The quarterback commanded an offensive attack that accounted for 14 of its 24 first downs through the air.
But it took about two quarters for the quarterback to get comfortable in the pocket.
“Personally, I feel like I struggled in the first half,” Chapple said. “[After that] I really just settled down, took what the defense gave me, and got the ball to our playmakers out on the edge. They made me look good.”
The signal-caller rose to the occasion after halftime, mixing several electrifying plays into his successful orchestration of the Crimson offense.
Chapple kept the entire offense involved, completing at least one pass of more than 25 yards to five different receivers and throwing all three of his second-half touchdown passes from outside the red zone.
But it was his first touchdown pass of the second half, a 42-yard strike to senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian with just over three minutes remaining in the third quarter, that ignited the Crimson offense.
“After the defense got a turnover on downs, we came out and scored that touchdown and really started to get the momentum going,” Chapple said. “That’s what helped us go on to win the game.”
Chapple found an opening in a Cornell defense that allowed just 130 yards on the ground.
“The defense was a little bit different than what we had anticipated,” Sarkisian said. “But Colton did a great job adjusting and just put the ball out there and gave me a shot to make a play. It was a great pass.”
The Crimson struck again on its next possession, as Chapple connected with sophomore tight end Cameron Brate for a 27-yard score to open the fourth quarter.
All game, Chapple was able to complete long passes down field to set the Crimson up for scoring chances.
His 41-yard completion to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch with just over six minutes remaining in the first quarter set up an 11-yard touchdown pass to senior wide-receiver Adam Chrissis just three plays later.
“Colton’s been playing great,” Lorditch said. “He’s done a great job for us. We’re sitting here at 3-1, and Colton’s a big part of the reason why.”
Chapple found Lorditch again in the fourth quarter, this time for a 29-yard pass that led to his 26-yard touchdown toss to junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk on the next play.
Chapple earned Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week honors after out-dueling Cornell sophomore quarterback Jeff Mathews, who threw for 322 yards and three touchdowns.
But for Chapple, improving the Crimson’s Ivy League record mattered most.
“Cornell is a really great team,” Chapple said. “It’s good to start the league season at 2-0.”
He didn’t know that he amassed over 400 passing yards until Harvard coach Tim Murphy told him after the game. Chapple didn’t even recognize the magnitude of his accomplishment until he looked at the previous records in the team’s media guide.
“That’s when I realized how big of a deal it was,” Chapple said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming out of the first half, the Harvard women’s soccer team had recorded only one shot on goal and had yet to convert any of its chances near the opposing Siena net.
All of that changed quickly as the Crimson (8-4-1, 2-0-1 Ivy) scored three minutes into the second half and never looked back, downing the Saints (7-5-0, 2-2 MAAC), 2-0, last night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
“They were good, they were dropping down,” said senior midfielder Hana Taiji, who scored Harvard’s first goal. “I think for us it was just a matter of finishing our chances. I think we got a lot of chances and we were in their attacking third quite a bit, we just needed to finish them.”
The first half was fairly uneventful, with Harvard controlling the possession with strong midfield play. But the Siena defense was able to thwart any chances the Crimson created with solid clears and tackles.
“That’s how it goes sometimes,” coach Ray Leone said. “We were keeping the ball, but we weren’t really getting in behind them so we were just trying to keep doing what we were doing and find an opening.”
The Crimson’s best chance before halftime was a shot by sophomore forward Elizabeth Weisman that sailed just above the crossbar after a lost goal kick from the Saints.
But Harvard remained confident entering the second half, as it tried to convert its strong play into scoreboard results.
“We weren’t scoring but we were moving and getting opportunities,” senior defender Rebecca Millock said. “We were confident we were going to come through because when you’re playing well and you have the ball you are going to score eventually.”
Taiji was able to score her first goal of the season and put the Crimson up one by deflecting a shot from freshman midfielder Mai Le. Co-captain Melanie Baskind, who originally served it in the box, also had an assist on the play.
“It was a great serve; we had a couple runners in there,” Leone said. “It hit one then another; that was a nice goal. That’s the way you want to score. It’s easier to score when a ball is served on the ground, and that was what happened, so it was great.”
“I don’t think it was the most beautiful goal, but I’m glad we got the win,” Taiji added.
After some back and forth play between the two teams, Harvard was able to score once more.  Weisman had an unassisted shot from a tight angle on the right that just sneaked under the fingertips of Siena goalkeeper Erin Kelly.
This proved to be enough to secure the victory, as the Crimson finished off the game strongly with most on the team seeing action.
“Almost everybody got in, and that was great because they all deserve to play,” Leone said.
After a tough draw against Cornell last Saturday, the Crimson was happy to come out and return to its winning ways. Midway through the regular season, Harvard is pleased with its improvement, especially with its ball possession.
“It was great to have a short term memory and move on,” Leone said.
Control of possession was impressive for the Crimson throughout, which helped it outshoot the Saints, 18-4.
“It was fun to watch,” Leone said. “It was just really enjoyable to watch them play and have fun. They just looked really relaxed and they played quick and exciting, and so it was a good night for us, one of the better ones.”
Although not recording any saves, freshman keeper Bethany Kanten picked up the shutout and her fifth win of the season with solid help from the Harvard defense.
With a strong win in its last non-conference game this fall, the team is excited for its upcoming matchup against league rival Brown this Saturday.
“What’s exciting about the Brown game is that they are having an amazing season,” Leone said. “They are [one of the top teams] in the league with their record and goals against, so they’re feeling strong too.”
“It’s going to be a great game,” he continued. “We just got to reenergize our mind and our body and start planning.”

Many a gleek with a T.V. hosts a viewing party on Tuesday nights, but if you don't happen to know any of them, or if you are looking for a larger space to watch the show with more people, then you're welcome to join the freshmen in Holoworthy basement, where students congregate to watch the musical adventures of the students at McKinley high.
Modern Family:
If you've got half-an-hour to kill on Wednesday night and feel like spending it with America's new favorite family, then head on over to Thayer basement at 9 p.m. for some laughs before writing that paper due on Thursday.
Gossip Girl:
If you're addicted to this guilty pleasure, slide into the Mather T.V. rooms on Monday night, where students are hoping to watch the lives of these Manhattan Socialites unfold on the big screen.

Some  Harvard grads shy away from dropping the H-bomb, demurely muttering  about going to school "in Boston." Others, however, have no such qualms.  For the die-hard Crimson crowd, there's a whole world of merchandise  that could let an eager shopper plaster his home in reminders of fair  Harvard.
The  Harvard Coop offers Harvard garden gnomes, sippy cups (it's never too  early to start), aprons (prerequisite for purchase: "Science and  Cooking"), and Harvard-printed ribbons for wrapping it all up.  Elsewhere, you can find a Santa ornament or a door knocker for broadcasting your Harvard pride to every passing solicitor.
 
But there's much more gear that Harvard has yet to offer. What about sunglasses or a board game? Some schools' fans can even purchase toilet seat covers.
 
If only Harvard didn't take itself so seriously.

For Harvard students looking to treat themselves to an occasional meal in the Square without putting a strain on their wallets, the Undergraduate Council may have an answer. The UC just created an initiative called UC Restaurants which offers bimonthly deals at local restaurants exclusively to Harvard students. 
 
Kicking off last Friday with a 20% off deal at Boloco, the program's leaders are in touch with a variety of restaurants in Harvard Square and say the response is positive.
 
Nicholas W. Galat '13, a Quincy House representative who is leading the project, said he was inspired to start UC Restaurants after talking to friends at other schools who get discounts at food joints just for showing their college IDs. "My hope is that this will provide a new avenue for students to branch out and explore Cambridge, while fostering positive relationships between Harvard students and the Cambridge community," Galat said.
 
Upcoming deals will be publicized in the UC's weekly email, so check your inbox when you're getting hungry.

It's that time of year again—the warm weather is giving way to colder days, and sniffles and coughs are starting to punctuate lectures. 
 
To protect students' health as winter arrives, Harvard University Health Services offers free flu shots. To get yours, just show up on the second floor of UHS on a Monday or Tuesday between 12 and 3 p.m.
 
Alternatively, you might be able to get the shot right in your dining hall. UHS nurses will be giving shots in Mather on Oct. 13, Lowell on Oct. 17, and Leverett on Oct. 19 from 5 to 8 p.m. each night.
 
If you do get sick, you can take advantage of free get-well supplies that are available to Harvard students. Just show your ID in the pharmacy in the Holyoke Center to claim a free cold kit. The pack, which students can get once every semester, contains items such as a thermometer, cough drops, antihistamines, and painkillers.
 
Whether you are used to warmer climes or well acquainted with frigid Massachusetts winters, taking a few precautions can help ensure that your health—unlike the warm temperatures—will be here to stay.

Senate Candidate and Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren has been enshrined in one of the most prestigious Halls of Fame that Harvard Square has to offer: the menu at Mr. Bartley's Gourmet Burgers. Warren now has a burger of her own, based on the recent stir caused when one of her Republican opponents, Scott Brown, said he was glad she didn't "take her clothes off" to pay her way through school (as he did at one time). 
 
According to General Manager Billy Bartley, who describes himself as "a big fan" of the HLS professor, the Elizabeth Warren burger is "fully dressed—thank God!"
 
"There's a lot there," Bartley added. "Our burger has more substance than Warren herself." The burger is topped with red peppers, onions, feta cheese, and Dijon mustard. 
 
"The thought of her taking her clothes off made me throw up a little in my mouth," Bartley said. Hopefully reactions to the new burger will be much more appetizing.
