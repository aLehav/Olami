After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has an identity crisis. Allegedly, it is a liberal arts college, but it has totally forgotten what that means. Instead of seeking to provide a humanistic education undergirded by strong curricular requirements, Harvard just wants us to take classes in topics outside of our concentration, and doesn’t particularly care what those are. Harvard provides a liberal arts education for its marketing appeal without the burden of actually believing in the pillars of that education.
The extent of the liberal arts curriculum which remains at Harvard is entirely vestigial, such as the General Education program, distribution requirements, and the language requirement. When a limb exists without its body, it seizes to have any utility. The language requirement is unsure of its own goal, and whatever end it may have it surely does not reach.
The language requirement developed from the original mandatory study of Greek and Latin. One hardly ever sees a justification of these languages, instead hearing that we should learn Latin so we can learn something else.
Of course, the point of studying a language is to be able to read the literature in that language. Implicit in its requirements, Harvard once believed that it is important to read Horace and Homer. Harvard averred that there are certain works with which any cultured and educated person should be familiar because they are great. Now, Harvard tells us “The College affirms that the learning of a language other than English is an essential component of a liberal art and sciences education.” It is not clear how two semesters of a language achieves this, nor what it has to do with a liberal arts education. Harvard seemingly just wants us to gain some sort of exposure without ensuring that we actually know a language.
There is no use studying a language but not understanding it. The language requirement is incomplete. It is like picking up a cup of water, putting it up to your mouth, and then putting the cup right back down before you are able to drink anything.
Harvard hurts itself further by making exceptions to the language requirement. It would seem that if the biggest fault of the language requirement is that two semesters of a language don’t accomplish anything, then the greatest resource the College could have are people who are well versed enough in a language to actually explore it deeply. Scoring 700 on the SAT II in Spanish means one has a pretty good grasp of grammar and vocabulary, but it certainly doesn’t mean one has engaged with Borges or Cervantes. Students are done a disservice when they complete their high school language regime and then wipe their hands and forget that the subjunctive exists. Harvard ought to push students to be able to do something with the skills they came in with.
Harvard created its own problem. A language requirement would be a lot simpler if students were required to come into the College with a solid grasp of a language. Then, Harvard would know that whoever enrolls will only require two or four semesters, whatever language it may be, until she has not only the exposure to a language, but skill. Obviously, the problem is that Harvard cannot count on high schools to actually teach their students a language.
Harvard ruined high school language education, not vice versa. Former University President Charles Eliot set Harvard on this downward path when he got rid of the pre-enrollment requirement of study of Greek and Latin. Schools no longer had the pressure to educate their students, because Harvard and the other elite schools no longer cared. Harvard recommends four years of foreign language study in high school, but schools do not have to actually teach the language because students do not need to demonstrate knowledge to Harvard in order to gain acceptance.
Students could delve so much deeper into the greatest works of literature if Harvard made the language requirement a strong one. Ultimately, this suggestion may be outdated. It accepts the premise promulgated by Harvard that it is a liberal arts school, or at least requires a liberal arts education. Observationally, that is false.
Harvard should embrace an identity one way or another. If it is to offer a liberal arts education, offer one properly. If it mostly cares about students excelling in their specialties, then stop distracting them with other requirements.
The language requirement can go in two directions, but it cannot stay where it is. Either Harvard has to give it the power it needs to fulfill its purpose, or Harvard needs to get rid of it altogether. Honesty is the best policy. When we take it upon ourselves to do something and commit ourselves to an ideal, we ought to strive to achieve that. If there is a previous philosophy which has now gone out of fashion, we either ought to defend it relentlessly, or throw it to the wayside. Pretending to care about it but only offering it negligence is useless and disrespectful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether you eagerly open every campaign email or steer clear of them altogether, the Undergraduate Council's Presidential election marks a critical time for all of us. Despite the perennial claims that the UC is ineffective or inefficient — claims which are often leveled at local and federal government alike — we believe in the importance of student government and the voices it uplifts. Moreover, the habits we build now, as future leaders in government, business, law, medicine, public service, and academia, will shape how we understand and value the sanctity of elections and democratic processes. We must all vote in the UC Presidential election to not only elect leadership that represents all of us but also, perhaps, more importantly, establish habits and a mindset of civic engagement that we will carry forward into our post-grad futures.
Though our time at Harvard is limited, as undergraduates we have the power to enact sweeping change in an otherwise slow-moving institution. To do so is not an easy task and without our community's trust and active participation, the Undergraduate Council cannot progress toward a collective vision of the campus and society we deserve.
One of the most critical roles of the Undergraduate Council is to elevate the student voice in rooms full of deans and administrators, many of whom cannot fully grasp the challenges of the student experience. Whether it's funding over 200 recognized student organizations, advocating for inclusive social spaces, or supporting first-generation and low-income students, the UC is constantly working to adapt to the changing needs and interests of the student body. As recently as 40 years ago, faculty and administration members "represented" the students, making decisions and allocating funding on their behalf. For reasons we hope that all can understand, we believe that students are best suited to serve students — not administrators.
And we’ve seen what the UC can accomplish. Without the UC's advocacy, fall semester exams would fall after winter break. Undergraduates might not have experienced Shopping Week past fall 2018. None of us would have the Smith Campus Center to study and gather in. During the virtual year, Harvard extended the pass-fail deadline following pressure from the UC. YardFest wouldn’t exist. However, the UC is only as strong as the people who invest in it. That posits an equal amount of responsibility in every student: from voter to elected leader. We must all do our part and vote.
We often hear that our Harvard education is intended to prepare us for the "real world," implying that our experiences here are not real. However, we are living in the real world. The issues we tackle in classrooms, in social spaces, in student organizations here at Harvard are issues that occupy conversations at a societal level. We will contend with these issues throughout our lives.
The UC recently celebrated its 40th anniversary, and at this moment of reflection, we can look at the problems that we’ve tackled in the past and the problems of our future. Whether it be pushing for a freshmen social space, facilitating discussions about inclusive visual culture and renaming, analyzing comp processes and blocking, or easing barriers to accessing academic, health, or student life resources for low-income students, the UC continues to work for the student body. At the core of these advocacy efforts lie issues of inequity, injustice, and exclusivity — tied to long histories of oppression. For the past 40 years, the UC has pushed for more equitable, just, and inclusive processes across every facet of the student experience.
We see in the discussion surrounding the UC's Presidential election a reflection of a larger, national conversation about the legitimacy of democratic processes. We would do a great injustice to de-value the importance of our elections and the subsequent representation of student voices. How we choose to engage in our communities, whether or not we vote, and who we vote to represent us shape our collective futures. By investing in our fellow students and instilling value in free and fair elections, we are building the habits we will need to strive for a "more just, fair, and promising world."
We must value our right to carefully choose leaders who we trust and who care about our community. The UC Presidential election ends this week, and candidates are vying for your vote. Regardless of who you support, you should participate because, regardless of size, elections have consequences. It has been an honor to serve as your President and Vice President, and we hope you’ll join us one last time in Building Tomorrow’s Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long dry spell, Sex Week is back. Once Puritan stomping grounds, this week, Sever and Emerson Hall have been dominated by sexual education leaders, advocates, and surveyors. Led by Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, Sex Week has begun with a bang. Penetrant topics — that is, those that go beyond surface-level abstinence and safety — pervade sex week. SHEATH has organized a week to learn about pleasure, sex, and how to enjoy both safely and creatively, breaking down deep rooted, no-fun taboos.
Sex Week’s impact on campus dialogue is undeniable. Scores of our peers altered their already-packed schedules to participate in at least some of its events, with attendance reaching 360 students for the three events hosted last Monday. Sex Week owes its success (as well as the ensuing dialogue) to the flawless execution and preparedness of the organizing group. The lighthearted, causal framing of the events is undeniably helpful. With names ranging from “A+ Students, F Boys: A Student Panel on Dating and Hookups in College” and “What What, In the Butt?: Anal Sex 101,” last week’s activites openly poked fun at the sometimes thorny, scary, or hush-hush parts of our romantic and sexual endeavors, encouraging students to be have fun and be vulnerable. Organizers’ choices actively challenge the notion that sex education must be tied to the outdated pseudo-moral principles, simply be a crash course in pregnancy avoidance, or preach reductive, anti-carnal doctrines.
As a board, we’ll gladly take free condoms and sex toys over unhelpful moralizing; many of our peers, it seems, will too! We’re happy to see Sex Week return to campus, particularly in such strong shape, and thank the students, particularly SHEATH co-presidents Karina A. Pimenta ’22 and Andie E. Turner ’20-’22, who made it possible.
Through its Sex Week programming, SHEATH is helping us over the hump of shame and insecurity that prevents many young people (and honestly, people of all ages) from tackling giggle-inducing taboos. The organizers have managed to destigmatize serious conversations about sex in novel ways, even by simple virtue of holding events inside stuffy Harvard classrooms, where the intellectual backdrop helps break awkward silences. Blurring the line between Harvard as a virtuous, academic campus and Harvard as a home to (inevitably horny) young adults with sexual desires is radically refreshing. It is a mindset that is sex-positive beyond the scope of simply practicing safe sex protocols; a practical implementation of the abstract belief that desire isn’t inherently dirty (in a bad way, anyway).
Sex Week’s success is particularly gratifying given the dire state of sexual education across the country. Roughly half of school districts across the country require no sexual education at all; those that do too often offer lackluster programs. SHEATH is paving the way for the smarter sexual discussions that we need: those that go beyond the run-of-the-mill lecture a middle school P.E. coach might deliver. Through discussions like “My-dentity: BGLTQ Intimacy,” “Race and Relationships: A Student Panel,” and “Won’t Stop Nothing But a Sentence: Period Talk w/ Flex,” SHEATH includes conversations beyond the conventional and, quite frankly, beyond the tired default heterosexual, male, and often white perspective. This programming undermines the unspoken cultural assumption that just heterosexual men are at the forefront of sexual insight and pleasure.
Yet the fun atmosphere Sex Week projects should not be taken as a free pass to behave any which way at its events. Students have a responsibility to respect the event, as a general courtesy to both its organizers and the peers who benefit from it. That includes picking up after ourselves following each event, no matter how spicy its content, and respecting guest speakers and moderators. It also includes respecting gift policies — take the free vibrator, but please don’t steal one for your friend!
Ultimately, SHEATH has exposed our community's naked desire to further explore the bounds of sex and sexuality. The week’s focus on enjoying sex, rather than just being “educated” on it, is pretty revolutionary. We hope the dialogue sparked continues beyond Sex Week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several current and former Harvard professors are helping establish the University of Austin, a private liberal arts school in Texas launched in response to what some of its founders see as a culture of censorship within higher education.
Former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers, Kennedy School professor Arthur C. Brooks, Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker and former Economics Professor Glenn C. Loury, who currently teaches at Brown University, serve on the University of Austin’s board of advisors, according to its website.
Former St. John’s College president Panayiotis “Pano” Kanelos, who helped found the University of Austin and serves as its first president, wrote in an online article announcing the new school that “higher education might be the most fractured institution” in America.
“The reality is that many universities no longer have an incentive to create an environment where intellectual dissent is protected and fashionable opinions are scrutinized,” Kanelos wrote.
“We are done waiting for the legacy universities to right themselves. And so we are building anew,” he added.
In an interview with The Crimson, Pinker lauded the effort, saying “it’s good to have some alternative models for higher education.”
“Too many of the country’s universities are stuck in the same rut, and that rut includes exorbitant tuition, a mushrooming bureaucracy, a bizarre set of admissions criteria, and increasing political homogeneity, including repression of speech and ideas,” Pinker said.
“All institutions profit when there’s competition. Otherwise, they get complacent,” Pinker said.
According to its website, the University of Austin will not consider race, gender, class, or “or any other form of identity” in admission decisions because it “stands firmly against that sort of discrimination.”
In his announcement, Kanelos charged that prestigious universities operate as a “finishing school for the national and global elite.”
“Harvard proclaims: Veritas,” Kanelos wrote. “These are soaring words. But in these top schools, and in so many others, can we actually claim that the pursuit of truth—once the central purpose of a university—remains the highest virtue?”
Brooks, however, said he is confident in Harvard's commitment to scholarly truth.
“I definitely think Harvard is fulfilling our mission of Veritas, and am very optimistic about our future,” Brooks wrote in an emailed statement. “I love teaching here because of the students and faculty, and consider it a privilege to be able to help other organizations seeking truth in different and interesting ways.”
Brooks wrote he does not plan to teach at the University of Austin “or have any fiduciary relationship.” Rather, he will counsel “primarily on fundraising” for the new institution.
“I think the role of start-ups in higher ed is entirely complementary to places like Harvard,” Brooks wrote. “We should welcome this and many other kinds of experiments.”
The FAQ on the school’s site says it will be located in Austin because “if it's good enough for Elon Musk and Joe Rogan, it's good enough for us.”
Earlier this year, a handful of Harvard affiliated faculty — including Pinker — helped found a separate nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to defend academics’ freedom of expression by issuing statements, offering legal assistance, or providing financial support.
The University of Austin will offer its first course this upcoming summer, a program for college students called “Forbidden Courses,” which will aim to discuss the “most provocative questions that often lead to censorship or self-censorship in many universities.”
In a February meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard must guarantee academic freedom and free speech for all of its affiliates, including by inviting speakers of all backgrounds and perspectives to campus.
“The defense of free and honest inquiry in the unfettered pursuit of truth is our shared responsibility—and among our most sacred commitments,” Bacow said.
The University of Austin has not yet received accreditation and does not plan to offer undergraduate degrees until 2024.

Raquel Coronell Uribe ’23 will lead The Harvard Crimson’s 149th Guard, becoming the paper’s first Latinx president in its 148-year history, the organization announced Sunday.
Coronell, a History and Literature concentrator hailing from Miami, currently covers the Police Accountability beat and serves as a social media manager for The Crimson, as well as an editor for its daily email newsletters. As a reporter, she has chronicled the search for and arrival of a new University police chief, as well as the department’s efforts to reform after a tumultuous year in 2020.
A resident of Dunster House, Coronell also currently heads The Crimson’s internal Latinx affinity group, an initiative launched by its Diversity and Inclusivity committee. She will begin her term as president on Jan. 1, 2022.
“The 149th Guard is an incredibly impressive group of leaders who are more than ready and qualified to tackle the challenges The Crimson will face in the coming year,” Crimson President Amanda Y. Su ’22 said of the new guard. “With our staff finally back home in our building on 14 Plympton Street, I’m excited to see where the next President, Managing Editor, and Business Manager take the organization in 2022.”
News and sports reporter Jasper G. Goodman ’23 will lead the paper’s coverage as its Managing Editor in 2022, directing The Crimson’s daily newspaper, magazine, arts, and sports sections, as well as its blog.
Goodman, a Government concentrator from Waterbury Center, Vt., currently covers Harvard’s Central Administration and trains incoming sports writers. In April, he uncovered that concerns over the governance, performance, and leadership of Harvard’s revered Institute of Politics had led to the departure of many of its leaders. He also covers the men’s ice hockey beat for the sports section.
Goodman, a Quincy House resident, also serves on The Crimson’s Diversity and Inclusivity committee and edits daily email newsletters.
Cabot House resident Amy X. Zhou ’23, a Computer Science and Government joint concentrator and native of Fishkill, N.Y., will serve as The Crimson’s next Business Manager after completing a year leading its Marketing department. In that role, she worked to institutionalize the paper’s guidelines around sponsored content, a major area of growth for the business. She also worked to expand the use of analytics to improve product strategy.
Founded in 1873, The Crimson is the student newspaper of Harvard University. It is the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper in the United States and the only breakfast-table daily in Cambridge. The paper is proud to provide news and analysis to a wide range of Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and readers across the nation.
The Crimson selects its leaders through an election called the Turkey Shoot, a process in which all outgoing members of the masthead may participate. A candidate for a senior leadership position must receive at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected.
Joining Coronell, Goodman, and Zhou on the masthead are:

The Harvard University Native American Program hosted a walking tour Thursday to show sites on campus connected to the history of indigenous people at Harvard as part of its observation of Native American Heritage Month.
Jason A. Packineau, HUNAP’s interim executive director, led the walking tour, which brought attendees to locations around campus, including Annenberg Hall and the Peabody Museum.
Packineau, who is an enrolled citizen of the Three Affiliated Tribes — the Mandan, the Hidatsa, and the Arikara — of North Dakota, and who is also from the Pueblo of Jemez and the Pueblo of Laguna, will be leading a second tour on Monday open to all University affiliate.
The tour began at Annenberg Hall, where attendees learned the story of Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, whose portrait hangs on one of the walls. Cheeshahteaumuck, who was Wampanaug, was the first Native American student to graduate from Harvard College in 1665.
The tour also stopped at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Earlier this year, the Association on American Indian Affairs accused the museum of violating the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act for failing to properly consult tribes about affiliated human remains and funerary objects.
During the tour, Packineau discussed the Harvard Indian College, which was established in 1655 to educate Native Americans but closed by the end of the 17th century. Packineau brought tour attendees to a dig site in the yard near Matthews Hall, where students in the class Anthropology 1130: "Archaeology of Harvard Yard” were digging for artifacts to gain insight into the lives of students in the Indian College.
In an interview after the tour, Packineau said he hopes that attendees come away from the tour with a deeper understanding of Indigenous history.
Originally, HUNAP planned for the tour to be open only to Native American students attending Harvard. Packineau said the program decided to open it to more people so as many people as possible could learn about Indigenous histories.
“It was really important to invite anybody affiliated with Harvard to come on out,” Pakineau said. “If we just keep talking to ourselves, then it just becomes an echochamber, and people don't learn about the important parts of Harvard's history.”
Other locations on the tour included Wadsworth House, where four enslaved people lived during the 1700s; a pennant for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Clover Food Lab’s Harvard Square location; and Houghton Library, which is currently hosting an exhibit on animal anthropomorphism that includes Indigenous works.
Lindsey B. Hightower ’23, an intern for HUNAP who accompanied Packineau on the tour, said the tour showed how “interconnected” Harvard’s history is with Indigenous history.
Packineau said he is “really surprised” by how many affiliates do not know much about Harvard’s Indigenous history. He added that he hopes to lead more tours in the future.
“It seems kind of weird to have this tour, when there are so many other tours that go on on campus. But a lot of those tours, I don’t think can really get into the depth of Harvard’s history with Indigenous people as much as this tour can, because they have to cover so much other history,” Packineau said. “So as long as the interest is there, it’s something that we’ll continue to do.”

After some internal contention over its latest tentative agreement, Harvard’s clerical and technical workers union voted to ratify the new one-year contract Wednesday, securing raises, lump-sum bonuses, tax relief on certain Harvard classes, retroactive sick days, and new diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments.
The contract was ratified by 81 percent of voting members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the largest union on campus, which represents more than 5,000 workers. Seventy-one percent of eligible voters cast a ballot. The ratification vote ran from Monday to Wednesday on the secure online election software ElectionBuddy, marking the union’s first online election.
“We’re very happy with the results and with the excellent HUCTW voter turnout,” Carrie E. Barbash, the union’s president, wrote in an emailed statement. “We are very grateful for the support of our members, and the support of our sisters and brothers in the other campus unions.”
HUCTW contracts typically last three years, but the newly ratified agreement will expire Oct. 1, 2022.
The percentage of votes in favor — 81 percent — is the lowest among recent HUCTW ratification votes: 94 percent of participating members approved the 2018 contract, 98 percent of voters approved the 2016 contract, and approximately 97 percent approved the 2013 contract.
This contract’s voter turnout — 71 percent — was approximately 20 percentage points higher than recent years. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, voter turnout was roughly 50 percent.
The one-year agreement includes a 2.9 percent raise and a $500 bonus for members who have worked at Harvard for at least 12 months. Ahead of voting, some union members raised concerns that the 2.9 percent raise would not be enough, urging others to vote “no” on the agreement.
Desiree A. Goodwin, a Widener Library assistant, said Thursday she was “disappointed” with the new contract because the union “missed an opportunity” to push for a larger raise.
“What’s the purpose of having the union in that case, if you’re just going to say, ‘We’ll take whatever they offer us,’” she said.
Goodwin added the lower percentage of “yes” votes demonstrates that more workers “are getting frustrated” with union leadership.
“I think they need to engage the membership more,” she said. “There’s a lack of transparency in the negotiating process in our union especially. We’re not allowed to observe the negotiations. They don’t meet with us regularly, to rally us and speak to us and ask us to join in.”
In an emailed statement last week, Barbash wrote that having “some level of confidentiality” in negotiations with the University allows both sides to have more honesty and creativity in developing mutually beneficial policies. Union leaders have encouraged members to reach out with concerns throughout the process, she added.
“During this round of talks, we had hundreds of lunchtime meetings with members throughout the negotiations process, where we talked frankly about what was going on at the negotiating table, in addition to our more formal written communications,” Barbash wrote.
The contract also includes a new tax assistance fund for HUCTW members taking job-related graduate courses at Harvard, as well as five additional retroactive sick days for members to use to receive pay for Covid-related absences from April 2020 to the end of May 2021. The agreement will also increase funding for joint union-University assistance programs covering child care, education, and transportation by 2.75 percent.
As for non-economic proposals, the contract includes a new Harvard-HUCTW committee on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging and more equitable contract language.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week away from the Harvard-Yale Game, College students said they are juggling a whirlwind of logistics — transportation, housing, and tickets — to adapt to coronavirus-related restrictions surrounding the Game.
In October, the College informed Harvard students that Yale will not provide housing accommodations as it did in previous years due to ongoing Covid concerns. Instead, the College urged undergrads to arrive and leave on Nov. 20, the day of The Game.
Despite the College’s suggestion, some students said they are still planning to stay in New Haven overnight, opting to spend the night in a friend’s dorm, an Airbnb, or a hotel.
Hannah M. Miller ’22 said she is “lucky” her plans were not affected by the restrictions.
“I'm very lucky that they were not affected and that I was able to secure a bus ride there and back, and my friends and I are staying together — not on Yale's campus, given that not all of us have friends at Yale,” Miller said.
Palis “Fresh” Pisuttisarun ’24 said he is planning to stay with a friend in New Haven, but added that he wishes Yale was offering traditional “sister housing,” which allowed Harvard students to stay in an assigned Yale residential college the night before the Game.
“I would have loved to go through their more systematic process, so I can actually meet new people — like new friends and stuff,” he said. “[My plan] was not majorly affected, but I imagine there's some people who don't have those connections or friends, so it might be affecting them.”
Other students said they will forgo taking Harvard transportation to the Game due to the limited shuttle schedule.
William C. Leonard ’24 said he and his friends have decided to drive to Yale, since Harvard is only offering a Saturday shuttle to-and-from New Haven and one of his roommates owns a car.
Despite the changes in protocol, students said they are still excited to attend the Game.
“I think that this will be just as fun as previous Harvard-Yales, and I'm glad that the schools are still having the game and tailgate,” Miller said.
Adrian E. Guzman ’25 said he has never been to Yale before and is looking forward to experiencing the “sports atmosphere.”
“I'm excited for the atmosphere. We haven’t really had that sports atmosphere here at Harvard, so I'm really excited just to be part of a group, just to be normal people supporting some football team,” Guzman said.
For Sidharth K. Menon ’22, the atmosphere at the game and tailgate are also a major draw.
“I think there's some moments in the tailgate before the game where you just are milling around and seeing a bunch of people who are super close to you and you haven't seen in a long time,” Menon said. “It’s a really special atmosphere that I'm really looking forward to about my senior year.”
Leonard added that he is optimistic about Harvard’s chances at clenching a victory.
“Our football team I think is pretty good this year, so maybe we’ll win!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics announced a new initiative Tuesday that will invite select young people with experience in politics and public service to visit Harvard in February 2022 to participate in politically-oriented programming.
The program, called Emerging Leaders, is open to people 14 to 25 within and beyond Harvard. The emerging leaders will also have the opportunity to engage with Harvard faculty, staff, and students about their work.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in an emailed statement that the Emerging Leaders program “honors the mission of the IOP to inspire Harvard students to public service and politics.”
“Emerging leaders will have the chance to listen and learn from our students, faculty and staff. And, in turn, we will also learn from them as new leaders who are making a difference across the country,” Gearan said.
IOP Vice President Kevin L. Ballen ’22 said March for Our Lives student organizers visiting the IOP in 2018 after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting partially inspired the new program. During that visit, five activists and survivors of the shooting spoke at a JFK Jr. Forum panel entitled “#NEVERAGAIN: How Parkland Students are Changing the Conversation on Guns.”
“We had them at the JFK Jr. Forum, we had them meet various leaders across the Harvard community, and it was this really meaningful opportunity for the students to get the mentorship and access to Harvard resources, and also for our students to learn from these incredible young activists,” Ballen said.
Ballen said this visit inspired the IOP to engage more with non-Harvard students who are engaged in politics, as well as students who have not yet had the same opportunities for civic engagement. The bulk of the IOP’s programming, including its 16 student organizations, is geared toward Harvard undergraduates.
On Thursday evening, the IOP hosted Aidan Kohn-Murphy, a high school student, TikTok personality, and the founder and executive director of the organizing group Gen-Z for Change.
“We provide really great resources for Harvard students, undergraduates, and the entire community, but how do we expand our resources for young people across the country that are involved in this space? And how do we become that political home for young people beyond Harvard's gates?” Ballen said.
In an email announcing the program, the IOP encouraged Harvard affiliates to nominate emerging young leaders from their hometowns to join the inaugural class of honorees, as well as to join the selection committee for the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man who “appeared to be under the influence” drove a pick-up truck into Harvard Yard Wednesday night, nearly striking several students before crashing into the edge of Lamont Library, according to Harvard police spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
Brianna C. Turner ’23 said she was walking by Widener Library in a rush to get to a meeting at roughly 9 p.m. when she heard screams in front of her.
“There were headlights coming toward me, quickly,” Turner said. “So I ran up into the grassy area right next to Widener and this green truck drove past me.”
Though she was physically unharmed, Turner said she was “rattled" by the event.
Alexandria R. King ’24 said she was walking along Massachusetts Ave. when she heard a loud clang from across the street. King recalled seeing a truck in the Yard.
“I was like, ‘well, that's weird, cars aren't supposed to be over there,’” she said.
King said she walked into the Yard to assess the situation and noticed that a bollard by one of the gates in the Yard had been “ripped out of the ground."
“Within a minute, [Harvard University Police Department] pulls up, and you can see the truck in the corner over where Lamont and Wigglesworth meet, there's just an empty truck,” King said.
King said she saw a HUPD officer run up the Lamont steps, chasing the driver who fled the vehicle.
Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that multiple HUPD officers responded to the scene after receiving calls at around 9:10 p.m.
“Upon arrival, officers discovered a pickup truck with its door open. Several witnesses directed officers towards an unidentified male fleeing the scene,” Catalano wrote. “Officers pursued the individual, eventually stopping him to conduct a field stop.”
The driver, who is unaffiliated with Harvard, was arrested for trespassing and “several motor vehicle driving offenses," Catalano added. He will be arraigned Friday.
Both Turner and King said they felt anxiety that the event could be related to bomb threats reported last week at fellow Ivy League institutions, such as Yale, Brown, Columbia, and Cornell. Multiple buildings at all four schools were evacuated, and the campuses ultimately found the threats unsubstantiated.
“When the guy opened his car door and started to get out was when I started to run,” Turner said. “I didn't know it was a drunk driver. Now I know that, but I didn't know if it was going to be an active shooter or somebody else, so once I sensed that everyone around me was okay, it was time for me to get out of that area.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the University and HUPD are continuing to “monitor the situation” regarding bomb threats at other schools.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System recently came under scrutiny following state legislators’ proposal to eliminate the test as a graduation requirement for high school students.
In a series of interviews, experts in public policy and psychometry — the psychological study of educational measures — at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, as well as the president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, explained why they believe less emphasis should be placed on diagnostic tests.
Paul Reville, a professor of education policy and administration at HGSE, explained that current concerns around the MCAS exams are due to its “high-stakes” nature.
“I think most of the controversy around MCAS centers around whether or not there ought to be stakes attached to it. Now generally, psychometricians agree that it's improper — inappropriate — to attach high stakes to any single test,” Reville said.
HGSE professor of education Andrew D. Ho — who holds a seat on the Technical Advisory Committee for the MCAS — said that speaking solely from his capacity as a professor, the way exams are used, rather than their content, is what determines whether they are “good” or “bad.”
“You can always take what is a ‘good test used for good purposes’, and then immediately make it bad by trying to put very high stakes on it, for example, without adequate evidence to support that use,” Ho said.
In addition to issues with the stakes involved, Massachusetts Teachers Association President Merrie Najimy said that focusing exclusively on diagnostic testing takes away from the ability to examine other issues schools and students face — particularly those in districts with higher populations of color.
“Schools in communities of color don't have the same resources,” Najimy explained. “They have fewer teachers, so they have higher class sizes. They don't have full time librarians or nurses in the schools.”
“And yet, MCAS has become the single measure of student performance, rather than looking at what are the resources students need to succeed,” she added.
Ho said he advocates for a model in which testing shifts away from “individual high stakes” and toward a system that works on improving issues of educational inequity.
“We need to shift [testing] to the monitoring quadrant, away from individual high stakes and unattainably high goals, to a monitoring system that allocates support where it is most necessary and deserved,” Ho said.
Najimy called for assessments that do not only measure student performance, but address issues impeding healthy school environments.
“We should certainly measure student performance, but we need to start measuring the quality of schools,” Najimy said. “So those are things like, ‘What are the building conditions? Are the ventilation systems in full repair so they can control mold and airborne diseases, like the flu and like Covid?’”
Najimy also said curricula should be revisted.
“We absolutely have to start to evaluate the curriculum. Does our curriculum represent the multiple identities that our students possess? And is it a curriculum that reflects the rich cultures and the assets that they bring to school?” Najimy said.
Reville said he believes attempts to tackle issues of inequity in Massachusetts schools and beyond have generally been ineffective.
“We haven't been very effective at the federal, state, or even local level in turning around pockets of chronic underperformance, and that's where we need to strengthen our investments and build our capacity, and do much better than we've done,” Reville said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 12, 2021 at 8:50 p.m.
With the voting period underway for the Undergraduate Council election, five of the six presidential candidates gathered in Boylston Hall for a debate hosted by the UC Election Commission to advocate for their respective campaigns and field questions about their platforms from College students.
For an hour, the candidates — Michael Y. Cheng ’22, Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, Neil F. Katzman ’24, Kanishka J. Reddy ’24, and Esther J. Xiang ’23 — responded to questions ranging from their stances on social and academic life on campus to the effectiveness of the UC.
Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23, the sixth candidate running for president, decided to not attend the debate.
The debate, which was moderated by UC Crimson Yard Representative Owen Ebose '25 and UC Election Commissioner Alex Guh-Siesel '25, took place hours after a tumultuous start to the voting period. Though voting began at noon on Thursday, the Election Commission had to nullify all votes cast before 5:30 p.m. due to a technical error that occurred when voters tried to cast their ballot for Cheng’s campaign.
Katzman began the event by criticizing the UC in his opening statement.
“I’m Neil from New Mexico, and I’m tired,” he said. “I’m tired of the lying and the backstabbing that has occurred. I’m tired of people treating the UC more importantly than Capitol Hill. I’m tired of all this nonsense.”
Ebose asked each candidate how they would support students as they continue to transition back to life on campus amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Brennan said he believes the first step is recognizing the “extremely disparate” off-campus student experiences during the remote school year.
“I think the first step is realizing that things are not back to normal and that we suffered extremely disparate experiences while we were off campus,” Brennan said. “That means that returning to a full expectation of what students can do on campus is not acceptable.”
Some of the candidates reflected on how their upbringings influenced their policy plans and their decision to enter the race.
Xiang spoke about her experience as a first-generation, low-income student entering Harvard.
“I knew that it was going to be so different, and it was really scary feeling helpless, feeling unseen, feeling unheard and not knowing how to navigate this space,” Xiang said. “We want to make sure that all resources are accessible on this campus and that people do feel like they belong.”
“We want to be able to expand FYRE, the pre-orientation for FGLI students,” she said. “And creating a safety net program to give to students who experience any kind of emergency or financial hardship."
During the debate, Cheng challenged Harvard administrators to further invest directly in students.
Cheng said that Harvard’s multi-billion dollar endowment increase could allow the school to “extend the FGLI bridge program, for hot breakfast, inclusion, and paying grad workers.”
“When Dartmouth’s endowment increased by $3 billion, they gave everyone a $1,000 bonus,” Cheng added. Dartmouth reported a $2.52 billion endowment increase during the 2021 fiscal year.
Later in the debate, candidates put forward different ways to promote wellness and inclusion for all students.
Reddy explained that his “Pol.is” platform – a tech software where users proffer ideas that others can vote on until a consensus is reached — will promote “direct democracy” to address student concerns about wellness and inclusion.
“I think the best way to listen to people is through direct democracy,” Reddy said. “With the Pol.is platform, you can also add to the conversation. You can add to the ideas that are being voted on and have other people vote on this too, so we think that's the best way to listen.”
Guh-Siesel ended the debate by inviting candidates to compliment a member of an opposing ticket.
Of all the candidates, Cheng received the most praise.
CORRECTION: November 12, 2021
A previous version of this article misidentified the moderators of the debate. The debate was moderated by UC Crimson Yard Representative Owen Ebose '25 and UC Election Commissioner Alex Guh-Siesel '25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the eve of voting, the Harvard Undergraduate Council’s Election Commission reinstated a UC presidential ticket it had disbanded just days before for early campaigning and violating the spirit of the election.
The Commission reinstated the ticket of Esther J. Xiang ’23 for UC president and David Y. Zhang ’23 for vice president late Tuesday night after the Dean of Students Office intervened in the situation. Amid the controversy, the Commission delayed the start of the campaign period from Monday to Wednesday, and pushed the opening of voting from Wednesday to Thursday.
The initial complaint against the ticket was made by UC Parliamentarian and Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24 on Nov. 1.
Taylor said in an interview that he felt it was “necessary” to file a complaint after he became aware of “significant” rules violations by Xiang and Zhang that “imperiled the ability of the UC to have a free and fair presidential election.”
“Esther and David have violated rules around early campaigning, early team-building, and ethical conduct. They have also seriously undermined the spirit of the election,” Taylor wrote in his letter of complaint to the Election Commission, a redacted version of which he provided to The Crimson.
The letter includes accounts from freshmen on the Council, fellow presidential ticket Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 and Joy Y. Lin ’23, previous Election Commission chair Desiree A. Rickett ’24, and two prospective running mates of presidential candidate Nicholas J. Brennan ’23. The allegations include that Xiang and Zhang campaigned early, manipulated freshmen with false information, and intimidated Brennan’s prospective running mates.
The Election Commission reviewed the evidence presented in the complaint over several meetings and decided to disband the ticket Nov. 4, the Commission wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday.
“The initial evidence provided to us revealed that the ticket had broken rules surrounding early campaigning. Specifically, rules 4.1 & 4.8. The Commission elected to remedy the issue via section 8.7 of the rules,” the Commission wrote.
Sections 4.1 and 4.8 of the UC election rules state that candidates cannot begin campaigning until 30 days before the start of the election. Section 8.7 allows the Election Commission to dissolve campaigns that have “committed serious rules violation prior to the beginning of the preparation period.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Xiang and Zhang denied the allegations of intimidation, and said the early campaigning violations stemmed from a new rule that the Commision should not have applied retroactively.
After Xiang and Zhang appealed, the Commission affirmed its decision to dissolve their ticket, but allowed the candidates to run on separate ballots, per the Commission’s statement to The Crimson. Xiang then launched a campaign with LyLena D. Estabine ’24, while Zhang decided not to participate in the election.
In the meantime, Xiang and Zhang also reached out to the Dean of Students Office, claiming that their ticket was unfairly disbanded.
“We reached out to the DSO because we felt that the appeal process was unfair. Given that we were dissolved based on evidence [the Election Commission] didn’t share with us, we could not have possibly defended ourselves,” Xiang and Zhang wrote in an emailed statement Thursday.
The pair met with the DSO, and the DSO then communicated with the Election Commission, according to Xiang and Zhang.
“DSO and the Election Commission agreed the process was unfair and agreed to do it again, this time using only relevant evidence,” they wrote. “By relevant, they meant ‘evidence directly related to the election process’ and they removed anything that was merely a personal attack.”
Following the exchange with the DSO, the Commission pushed back the campaign and the voting period as it reconsidered the decision. The Commission ultimately voted to reinstate Xiang and Zhang’s ticket.
Election Commission chair Camryn D. Jones ’22 wrote in an email that “in no way did the DSO force our hand in the decision to reinstate the ticket,” and instead provided “clarification” about the types of issues the Commission is permitted to rule on.
The DSO informed the Commission it could only rule on campaign violations, not allegations regarding the spirit of the election, because the latter are assessments of character or subjects of rumors, according to a person with direct knowledge whom The Crimson granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations.
Several UC members expressed concerns about the DSO’s involvement in the decision to reinstate the ticket.
“It’s an abrogation of the integrity of this election,” Taylor wrote in a text message. “There is thorough evidence that their ticket violated several election rules, as has been acknowledged by many people. Despite this, their ticket will face no consequences.”
“This will entrench the advantages that candidates get for cheating the rules, and incentivise candidates to cheat in every future election,” he added.
Brennan said he is concerned about the fairness of the election process as candidates who were found to have violated campaign rules are still in the race.
“Very real rules infractions were brought up and determined by the Commission to be in violation of those rules,” Brennan said. “To see a reinstating of the ticket poses a lot of concern about the fairness and spirit of this election.”
Pforzheimer House Representative Jane J. Oh ’24 — who said she contributed evidence to the initial complaint against Xiang and Zhang — said she is frustrated the DSO did not reach out to her after it intervened in the process.
“They don’t feel the need to meet up with us or anything like that,” she said, adding that she believes the DSO saw the situation as merely interpersonal conflicts amongst the candidates and complainants.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that the DSO intervened per the Commission’s request.
“The DSO, as Student Organization Discipline Process overseers, have and will get involved in the process of student organizations when concerns are raised to them that those processes are operating unfairly,” Dane wrote.
“Nothing in the rules states that the DSO needs to inform [the complainant] of anything,” she added.
Following the reinstatement, Estabine, whom Xiang launched a campaign with after her ticket with Zhang was disbanded, stepped down from the election and chose to support the Xiang-Zhang campaign, according to Xiang and Zhang.
Voting opened Thursday at noon, but had to be restarted at 5:30 p.m. due to user interface issues on the voting website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just a single loss over the course of 16 games, a perfect 7-0 Ivy League record, and the best team goals-against average in the nation (0.42), the Harvard field hockey team has earned a spot in the 2021 Division I NCAA tournament.
The No. 12 Crimson finished off its regular season with a decisive 4-0 win over Brown last weekend, clinching the outright Ivy League title. The victory marks Harvard’s third league title in the last five years. Harvard will carry a 10-game winning streak into the first round of the tournament, back-stopped by a dominant defense.
“I think our defense has really stepped up and has proven to be an extraordinary quality,” said Harvard head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden, who was recently named the Ivy League Coach of the Year. “Defense has been phenomenal for us, and that is something that we look to bring into the NCAAs.”
Centering the defense is junior goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo, who deflected three shots on goal during the win over Brown and secured the top save percentage in Division I field hockey at 0.857. Offensively, the Crimson is fifth in the nation in assists per game. Senior captain and back Hannah Pearce, who was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, led the team this season with 13 goals and two assists.
Harvard will come off its nearly perfect season ride (15-1, 7-0 Ivy) to take on a new challenge: the NCAA tournament. But the D-I tournament is not uncharted territory for the Crimson.
In 2018, the then-No. 6 field hockey team made it to the quarterfinal round of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history — an effort marked by an aggressive mentality and resilience. However, with 2018 three years in the past and a 21-month hiatus leading into this season, a different team and a different mindset will be on the field in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Friday.
“We are an entirely new Harvard,” van Herwaarden said. “We have had a different season, different strengths, and different difficulties.”
This year, the NCAA tournament features 18 teams from different conferences throughout the nation: Big Ten, Big East, and the ACC, to name a few. Harvard remains the only team from the Ivy League to clinch a spot in the tournament.
“I think we take it game by game,” van Herwaarden reflected. “We are not comparing ourselves to any other team that has done well in the past. We are making sure we utilize our strengths and see how we have to deal with [their] strengths and be able to compete with them.”
There is one team in the tournament that Harvard faced earlier this season, the University of Delaware. The Crimson beat Delaware 2-0 back in September. Delaware recently beat out Fairfield University for a spot against No. 1 Rutgers in the opening round of the tournament.
“I think when you look at the records and the scores of this past season, it’s going to be anyone’s game,” observed the Ivy coach of the year. “This championship is very much undecided — it’s anyone’s game.”
“But it’s also going to come down to which form might be best on any given game day,” he continued. “For us as coaches, it’s our job to make sure our athletes have to step up when it matters the most.”
When the bracket came out this past Sunday night, Harvard learned that it would be facing No. 6 University of Louisville in the first round of the tournament. This will be the first time the two teams have ever faced one another.
The Louisville Cardinals (16-3, 6-0 ACC) recently secured the 2021 ACC regular season title before losing 2-1 in a sudden-victory shootout to No. 17 Virginia in the semifinals of the ACC Championship. This is Louisville’s 10th overall NCAA tournament appearance and its seventh at-large bid. In the 2020 season, in which the Crimson was not permitted to play due to Ivy League restrictions, the Cardinals advanced to the NCAA semifinals and reached the quarterfinals in 2019 as well.
“Their championship in the ACC is a show of their strengths and that is something we need to prepare for,” van Herwaarden remarked. “We have been watching a lot of video, discussing it with the team, and I think Louisville will probably do the same for us and try to recognize our strengths.”
“Playing a team that you don’t know can be very fun,” he said. “In the meantime, I want to make sure that we utilize our strengths and make sure that we have something in store to surprise them a little bit.”
Harvard is preparing to take on the No. 6 team in whatever shape or form the Cardinals take to the field on Friday. Through scouting video, high-intensity practice, and running through different situations that could happen during the game, Harvard’s main focus is on bringing what it has to the table.
“We are making sure that we are prepared for the unknown and have a couple of different options of what could happen in the game,” the head coach said. “We are trying to prepare for as many scenarios that we can play out, with a goal down in the last five minutes, a goal up in the final four minutes,” he said. “Those are things we are practicing right now.”
No matter the outcome of Friday’s game, Harvard has had quite the phenomenal season marked by key defensive play. In the Crimson’s sixteen games, there has not been a team that has been able to score more than a single goal against Harvard. The Crimson has proven to be very difficult to score against, and the squad will look to lean on that strength in its NCAA opener.
“The goal is to win,” van Herwaarden said. “I think now we’ve been given an extra opportunity to play for a national championship, and that’s special. We need to make sure we prepare for it properly so that we step off the field no matter what the outcome is knowing that we did everything we could. If that’s the case, then — win or lose — we should be very proud of what we accomplished and then we can look forward to future years.”
“This is just a make-or-break game, so we go in to win it and that’s the desired outcome.”
The Crimson and Cardinals will face off at 2:30 p.m. EST, following the noon matchup between host Michigan and Miami (Ohio). The winners of these first-round matches will play on Sunday for a right to advance to the final four.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard (6-2, 2-2 Ivy) welcomes Penn (3-5, 1-4 Ivy) to Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, it will mark a celebration and an ending. The matchup is the Crimson’s last home game of the season, for next week the team will travel away from its friendly confines, where it has gone 456-227-34 (.660) all time. On Saturday, Harvard will celebrate the 18 seniors on its roster as the squad plays on Soldiers Field for the last time.
The Crimson is coming off an underclassman-led effort in its last game, a 49-21 victory over Columbia on Nov. 6. Junior quarterback Luke Emge threw for 205 yards and three touchdowns, sophomore running back Aidan Borguet and junior running back Aaron Shampklin each found the end zone twice, junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly became Harvard’s first 100-yard receiver this season, and first-year defensive tackle Thor Griffith led the defense with seven total tackles, including three for a loss and a 12-yard sack. But it is the team’s senior captain, linebacker Jordan Hill, whose leadership has helped keep the Crimson grounded and hungry coming into the Penn matchup.
“We didn’t finish the game the right way,” said Hill after Harvard allowed three touchdowns in the second half against the Lions. “You need to be able to finish in the games that really matter. And against Penn and Yale to finish out the season, those are going to be good games. So the fact that we won by such a margin isn’t even something that we’re really talking about — it’s more the fact that we gave up three scores in the [second half].”
Senior linebacker Andrew Irwin, who has made 62 tackles over his four-year career, embraced Hill’s message. In 2019, Harvard was statistically worse in the second half, being outscored by opponents 144-130 after halftime after winning the first two quarters, 166-84. So far this season, that trend has held: in the first half, the Crimson has scored 187 points and allowed just 35, and although it is winning second halves as well, the margin is considerably thinner: 100-76. Irwin was hopeful that his team would be able to come out of halftime with more fire against the Quakers.
“As a unit, defensively, we just know that was unacceptable. We’ve looked to finish out games,” he said. “Especially when we have a lead, we want to make sure that we play to the end of the whistle in the fourth quarter and not let [up] some late scores.”
For Harvard to come away with a victory against Penn, it will have to contend with a balanced offense that mixes speed with size and youth with veteran savvy. The star of the Quakers’ offense is a graduate student, running back Isaiah Malcome, who, despite standing just 5’5”, broke out for 201 yards and a touchdown against Lehigh on Oct. 9. Overall, Malcome has gained 642 yards on the ground this season, which ranks third in the Ivy League behind Columbia’s Dante Miller and Shampklin, in addition to five scores.
“He’s a tremendous athlete. He’s got amazing quickness. He’s a shifty kid, can get east and west very well, and then, when he has to, get north and south,” Irwin said. “It’s going to be a challenge, and it’s going to take the whole defense to bring him down. We pride ourselves on getting everyone to the football, so it’s not just going to be one-on-one. It’s going to be all eleven Crimson coming after him.”
Penn balances its undersized running back with a large receiving corps, with three wide receivers standing over six feet tall. Although senior receiver Ryan Cragun did not play in Penn’s loss last week to Cornell, the Quakers possess the size to threaten Harvard’s defensive backs, who allowed 5’9” Princeton receiver Jacob Bermelin to high-point the football for the game-winning conversion in an 18-16 5OT loss. Penn’s leading receiver this season is Cragun, who has hauled in 31 catches for 463 yards and two touchdowns. It also mixes its veteran leaders with a first-year quarterback, Aidan Sayin, who took over for senior John Quinnelly after the upperclassman completed just 24 percent of his passes in a loss to Columbia on Oct. 16. Sayin’s best game came against Brown on Oct. 30, when he completed 68.8 percent of his passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns in the 45-17 Quaker victory.
“He’s a very talented young player, and he’s going to be a great Ivy League quarterback in the years to come. I think he’s got great arm strength. He’s a decent athlete,” Irwin commented on Sayin. “For us, it’s going to be getting after him, using our veterans to try and outsmart him a little bit, but he’s a great player and it’ll be a challenge playing against him.”
On Saturday, however, Sayin and Malcome will face their most difficult opponent yet. Aided by its strong front seven, the Crimson rushing defense is the best in the country, allowing just 55.5 yards per game and 1.75 yards per carry. Additionally, Harvard allows among the fewest conversions on third down, fourth down, and in the red zone, ranking third, third, and fifth, respectively. Because of its strength in clutch situations, Harvard has allowed just 130 first downs in its eight games, the fifth fewest in FCS.
“I think it starts with the game plan with [defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99] and the rest of the defensive coaches. They put us in a great situation,” Irwin explained. “First and second down matter just as much as third and fourth down. So if we stop them for minimal yards on first and second down, it makes third and fourth down a lot easier.”
The Crimson relies on the strength of its defensive line, which has gotten through for 33 sacks this season, good for second-most in the country. It is led by junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes, who has racked up seven sacks, sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec, who has contributed 5.5 of his own, and Griffith. Griffith, who was named to the 2021 Stats Perform FCS Jerry Rice Award Watch List on Oct. 27, putting him on the national stage as one of the best first-year players in the country, has brought down the quarterback four times and has 7.5 tackles for a loss. The Portsmouth, N.H., native is supplemented by talented linebackers like Hill and Irwin and a secondary that has intercepted 11 passes this season, good for a tie for thirteenth nationally. 6’2” sophomore cornerback Alex Washington, who intercepted two passes against Lafayette on Oct. 16, and 6’0” senior cornerback Khalid Thomas, who snagged two of his own against Holy Cross on Oct. 2, give Harvard plenty of size to combat the Quakers’ trio of receivers.
On the other side of the ball, head coach Tim Murphy will present a relatively unfamiliar look. After sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean was lost for the season with an injury after the Princeton loss and senior quarterback Jake Smith was benched, Murphy turned to Emge, who, in his first career start, helped the Crimson execute its most aggressive offensive game plan this season last Saturday against Columbia. Emge repeatedly threw downfield, finding Wimberly seven times for 111 yards, including a touchdown. The junior is Harvard’s leading receiver this season, having caught 29 passes for 357 yards and three scores. Senior wide receiver James Batch was also the beneficiary of two deep throws, one by Emge and one by sophomore wide receiver Gavin Sharkey on a trick play.
“[Wimberly and I] have a great chemistry, and I think that same chemistry is something that is had between me and all of the receivers, and same with our other quarterbacks and receivers,” Emge said. “I think that comes from spring ball [and] in the summer, throwing with these guys up here, it’s just a lot of reps together. … Our quarterback room and our receiver room, as a whole, just has really great chemistry. I think we’re able to build on that on game day and lean on that.”
The Crimson offense, however, is led by its running backs, who each ran for nearly 100 yards and two touchdowns against Columbia. Shampklin leads the Ivy League with 94.1 rushing yards per game, and ties Princeton’s Collin Eaddy with 10 total touchdowns. Meanwhile, Borguet is not far behind, having rushed for 530 yards and seven touchdowns this season. Together, the pair helps Harvard boast the 31st best rushing attack in the country, averaging 173.4 yards per game to pace the defense-oriented Ancient Eight.
“We have an extremely talented running back room, whether it’s [Shampklin], [Borguet], [sophomore running back Sone Ntoh], really talented young guys too. It really just takes a lot of pressure off the quarterback, when you know you can hand it off to those guys and they’ll get you five, six, seven yards a pop,” Emge said. “I think a lot of it also comes down to our [offensive line]. Our o-line has done a great job this year, opening up holes for them and protecting the quarterback.”
Led by senior offensive lineman Spencer Rolland, a projected All-Ivy League First Team selection, the unit will have to come prepared against a Penn defense that plays aggressively. Although the Quakers were unable to manufacture a sack last Saturday against Cornell, they have totaled 21 sacks this season, good for fifth in the Ivy League. Their frequent blitzes have allowed them to concede just 140 first downs this season, tied for the 12th fewest in the country. Linebacker Jake Heimlicher has contributed six sacks, defensive back Jaden Key and linebacker Brian O’Neill each have 51 tackles, and defensive back Jalen McCleod has three picks to pace the team.
“They have players with high motors. They get after it [and] fly to the ball. They take a lot of pride in their defense,” Emge said. “Their defense as a whole is extremely talented. Talented [defensive backs], front seven, specifically their down linemen, are really talented. Every week, I think the big focus for us as a team is focusing on what we can control and preparing ourselves as [well] as possible to execute our offense.”
A Harvard victory on Saturday would improve its record in the rivalry to 50-39-2 (.560) and give it a 4-2 conference record headed into the 137th playing of The Game in New Haven, Conn., on Nov. 20. The Crimson currently sit just one game behind Princeton, Dartmouth, and Yale, although the Bulldogs play the Tigers this weekend in Princeton, N.J. If Princeton and Dartmouth each lose a game and Harvard wins each of its remaining two games, the Crimson is guaranteed a share of the conference title, which would be Murphy’s tenth since taking over as head coach in 1994. After the Yale contest, the Tigers will finish out their season on the road against Penn. The Big Green, meanwhile, will face Cornell before traveling to Providence, R.I., for its finale against Brown. However, as they have all season, Harvard players are taking it one game at a time.
“[You] can’t focus on the past and you can’t dream about the future,” Irwin said. “All you can control is the present, so we’re going to go 1-0 this week and then see what happens.”
