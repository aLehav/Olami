After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the successful 2016 referendum legalizing recreational marijuana in Massachusetts, marijuana stores came closer to becoming a reality in Cambridge. Yet prospective vendors may get lost in the weeds of complex new zoning restrictions.
In late August, the Cambridge Planning Board heard a petition that would institute zoning petitions on stores that sell marijuana recreationally. This petition institutes a “buffer” of 500 feet between any recreational marijuana store and K-12 school or public youth recreation areas. It would also require that there be 1,800 feet of separation between each store that sells marijuana recreationally. In Kendall, Harvard, or Central Squares, two shops may be located within 1,800 feet of each other. According to the planning board, these regulations are meant to “avoid policies that exclude disadvantaged populations,” prevent “clustering” of recreational marijuana stores, and “promote distribution throughout the city.”
Barring the part of the petition seeking to keep recreational marijuana shops away from Cantabrigian youth, these regulations are unnecessary, overburdensome, and misguided. At best, they will have little impact given the economic disincentive for competitors to set up shop so close together. At worst, they will hamper local economic growth. These restrictions should be discarded as soon as possible.
According to the Cambridge Planning Board, one of the main purposes of the petition is to “avoid policies that exclude disadvantaged populations”. While this part of the planning board’s reasoning is almost unintelligible, we take it to be a concern that legal recreational marijuana shops will lead to gentrification if not regulated properly, given the large amount of public discourse on the issue.
This should be a large concern, especially when it comes to Cambridge, which is gentrifying at an alarming rate. Nevertheless, we are not confident that pot shops will have a substantial effect on Cantabrigian gentrification. There is not enough long-term evidence on how recreational marijuana affects property values to come to a definitive conclusion on the matter.
Zoning regulations, on the other hand, have existed for far longer than legalized recreational marijuana, and the evidence concerning their effect on gentrification is clear. Aggressive zoning may raise property prices for everyone and thus exacerbate gentrification. As a result, not only are these particular regulations unnecessary, but they may worsen one of the problems they purport to solve.
According to the Cambridge Planning Board, the other purposes of the petition are to prevent “clustering” of recreational marijuana stores, and “promote distribution throughout the city.” While it is true that the same type of business will often form clusters of shops, a large district of solely recreational marijuana shops is unlikely to form in Cambridge, which has a population of approximately 110,000. We suspect that a city of this size would not be able to sustain such a district.
Still, the most damaging part of these regulations is their negative effect on Cantabrigian economic growth. Michael Dundas, president and CEO of Sira Naturals, told The Crimson that the biggest obstacle to opening recreational marijuana stores is approval by both the city and state. The oftentimes burdensome regulations faced by aspiring business owners are not inherently bad, but unnecessarily adding to them certainly is. These regulations threaten to restrict Cambridge’s economic growth and worsen the problems that the city is trying to solve. While we support the obvious necessity of keeping stores away from schools, other restrictions serve no functional purpose. The city should scrap them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My interest in concentrating in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is often met with puzzled facial expressions, followed by the simple, patronizing question: “But, why?” I cannot deny that this is frustrating. I also cannot deny that, before I enrolled in a WGS course last year, I was just as skeptical.
Why is studying WGS considered so off-putting? Why is it not met with the same reverence as concentrations like Computer Science or Economics?
While most people I’ve come across have not totally discounted the importance of WGS being incorporated into college education, there is a common misconception (one that I had previously held) that the decision to focus in it is not a practical one. I mean, a degree in Computer Science can get you that job at Facebook and a degree in Economics can get you closer to the Goldman Sachs dream. What can a WGS degree do for you?
WGS offers something much more valuable than a gateway to a big fancy corporate job. If you take a moment to think about it, you’ll see the world we live in is gendered. We associate different colors with different genders — blue for boys and pink for girls. We use different adjectives to describe people based on feminine or masculine qualities, such as “pretty” for women and “handsome” for men.
At first, these examples of gender classification may seem natural and unworthy of study, but a closer look reveals how problematic our ingrained gendering system really is. By dividing our world up into these two gender categories, we begin to fit people into boxes.
Women are soft. They are kind, caring, and understanding, and while these are beautiful qualities, often they are followed by submissiveness, domesticity, and a lack of autonomy. Men are tough. They are strong, persistent, and competitive, but these characteristics can also prelude a sense of dominance or superiority over others and can lead to emotional distance or inaccessibility. But perhaps worst of all is that this rigid systematic gendering of the world leaves no space for people who do not conform to these two gender categories, excluding them from the rest of society. And most people do not not fit neatly into these gender stereotypes.
Now, it is true that we have come a long way in improving our perception of gender and gender roles. No longer is the woman confined to the house or the man expected to solely provide for the family. And no longer are the categories of man and woman the only two categories that the word “gender” encompasses. Because of these advancements, some people might argue that there is no longer a practical reason for studying WGS, but this argument assumes that gender inequality has completely disappeared, which could not be farther from the truth.
The gender pay gap in the U.S. still persists today, with women being less likely to be promoted to administrative positions and only making approximately 80% of what men make for working full-time. Unfortunately this pay gap is even worse in other countries, such as Bulgaria and Saudi Arabia. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, an estimated 20 to 25 percent of people who identify as lesbian or gay experience hate crimes in their lives. In today’s pop culture and mainstream media, derogatory lyrics about women and inaccurate depictions of the LGBTQ community reinforce the idea of their inferiority.
So, while there is certainly value in studying the aforementioned “practical fields” of computer science and economics, if we are solely focused on these academic areas, we will remain ignorant of the magnitude of the effects that our ingrained gendering systems have on society. In studying WGS, not only are we trained to recognize these flaws in our society, but we are also equipped with the tools to correct these flaws. Some of these tools include skills that are highly desirable to employers such as critical thinking, insightfulness, and, most importantly, a sense of openness and inclusion.
So, WGS is not only an immensely practical field. In movements of social equality and social improvement, it is essential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column rarely plays host to popular campus opinions, so it is probably unsurprising that its author quite enjoys hearing the Harvard Band play its medley of Crimson fight songs at sporting events and major university ceremonies like Convocation and Commencement. I genuinely enjoy the raucous energy of “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard” (as well as its less respectable counterpart) and the joyfully archaic melodies of “Fair Harvard.”
Those delightful booming bass drums and rattling snares rang out as I passed through the Yard just before the start of Freshman Convocation for the Class of 2022 a few weeks ago. Despite the usual confidence and slight aggression with which I usually walk through the Yard, I must have looked terribly awkward and touristy as I paused to listen and watch as the first few throngs of well-dressed freshmen strode into Tercentenary Theatre, jacket lapels and summer dresses adorned with newly acquired class pins, faces shining with excitement and perspiration.
For the first (and surely not the last) time during my senior year, a twinge of nostalgia tugged at my thesis-distressed mind and rapid walking pace as I tried to recall what must have been going through my head as I walked into Tercentenary three years ago for the Convocation of the Class of 2019. The same delight at Harvard Band antics was there, as well as some amount of trepidation and hesitancy.
I’m quite skeptical of many elements of Freshmen Opening Days, but my classmates and I did confront, however timidly, genuine concerns and fears about entering an instruction so globally recognized and renowned. Were we worthy of the prestigious Harvard mantle? Would we prove valiant stewards of the opportunities afforded to us? At once, these questions reflected an acknowledgement of the ultimate honor and privilege that we had been given, but Opening Days also instilled a peculiar tendency to dance around dropping the “H-bomb,” to constantly “check our privilege,” and almost to fear Harvard’s very shadow. Community Conversations and its assorted counterparts seemed to assume that we were fragile creatures in need of every possible source of comfort and support, and that Harvard’s imposing reputation would crush us.
Thankfully, the following three years silenced the voices whispering that I wasn’t worthy of a Harvard degree, and strengthened a resolve to seek the best liberal arts education I could. (Not always the easiest task given the chaos of the General Education system.) I’ve become less tentative about owning my place in the Harvard legacy, and allowed myself to revel in the tradition and pomp and circumstance of this grand collegiate story. I am happily not the same person who walked into Tercentenary behind the Greenough banner three years ago.
Even as my classmates and I confidently inch ever closer to donning our caps and gowns one (hopefully) fine day in May 2019, we may often find ourselves feeling more like we did in August 2015 as President Bacow begins penning a new chapter in Harvard’s history. Once-familiar faces in the administration, Houses, and academic departments depart to begin their own new chapters, and new faces fill their place at a rate seemingly faster than usual. House Renewal projects (admittedly much needed) chip away at the repair and restoration of historic Harvard. A new course schedule promises to alter the very essence of the Harvard College experience as punctuality is no longer optional.
My conservative attitude towards change can’t help but wish for four years of relative constancy. But as much as I’ve yearned for the constancy that Harvard’s standards, legacy, and traditions usually produce, I’ve learned that Harvard remains an institution very much in flux, constantly changing. Paradoxically, our time here is essentially moving through a revolving door, but is an experience that promises to transform our very selves.
It will be a challenge this semester to resist the current that bears us ceaselessly back into the past as Harvard Time wrinkles and the University’s next pages begin. My time to linger in the Yard, enjoy the last refrain of Ten Thousand Men, and roll my eyes at stars dying in the firmament (Fair Harvard’s baffling new last line) will one day expire and run out, and I will leave this place. But not yet — there’s thankfully at least a few more columns’ worth of the Harvard experience for me, and unfortunately (fortunately?) for you all, much more opining to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives of Harvard’s freshly minted graduate student union say they are committed to prioritizing issues of diversity and inclusion at the bargaining table, which they expect to approach soon.
Earlier this year, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers established a Civil and Human Rights Committee in order to push for contract language that “meaningfully addresses the unique needs of various underrepresented groups on campus,” according to committee co-chair Cherrie N. Bucknor, a GSAS student.
The committee is one of three bodies formed by HGSU-UAW almost immediately following the union’s certification in April. In an election that capped off a five-year effort by graduate students to collectively bargain, 56 percent of voting teaching and research assistants said they wanted to form a union.
In the days following the vote count — even before the University had pledged to meet the group for negotiations — HGSU-UAW leaders moved swiftly to build up a formal bureaucracy, establishing a bargaining committee, a “Time’s Up” committee, and the Civil and Human Rights committee.
Bucknor wrote that the committee spent the summer “reaching out to our community with town hall meetings, researching relevant contract clauses, and assisting the bargaining committee with drafting bargaining surveys.”
The challenges faced by minority students have been a topic of discussion within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences — whose students make up the lion’s share of HGSU-UAW’s membership — for several years. Last semester, GSAS hired its first pair of diversity fellows in an effort to better serve students of color. Protections for international students also featured prominently in pro-union activism leading up to the April election.
The issues facing underrepresented minorities have also been a point of discussion within national unions — including HGSU’s parent organization, the United Automobile Workers.
United Steelworkers International Organizing Director Maria Somma said there are a “wide variety” of ways for local union chapters like HGSU-UAW to promote diversity, both in their contract negotiations with the University and among their own ranks.
“With the changing demographics and workforce of our union and others within organized labor, now we’ve got an opportunity in which a lot more diversity can happen within the unions,” Somma said.
Susan E. Woods, an emeritus faculty member at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said that, in order for local union chapters like HGSU-UAW to secure diversity and inclusion provisions in collective bargaining, they must also promote diversity within their own ranks.
“In this atmosphere — this political climate of anti-union animus — it’s more important these days than ever before for unions to connect with their membership,” Woods said. “That means any member has to see themselves and see their face in the face of the union.”
HSGU-UAW has yet to release a formal bargaining agenda, which could include demands related to the Civil and Human Rights committee’s work. In an August series aimed at educating members about contract provisions at other academic institutions, the union cited language secured by Graduate Employees’ Organization 3550 — the University of Michigan grad union — mandating funding “for paid positions for student workers to help implement their university’s diversity initiatives.”
Somma — who is the first Asian organizing director in her union — said pushing for diverse hiring practices in negotiations is an important strategy for a local union like HGSU-UAW to consider.
“In a bargaining situation, you want to make sure your employer is proactive and has practices in place to do diverse hiring, which would include where you recruit workers from — where you recruit students from — and how you make funding decisions,” Somma said.
Bucknor wrote that the committee’s has two goals for the upcoming semester: “to continue to be a resource for student workers on campus from underrepresented groups” and to collaborate with other campus groups. Last Friday, HGSU-UAW co-sponsored a rally to support workers with Temporary Protected Status and call attention to an ongoing nationwide prison strike.
“We hope to hold town hall meetings and information sessions, as well as participate in activities in support of winning strong contract clauses around equity and inclusion and international student worker protections,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Broad Institute holds patent rights to the gene-editing technology CRISPR-Cas9, ending a years-long dispute between the University of California, Berkeley and the Harvard and MIT-affiliated institute.
CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology, has a variety of potential biotechnological applications, including helping to cure genetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.
In 2011 and 2012, Jennifer A. Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle M. Charpentier of Umeå University in Sweden were researching CRISPR-Cas9. Simultaneously, Feng Zhang ’04 of the Broad Institute was working on the same problem, albeit separately.
Although Doudna published her findings and applied for a patent before Zhang did, her work focused on CRISPR-Cas9 in test tubes whereas Zhang’s research focused on its usage in human and mouse cells.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded the Broad Institute the rights to use CRISPR-Cas9 for eukaryotic cell-editing methods, listing Zhang as the primary inventor. Eukaryotic cells, which include animal and human cells, have the most potential for industry and commercial purposes.
A patent for CRISPR-Cas9 is valued at approximately $265 million, according to Forbes.
UC Berkeley contended that Doudna and her collaborators deserved the patent and appealed the patent office’s decision, filing interference proceedings that were approved by the trademark office in Jan. 2016.
In Feb. 2017, a U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that the patents held by the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley applied to different subjects. Berkeley appealed that ruling in April 2017.
Judge Kimberly Moore, one of three federal appellate judges, wrote in her decision Monday that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board “did not err in its analysis,” limiting UC Berkeley’s possible options going forward.
“We have considered UC’s remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive,” Moore wrote in the ruling.
Despite the setback, Charles F. Robinson, general counsel and vice president of legal affairs at UC Berkeley, wrote in a Monday statement that the university is considering further legal action.
“We are evaluating further litigation options,” he wrote. “We also look forward to proving that Drs. Doudna and Charpentier first invented usage in plant and animal cells.”
In a separate statement published Monday, Robinson wrote he believes that the latest ruling will not impede further efforts by UC Berkeley to claim intellectual property for CRISPR-Cas9 usage in eukaryotic cells.
“The court did not address the question of who invented the specific use of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, and emphasized that its decision was ‘not a ruling on the validity of either’ Broad’s or UC’s claims,” Robinson wrote.
Disputes over the inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 have also spilled into international courts. The European Patent Office granted Doudna and Charpentier two CRISPR-Cas9 patents in March 2017 and most recently in January, providing the Doudna-Charpentier team with eukaryotic cell-editing rights in the European Union. The EPO also revoked the Broad Institute’s first patent for CRISPR-Cas9 in January.
Lee McGuire, Broad Institute communications director, wrote in a statement that the Institute agreed with the the appellate ruling that the two patents were distinct in nature.
“The Federal Circuit made the correct decision in upholding the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s ruling,” he wrote. “The patents and applications of Broad Institute and UCB are about different subjects and do not interfere with each other.”
McGuire encouraged both parties to let the ruling stand and instead focus on future applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
“It is time for all institutions to move beyond litigation,” he added. “We should work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Extension School students can access the University's full library system for the first time, following the recent shuttering of the Division of Continuing Education's Grossman Library.
Grossman Library, located in Sever Hall, merged with the larger Harvard College Library system in August. Starting this year, all Extension School students can receive a Harvard ID card, allowing them for the first time to access the full extent of the library system.
“Previously, only Harvard Extension degree candidates had access to library spaces, while our individual course takers only had online access,” Kaitlin Buckley, communications officer at Harvard Library, wrote in an email. “Now, for the first time, all students enrolled in Harvard Extension School courses are eligible for library services like [Faculty of Arts and Sciences] students, whether or not they are enrolled in a degree program.”
Extension School students will also be able to book group study spaces through the library system’s website and access additional research resources, according to Buckley.
Buckley wrote that the closing of Grossman and integration of the Extension School’s collections came in response to the recommendations of a working group.
“It was important for the librarians at Grossman, the administration at DCE, and leadership at the Harvard College Library to make this connection to best serve all our students,” wrote Buckley.
Grossman Library’s non-circulating collections, which included copies of past Master of Liberal Arts theses and course reserves for Extension School students, are being integrated into the larger Harvard College Library system, which contains over two dozen libraries spread across campus including Lamont, Widener, and Cabot.
Grossman Library was previsouly open to Harvard students, faculty, and staff outside of the Extension School.
Rachael Han ’20 said she used to visit Grossman at least once every week and usually more often during midterms.
“I was just really sad because it was so convenient to go to Grossman before or after my classes in Sever,” Han said.
However, the reaction from Extension School students has been largely positive, according to Buckley.
“Extension School students are excited to access all of the resources offered by the Harvard College Library,” Buckley wrote.

Next year, eager freshmen seeking vodka and whiskey might not be able to find it at Harvard’s few remaining fraternities.
The North-American Interfraternity Conference announced last week that it plans to ban hard alcohol at its more than 60 affiliated fraternities across the nation. The ban will take effect at the beginning of Sept. 2019. While it prohibits fraternity members from keeping liquor at their facilities and serving it at chapter events, it does not prevent licensed third-party vendors from serving hard alcohol in fraternity spaces.
Harvard’s three fraternities — Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi — are all members of NIC and will be subject to the new rule. The trio are the only fraternities and some of the only all-male social groups left in Cambridge after administrators decided to sanction members of single-sex final clubs and Greek organizations in May 2016 .
The social group policy — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bars members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities from holding leadership positions in recognized student organizations, becoming captains of varsity teams, or receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
Two fraternities went co-ed and relinquished membership in the NIC in response to the sanctions. Alpha Epsilon Pi became the co-ed The Aleph, while Kappa Sigma formed the gender-neutral KS. Both groups were among the 15 social groups that earned Harvard recognition — and freedom from the sanctions — last week.
DKE, SAE, and Sigma Chi did not respond to requests for comment Monday.

Nearly five months after the arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate roiled campus and drew allegations of police brutality, the Cambridge Police Department has yet to determine a timeline for completing its internal probe into the conduct of officers involved.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that a schedule for completing the investigation “will be communicated once the results are nearly finalized.”
The controversy around the April arrest largely centered around CPD officers’ use of force in apprehending the student. Shortly after 9 p.m. on April 13, the night of Harvard’s annual spring concert, Cambridge police arrived at a street median feet from the Harvard Law School campus to respond to calls about a naked man.
The officers later stated in a report that the student — who was nude and likely under the influence of narcotics — had clenched his fists and began making aggressive movements towards them, prompting an officer to tackle him to the ground. But eyewitnesses, including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, stated CPD’s version of events was inaccurate and the officer acted “without provocation.”
In a video of the incident later made public by CPD, the student is seen standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers speak with him for at least two minutes. The student turns around and makes two steps towards one officer, then takes a step back and raises his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles him from behind.
The arrest triggered a CPD internal investigation. Per department policy, CPD investigates all incidents in which officers use force.
CPD is also facing a second, external probe. The department announced in April that Roderick L. Ireland, the first African-American Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, would conduct an “independent review” of CPD’s internal review. The results of Ireland’s review will be made public, according to the April press release.
Last week, Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed announced that a Harvard task force tasked with reviewing the arrest and systematically examining relevant University policies had missed its deadline to share its findings with University President Lawrence S. Bacow. 
Gordon-Reed wrote in a letter to Bacow explaining the delay that the committee needs to hold more meetings with student focus groups before it can issue any conclusions.

Harvard Law hopefuls, beware — the number of applicants to the Law School spiked by more than 30 percent this past year, and experts say it’s a trend that’s likely to continue.
Harvard Law received 7,578 applications for the Class of 2021, compared to 5,755 for the Class of 2020, representing a 32 percent bump. That increase is significantly higher than the rise in law school applications nationwide, which clocked in at 8.3 percent, according to the Law School Admissions Council.
Analysts say the national increase could be due to the current economic and political atmosphere in America. Some are calling the rise a “Trump bump.”
Kellye Testy, president and CEO of the Law School Admission Council, wrote in an email that her group traces the increase to an improved “employment outlook” for law school graduates across the nation, something she partly attributed to law schools’ recent downsizing of their incoming classes.
But she also pointed to Trump.
“Law and justice issues are very visible in our society right now, and young people are hearing the call to work in law, policy, and other realms open to law graduates to address legal and justice issues that need attention in our world,” Testy wrote. “We are seeing very strong interest from candidates who are inspired to pursue legal studies as a way to work for greater equity and social justice.”
Harvard Law School Assistant Dean for Admissions and Chief Admissions Officer Kristi L. Jobson was less convinced. She said she thinks Harvard’s increase has little to do with the national increase.
“We don't attribute the 32 percent increase that we saw to a parallel to the national increase because it was much higher,” Jobson said. “We think that our office has engaged in a systemic strategy in knocking down barriers to legal education.”
She cited a few tactics in particular: Harvard recently eliminated seat deposits, included video interviews as part of the application process, accepted the GRE as a standardized test, and created a Junior Deferral Program.
Still, Jobson believes that the spike is fundamentally due to excitement for the school itself.
“When you see a 32 percent increase, it's not anything about policy nationwide or any initiative that the admissions team is putting together, even though we think our initiatives are really great,” Jobson said. “It's about the institution.”
She mentioned the wide range of clinical programs that Harvard Law offers. The Law School’s website claims that the school “offers more clinical opportunities than any law school in the world.”
The Law School may not have completely bucked national trends and issues, though. Many applicants this year indicated an interest in immigration and refugee advocacy, according to Jobson.
“That was one area where we saw an increased interest this year,” she said.
The Trump administration last year sought to enact a travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries, sparking protests and counter-orders by various judges around the country. Over the summer, the federal government drew widespread criticism for its enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy that mandated that immigrant children be separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Harvard’s investment practices have come under fire frequently in recent years, as protesters on campus have called on the University to divest from fossil fuels and private prisons.
This time, the criticism is coming from groups hundreds of miles away — and it’s aimed at the University’s vast but little-known farmland holdings.
A report released last week details the web of companies with which Harvard Management Company, the university’s investment arm, directly invests in farmland around the world, risking conflict with communities from California to Brazil.
The report, published by activist groups Genetic Resources Action International and Rede Social de Justiça e Direitos Humanos, claims to provide “a comprehensive analysis of Harvard University’s controversial investments in global farmland.”
It traces the history of Harvard’s farmland acquisitions since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago, estimating that HMC has spent more than $1 billion to buy up more than 800,000 hectares of farmland around the world.
“Shielded from public scrutiny, the University’s endowment fund quietly accumulated into one of the largest farmland portfolios of any financial company in the world in less than a decade,” the report reads.
Unlike other universities and large endowments, HMC has invested directly in natural resources, though it has moved to scale back those holdings since CEO N. P. “Narv” Narvekar took office in Dec. 2016.
HMC profited well from natural resource investments in the 1990s and early aughts. From 2005 to 2013, HMC expanded its investment in emerging markets, including investing in farmland in Brazil and Eucalyptus farms in Uruguay.
Narvekar, though, has changed tack. He oversaw a $1 billion write-down in natural resource assets last year, and the Wall Street Journal reported in December that Narvekar said some investments carried more risk than previously calculated.
“For years, HMC benefited from an internally managed natural resources program that generated strong returns. At this stage, however, while most assets remain attractive, a few have significant challenges,” Narvekar wrote in HMC’s 2017 financial report.
“Our natural resources platform will take multiple years to reposition,” he added.
In March, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that HMC was exiting from a $150 million investment in forest and farmland in northeast Brazil, and that the failed investment contributed to the 2017 write-down.
While HMC is moving away from natural resources, its investments over the past decades have left marks across the world that this new report now aims to bring to light.
It can be difficult to monitor Harvard’s natural resource investments because HMC uses subsidiaries to invest in farming operations, which can obscure the University’s involvement. The GRAIN and Rede Social de Justiça e Direitos Humanos investigators collected tax documents and other local records to piece together their account of Harvard’s farmland investments, according to the report.
The 16-page document relays stories of locals in Brazil and elsewhere who say they were unfairly pushed off of land that Harvard now owns, or who say they have suffered health problems from Harvard-linked farms next door.
After HMC acquired farmland in South Africa, local managers sought to impede workers' ability to access family burial sites on property where workers had “occupational” rights, the report claims. The University later directed its local farm manager to sell the land, according to the report.
Some villagers in Brazil say that pollution from pesticides on properties connected to Harvard has caused an increase in the number of cancer patients, according to the report.
“Harvard’s decades of farmland deals has generated many casualties, from Brazilian peasants to South African farm workers to rural Californians,” the report reads.
The University has faced a number of legal challenges related to its land holdings in Brazil, where the practice of falsifying land claims is common, according to the report.
In the country’s Bahia region, a state commission found in 2014 that a Harvard subsidiary may have acquired land titles that had been illegally obtained and involved violent displacement of locals from public lands. State prosecutors have now indicated they may sue to reclaim some land linked to the University.
The report calls on Harvard affiliates to press HMC to end its farmland investments and land conflicts, as well as cover any monetary damages the local communities may have suffered.
Brazil is not the only place where locals are pushing back on Harvard’s management of lands. In the Cuyama valley, a drought stricken area of California, local residents are criticizing a Harvard owned vineyard that could diminish the valley’s water supply.
Harvard’s natural resource assets have also come under fire from within one of the University’s own governing bodies. Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80, a former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, resigned her post after criticizing Harvard for investing in “pernicious activities.”
In her letter, Taylor said Harvard’s engagement in “land purchases that may not respect indigenous rights” played a role in her resignation.
“But we don’t know what we don’t know, especially now that so much of the endowment is held in opaque funds,” she added.
University Spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote at the time in an emailed statement that Taylor’s support for divestment was long known to the community.
Responding to the new report, HMC spokesperson Pat McKiernan wrote in an emailed statement that the natural resources team has increased supervision of their asset managers.
“The team has also instituted a more proactive approach to working with managers of new and remaining assets—a partnership that provides more oversight and ensures that we can leave the land and community better than when we first invested,” McKiernan wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 9 Harvard men’s water polo team was among the West and East Coast teams to descend on Princeton, N.J., over the weekend to participate in this year’s Princeton Invitational. In a melee that featured 15 squads from across the nation—including seven top-20 teams—No. 18 George Washington, Navy and Fordham filled the itinerary for the Crimson.
Among the other competitors were the 2017 National Champions, the No. 2 UCLA, and No. 4 Stanford, No. 13 Princeton, No. 16 Cal Baptist, No. 17 Brown, Air Force, Iona, Johns Hopkins, Santa Clara, St. Francis Brooklyn and Wagner also split time in the Denunzio Pool at Princeton University.
"This season has been successful so far," junior co-captain utility Austin Sechrest said. "On the first weekend of the year, we took down the No. 7 team in the country, UC Davis, and then we won another rivalry game this past weekend against George Washington to push our record to 5-2. Dennis Blyashov, a third-team All-American as a freshman last year, has been playing really well so far, as has our center Charlie Owens. We have three really good goalies who are all competing hard to earn playing time."
The news of a Harvard top-ten ranking was released a few days prior to the Princeton Invitational in the College Water Polo Association’s announcement of the top 20 teams on Sept. 5. The number nine ranking ties the Crimson’s highest in program history.
Only two other times has Harvard ventured into the top 10 in national standings. The first followed the team’s 2016 NCAA appearance, and the second came in the preseason rankings entering the following season. Returning to Cambridge with a perfect record over the trio of this weekend’s matches, there is little chance of the team dropping in the CWPA’s new rankings.
“Obviously we have very high hopes for the season, coming off of two back-to-back conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances,” senior attacker Nathan Ondracek said. “We’ve got a great roster this year with key returners and talented freshmen, and now it’s a matter of fine-tuning our play styles and team chemistry.”
HARVARD 15, FORDHAM 10
In the final matchup of the weekend, the Crimson (5-2) squared off with a competitive Rams (2-4) team. The first quarter of play featured even play that ended in a 3-3 draw.
Freshman attacker Alex Tsotadze broke that tie with a goal that ushered in offensive momentum: strikes by Sechrest, sophomore attacker Dennis Blyashov, and senior attacker Nick Bunn followed Tsotadze’s own.
The offensive onslaught pushed Harvard into the halftime lead, but the second half allowed the squad to grow that lead. Sechrest nailed a shot and Fordham returned the favor, but the momentum had already swung the Crimson’s way. By the end of the third quarter, the Crimson had grown its one-point lead to five at 11-6.
The final quarter nearly mirrored the third for the Crimson’s offense, as the team converted four shots—from Sechrest, Bunn, Tsotadze and freshman 2-meter Michael De Mundo. The Rams finally got in a grove as well, growing its score to 10, with the final point coming in the last second of play. Junior goalie Nikhil Suri held firm overall, though, saving 11 goals, good for a season high.
With the win, Harvard continues its ten-game win streak against Fordham.
HARVARD 16, NAVY 9
A matchup with the Midshipmen (3-3) kicked off the double-header on Sunday for the Crimson. In the morning contest, Harvard wasted no time getting started, striking swiftly with two goals from Blyashov within two minutes of the opening horn.
Sechrest followed in suit, adding another tally to the Crimson’s point total before Navy finally answered. Midshipmen junior attacker Kevin Volkov nailed two goals before Ondracek sealed the first period of play, sending his Crimson into the break with a 4-2 lead.
By the start of the third, the Crimson was up three. A five-point third quarter, including junior attacker Charlie Owens’ first point of the match, expanded Harvard’s lead to 13-8 heading into the final frame. Navy scored once more in the fourth while the Crimson nabbed two, propelling Harvard to its third consecutive victory against the Midshipmen.
After the first set of play, the Crimson built upon its two point lead by outpacing Navy in the second quarter, four goals to three. Blyashov, Ondracek, sophomore attacker Bruno Snow and junior co-captain defender Bennie Seybold combined for the second quarter effort, and Harvard returned to the locker room on top, 8-5.
HARVARD 12, NO. 18 GEORGE WASHINGTON 11
In its first matchup of the weekend, the Crimson faced its toughest opponent of the two-day invitational.
In the 12-11 back-and-forth tale with the Colonials (6-1), Harvard started freshman Noah Hodge in net. The first-year amassed a career-best 12 saves which, complemented by a season-high goal performance by Sechrest, helped to earn the Crimson the victory.
"We came out against GW a little bit lethargic, and we knew we needed to answer back after a poor first quarter," Sechrest said. "I think it really started on the defensive end and we were able to turn some stops into goals going the other way in the second quarter. Our freshman goalie Noah Hodge made some big blocks and helped to feed our attack."
Overall, Sechrest proved to be the offensive catalyst with a season-best five goals. Scoring early in the second quarter when Harvard faced a 4-2 deficit, Sechrest’s tally was replicated by Ondracek, Owens and Blyashov. By the time the first half ended, the Crimson had completely erased George Washington’s lead and tied the match at six apiece.
In the second half of play, a back and forth spurt was broken by Sechrest’s third goal of the game, ending the third quarter at 9-8. The back and forth picked up again in the fourth before Sechrest netted his fifth goal of the game to win with only 39 seconds remaining.
“This weekend against George Washington, Navy, and Fordham, the games were close due to some lapses in our defense, leaving our goalies exposed,”  Ondracek said. “On the other hand, our offense was really firing away, keeping us in the game…. We’ll look to keep up the unselfish play as we fly out to California this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hopes are high for this year’s edition of Harvard men’s golf. Captain and multi-time Ivy League Champion Aurian Capart heads up the squad this season, and he will rely on the support of high-performing juniors Ryan Rhee and Rij Patel, not to mention Grant Fairbairn returning for his second year after a prolific freshman campaign.
With this cast, the team appears poised for another deep run in the Ivy League Championship after last year’s third-place finish. But that is a long way away, and just as well: the Crimson currently finds itself in a bit of an injury crisis.
Fairbairn, for example, was unable to travel. Meanwhile, Rhee was suffering from a knee strain. With a third of the roster sidelined in total, the Crimson tripped to Farmingdale, New York, and teed off at the annual Doc Gimmler tournament. Able to field just four players instead of the typical five, the team would limp to a 10th-place finish in its first competitive tournament this year.
Harvard got off to a shaky start on Friday, finishing dead-last in 14th place with a team score of 301. The team’s performance improved markedly on Saturday—the Crimson finished sixth on the day, with its score of 285 marking a 16-shot improvement from the first round of play.
While the competition generally improved from Saturday to Sunday, Harvard regressed and shot a 288, three strokes over its second-round performance, meaning that the injury-plagued squad would slip to 10th in aggregate.
Though the 10th-place performance on the whole seems underwhelming, there were some positive signs that the team hopes to extract from the weekend. The sole Crimson freshman impressed. Brian Isztwan, a native of Huntingdon Valley, Penn., shot a team-low 217. Isztwan’s score finished one, two, and three strokes lower than those of Patel, Capart, and sophomore Peter George, respectively.
The verdant Harvard swinger finished tied for 30th overall out of 83 competitors. Making the jump from high school to Division-I golf is difficult. Between the overall level of competition, the added pressure, and the elevated difficulty of the course, everything is more difficult. In his new surroundings, however, Isztwan handled himself with precocious poise for a freshman.
“Brian played with great composure all weekend,” Capart said. “He focused on the process, which is admirable for someone that only had a few days of practice with us. I am happy it paid off in the first tournament already. We expect great things from him.”
This weekend was also a “welcome back” for George, whose most recent competitive match for the Crimson prior to the Doc Gimmler was last fall. George had been sidelined after wrist surgery for the entire spring semester of his freshman year. While the sophomore may hold higher standards for his future performances, this weekend marks the beginning of George’s return to competitive match play, where there will surely be some rust early on this season.
Captain Capart’s performance was solid—a description he would be content with, considering last spring’s struggles. The Belgian’s last tournament was in May, so during Friday’s first round especially, he felt rusty and needed to make adjustments. And he did just that.
After a difficult first round in which he shot 80—tied for second-worst of all first-round scores—Capart improved by an astounding 10 strokes in round two. In the final round he shot a 69, which only seven players eclipsed.
Patel also had an unspectacular yet solid performance, shooting a 75, 69, and 74 over the course of the weekend. His second-round 69 was good for fourth-best that day, proving that, at their best, Patel and Capart can beat most anyone. But for both golfers, finding consistency will be paramount as the young season progresses.
For the Crimson, the Doc Gimmler can serve as some much-needed tournament experience and a springboard to kick the season into motion. While individual players will continue to strive for consistency in the coming weeks, the team will benefit greatly from the return of Rhee and Fairbairn from injury.
“We are focused on health and clearing the rust going forward,” said Capart. “We will continue to focus on process and hopefully this will bring the results that we know we are capable of producing. In the meantime, we will only focus on what we can control.”
The Crimson’s next test is at Dartmouth in the Quechee Invitational on Sept. 22.
