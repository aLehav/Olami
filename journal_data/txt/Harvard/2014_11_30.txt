After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 30, 2014, at 3:45 p.m.
Six of the seven student plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit last week that seeks to compel the University to “immediately withdraw” its holdings from fossil fuel companies discussed their decision to take legal action during an informational meeting held Tuesday afternoon at the Law School.
Kelsey C. Skaggs, one of the Law students involved in preparing the suit, said that the decision to file a suit came after many attempts at dialogue with the University over the past three years had gotten “absolutely nowhere.”
The plaintiffs, who refer to themselves as the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, will be representing themselves pro se, or without legal representation. Joseph E. Hamilton, another Law student working on the case, said the group made this decision because they felt it was “more appropriate” to represent themselves as students of the University.
According to Hamilton, the lawsuit is the first of its kind in the fossil fuel divestment movement. The only other divestment suit led by students was filed in Oregon over the University of Oregon’s investments in companies profiting in apartheid South Africa, Hamilton added.
Skaggs, Hamilton, and Alice M. Cherry, the third Law school student among the plaintiffs, began research for the case in January of this year, they said.
The case is based on two counts, the first of which argues that the University is mismanaging its funds as a public charity, and the second of which claims that the University is intentionally investing in “abnormally dangerous” activities.
Addressing the lack of precedent for this kind of case in Massachusetts law, Cherry said, “There’s a long history of tort law expanding liability [of defendants].”
Cherry cited the decision to begin holding hospitals accountable for the negligence of their doctors as an example of increased liability following a suit. Examples like this, the plaintiffs say, give them reason to believe that Harvard could be held liable for environmental damage caused by investing in fossil fuel companies.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Benjamin A. Franta, another one of the plaintiffs in the case, served as the group’s scientific advisor and compiled the scientific information that makes up part of the group’s legal argument.
“Harvard has tried to make a virtue out of greed, saying ‘we have to do this,’” Franta said of the University’s decision to continue investing in fossil fuel companies.
“We’re asking for Harvard to throw their lot in a trajectory that will help us in the future, and not hurt us,” Franta added. In addition to Franta, Skaggs, Hamilton, and Cherry, there are three undergraduate students also listed as plaintiffs, and “future generations” are included as an eighth plaintiff.
Harvard has not yet indicated how it will respond to the lawsuit. University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly stated that the University will not divest, arguing that such a maneuver would improperly politicize the endowment and detract from the University’s ability to support research and dialogue on ways to combat climate change.
In conjunction with the suit, an escrow donation fund that will accrue interest will be set up for those who wish to donate to fossil fuel-free University initiatives. The fund will be withheld from Harvard until the University decides to divest, the students said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard had seen it before. As Massachusetts guard Trey Davis rose up for a three—his team down two and the clock winding down—the scene was eerily familiar
Memphis. Colorado. St. Mary’s.
All situations when the Crimson had fought a quality nonconference opponent down to the wire, only to see defeat stolen from the jaws of victory. Two years ago, against the same Minutemen (5-2), it was Sampson Carter draining a corner three as time expired to send Harvard home empty-handed.
On Saturday, the Crimson held on as Davis’s shot rimmed out. Senior wing Wesley Saunders’s three-point play with 38 seconds left—which had put Harvard (4-1) up three—proved to give the team an insurmountable lead as the Crimson notched its best nonconference victory of the year, 75-73, in a game in which neither squad led by more than three in the final 17 minutes.
“That was a terrific, terrific college basketball game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think anyone who watched that game, played in it, coached in it, you recognize that both teams really competed hard and put on a display that was an incredible effort from both squads. I can’t say enough about our kids.”
All of the previous nonconference shortcomings had come away from Lavietes Pavilion, where the Crimson has now won 53 of its last 56 contests. However, Harvard’s first sold-out game of the year felt very much like a road contest for the Crimson, as a screaming UMass student section made its presence felt. Harvard looked rattled early on, falling behind by six as co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi was relegated to the bench by two early fouls.
Playing without its best post defender, the Crimson turned to a platoon to defend star UMass forward Cady Lalanne. Coming in averaging 15.2 points per game, the burly Lalanne made just five of 11 shots and had six turnovers, with sophomore Zena Edosomwan and senior Kenyatta Smith giving him fits defensively in the post.
Edosomwan, Smith, and junior Evan Cummins were the stories of the game—combining for 25 points and 13 rebounds to keep Harvard within striking distance after its shooters failed to produce. On the afternoon, the Crimson made just 33 percent of its threes but 57 percent of its twos, outscoring UMass in the paint, 38-32.
“We mentioned to our team in the locker room that it was a team win,” Amaker said. “I thought that [Cummins and Edosomwan] gave us real solid minutes. I thought Zena’s play in particular was just a big shot in the arm, giving us production and scoring against that team when we were struggling to score.”
However, despite its best efforts in the post, Harvard struggled to take the lead. After closing a seven-point deficit to two with two minutes remaining in the first half, the Crimson made just one of five shots the rest of the frame. UMass capitalized, taking a six-point lead into the break on a late trey by Donte Clark.
The Minutemen exploded out of the gate in the second half, scoring seven quick points to take a game-high nine-point lead with 18 minutes to go.
Then came the Saunders onslaught. The senior, who led all scorers with 27 points on the afternoon, either scored or assisted on each bucket of a 9-0 run that drew the game even at 45. Overall, the senior had a hand in 23 of the Crimson’s 43 points after intermission.
“I think in the first half we were a bit stagnant on offense, just standing around,” Saunders said. “In the second half, we had a little bit more movement, guys making picks and rolling hard…. I think we made some good adjustments.”
Both teams kept each other at arm’s length the rest of the way. Harvard took its first lead since the opening moments on a layup from junior co-captain Siyani Chambers with 12 minutes to go, but UMass quickly retook control on a Lalanne layup. After Harvard seized a three-point lead—its biggest of the night—with 10:31 remaining, Lalanne had back-to-back buckets to put the Minutemen in front once again.
When UMass threatened to take control, bringing the building to its feet on a Zach Coleman dunk, it was Saunders with five straight points—including a pull-up three in transition—to put Harvard right back in front. The Crimson gave the lead right back two minutes later, only to pull ahead on Miller’s trey with 2:22 to go, after which Harvard never trailed again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a game that had to come down to its waning moments.
The Harvard (4-1) and UMass men’s basketball teams (5-1) battled neck-and-neck for 39 minutes Saturday afternoon. For the final 17 minutes of play, neither team built a lead that exceeded three points.
Fittingly, the final minute would prove decisive. And who else would be the one to step up but senior wing Wesley Saunders.
With under a minute remaining and the teams knotted at 71, the Crimson’s offensive possession appeared doomed. As passes around the perimeter amounted to nothing, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers dumped the ball off to Saunders.
“I knew a play needed to be made,” Saunders said. “I just tried to get to the basket any way I could.”
He did just that. Saunders cut his way to the hoop, absorbed contact, and finished a floating layup as the referee blew his whistle with the foul call. As the Harvard contingent roared, Saunders pumped his fist. The senior converted the free throw, and Harvard took a 74-71 lead with 38 seconds remaining.
UMass, however, would not go away. After a layup from guard Derrick Gordon and a missed Harvard free throw, Gordon once again made his way to the baseline with his squad down one. As Gordon elevated for the close-range shot, Crimson seniors Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi went up with him. The attempt, which would have given the Minutemen the lead, clanked off the iron.
“You don’t want to foul down the stretch, especially with us having 10 fouls,” Smith said. “So we just wanted to contest and get a hand up there.”
Even then, the drama had not yet concluded. Down two points with as many seconds remaining, UMass center Cady Lalanne chucked a baseball pass down the court from under his own basket. The rock ended up in the hands of Trey Davis, who launched an uncontested shot from just beyond the three-point line.
As the ball hung in the air, UMass and Crimson fans alike fell silent. When it rimmed out, the Crimson faithful could finally breathe once more as its team escaped with a hard-fought 75-73 victory.
A BALANCED VS. SINGLE-HANDED ATTACK
Harvard and UMass may have recorded baskets at equal rates throughout the game, but there existed few similarities in the sources of offensive production for the two squads.
Touting a balanced attack, UMass obtained points from throughout its lineup all game long, with five different players scoring in double-figures. Davis and Lalanne led the team with 13 points apiece, but its fifth-highest scorer was only three points back when the final buzzer sounded.
“When you have a balanced attack, it’s very difficult [to defend] when you can get production from a lot of different areas,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s why [UMass is] going to be one of the better teams we play all year.”
By contrast, as it has for much of the year, Harvard relied overwhelmingly on one man—Saunders. The senior showcased his usual fadeaway jumpers, layups in traffic, and exemplary body control to score a season-high 27 points. Smith was the only other Crimson player to reach double-figures with 11 points.
Saunders took over the game in the second half and provided buckets at crucial moments. In addition to his decisive three-point play with under a minute to go, Saunders nailed a clutch trey and netted two late free throws to put the Crimson ahead.
Sophomore Zena Edosomwan and Smith provided jolts of energy for Harvard on the offensive end but it was the play of Saunders from start to finish that—once again—propelled Harvard to victory.
A ROAD GAME AT HOME
Lavietes Pavilion was rocking Saturday afternoon. But it was the fans clad in Minutemen red—not crimson—who were making all the noise.
Chants of “U, MASS” echoed throughout the building all game long. On three separate occasions, UMass forward Maxie Esho threw down resounding one-handed dunks that brought the roaring, partisan crowd to its feet.
“They had a great turnout and a great crowd,” Amaker said. “That’s what makes the game even that much more rewarding and meaningful and special for us to be able to pull it out.”
Indeed, the home contest felt like a road game for Harvard, perhaps contributing to the team’s first half struggles. After taking an early 5-2 lead, the Crimson did not regain the upper hand until less than 12 minutes remained in the second period.
Matters were made more difficult with Moundou-Missi in foul trouble. After picking up two quick fouls, the co-captain was called for his fourth personal early in the second half, forcing him to the bench for 13 consecutive minutes.
Moundou-Missi’s teammates, however, managed to persevere in the hostile environment. Despite only finishing with five points, Chambers notched nine assists. The team also demonstrated its improvement in breaking the press since its 24-turnover loss to Holy Cross, only coughing up the rock eight times to an aggressive UMass defense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three teams from Massachusetts stand in front of the Harvard men’s ice hockey team in the national rankings. With Saturday night’s win, the Crimson has now taken them all down this season.
Led by solid performances from its sophomores—including two goals from sophomore forward Luke Esposito—No. 18 Harvard emerged victorious over No. 4 UMass-Lowell, 4-2, at the Paul E. Tsongas Center. The last two games have seen the Crimson topple two opponents ranked in the top five nationally.
“Putting together these wins has been an excellent feeling,” sophomore forward Luke Esposito said. “We’re going into every game feeling that we can win…. We can compete with anyone.”
A cross-checking penalty on the River Hawks (8-3-3, 5-0-2 Hockey East) midway through the second period gave Harvard (7-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC) a chance to break a 2-2 tie that had been intact since the beginning of the frame.
UMass tried to clear the defensive zone, but Harvard sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson was able to corral the puck before it left the zone. Anderson darted for the net and put it past goaltender Jeff Smith to give the Crimson what would end up being the game winner. Esposito’s second goal of the night—an empty-netter with two minutes left—secured the victory.
Harvard also converted on another of its five power play opportunities of the night. Nearly halfway through the first period, junior forward Jimmy Vesey fired a shot wide of the net off a faceoff win by classmate Kyle Criscuolo, but the puck bounced fortuitously to sophomore forward Tyler Moy, who jammed his fourth goal of the year past Smith to put Harvard on the scoreboard first. Harvard’s 31 percent conversion rate on the power play leads the ECAC.
UMass-Lowell responded to this first goal with one of its own less than two minutes later. Freshman C.J. Smith was able to snip a goal over the shoulder of junior goaltender Steve Michalek to knot the game at one goal apiece.
Esposito’s first goal of the night put the Crimson up again. After junior defenseman Patrick McNally went to the penalty box to nix a Crimson power play opportunity, junior forward Brian Hart picked up the slack, finding open ice toward the net and sending a pass across the ice to the sophomore who slipped it past Smith.
The offense overshadowed the overall defensive effort of the Crimson on the night. The back lines only allowed 17 shots on goal from the River Hawks, of which Michalek was able to save 15. Harvard ranks second in the conference in goals allowed, conceding an average of just over a goal and a half per game.
“I thought we shut them down pretty well defensively and executed our game plan,” Esposito said.
One of these goals came in the beginning of the second period after a holding call on freshman Wiley Sherman put Harvard down a man. Less than 30 seconds later, C.J. Smith beat Michalek for the second time of the night to pull even with the Crimson.
Masked by Harvard’s recent success is the fact that the team’s penalty kill has struggled in its past three contests. After going its first seven games without conceding a power play goal in 24 attempts, special teams have now allowed three goals of this ilk in the last three games.
But Anderson’s goal once again broke the tie in the Crimson’s favor and stopped the River Hawks, an unfamiliar foe for the Crimson. Despite both being based out of the same state, the two have only faced off once in the past decade—a 5-0 blowout win for UMass-Lowell.
The Crimson now boasts a four-game winning streak, which the team has not strung together since Feb. 2011.
“I think we’re a much more confident team [than last year],” Esposito said. “It’s a huge influence going into every game when you know you can win. You play harder, and you play stronger.”

Lamont’s 24-hour status means that knowledge is constantly being produced beneath its hallowed roof. I took the opportunity to imbibe 8 hours and 41 minutes of sweet wisdom. Below is a sampling of my observations from the illuminating night.
10:00 p.m.I settle into Lamont Café. According to Google, the sun will rise at 6:41 a.m. In the intervening eight and a half hours, revelations are sure to come.
10:11 p.m. A girl with thick-framed glasses that don’t look like they have an actual prescription exclaims “Kafka is my favorite!” excitedly. The learning begins.
10:53 p.m. “I love the fur, it’s real coyotes” says a girl extolling the virtues of Canada Goose coats.
11:31 p.m.“The champagne is a farce. The mimosas are gonna be extremely strong. It’ll be blue raspberry vodka.” - Larista
11:30 p.m.Someone comes in to conduct a psych experiment. It involves candy. I am not asked to participate.
11:58 p.m. I decide that this video is immensely important.
12:04 a.m.A man refers to the “Larista” as an American hero.
1:08 a.m.“Why the fuck would I want to send money over Snapchat? Does it go away if I don’t use it in 10 seconds”
1:30 a.m.It smells like stale cigarettes here.
1:40 a.m.The Larista summarizes a Spongebob episode and fields trivia.
2:00 a.m.The café has closed but the trivia continues. We are now on to Fairly Oddparents.
4:03 a.m.Silence has descended on the café. A guy in a fedora who has been passed out for the past 3 hours has now shed his fedora in his never-ending quest for a comfortable sleeping position (for now he’s huddled in the fetal position in the chair)
4:30 a.m.Completely new ideas for a paper that come after 4 a.m. are always good, right? Realizing the error of my previous ways, I walk briskly back to my dorm room to retrieve a necessary book.
4:36 a.m.I get back from my dorm room. As I type fedora guy wakes up, dons his fedora and backpack, and leaves. I feel an immense sense of loss.
5:54 a.m.Work on my paper has long since stalled. I decide to take a stroll around the library that’s sure to be regenerative.
On my stroll I create an intricate, painstakingly crafted statistical analysis of who is asleep and who is awake.
Level B: 1 asleep, 1 awakeLevel A: 0 asleep, 2 awakeLevel 1: 3 asleep, 2 awake (excluding Larsen, and Lamont Café)Level 2: 1 asleep, 2 awakeLevel 3: 2 asleep, 1 awakeTotal: 7 asleep, 8 awake
6:23 a.m.The sun begins to rise. I can now make out Mem Church’s steeple quite clearly.
6:41 a.m.The sun is up, the day has begun, and I write a witty, yet somehow beautiful and poetic ending to this piece. Then I go sleep till class.
