After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House Faculty Deans Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten announced Friday morning that they will resign their positions in June 2017, coinciding with McDonald’s retirement from her role on the Faculty.
“I am retiring in June as a faculty member. And that prompts retiring as a Faculty Dean,” McDonald said in an interview Friday.
In an email sent to Mather residents, McDonald and Rosengarten expressed gratitude for their time leading the House, and highlighted increases in House resources and programming during their tenure.
McDonald and Rosengarten were appointed to the positions formerly known as House masters of Mather House in 2010, and will retire having served in the role for seven years. McDonald is a professor of French Language and Literature and of Comparative Literature, and is a renowned expert on French literature from the 18th century and 20th century. Rosengarten, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist, is an associate professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.
Reflecting on their nearing retirement, McDonald and Rosengarten said their time as Faculty Deans was very positive. “I’ve been an engineer, I’ve been a doctor, I’ve been a cardiologist, I’ve been an associate dean, but being a Faculty Dean was the best of all,” Rosengarten said.
“And me, I’ve never left school because I’ve been a professor all my life,” McDonald said.
Each pair of Faculty Deans oversees one of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential Houses. They are responsible for House life, hiring tutors, and the well-being of undergraduates. During their tenure, McDonald and Rosengarten oversaw the implementation of a “Fast Pass” program making it easier for students to register parties in Mather, and piloted a sophomore orientation program to help integrate the House’s newest members.
McDonald and Rosengarten said promoting inclusion and diversity have been paramount priorities as Faculty Deans.
“Our largest concern for some time has been the issue of race and diversity. We’ve tried some new ways of dealing with it, but we feel that that’s really important to protect our students, you know, whatever their diversity is, and it's been quite gratifying to do that,” Rosengarten said.
The Faculty Deans also used their retirement announcement as an opportunity to advocate for greater inclusion and respect following the rancorous 2016 presidential election.
“This fall has been a difficult time in our nation through a campaign that has not only been acrimonious but emboldened rhetoric and acts of hate. We at Mather feel a special responsibility to support all of our students, tutors and staff, and to protect a respectful and inclusive community that is home to all who live and work here,” the email said.
McDonald and Rosengarten cited Mather House’s people and architecture as their favorite part of their time as deans.
“We love our concrete. But the main thing is the people that make up the community,” Rosengarten said.
Many students expressed surprise at the announcement and said they would miss the deans in their absence.
“I’m definitely sad to see them go,” Melonie N. Vaughn ’19 said. “Pretty much everyone in Mather is probably going to agree that they were a really important part of the Mather community and it’s going to be really different without them.”
Prior to Rosengarten and McDonald’s announcement, the most recent Faculty Deans to step down were Currier House leaders Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross last fall.
McDonald and Rosengarten said that once their replacements were selected, they would help make their transition as smooth as possible.
“We’re going to try as hard as we can to support the new incoming Faculty Deans and also support our tutors that are going through the transition so the community survives,” Rosengarten said. “The concrete will survive, but we want the community to survive, too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 3, 2016, at 10:00 p.m.
A 10-alarm fire broke out in Cambridge Saturday afternoon, setting multiple buildings ablaze and drawing firefighters from as far away as Newton, Mass.
The fire was contained to one building as of around 9 p.m., according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. By that time, upwards of 50 to 60 people had been displaced from their homes, he said.
The fire began in the afternoon on Berkshire Street, near Kendall Square, and eventually spread to reach at least 11 buildings and several cars parked on the street, Warnick said. Between five and six people have suffered minor injuries due to the blaze, Cambridge Fire Chief Gerald Reardon told CBS Boston.
None of those injuries were severe, according to Warnick.
At one point over the course of the evening, more than 130 firefighters from 17 or 18 companies were trying to put out the fire, CBS Boston reported.
Power has been shut off in the area surrounding the blaze, according to CBS Boston, and the shutdown is likely to continue through the rest of the night. Eversource, an energy company servicing New England, told CBS Boston that more than 1,600 of its customers were without power due to the fire as of about 6 p.m.
The Cambridge Fire Department tweeted out a warning about a “structure fire” at 2:52 p.m. Eight separate fire departments from around the region planned to send help, the Globe reported.
Firefighters had to battle the flames while facing winds up to 25 miles per hour and breathing in dense smoke, according to the Globe.
There is a shelter open for those affected by the fire at the War Memorial Recreation Center on Cambridge Street, with Red Cross representatives “available” to help, according to a tweet posted by the Cambridge Fire Department around 5:30 p.m.
Shelter is also available at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School on Broadway Street, according to the Globe.
Police and fire officials are asking everyone to avoid the area, according to WCVB Boston. Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons has established a Mayor’s Fire Relief for those who wish to donate to people affected by the blaze.

Reardon told CBS Boston the investigation into the cause of the fire will be “long and protracted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With seconds left on the clock in the first half, co-captain Siyani Chambers drove inside and kicked the ball out to sophomore guard Corey Johnson. Johnson stepped back and nailed the three as time expired to give the Crimson a 29-25 lead. Despite an early Fordham (5-4) comeback in the second period, the Harvard men’s basketball team would hold on in the second half to secure the 64-52 win.
“Obviously for us it feels great to have a victory under our belt after we have struggled and trying to find a rhythm, against a team that plays incredibly hard,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We knew how hard Fordham plays, how aggressive they are defensively, so I’m really pleased with our guys.”
With a smaller-than-usual starting lineup, the Crimson (2-4) was able to move past some of the shooting struggles that plagued them in three consecutive losses before Saturday’s win. With a starting lineup of Chambers, Johnson, and freshmen Bryce Aiken, Seth Towns, and Henry Welsh, Harvard shot a season-high 48 percent from the field.
“We thought, because of going against Fordham and their style, we thought that we needed a bit more ball handling and we wouldn’t suffer from it as much,” said Amaker. “With Bryce and Siyani in the backcourt and Corey on the perimeter maybe getting perimeter shots and Seth as kind of that second big guy, I thought it was an adjustment that was well received this afternoon.”
Despite a strong second half, the Crimson struggled to create offense early on. In a first period that saw seven lead changes and five  ties, Harvard turned the ball over nine times and was held to a single field goal for a period of over five  minutes halfway through the first.
Co-captain Corbin Miller, however, was the spark from the bench that the Crimson needed. He wouldn’t miss a shot in the first half, going four-of-four from the field and two-of-two from beyond the arc for 10 points.
“We’ve had the looks and we haven’t been able to nail them like Corbin did and relieved a lot of pressure on our team,” said Amaker. “We haven’t been able to have those moments when we’ve been able to get two and three of those shots to fall and getting a cushion or a lead…so I’m really pleased and proud that it was Corbin.”
Miller wouldn’t be the only bright spot coming from the bench, as Harvard’s reserves would outscore the Rams’ 24 to 10.
Beyond the strong offense, Harvard was also able to limit a high-scoring Ram’s squad to 52 points on 33 percent shooting. Despite averaging nearly nine three-pointers a game, Fordham was held to five treys on 26 percent shooting from beyond the arc.
After a 4-0 run to begin the second half, the Crimson struggled to pull away from the Rams. A jumper from Aiken would extend Harvard’s lead to eight, but Fordham would respond in tandem with two threes and a dunk off of an Aiken turnover to tie the game at 35.
“It’s definitely frustrating when there is the unforced error always,” said Miller. “When we’re moving the ball and we’re getting into rhythms like that, there’s going to be unforced errors, there’s going to be turnovers, there’s going to be missed shots, but the key is, if you’re moving the ball, the shots will fall.”
Luckily for the Crimson, it began to fall late in the second half. After the Rams tied the game, both Aiken and freshman forward Robert Baker, Jr. would make it to the line to give Harvard a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. Aiken would add to the lead after dribbling down the court to drain a corner three after shaking his defender. The Crimson would proceed to go on an 8-0 run late in the second half to close the game out.
“The last couple games we’ve obviously lost but they’ve all been relatively close games, a lot of late game runs or opening half runs,” senior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “I think today was definitely a step in the right direction in terms of maturity and kind of growing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most difficult assignments of the fall semester always arise in December. Sometimes they’re papers. Often they’re exams. Other times they’re hockey games.
Yet, when pinned against two opponents riding month-long unbeaten streaks this weekend in upstate New York, the eighth-ranked Harvard icemen answered the bell. And they delivered two punishing blows.
After trailing No. 19 St. Lawrence (9-5-4, 6-1-2 ECAC) early on Friday, the Crimson (8-2-1, 4-1-1) lit the lamp four consecutive times en route to a 4-2 victory that snapped a Saints’ nine-game unbeaten streak. Then after falling behind 2-1 to Clarkson (9-6-3, 5-2-1) the next night, Harvard rinsed and repeated. Another string of four straight goals put the Crimson on the path to a 7-3 win, this time bringing an eight-game unbeaten run to a halt and capping Harvard's first North Country sweep in 14 years.
HARVARD 7, CLARKSON 3
As part of its four-goal rally, the Crimson blanked the hosts, 3-0, in the second period. Junior Seb Lloyd’s tip-in minutes into the middle frame pulled Harvard even at two. Then freshman Nathan Krusko went five-hole on the doorstep at 8:36 to give the Crimson its first lead of the night from the power play.
The Harvard man advantage finished 2-for-5, with senior Tyler Moy responsible for the other conversion—a first-period strike that beat Clarkson goaltender Jake Kielly short-side from below the left faceoff circle. Moy also netted what proved to be the game-winner late in the second period off a two-on-one with linemate Sean Malone, putting Harvard up 4-2 heading into the second intermission.
Sophomore Ryan Donato got in on the action in the final frame, slapping a shot through Kielly’s five-hole from the left faceoff circle at 5:33. The Golden Knights did get one back with 12:32 remaining and threatened to pull closer on a 6-on-4 in the game’s final moments, but Donato tacked on the first of two shorthanded empty-netters that sailed the length of the ice and sealed the deal. Malone netted the second.
Clarkson had jumped out to a promising start, however, nearly squeaking a puck over the line amid a scramble in front of goal during the first minute of action. The officials never got a good enough look—neither in real time nor via replay—to call a goal, but the Golden Knights would strike first about six minutes later anyway.
Senior Troy Josephs’s difficult-angle breakthrough near the goal line gave Clarkson an early edge before Moy’s power-play goal two minutes later at 9:05 tied the game at one. But in the spirit of quick responses, the hosts went right back in front at 10:08 when senior A.J. Fossen batted a bouncing puck out of the air and through the pads of junior Merrick Madsen.
“I liked our early part of the game,” Clarkson coach Casey Jones said. “It was just one of those nights where we didn’t sustain who we have to be and how we have to play for 60 minutes, and they took advantage of it. We turned pucks over in critical areas of the ice, and they can make you pay.”
Harvard’s takeover during the final two periods featured a 28-14 advantage in the shots on goal department, and more importantly, a 6-1 edge on the scoreboard for the visitors.
Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot and freshman defenseman Adam Fox each registered a pair of helpers, marking their third consecutive games with multiple points.
HARVARD 4, ST. LAWRENCE 2
Kerfoot lit up the scoresheet even more so on Friday, playing the role of scorer or distributor on each of the Crimson’s four tallies. The co-captain scored Harvard’s first two goals, then assisted on its next two to produce his second consecutive four-point performance and the third of his career.
“It’s no secret to the coaching staff and the guys in that locker room that Alexander Kerfoot’s a hell of a player,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He’s certainly been there for us every night.”
The New Jersey Devils prospect scored in each of the first two periods. With the Crimson down 1-0 but up a man late in the first, Kerfoot knocked down an attempted Saints’ clear, moved in on goal, and lasered a shot over the glove of junior netminder Kyle Hayton from point-blank range. Then 5:42 into period two, the co-captain finished off a 2-on-1 with sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage to put Harvard up, 2-1.
Making the second play happen was Fox, who recognized that St. Lawrence was in the middle of a line change and fired the puck the length of the ice to Zerter-Gossage to create the chance. Fox finished with a career-high three helpers, picking up a secondary assist on Kerfoot’s first goal and the primary dish on the eventual game-winner.
That score would belong to Moy, who picked up his first power-play goal of the weekend from the top of the left faceoff circle, where he beat Hayton with a glove-side one-timer. Senior Luke Esposito added the fourth Harvard goal off a perfect feed from slot to goalpost courtesy of Kerfoot.
Ted Donato said Friday’s performance was probably the “best team game” his side has played all year, and he went on to call the play of his goaltender excellent. Madsen only had to make 22 saves, but a few of them were particularly key, including a glove save on Joe Sullivan midway through the third after the junior broke free on a shorthanded breakaway with the Saints down 3-1.
Meanwhile Hayton, who had posted a .961 save percentage over St. Lawrence’s nine-game unbeaten streak, hardly had a shot of stopping any of the Crimson’s four scores.
“We got our butts handed to us tonight,” St. Lawrence coach Mark Morris said. “So we’ve got to find a way to regroup.”

Life is great. Classes have finally ended and you’ve broken out your best holiday playlist, filled to brim with classics like “Deck the Halls” and Justin Bieber’s “Mistletoe” . But then you suddenly remember that the hardest two weeks of the semester are looming ahead. That’s right: finals are literally just around the corner. We wanted to take a break from our otherwise hilarious content to share a few study tips:
Make Notes Worth Studying: cut through the crap of lecture notes and psets, decide what’s important and put it on one page. If it doesn’t fit on the page, it’s probably not that important. Color code, decorate, whatever works for you. Put it on your desk or your dresser, wherever you’ll see it often. But the most important part is making the sheet, so don’t take your friend’s cheat sheet and put it on your wall instead of doing it yourself.
Test Yourself Often: Put away your notes for half an hour, go chat with your roommate, then get out a fresh sheet of paper and write down everything you remember. Compare with your previous notes and fill in the blanks in a different colored pen. Or, if you’re feeling really intense, make a practice test (with an answer key) for friends in your section–you’d be surprised how often you can guess the types of questions that will be on the actual exam.
Location, Location, Location! Like real estate, where you study matters almost as much as how you study. We think it’s best to switch it up, keep things interesting. Maybe treat yourself to a Café Crema latte and crank out an essay (no internet access, so you won’t be distracted by Facebook), or check out the silent room in Widener. When you feel yourself losing momentum, take a short walk, fill up your water bottle, or change locations entirely. Sometimes breaking your rhythm can make you more productive.And if you want to be really creative, go study outside of the Harvard bubble. Here’s a list of great locations.
Plan Ahead: if you’re reading this article, you’re already on your way to planning ahead. This is the oldest advice in the book, but still the best. A little bit of studying every day is far better than a lot of studying one day–your sleep schedule and your mental health will thank you. So make a study plan now, block out an hour per day per subject, and avoid that last minute cram.
With that said, don’t forget to take lots of breaks. The weather is still bearable, and it’s the holiday season, so don’t waste away in Lamont café. Happy studying!
