After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The administration has been remarkably tight-lipped about any structured plans for next year’s inaugural “January Experience,” the chunk of post-break January in which Harvard students are encouraged to do something productive rather than take an extended vacation. While the administration has been quick to provide ideas about how to spend the extra three weeks—study abroad, short internships, research, or intensive academic courses have all been presented as viable options—it has not promised the guidance necessary to bring these suggestions to life. In addition, January housing will now be limited to students with a demonstrated need to remain on campus. We worry that those attempting to spend free time in a productive, meaningful way will find this to be a very substantial obstacle.
 January housing should operate on an “opt-out” framework. All students should have the default option of staying in their dorm rooms from the day after the end of winter recess to the day that marks the start of spring term. Many Harvard students will want (and ought to have the option) to spend their January working on extracurricular activities on campus or at jobs and internships in the Cambridge and Boston areas—two options that would be much less feasible without guaranteed campus housing. Renting an apartment is costly and more difficult for short time periods and would be especially challenging for students on financial aid.
Of course, the cost of maintaining the Houses and freshman dormitories during the entire month of January is high, and limiting available housing could save the College costs through heating, dining, electricity, and water bills. The College has not yet specified whether entire Houses will be closed, forcing students to move into “open” houses, or whether all students allowed to stay on campus would be permitted to live in their own rooms. The administration has stated that Annenberg would be the only dining hall to be open during the month. Making sacrifices to cut costs is, of course, a necessary measure for a January Experience that will presumably debut in an economic climate that is still unfavorable. Strictly limiting housing, however, is not the answer.
The College could minimize costs during January without resorting to drastic measures. To gauge how many students intend to stay on campus for their January Experience, the administration could conduct a survey early in the year and then decide how many dining halls, libraries, and other facilities to keep open during the interlude. Cutting back on the usage of such facilities would hopefully generate enough savings to allow every student wishing to remain at Harvard to live in his or her room.
Beyond cost-saving, the administration has additional reasons for limiting January housing. In an interview with The Crimson, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds expressed concerns with having idle students on campus when no programming would be available for them. Unfortunately, this attitude reflects a lack of trust in the student body to find productive activities and stay safe, even when class work is not occupying student schedules.
The largest problem is that there is such a scarcity of concrete information that it is difficult even to understand the administration’s January plans. Many questions remain surrounding the current proposal. For example, will entire Houses be closed? And who specifically will be recognized as having a demonstrated need to stay? Will student groups receive housing if they plan to work on projects during January? We worry that many questions do not have concrete answers, which is troubling given the diminishing time left to make decisions.
While the creation of any new program in a university setting is bound to lack complete clarity, certain logistical aspects need to be articulated from the start. A plan for housing is an essential aspect of J-term. Moving forward, we hope that the administration will not only guarantee housing for students wishing to remain on campus but that it will also provide more general information about the program for students who will have to plan their month accordingly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This month, high-school seniors across the country are deciding where to spend their next four years, and anyone who fought through the droves of tour groups crowding the yard last Friday knows they’re doing their research. Every college, after all, is different—in fact, too much so, according to educators in some states. 
On Wednesday, universities and colleges across Indiana, Minnesota, and Utah announced a pilot project that would set common learning standards across institutions in those states. The project, supported by the Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation for Education, will specify a consensus-based set of skills, rather than a subjective number of credits earned or courses taken, that qualify a candidate to receive a degree in a particular field. In effect, one program advocate told The New York Times, “If you’re majoring in chemistry, here is what I expect you to learn in terms of laboratory skills, theoretical knowledge, applications, the intersection of chemistry with other sciences, and broader questions of environment and forensics.” The goal, it appears, is to give students, universities, and employers a greater degree of comparability and quality assurance across institutions that current, less consistent degree standards cannot provide.
 Some standardization may be desirable, and even necessary, in what is often so subjective an enterprise as education, but the project’s pioneers should tread carefully.  While any standardized test—whether MCATs, SATs, or APs—risks encouraging educators to “teach to the test,” explicitly requiring that degree programs include certain material effectively forces them to do so. When done too zealously, curriculum standardization not only stifles ingenuity, but also severely limits academic freedom.
Even without the newly proposed standardization, colleges are already subject to objective standards and at least some degree of quality control. Universities are evaluated every ten years by accrediting institutions, such as the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (for Harvard and other area institutions), are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Beyond that, universities develop their own reputations with employers based on qualities that are perhaps the most practicable of gauges: the real-world competence of graduates. That said, the onus should be on employers to understand what each candidate will bring to a position based on their degree and school and, where they are unfamiliar with these, to do their research. While more degree standardization may make hiring a bit easier, its implications for education as a whole outweigh whatever convenience it may provide.
Especially at the university level, where each institution has its own distinct character, regulating instruction across institutional lines only discourages intellectual diversity. Moreover, each professor who develops a course can add a different ingredient to that particular field—an aspect of higher education that makes it especially unique and one for which a large degree of autonomy is essential. This is not to say that the Lumina Foundation’s new project threatens to end diversity in itself—its framers explain that educators at each individual school will retain their prerogative to design courses and curricula so long as they comply with the agreed-upon framework. Nonetheless, Lumina should question whether its program is heading in the right direction. Significant curricular differences may make decisions harder for the Class of 2013, but they would be foolish to have it any other way.

My fifth-grade teacher must have experienced an unusual level of confusion as she prepared seating charts and memorized names 15 years ago. Our class of 25 had two “Heidi H”s, a difficulty exacerbated by the fact that they shared not only the same appearance (blonde, blue-eyed) but also the same full name: there was Heidi Hansen, who played violin, and Heidi Hanson, the gymnast. In high school, the main office dealt with the problem matter-of-factly by announcing them on the intercom as “Heidi Hansen E-N” and “Heidi Hanson O-N.” It was only during college that I realized how uniquely Iowan it was to have two students in such a small sample sharing such a Scandinavian name.
So I smiled when I visited the website of the Des Moines Register two Fridays ago and found an article by a guy named Hansen about a guy named Hanson. The title, too, was typically Iowan: “Judges, recorder all did their jobs.” It suggested the kind of no-news story that would only appear in a capital-city paper in the middle of nowhere.
Except that this was news. Hansen E-N was praising the Iowa Supreme Court for unanimously upholding the earlier verdict of Hanson O-N, which declared that Iowa had to provide marriage to same-sex couples. Many of the Iowans who commented on the page joined Hansen in celebrating the decision; some, of course, objected strongly. Yet the most common reaction from non-Iowans was neither approval, nor dismay, but shock: “Gay marriage? Iowa?”
Yes, Iowa. Although many of the stereotypes about the Midwest are true, they rarely do justice to our progressivism—an aspect of Midwestern culture as significant as publishing newspapers with no news or responding to “thank you” with “you bet.” Every election cycle, the national media lumps Iowa together with every other so-called flyover state into a place named “the heartland” and emphasizes how strongly we believe in “family values,” which means they can count on us to be fanatically religious, vote Republican, and, naturally, hate gay people. Even after the court decision, journalists like USA Today’s Dan Gilgoff continued to portray Iowa as “a culturally conservative heartland state.”
Iowa did vote for Bush—though by only a 0.67 percent margin—in 2004. My publicschool district did prohibit school activities on Wednesday night to reserve time for church groups. And it’s true that, for as long as I’ve made the 20-minute drive from my house to the University of Iowa campus, I’ve been greeted by a massive sign over one soybean field declaring, “God is pro-life—Are you?”
But it’s also true that my former congressman, Jim Leach, was one of only six Republicans in the House to vote against authorizing the war in Iraq and the only one to vote against Bush’s 2003 tax cut; despite these moderate views, he lost my district to a Democrat in 2006. That Democrat, Dave Loebsack, now sits in the Congressional Progressive Caucus alongside Barney Frank ’ 62 and Bernie Sanders. Iowa also gave Barack Obama his first victory of the primary cycle, silencing those who insisted that an African-American candidate couldn’t win in an overwhelmingly white state.
Even more revealing of Iowa’s true progressivism is its history. As Pat Murphy, the speaker of the Iowa House, and Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal pointed out in a statement lauding the verdict, gay marriage is only the most recent issue on which Iowa has been ahead of the times. They note that our supreme court outlawed racially segregated schools in 1873, almost a century before Brown v. Board, and that Iowa was the first state in the Union to admit a woman to the practice of law, doing so in 1869.
“When all is said and done,” Murphy and Gronstal write, “we believe the only lasting question about today’s events will be why it took us so long. It is a tough question to answer because treating everyone fairly is really a matter of Iowa common sense and Iowa common decency.”
And while I’m tempted to suggest—as they do—that such forward thinking is the province of my home state alone, the reality is that it’s as much a part of the fabric of the entire Upper Midwest as Hansens and Hansons are. Now that Iowa has taken a stand for marriage equality, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota probably aren’t far behind.
It’s time that progressive organizations and progressive people stopped thinking of the Midwest as a lost cause. By organizing an equal-marriage suit in Iowa, gay-rights groups demonstrated a remarkable understanding of who Midwesterners really are. Marriage Equality USA, discussing the significance of the Iowa decision, explains that “we know in our hearts, it is only a matter of time for America to turn its back on this history of discrimination against same-sex couples.” We’ve known it in our heartland for a while too.

Imagine taking out a life-insurance policy, not on yourself, but on a sick man who lives down the street. That way, if he dies, you’ll be sure to turn a profit. This is but one of many bizarre features in the world of credit default swaps—a financial instrument that crippled our global economy. While many different events and policies contributed to the financial crisis, it is safe to point a finger at credit default swaps. The U.S. government should decisively regulate these complex financial instruments.
When a group of J.P. Morgan bankers conceived credit default swaps 19 years ago at the Boca Raton Resort & Club in Florida, they could not have imagined what a monster they had unleashed. In 2007, the credit default swaps market value was $62 trillion, more than quadruple the entire U.S. gross domestic product.
A credit default swap is an insurance policy on an investment. Wall Street took out insurance on risky investments, like taking insurance out on your car. The party that issues the CDS agrees to insure an investment in the event of a loss, and, in return, the CDS buyer agrees to pay a monthly premium. However, a CDS is not your average insurance policy. Insurance is highly regulated, and CDSs are unregulated, creating many dangers. 
In a typical insurance policy, the insurer must set aside some money, called collateral, that proves that it can make some payoff when needed. There was often little or no collateral required for CDSs. The obvious problem is that in an unforeseen catastrophe, the insurer may not be able to honor its commitment. Therefore, the CDS buyer must totally trust that the issuer is good for the money. 
This trust requires considerable faith in rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. To make a low-risk purchase of a CDS, a firm needs to buy from an insurer with an excellent credit rating. If any of these ratings are inaccurate or get downgraded, this will dramatically affect the CDS and cause panic. Therefore, the government must institute a reasonable collateral requirement for the sale of CDSs. Further, rating agencies must closely monitor investing schemes that use insurance from highly rated firms like AIG to make risky investments in poorly rated firms.
A firm can purchase a CDS on a company with which it has no direct relationship. Consequently, if a firm looks like it will fail, one can purchase a CDS on it so that when it collapses one receives the insurance payout. This incentivizes firms to work against each other and was one reason why Lehman Brothers collapsed. As the Financial Times asserts, “a house insured for more than its value is always considered a fire risk.” Healthy competition among banks is essential to a vibrant economy, but incentivizing the failure of banks is not. Furthermore, the government should regulate who is eligible to buy a CDS. If a firm attempts to purchase a CDS without the intent to insure their own investment, strict scrutiny should be applied. 
Although CDSs work like insurance for investments, buying and selling them is similar to trading stocks. This generates a hazardous web of firms that hedged bets by both buying and selling CDSs. If one firm defaults, it cannot pay out the next firm’s insurance that can cause another firm to default, and so on. To further complicate matters, since CDSs are unregulated, there is no authority to which these transactions are reported. Thus, no single firm knows how many CDS deals have been made, and firms do not know to whom most CDSs have been sold. Additionally, after the original transaction, a firm may sell its end of the CDS bargain to another firm without notifying the original counterparty. This exposes the financial system not only to a significant chain reaction, but also an inaccuracy in gauging it, even as it occurs. 
The ensuing panic results in a lack of confidence, since one cannot be sure if a company is doing as well as it claims to be. Therefore, the government must make CDS transactions a matter of public record. 
Finally, many CDSs insured products ill-suited for insurance. Insurance works best when a disaster is random, infrequent, and independent from other disasters. This is not the case for mortgage-backed securities. In the housing market, prices are dependent on the surrounding area. A firm can attempt to mitigate this problem by slicing up mortgages and repackaging them in complex financial instruments like collaterized debt obligations, but the risk persists. If enough houses drop in value, others will follow, and this domino effect is the current housing crisis. 
For CDSs that back investments in mortgage-backed securities, this is especially potent. There is no way to insure a disaster that in turn causes other disasters. It would be like providing health insurance when one heart attack induces a chain of other heart attacks in the population. Therefore, the government must regulate CDSs to guarantee that insurance firms have the capital to remain solvent.
These are only a few of the issues to be fixed with credit default swaps. Although they are not innately bad instruments and can provide much-needed liquidity, when left unregulated they can be used in ways that cause tremendous detriment to our financial system. It is not surprising that investor Warren Buffet refers to credit derivatives as “financial weapons of mass destruction.”

While neither Somali nor seaborne, many people around the world are nevertheless pirates. Internet users outside the United States are absurdly unable to access American television shows through the networks’ websites directly or via Hulu. Left with little choice, they master the murky world of link compilers such as sidereel.com and surfthechannel.com, conduits for illegal videos hosted by such sites as megavideo.com and others. Even in America, distribution of cable shows is so inefficient that domestic viewers resort to piracy. The networks’ shocking response to such desperate demand for their products has been not to expand accessibility and profit, but to clamp down on it. Consider Viacom’s legal showdown with YouTube. And has Disney confused itself with DeBeers? The profound shortage of common sense in such moves—given that the fundamental driver of a content creator’s success is the size of its audience—is reflected in the black market’s vibrancy: Not more than half an hour after their original broadcast on the East Coast, most shows are uploaded across the Internet.
Consumers of television programs often have only one or two price points to choose from if they want a full television season: either free, if they download illegally, or more than $20 if they choose iTunes, DVD, or Blu-ray. There are far more consumers at $0 than at $20, even though consuming at $0 takes on a criminal hue. Those willing to buy at some price in between are completely ignored. Abroad, where a viewer can only consume at $0, the choice is obvious. The television industry risks annihilation in the near future, but the enterprise certainly should not be in this position.
Hollywood produces our most competitive exports by a long shot; its creative capacity and production quality are unmatched anywhere in the world. NBC Universal would as soon relocate its studios to Shenzhen as Nike would build a new factory in Malibu. This type of competitive advantage is rare and extraordinarily valuable. It is completely bewildering, therefore, that networks are unable to translate it into profits, as explained in a recent article in The Economist. These are the types of businesses, after all, that ought to flourish in the economy of the future.
Unlike newspapers, TV shows are not competing against new technologies such as blogs. The television show’s only competitor is itself, a Sisyphean punishment for an indefensibly retarded response to the Internet. A show on fox.com is competing with the exact same show on youku.com and tudou.com, Chinese versions of YouTube. Foreigners pine for a taste of the gold standard of entertainment and will find a way to get it. Rather than play a fruitless game of cat and mouse with a billion Chinese, networks and producers ought to harness the potential of this vast audience. Admittedly, there have been efforts to do so as recently as last year through acquisitions of international media outlets and distributors, but the efforts have been halfhearted. Our brothers in the United Kingdom—so loyal in times of war—still cannot watch the most recent episode of 30 Rock without breaking the law.
Online advertising revenue may not soon supplant DVD sales in developed countries.  But, where legal, high-quality DVDs are either unavailable or have simply lost out to cheap, low-quality pirated ones, whatever little revenue may come in from the Web is worth it. American viewership is accelerating its decades-long flight to cable channels. In the short term, networks need whatever revenue they can get. Internet broadcasts point the way forward. Active experimentation on a global scale is the only way to refine the current model of online advertising and distribution into something that can support the costly day-to-day operations of the networks without an extreme dropoff in the quality of their products. This experimentation does not require staggering investments and must begin in earnest.
In the future, one way forward for the broadcast networks is to capitalize on certain Internet websites as fee-paying distributors. Just as cable providers and satellite-television companies pay carry fees to producers of content, Internet entrepreneurs could arrange local advertising or subscription services that would allow them to pay content creators for certain programming. Websites with a -large number of active users, such as Facebook, would become the new Comcast. Networks would thus pass the problem of garnering advertising revenue on to the new websites, who are already actively struggling to find a solution. With such alluring content, even that problem may evaporate more quickly. Other websites would cater to certain niches, such as gathering subscriptions and advertising for shows about doctors. This type of surgical precision in targeting high-quality viewers may allow for sustainable business models to crop up. 
We in America watch on average 151 hours of television programming a month, more than ever. The rest of the world is fast catching up. With the right moves, the American businesses behind this enormously successful set of products stand to reap a veritable bonanza. I understand that change in Hollywood, that iconic land of individual wheeler-dealers, comes slow, but the pussyfooting must end now.

It all started back in September.
The Harvard men’s volleyball team hadn’t participated in a playoff game since 2005, but first-year coach Brian Baise set the bar high right away, aiming his sights on the postseason.
Seven months later, despite injuries, a depleted roster, and a new coaching staff, the Crimson has reached that goal. Harvard (11-6, 6-1 Hay), relying on senior leadership and team chemistry, carried itself to a share of the EIVA Hay Title with a 3-1 (30-25, 30-32, 30-13, 30-21) victory over visiting Sacred Heart on Saturday. With just one game remaining against second-place Rutgers-Newark, the win guaranteed Harvard a spot in the playoffs. 


“It feels great,” Baise said. “Our guys really wanted this game, and we’ve known that for a long time. I’m really proud of them.”
The win came at the perfect time for the Crimson, with the team recognizing seniors Jeff Nathan and co-captain Brady Weissbourd on Senior Day for their achievements during their four-year tenure. 
“I hope it means a lot to the seniors, because it represents all of their accomplishments,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “These are the seniors to take us to the playoffs. They played great today.” 
And while Weissbourd—who led the team with 24 kills—has received much attention for his stellar play, Baise also gave credit to Nathan for the team’s success. 
“He’s a leader on this team in so many ways,” Baise said. “Fundamentally, he’s really good and really reliable. He’s exactly what you hope for in a senior.”
Harvard and Sacred Heart started off cold in the first set, trading point-for-point until a service ace by Weissbourd gave the Crimson a 13-11 lead. Riddled with service errors, both teams had trouble establishing their respective offensive game plans, and the set was highly contested until the end. 
“We served really poorly the first two games,” Baise said. “No matter how hard you practice, there are always cases where you can’t replicate the pressures of live games.”
“It’s always the jitters when you played your last game a week ago,” Weintraub said. “When the other team misses serves too, it’s easy to slack off. It’s unfortunate when you return the favor, but we were able to turn it around in the third set.”
But back-to-back aces by Weissbourd seemed to be exactly what Harvard needed, putting the team up, 23-21. The rest of the team, led by junior Erik Kuld and junior co-captain Gil Weintraub, would take care of the rest, and the Crimson cruised to victory after yet another service error by the Pioneers. 
Harvard continued to play sloppy volleyball in the second set after falling behind, 15-11, early. Sacred Heart would capitalize on eight Crimson service errors to squeak out a 32-30 set victory to even the game at 1-1. 
In the third set, a different Harvard team stepped onto the court. After jumping out to a quick 4-0 lead, the team improved from its mediocre .273 hitting percentage in the second set to a gaudy .609 in the third. 
“We talked about playing aggressively in all parts of the game,” Baise said. “Sometimes when we don’t play as well, we start to play more conservatively. It all started out with the serving, which made it easier for us to get our offense going.”
In the third set, Sacred Heart had no answer for Weissbourd, who served five straight times to give the Crimson a 13-5 lead. The 6’9 outside hitter put an exclamation mark on his storied Harvard career when his signature spike, always loaded with velocity, knocked down a Sacred Heart player to get the crowd roaring with approval. Such was the scene for a frustrated Pioneers team that committed five more errors than serves for a team attack of -.200. 
One set away from a share of the league title, the Crimson remained relentless in the fourth frame. Despite getting in a 12-12 tie early on, Harvard took the lead for good after a kill to the right corner by Kuld put the team up, 22-17. A light tap by Jones to center court gave the Crimson its fifth straight win and the playoff spot Harvard had been gunning for since the beginning of the season.  
“The team is an extremely hardworking, goal-oriented team,” Baise said. “That was clear in the off-season. It took us the first half of the season to start playing the way we do now.”
While the Crimson has every right to celebrate its achievements, its players and coach realize that a determined Rutgers-Newark team will do everything to prevent Harvard from clinching the title outright. 
“It’s not very often that you have your destiny in your own hands,” Weintraub said. “It’s a tremendous opportunity for us, and that’s exactly where we want to go into Rutgers. We’re going to train really hard for it.”
“We’ve got a big game against Rutgers and we hope to win a playoff game or two before it’s over,” Baise said. “We have some work to do.”

Harvard and Yale may be bitter rivals, but on Friday, the two squads teamed up to face Oxford and Cambridge in the 42nd annual staging of a meet that pits two of the top academic institutions in the U.S. against the top two universities in England. The trans-Atlantic meet uses  unique scoring system in which the visiting team decides which points system will be used— this year, Oxford and Cambridge chose the “winner-takes-all” system, where only one point is given to the winning team per event, and the Harvard/Yale women trumped their English counterparts 12-7 while the American men fell to Oxford and Cambridge, 10-9. Overall, the combined men and women’s team outscored the British teams, 21-17, to claim the coveted Naughton Trophy once again. The Harvard/Yale-Oxford/Cambridge meet is the world’s oldest continuing international intercollegiate competition, dating back to 1894. The two countries involved trade off hosting each other, and this year, the four teams headed off to New Haven, Conn., for the historical event. “There’s sort of one word that sums it up and that’s tradition,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “There’s a tremendous amount of tradition and history with this meet. This Friday shaped up to be another great competition. I was really pleased with the way the teams competed, and it was a lot of fun to be part of.”Co-captain Becky Christensen, in the second HYOC match of her career, said she enjoyed not only competing on the track but also getting an opportunity to meet track athletes from the other side of the Atlantic. “Sure, they’re from England,” Christensen said. “But we have a lot in common with them, and it’s really cool to be friends with people you wouldn’t normally meet.”Before the match began, Saretsky and Yale coach David Shoehalter sat down to discuss which members of the Crimson and Bulldog teams would represent the universities on the track. “[Harvard-Yale] is only allowed two total on the track for each event,” Saretsky said. “Every track event has only four contestants.”Despite a limited roster, the Harvard track team continued to shine, receiving solid performances from both the men and the women. Favia Merritt, also the co-winner of the most valuable performer’s award, won the 100- and 200-meter dash with a time of 12.31 seconds and 25.41 seconds, respectively. The senior sprinter also was part of a winning 4x100 relay, which also featured Crimson senior Brittan Smith. Christensen out-jumped her competition once again, and reached her 1.75-meter record mark for the second time this season. On the men’s side, freshman Nico Weiler won the pole vault event, clearing 5.20 meters and setting a new HYOC match record. A familiar face to the Crimson was also on hand to compete Friday. Clara Blattler ‘08, a Rhodes Scholar and former standout women’s pole vaulter for Harvard, represented Oxford in the match, and placed first in the pole vault event with a clearance of 3.50 meters. Friday’s performance not only gave the Crimson athletes a chance to hone their skills on the track, but also offered a rare opportunity to scout out their competition. Harvard will meet Yale next week, this time as opponents. “Our training is geared towards performing at our best as we go into Harvard-Yale,” Saretsky said.But for the moment, Saretsky and his team enjoyed participating in this historic event. “It’s an honor to compete in this event,” Christensen said.Representatives of the track team also headed down to Brown for the Brown Invitational on Saturday. “Brown was more an opportunity for our developmental kids to get in a competition, to knock the rust off before we take on Yale,” Saretsky said. Leading the Crimson in Providence was sophomore distance runner Eliza Ives, who won the 1500-meter event. “[Eliza’s] been a scorer for us in the past,” Saretsky said. “She’s really rounding into form as we head into the heart of the outdoor season.”But it was clear that the main focus of the weekend for the track team was the HYOC matchup.“Theres something really special about it,” Saretsky said. “Our student-athletes recognize the importance of this competition, and had a lot of fun.”—Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the start of a hectic Easter Weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team sought to resurrect its Ivy League championship prospects.Unfortunately for the Crimson, it proved too hard a feat.With its Ancient Eight defense faltering, Harvard (10-9, 2-2 Ivy) took to the open road to face-off against former title challengers Princeton (11-8, 3-2 Ivy) and Penn (10-10, 1-4 Ivy). In a mixed outcome, the Crimson fell to a narrow defeat against the Tigers but delivered a solid win over the Quakers—characteristic of an unusually unpredictable Ivy League season.“It’s a strange league—[all] the teams are very even. We could easily be the top team in the league,” head coach David Fish ’72 said. “It’s topsy-turvy...you never really know what kind of surprises are in store.”HARVARD 5, PENN 2Following the previous day’s loss to Princeton, the Crimson looked to salvage some pride on Saturday in Philadelphia, against a Penn team with only one win in its Ivy League season. With a senior class looking to finish with a flourish, Harvard recorded a morale-boosting win.“The guys responded really well against Penn,” Fish said.An overpowering sweep of the doubles set the tone for the Crimson. At No. 2, the partnership of sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien and senior Sasha Ermakov won resoundingly against Justen Roth and Phil Law (8-2), followed by a point-clinching win for the No. 3 pairing of junior Michael Hayes and freshman Alistair Felton (8-1). Gloss was duly applied at No. 1; sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans and co-captain Chris Clayton fought back against the Quaker’s Hicham Laalej and Adam Schwartz to win 8-7 (7-5).Harvard continued to dominate in the singles. At No. 2, Chijoff-Evans defeated Jonathan Boym in a comprehensive 6-2, 6-1 win, doubling the Crimson advantage.But a stirring Penn comeback leveled the scores. Straight set defeats at No’s 4 and 5 for freshmen Davis Mangham and Felton—6-2, 6-2 and 6-4, 6-3 respectively—set the stage for a tight finale.With three points remaining, Harvard’s seasoned veterans took center stage.The Crimson regained the lead through the groundstrokes of No. 3 Sasha Ermakov, overcoming Schwartz in a 6-2, 6-4 win. With the Quakers on the edge, senior co-captain Michael Kalfayan, restored to the starting line-up, clinched the match in dramatic fashion—winning at No. 6 in a third set tiebreaker, fighting back from a set down for the win (4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)).“[Kalfayan] has been playing superb tennis in practice,” Fish said. “It was finally time for him to get a chance.”PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3In a difficult matchup, the Crimson took to the Jadwin Gym courts in New Jersey on Friday, needing a win to boost its Ivy League title chances. With the stakes high, it was the Tigers who edged a closely-fought battle.“It’s just one of those really tough losses, where we needed maybe a couple of days just to get our guys back and together,” Fish said. “Princeton didn’t miss a beat.”Harvard’s winning prospects improved with an opening victory in the doubles. At No. 2, the partnership of Ermakov and Omodele-Lucien overcame Princeton’s Ryan Kim and Ilya Trubov (8-4).It was to prove a false omen. No. 3 partnership Hayes and Felton fell to an 8-3 defeat, while the No.1 combination of tenacity and power—Clayton and Chijoff-Evans—was unable to defeat counterparts Peter Capkovic and Alex Vuckovic—the duo clinching the doubles point (8-5) and a psychological boost for Princeton.The Tigers proceeded to build on their advantage in the singles. At No. 1, Capkovic—the 2008 Ivy League Player of the Year—raced to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Clayton, doubling Princeton’s lead.The Crimson secured parity with a pair of victories. At No. 3, Ermakov recorded his second win of the day with a stylish win over Kim (6-2, 6-2). Avenging his doubles loss, No. 2 Chijoff-Evans defeated Vuckovic, rallying Harvard’s comeback with a second set tiebreaker win (6-2, 7-6 (3)).With the momentum swinging, the Tigers’ response settled the outcome.At No. 6, Hayes lost 6-2, 6-4 to Charlie Brosens, leaving the Crimson on the brink of defeat. The team’s fate was sealed shortly after at No. 3—Felton, unable to send his game into a third set in a tiebreaker, was defeated by George Carpeni (6-2, 7-6(4)).No. 5 Manghan replied with a win through a match tiebreaker, 4-6, 7-6(3), (10-5), but it was too little, too late for an outclassed Harvard.“We fought hard, they played better,” Clayton said. “It could hardly be more simple.”—Staff writer Allen J.

The Crimson women’s tennis team returned to the Murr Center this weekend to host its first matches in over four weeks. On Friday afternoon, Harvard (10-8, 3-1 Ivy) lost a vital Ancient Eight match-up to rival No. 46 Princeton (16-7, 4-1 Ivy) 5-2, but recovered on Saturday to defeat Penn (1-14, 0-5 Ivy) 4-3.The Crimson entered the weekend on top of the Ivy League standings, but the loss to the Tigers hurts Harvard’s chances at the league crown.“We know that we’re still in the race for the Ivy League championship,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Right now our focus is on winning every match...for the rest of the season.”Harvard is now just a half game behind No. 60 Brown, No. 44 Yale, and Princeton, and likely must defeat all its remaining opponents, including challenging match-ups against the Bears and Bulldogs next weekend, to take the title.HARVARD 4, PENN 3The Crimson defeated the Quakers for the first time since 2006, when Harvard was ranked No. 15 and Penn was No. 41. This time, although both teams were unranked, there were still critical Ancient Eight records at stake, as the Crimson kept its hopes alive for an Ivy crown with a victory.A day after Princeton snapped Harvard’s four-match win streak, its longest since winning eight straight in April 2006, the Crimson extended its doubles point win streak to six.Captain Laura Peterzan and freshman Camille Jania at No. 3 quickly disposed of their Quaker opponents 8-2 and moved to 6-0 as partners, while at No. 1 senior Beier Ko and sophomore Agnes Sibilski won 8-3.Sophomore Samantha Rosekrans and freshman Holly Cao, fought back from an early 3-0 deficit, but lost the set in a tiebreak, 8-7 (7-3).Avenging her 6-2, 6-0 defeat in last year’s match against Penn’s Ekaterina Kominskaya, Ko won the No. 1 rematch Saturday with a pair of 6-2 sets to improve to 7-5 at that position.Relying on her powerful backhand, Cao got back on the winning track at No. 5 with a 6-1, 6-2 win, despite feeling a little under the weather, according to Green.“I’ve always had a strong backhand,” Cao said. “I prefer my backhand. It just comes naturally I guess.”Sibilski clinched her ninth singles victory and the overall match for Harvard with a 6-4, 6-3 win at No. 4.“[Sibilski] was a little bit fatigued [from] yesterday’s match, so I’m really proud of the way she found a way to keep it close and come out with the win,” Green said.With the match decided, Peterzan fell at No. 2, 6-4, 6-2, while Rosekrans dropped her match 7-5, 6-4. Freshman Louise Laciny failed to take advantage of three Penn double faults in the super tiebreak, resulting in a 6-4, 6-7(4), 10-6 defeat. PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 2The Crimson began the afternoon with a sweep in the competitive doubles matches.Down 6-5 at No. 2, Rosekrans and Cao converted their next two break opportunities to win 8-6, finishing the match with a lob to the back left corner over the gazing Tigers’ eyes.Sibilski and Ko stepped up to the challenge of facing the No. 37 doubles pair in the nation, defeating the Princeton duo of Hilary Bartlett and Taylor Marable, 8-6, and clinching the doubles point for Harvard.“That was a great win for them,” Green said. “It’s definitely going to give them confidence.”At No. 3, Jania and Peterzan remained undefeated as partners, defeating the Tigers 8-4.“Camille and Laura have been really clutch for us this season so far, and they’re really growing as a team,” Green said.After two quick losses in singles by Jania and Sibilski, Peterzan succumbed 6-1 in her second set against No. 99 Bartlett after losing a first set tiebreak 7-3.With Harvard down 3-1 in the contest, Cao fought to keep the Crimson’s chances for an undefeated Ivy season—and her own personal undefeated record—alive but failed after falling behind in the third set and finding herself unable to recover. Princeton took the No. 5 match 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 and the overall contest with the point.But on a positive note, Ko earned her sixth victory at No. 1 with her 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 comeback victory.Rosekrans stunned onlookers in the first set after mounting a comeback from a 4-0 deficit to win the set, 7-5, on an overhead put-away on a lob while approaching the net. But her momentum didn’t carry into the following sets and she dropped the match 5-7, 6-4, 6-4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight crews finished in the runner-up position this weekend, after facing top-ranked national competition early in the season. While the No. 10 heavyweight crew battled difficult conditions against No. 7 Princeton, Cornell, and Bucknell for the Class of 1975 Cup, the No. 4 lightweight team advanced to the Grand Finals of the Knecht Cup only to finish behind the top-ranked Wisconsin Badgers.With the Class of 1975 Cup on the line, the heavyweights took to New Jersey looking for a win, but Princeton showcased its signature speed and swept both varsity eight races.Despite managing to keep close with the Tigers, the Black and White’s varsity eight came up nearly seven seconds short against the Tigers, who took the race with a finishing time of 7:23.2.“Unfortunately, Princeton got a bit of a jump in the first 500 [meters] and we were two lanes away from them,” senior Liz Demers said. “So we weren’t able to be racing right next to them. After the first 500, we were able to hold for middle 1000.”The second varsity eight was able to give the Tigers a run for their money, as both crews managed to leave Cornell and Bucknell in their wake and entered the last 500 meters of the race even with one another. That was when Princeton’s speed got the better of Radcliffe, and the Tigers, finishing at 7:32.2, defeated the Black and White by 2.9 seconds.“They’re known for fast starts in the race, so really our goal for the past week was working on trying to stay with them in the first quarter of the race,” Demers said. “They’re known to get out very quickly. Each year, facing them early in the season is always a challenge, because they’re always ready to race.In the five races that featured the two varsity eights, the varsity fours, and the novice eight, Radcliffe claimed only one victory when the Varsity Four B prevailed with a time of 8:07.4. Both Cornell and Bucknell bested the Black and White in the novice eight.  The varsity four A finished at 8:10.4, nearly six seconds behind Princeton and four seconds behind Bucknell. “We’re still working on lineups and getting good training in, but it’s hardly a predictor of the rest of the season,” Demers said. “I think we have a lot of speed to find and gain, and I think we can do that in the next few weeks.”On Saturday, facing some of the best competition in the country, the No. 4 Radcliffe lightweight crew team finished in second place at the Knecht Cup on the Cooper River in Camden, New Jersey. Both the first and second varsity boats qualified for the Grand Final race, which also featured three boats from Wisconsin and one from Lafayette.The Black and White’s runner-up finish marks the second straight year that Radcliffe has fallen just short of bringing the Cup back to Cambridge.The Wisconsin A boat crossed the finish line at 7:41.5, 10 seconds ahead of the Black and White’s A boat, which clocked in at 7:51.7. Radcliffe’s second varsity finished at 8:26.0, 5.9 seconds better than the Wisconsin C squad but 20.2 seconds behind the Badgers’ B boat.“I think it was a great weekend to be able to race more than one team,” junior Medha Khandelwal said. “To get into a situation where you have six boats across and line up and go through the whole process, it was a great chance to race Wisconsin, which is a perennial national champion this early in this season.”During the first round of racing, the Black and White exhibited all the speed and athleticism needed to compete against top-ranked Wisconsin.“It’s like facing any other top team,” Khandelwal said. “They have proven themselves to be great races. Racing them is a great opportunity to rise to the occasion.”Though Radcliffe finished in fifth place in the lightweight four heat, each of the Black and White’s eights qualified for the Grand Final with a sub-eight minute performance, putting Radcliffe in elite company. Only the Badgers’ A boat achieved a similar performance by winning the first qualifying heat over the Black and White’s B boat with a finishing time of 7:42.6.—Staff writer Robert T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader against Yale, the Harvard baseball team could only muster two runs in a 4-2 loss. Add the near-freezing temperature and swirling winds sweeping O’Donnell Field, and Crimson coach Joe Walsh knew that the team might have take a different approach to manufacturing runs in the second half of the twinbill. So in the thirty minutes between the two games, Walsh talked to his team about being more aggressive—both at the plate and on the basepaths.Harvard (8-21, 6-4 Ivy) did just that, stealing six bases en route to winning the second game by the same score it had lost the first, and salvaging a split against the rival Bulldogs (10-14, 5-5).“We did talk about wanting to run,” Walsh said.“People get excited because they look forward to swiping the bag,” captain Harry Douglas added.The Crimson got some solid performances out of its strong crop of freshman pitchers over the course over the day. Rookies Jonah Klees and Brent Suter each made impressive starts, while Will Keuper and Conner Hulse helped in relief.“I’ve been using them all a lot,” Walsh said. “I’m hoping they’re not ‘freshman’ anymore.”Next up for the Crimson is a trip to Fenway this afternoon, where the team will take on Boston College at 2:05 in the Beanpot consolation game. Tomorrow afternoon, Harvard will make up Saturday’s rained-out doubleheader against Yale.HARVARD 4, YALE 2The top of the fourth inning provided the perfect opportunity for the Crimson players to use the aggressiveness that Walsh stressed in between games.With one out, Douglas doubled to deep left before senior Tom Stack-Babich was hit by a pitch. Sophomore Tyler Albright popped out, but then Walsh called for a double-steal that advanced the runners to second and third. This turned out to be the key moment in the game. On the following play, junior first baseman Dan Zailskas squeaked a single through the left side of the Bulldogs’ infield. Douglas scored to put Harvard on the board, a result that would have been unlikely had he still been on second base.Stack-Babich then came home on a Yale throwing error trying to catch Zailskas stealing second to put the Crimson up, 2-0.Suter pitched a gem, going 6 1/3 innings and giving up just one earned run while striking out eight. He was removed in the seventh after loading the bases with one out. Luckily for Harvard, Will Kepurer was able to come in and get out of the jam. Keuper first induced a groundout—which scored a run to knot the score at two—and then notched a strikeout to end a potentially big inning for Yale.“It was big to get the win in the second game,” Douglas said. “Our pitching was very good and there are a lot of positives you can take from this.”The Crimson responded in the bottom half of the inning, taking the lead once more after sophomore shortstop Sean O’Hara brought home Zailskas—who also closed the game for Harvard. The aggressiveness on the basepaths wasn’t all good, though, as O’Hara was thrown out trying to stretch his double into a triple.Harvard added an insurance run in the eight courtesy of a sacrifice fly from Stack-Babich, which plated senior second baseman Taylor Meehan.With Yale threatening in the top of the ninth, a nifty snag and strong throw from O’Hara guaranteed the Crimson a split. “It was a great clutch play by O’Hara to end the ballgame,” Walsh said.YALE 4, HARVARD 2The Crimson managed only six hits against Bulldogs’ starter Brandon Josselynm, who struck out six in his complete game win.Even when the Crimson did get men on base, the runners were often stranded. Harvard left seven men on base in the game.In the second, a tough third strike was called on sophomore centerfielder Dillon O’Neill with runners on the corners to end the inning, on a day in which the umps allowed for a wide strike zone, given the strong wind.“We didn’t do enough against them—not bringing guys in and not putting the ball in play enough,” Walsh said.Klees was nearly unhittable through the first three innings, but got into trouble in the fourth. The Crimson could have escaped with less damage had it capitalized on a running miscue by Yale. Instead, Klees was hit hard for three runs in the inning—and it could have been worse had it not been for a diving stop by O’Hara, which saved a run.“It’s those types of little things that we always seem to pay for,” Walsh said.Harvard pulled to within one run in the fifth. After O’Neill was hit by a pitch, Meehan—who was 3-for-4 in the game—crushed a ball to the fence in center field for a double. A sacrifice fly from senior Matt Rogers scored O’Neill from third, and a single from Douglas—who went 3-for-5 over the course of the day—brought home Meehan.Klees loaded the bases with no outs in the sixth, but then got a strikeout and a pop out. Sophomore Dan Berardo came into the game looking to get the third out, but walked in a run instead. Berardo was able to get the following batter to ground out to Douglas to keep the Crimson within striking distance.But Harvard’s offense was unable to score a run in the final two frames of the seven-inning contest, and the Bulldogs pulled away with a win.—Staff writer Jay M.

Two late-inning rallies were not enough for the Harvard softball team yesterday, which was swept by its New Haven rival yesterday. In both games, the Crimson (19-12, 5-5 Ivy) mounted a seventh-inning comeback, but ultimately fell short. Yale (16-16, 5-5) defeated Harvard, 7-4, in the first game of the doubleheader, and the Bulldogs won the nightcap, 4-2, at a frigid Soldiers Field.“In the seventh inning we started scoring some runs, but obviously we need to find the runs faster,” co-captain Hayley Bock said.The games came on the heels of Saturday’s rainouts, also against Yale, which will be made up Tuesday at 2 p.m.YALE 4, HARVARD 2For the second consecutive game, Harvard headed into the last inning with an uphill battle to face. Her team trailing, 4-0, junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, led off the inning with a hard-hit ball down the third-base line. Junior Jennifer Francis followed with a triple, knocking in Schellberg and knocking out the Bulldog’s starting pitcher. The run was Harvard’s first of the game.The situation got interesting when, with one out, sophomore Emily Henderson bunted home Francis to bring the Crimson to within two. Henderson—who had four hits on the day—was able to advance to second base on an overthrow. After sophomore Ellen Macadam grounded out to shortstop, power-hitting freshman Whitney Shaw—the team’s leader in batting average, home runs and runs batted in—stepped to the plate, representing the game’s tying run. It appeared that Shaw would take first base on a hit-by-pitch, but the umpire ruled that Shaw did not attempt to avoid the pitch. Shaw flew out to left field to end the game.“We are obviously pretty upset getting swept at home,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We’re in a rut. We’re not hitting. We need to hit, and it’s frustrating because we know we can do it.”“We are going to take extra batting practice,” the shortstop continued. “This hasn’t been us. This hasn’t been our team.”The Bulldogs were the first to put a run on the board, scoring on a dribbler up the first-base line in the second inning. Junior starting pitcher Dana Roberts helped her own cause by fielding her position well. Roberts, on a comebacker to the mound, threw home to retire the unforced runner from third base that was trying to score.It looked as if the Crimson might even up the score in the bottom of the frame, as junior Jessica Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer, led off with a double. A bunt by Vertovez advanced Pledger to third base, but Harvard was unable to bring her around.In the third inning, Yale loaded the bases with one out, which forced Roberts from the game. Coach Jenny Allard called upon junior right-handed pitcher Margaux Black to keep the Bulldogs at bay. But the first batter to face Black drove a single to right field, which knocked in two runs. The next Yale hitter followed with a single up the middle, scoring one. Junior centerfielder and Crimson sports editor Stephanie Krysiak’s strong throw home retired the second runner trying to score on the play.YALE 7, HARVARD 4In its first comeback attempt of the afternoon, Harvard tried to overcome a 7-1 deficit in the seventh inning. With one out in the frame, Pledger drove a double down the right-field line. Francis was next at the plate for Harvard, and the Bulldogs left fielder misplayed the ball, which allowed Francis to reach base safely and for freshman Jane Alexander, pinch-running for Pledger, to score. Francis also came around to score on another error by the left fielder. The Crimson then loaded the bases—with still just one out—and Shaw was hit by a pitch to force in Harvard’s third run of the inning. The Crimson could not bring any more runners home, and Yale escaped its three-error seventh inning for the victory.“We love to fight—we don’t want to roll over and die,” Vertovez said. “We want to get that energy to the beginning and middle of the game.”Harvard had taken the early lead over its long-time foe, 1-0, in the third inning. But the Bulldogs had a prolific fourth, scoring seven runs on five hits and two Harvard errors. At one point in the inning, ten consecutive Yale players reached base safely.  The seven runs were all Yale needed against Harvard, which left seven runners on base for the game.Star freshman pitcher Rachel Brown—who was perfect for the first three innings—lasted 3.2 frames. She struck out five Bulldogs and allowed two earned runs. In 3.1 innings of relief work, freshman Marika Zumbro gave up no earned runs.The Crimson players, who have failed to score a run in four of their past seven contests, are hopeful their bats will come alive when they play Yale again tomorrow.“We are going to mentally prepare, play with confidence, and know we can get it done,” Bock said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lightweight rowers swept Dartmouth and MIT to win the Biglin Bowl, and the heavyweight team took three out of five races from Brown to capture the Stein Cup Saturday morning on the Charles River.  The second-ranked lightweight varsity eight never trailed en route to a 12.1 second win over Dartmouth. The Crimson led by a length at the halfway point and continued to stretch the lead for the duration of the course. The win improves the varsity eight to 6-0.The second varsity eight followed suit by getting ahead early and never trailing as it clocked in at 6:19.3 for an 8.8 second victory over the Big Green.“We had a really solid performance today,” sophomore Andrew Trott said. “The team’s been working hard and the results are starting to show. With every race we improve, and it definitely helps to…have a good race, especially with good boats to race against.”The Crimson freshman eight opened the regatta for Harvard with a victory in which it also never trailed. Harvard and Dartmouth pulled away from MIT early, and the Crimson held a 4.7 second advantage with a 6:08.8 finish. Harvard’s second and third freshmen also had impressive showings, both defeating Dartmouth’s second freshmen. The Crimson’s second freshman boat rowed a 6:47.6, while the third freshman clocked in at 7:00.2 to narrowly beat the Dartmouth second freshman by 1.2 seconds.  Harvard held a comfortable lead throughout in the varsity four race and defeated the Big Green by 6.6 seconds to round out the sweep.  “We certainly put the training we’ve been doing all year to good use,” sophomore Jared Dourdeville said. “All the guys rowed strong and we had a good showing, but some of our toughest competition is yet to come. We have to build momentum and strength heading into championships—we can’t be complacent sitting where we are but we have to keep looking forward.”  The Harvard heavyweight varsity eight also had a strong showing at home, holding off a staunch Brown rally to secure a one-second victory in the Stein Cup.  The fourth-ranked Crimson took the early lead over the sixth-ranked Bears and nearly had a full-length lead shortly after the midway point. Brown rallied in the final 250 meters, but Harvard held on to finish the 2,000-meter course in 5:47. With this victory both the lightweights and heavyweights recaptured their coveted trophies.“We obviously expected some competitive racing,” captain Teddy Schreck said.  “It’s definitely an early test. We had a look at Brown last week, and we knew they were going to be fast. It was a good experience for us, and we were fortunate enough to come out on top.”  The freshman eight ran a solid race in its first outing of the spring to clinch a 3.4 second victory over the Bears. The Crimson came out ahead early and continued to build on its lead as it clocked in at 5:59.8. The Bears bounced back with a 3.1 second victory in the second freshman eight.  Like their lighter counterparts, Harvard’s heavyweights dominated the varsity four race, as four Harvard boats finished ahead of the Brown boat.  The A boat won the heat with a 6:29, with the B boat just one second back.  The D boat finished in 6:37 and the C crew finished two seconds back with 6:39, besting the Bears by three seconds. It was Brown who jumped to an early lead in the second varsity eight. The Crimson was able to keep it close and apply some pressure, but was never able to pull ahead as Brown rowed a 5:56 to win by five seconds. By getting so many of its boats into the water on the Charles, Harvard gained valuable perspective on the challenges that lie ahead in the spring season.“It’s definitely nice to have an indication of the crews, especially Brown since we will see them in the future,” Schreck said.  “Different crews will bring different things, and it’s nice to know what to expect when you line six boats across and to know who could come through down the stretch.”The lightweights will remain at home this weekend to take on Navy for the Haines Cup for its final dual race on the Charles, while the heavyweights will travel to Annapolis, M.D. to face Navy and Penn for the Adams Cup.

Last week, President Barack Obama hosted a friends and family seder in the White House's old family dining room. And the unleavened event was led by none other than one-time Harvard Dems President Eric P. Lesser '07.  Lesser, who could not be reached for comment, is currently a personal aide to Obama adviser David Axelrod. During the campaign, he served as a ground logistics coordinator (read: baggage handler).
Passover began at sundown on Wednesday. It commemorates the Exodus from Egypt over 3000 years ago, when the Jewish people escaped but didn't have time to let their bread rise. Thursday night's seder at the White House reportedly featured a reading of the Haggadah and traditional Jewish goodies like kugel and a roasted egg.
But matzo fast. Some Jewish community members who didn't make the invite list were a bit miffed at having been, well, passed over. Word got out when an email chain discussing the discontent was accidentally circulated. Said one staffer, “Apparently Jewish [sic] here and in neighboring states are now calling wondering why they have not been invited.”
Alas, no one can please all the people all the time. And if you needed more convincing that our current president is different from all other presidents, note that even though Clinton's staff also held seders, Clinton himself did not participate. Besides, the thought of Obama in a kippah makes FlyBy weak in the knees.

Sex, drugs, bubble wrap, bagpipe music, history theses…Flyby found out a last night that these are just a few of the titillating things that Adams residents secretly pine for.  They have been submitting their anonymous fantasies for a month, hoping that their innermost desires would be played out at the biennial Adams House Fantasy Dinner. Saturday night, all their wildest dreams came true.  Breakfast food for dinner?  Check.  Brighter lighting in the dining hall?  Got it (finally).
Find out what other fantasies Adams residents realized—including an Aesop-inspired race, a faux Bar Mitzvah, and the chance to hate on The Crimson—after the jump.
•	Adams House Masters being carried into the room like Prince Ali (and Jasmine) by half-naked Adams boys.  Kudos to the Masters for their royal good nature.
•	Twister on a dining hall table.  Looked like fun, but Flyby didn’t want to get too entangled in it.
•	Hall-wide massage.
•	Chocolate and strawberries.  The only announcement that could send a mass exodus of diners to the servery.
•	Omar Abdelsamad kisses ten Asian girls.  Before the smooches, each girl was asked to announce where she was from.  Flyby’s favorite moment: when Matt Corriel, the MC, confused “Iowa” with “Taiwan.”  We were also amused that one girl, who seemed to be wearing a Lisa Frank-esque sweatshirt, tried to run away.
•	Race between the tortoise and the hare. 
So much for the moral—the hare won!  But the tortoise was fake, so Flyby, like everyone else, was rooting for the hare anyway.
•	A piano strip tease.  Replace the pole with a piano.  Enough said.

•	Revenge on the Crimson. Everyone in the dining hall was asked to simultaneously text Maxwell L. Child ’10 his or her favorite food, sexual position, or species of monkey.  Some of the responses:
o	reverse cowgirl spaghetti baboon
o	orca style
o	bonobo
o	mango, dried mangoes, anything mango
o	creme broulee, bitch  [sic]
o	Your mom
o	Hand stand up against the wall
o	in the library on top of boookssssss
o	FOIE GRAS
o	I love being on top
o	The spread eagle

"If, for a moment, you think of your life at Harvard as an ocean voyage..."
From the moment we saw this line on page one, FlyBy knew the Advising Fortnight handbook would be a prime example of only-at-Harvard absurdity. It did not disappoint.
The packet, whose theme is "Chart Your Own Course," appears to have been designed by the guy who did the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.  Also, like most aspects of "the Fortnight," it seems like way too much money was spent on branding and not enough on substance (we have a wiki now! Web 2.0 ftw!).
For starters, the name of the program—was there too much good stuff for a week?  Too little for a month? Or were they just looking for the most pompous title possible?  Flyby is pretty sure the word "fortnight" went out of style once it started taking less than that amount of time to get from Independence, Missouri to Oregon's Willamette Valley.
More absurdity after the jump...
"Chart Your Own Course" takes the heady language to a new level:
Wow.  Just wow.  Where do we begin?
There are "infinite paths"? Really? We feel like even a mediocre statistician would tell you that the Harvard concentration list is, without question, finite.
Also, we're not so sure that all of the possibilities lead to "the right destination," metaphorically or in real life.  Didn't plenty of mariners end up wrecked on the rocks?  Was that the "right destination" for them? In the real world, have no Harvard undergrads ever regretted their concentration choice? In fact, if it's impossible to go wrong, what is the point of this "Fortnight" in the first place?
The worst part of the whole business is the absurd amount of money that seems to have been budgeted to this initiative over the past few years.  What were the College bursars thinking? "Frisbees, t-shirts, more useless swag for Advising Fortnight—Check.  Maintaining the Q Guide? Denied."
As awesome as it is to have a stack of Advising Fortnight notepads for jotting down thoughts about how ridiculous Advising Fortnight is, we think we'd prefer this money get spent on... well, practically anything. Here's what came to our heads in the span of 30 seconds:
We know advising is important, and that it's apparently improving, but we're confident it's not the t-shirts.  Promise.  Now, can we have more than one written question published in the new Q Guide?  Pretty please?

Chester French—specifically, former Crimson Magazine columnist D.A. Wallach '07 and Maxwell C. Drummey '07,  who have been making waves in the big, scary world of music—are going to perform on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on April 21st.
This also happens to be the day that the duo will release their full-length debut album, "Love the Future," which has been in the works for more than four years. Definitely not a publicity tactic. The boys just want to play some good music, you cynics.
It'll be a while until you'll be able to slobber all over your keyboard as you watch their performance on YouTube, so check out the jump to learn how in the interim, you can feel (somewhat) closer to Wallach's ruby locks and Drummey's greasy shower curtain known as hair.
On Wednesday, the band released their free mixtape, called "Jacques Jams, Vol. 1: Endurance," featuring collaboration with some big names like Pharrell, Jadakiss, and Lady Gaga. The collection has gotten some rave reviewers from well-meaning listeners, like "Shelley":
Must be some real powerful stuff.

Most of us have fond memories of Easter egg hunts.  Crawling through the grass on our hands and knees, scanning under park benches for glimpses of colored plastic, being shoved by some clambering kid who stole all the eggs we had clearly seen first—yes, those were the innocent days when we didn’t know or care about the essentially pagan origins of this holy day ritual.
Now that we’re wiser and taller, would the joy of rummaging through the shrubs for Easter eggs be the same?  Today, a handful of Eliot residents met in the courtyard to relive this childhood pastime.  Find out whether egg hunts are still all they’re cracked up to be, after the jump.
The hunt began at 3 p.m., with everyone rushing all around the courtyard with plastic shopping bags, cardboard boxes, and other substitutes for baskets.
Lizzy Elrod ’11, who was the main organizer of the event, announced that whoever found the one red egg would win the grand prize.  Within five minutes, Andrew Trott ’11 found it under a trash bin.  He won a Jesus figurine, but he decided he didn’t really want it and gave it to another egg hunter.
“I’m spreading the love,” he said.
“You’re a true disciple,” Elrod told him.
FlyBy doesn’t know why on earth Trott would give up Jesus, but we’ll admire his benevolence just the same.
By the way, hunting for eggs is definitely way harder than we remember.  FlyBy joined in the festivities halfway through the search but sadly came up with nothing.  We did find plenty of beer bottles, though.
One girl even brought back an empty vodka bottle.  We think she deserves a prize.
