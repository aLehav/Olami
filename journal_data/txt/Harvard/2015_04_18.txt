After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Environmental activist group Divest Harvard ended its six-day blockade of Massachusetts Hall on Friday after protesters delivered a petition demanding that Harvard divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels to Loeb House, an administrative building.
To deliver the petition, protesters walked from their positions at Mass. Hall to Loeb, the former home of Harvard presidents and the current meeting place of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. The building was guarded by Harvard University Police officers and bordered with police barricades.
After a short negotiation with an officer stationed at the entrance, Sidni M. Frederick ’17, who is a current Crimson Multimedia comper, walked through the fortification to deliver the petition and a letter from alumni. Former Harvard University Professor Cornel R. West ’74 and Medical School professor James M. Recht followed. More than 100 demonstrators chanted and sang protest songs, before returning to their blockade.
At a rally preceding the march to Loeb, West and other activists spoke to the protesters, denouncing Faust, who has repeatedly argued against divestment, maintaining that Harvard should address climate change through research and teaching.
In the afternoon, Divest Harvard held an open forum. The forum, which took place in a Harvard Hall classroom decked out with balloons and buckets of candy, featured Divest Harvard members and faculty and alumni affiliates discussing climate change and fielding questions from the audience.
On Friday night, hundreds of Divest Harvard supporters gathered in the Science Center plaza for a closing rally and subsequent march through Harvard Yard. Members from divestment campaigns at MIT, Tufts, Brandeis, and Boston College were also present.
“Heat Week,” which marked Divest Harvard’s largest set of demonstrations since the group’s conception in 2012, started on Sunday when members first blockaded all entrances to Mass. Hall, as previously planned and publicized. They later hung banners all around the building and pitched tarps and tents for a week of sleeping outside.
Faust on Thursday offered to meet with Divest Harvard members on the condition they stop “disrupting university operations.” The students continued their blockade, however, and did not meet with the president.
Besides its blockade of Mass. Hall, alumni supporters of Divest Harvard occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters on Mt. Auburn St. for about two days; on Tuesday, the group blocked off all the entrances to University Hall for about four hours, and on Thursday, the group again blockaded University Hall, that time for the full work day.
With their offices inaccessible for parts of the week, administrators worked from coffee shops or hotel lobbies. Few reacted with public frustration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a number of Harvard teams in action this weekend, The Back Page takes a look at some of the biggest games for Crimson squads as the spring season approaches its conclusion.
Softball:
Following a tough loss at Boston College on Thursday, the Crimson softball team (17-18, 8-4 Ivy) looks to snap a three game losing streak at home against a struggling Yale squad (8-17, 2-8) over the weekend. The Crimson is in second place of the North Division of the Ivy League, and if the team can come out with four wins, the squad will be in contention for first place with a thus-far dominant Dartmouth team.
Men’s Tennis:
Coming off a 5-1 stretch and having won the Eastern College Athletic Conference title, the No. 34 men’s tennis team (17-6, 3-1 Ivy) is looking to move up in the Ivy League standings at Yale over the weekend. The Eli's (11-9, 1-3) are looking to snap a three game losing streak and have also dropped three in a row against Ivy League teams. The Crimson swept the Bulldogs earlier in the year, 4-0. After Friday’s game, the team will travel back home for senior night at home against Brown on Sunday.
Women’s Tennis:
Having suffered a loss to Penn last weekend, the women’s tennis team (7-9, 0-4 Ivy) is looking to snap a four game losing steak against a visiting Yale squad (8-9, 2-2) on Friday and away at Brown (2-2, 9-8) on Sunday. This weekend will represent the Crimson's first matchup against each team. If Harvard manages to emerge with a pair of wins this weekend, the team can climb in the conference standings as it faces another conference rival, Dartmouth, a week from now.
Men’s Lacrosse:
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-6, 1-3 Ivy) comes into the weekend off a close loss last week against a visiting Penn team. The Crimson is facing a strong No. 19 Princeton squad (7-4, 3-1) away on Friday. Despite having a schedule ranked 10th most difficult in the country, Harvard has managed to snag some wins against strong squads such as Cornell and Holy Cross. The game is among the Crimson’s most important as it would keep Harvard in contention for conference playoffs.
