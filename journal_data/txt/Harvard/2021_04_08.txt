After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
With “Respecting Preceptors Means Reform,” you join the long tradition of abstractly calling for greater respect for preceptors at Harvard, while not supporting the kind of concrete improvements to our working conditions that such respect, if real, would entail.
Meanwhile, another Harvard tradition to which you appeal, that of using preceptorships as a path to “larger and more secure roles in academia,” is dead. You write that “Successful preceptors are expected to spread their wings elsewhere and vacate their positions for newcomers.” Here is some actual data to ground your lofty rhetoric: In the last six years, around 25 of our colleagues in the Harvard College Writing Program (which has the largest cohort of preceptors at Harvard) have left, most often because they were forced out by term limits. By our count, only three are now professors or on a tenure track. You are right that the paths to a career in higher education are scarce, but wrong that this is one. We appreciate your highlighting how excluded we were from the recent Faculty of Arts and Sciences review of the preceptor system, but your editorial reinforces many of its faulty assumptions about teaching, research, and the academic job market.
While more of our former colleagues have found lectureships elsewhere, just as many have quit teaching for administrative positions — often not because they wanted to, but because such positions aren’t term-limited — or left academia entirely. Stable teaching positions are being replaced everywhere by adjuncts who are not paid a living wage, nor given health insurance. The alternative to exploiting teachers in this way, and to Harvard’s rigid term limits, is not “un-capped preceptorships.” It is a system of potentially renewable contracts that would balance retaining the most excellent teachers and bringing in new ones. To be clear: Harvard’s very limited number of senior preceptorships do not constitute such a system. Those promoted into senior preceptorships replace many of their teaching duties with administrative ones. Harvard has no mechanism for retaining, as teachers, its most excellent preceptors.
If Harvard actually respects preceptors, then it should give us more manageable teaching responsibilities by reducing class sizes or our course load, which would benefit our students as well. It should support our research and writing with time and money, so that we are more competitive on the job market, as even teaching positions now require robust publication records. It should pay us in line with our peers at other institutions, so that we don’t have to teach extra classes in order to cover our bills, making it even more impossible to find time to write. And it should create a real path to longer-term employment for the most excellent teachers among us who want to keep teaching and make a real home at Harvard.
Katie Ana Baca ’11, Matthew B. Cole, and Ben M. Roth are all preceptors in the Harvard College Writing Program. Additional contributors to the letter can be found here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, I looked in the mirror after playing Mario Kart Wii for three hours, and thought to myself: Surely, if I can waste time playing a video game that hasn’t been relevant for more than 10 years and still look into the bloodshot eyes of my scruffy, beard-faced reflection — fully aware of the academic betrayal and personal disappointment that’s just befallen me — I must have finally accepted my addiction to Nintendo-related nostalgia as part of who I am. Hooray?
This rare moment of self-acceptance, however, got me thinking about what little of it students typically have, as a direct result of being a student. And, strangely, not for the first time, Mario Kart prompted an introspective journey.
As students, we often sacrifice benefits in the present for benefits in the future. We go to college to prepare ourselves for life post-graduation, gaining the qualifications and education necessary to achieve our idea of success. As students, we are intent on improving ourselves and becoming what people in the future will expect of us as university graduates. Yet, as great as improving yourself can be, our efforts to improve are often at odds with self-acceptance.
When you strive to improve yourself, it can either be from a place of genuine satisfaction and acceptance of who you are at present, or from a place of rejecting who you are at present. This far into my first year at Harvard, in my academic pursuits, I’ve noticed the temptation to fixate on the wrong reasons when seeking to learn. We’re surrounded by so many extraordinary people who appear to have the faculty and drive to succeed at any cost. Our environment normalizes believing that currently, you’re not enough and that until you’re as smart a student as x or as qualified as professor y, you’re not valuable.
As far from our career goals as we may be, it is crucial for us not to let these goals be what dictates our value as people. This is a tall order when you come from a background of immense self-improvement; you don’t get accepted into universities without stepping up hugely from middle-school-you.
Being accepted into Harvard only reinforces, if not further incentivizes, allowing a feeling of inadequacy to be our motive for improvement. For many of us, it’s what got us here.
I notice myself wanting to rely on feelings of inadequacy to motivate me because I’m not used to motivating myself from a position of security with where I currently am. It’s foreign to me to try improving without feeling as though this improvement will be a necessary step towards acquiring value as a person. And I don’t believe I’m alone in these feelings: What has influenced me to possess this mindset has likely influenced you, too.
This is due in part to the ubiquity of the narratives that cultivate this mindset: products designed to “make us better” reside rent-free in our minds due to marketing that pervades all aspects of our lives, intended to exploit and manipulate the fragile psyche of a media-obsessed world — media that takes self-improvement for granted as something everyone wants, assuming that no one could possibly be happy with the way they are at present. That a product can make us better, or that we believe we have the capacity to self-improve, seems to suggest we are not enough as is. Examples range from beauty-enhancing products to even luxury cars that are advertised as social indicators of personal worth.
And, of course, university itself can be seen as one of these products, something that we feel we need in order to be adequate. Through this product and others, standards that are neither realistic nor legitimate measures of a person’s value insert themselves in our minds, showing us where we fall in comparison, and reinforcing the belief we can and must improve ourselves.
Self-acceptance. Something so elusive, so abstract, that it almost makes this argument redundant. As difficult as it is to define what self-acceptance is, or what it looks like, we can’t ignore it. Unless we totally reject who we are, we must possess it to some extent. I know it sounds paradoxical, but I don’t believe self-acceptance necessitates complacency — such comfort with your flaws and weaknesses that you resist change. Otherwise, self-acceptance would involve never ironing-out those sixth-grade temper issues. And would involve me guiltlessly dedicating all of my time to Ubering a mustached plumber around a race track.
A distinction I want to make, but don’t want to suggest is necessarily right, is that self-acceptance is the belief that as you are, you’re alright. Could you be better? Probably. Should you be? Up to you. But importantly, whether or not you change or stay the same, regardless of how many times you pick up that busted Wii remote steering wheel, your value as a person will remain the same. Self-acceptance is not just thinking, but believing that nothing you can do or change about yourself alters your value as a person. It is this principle that I think we must keep in mind when we seek to improve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I prepare for a Zoom, I carefully position just my face and shoulders in the frame of the camera. As someone who has long struggled with body image, I consider this setup a dream come true; The majority of my body, an aspect of my identity that I have always been ashamed of, can be hidden off-camera. When the fall semester ended, I was finally forced to view myself as a whole.
I realized that I had failed to take care of my body and that my self-esteem was significantly worse than at the start of the semester.
For those with body dysmorphic disorder and other body image issues, it is easy to ignore household mirrors. But, once you are stuck in a Zoom meeting for hours on end, it’s nearly impossible to avoid your image. The effects of staring at your own reflection can wreak havoc on esteem and further distort self-perception.
To soften the effects of virtual classes the coming spring semester, I propose a few strategies to shift your frame of thinking to (hopefully) grow to love yourself as a whole a bit more.
To begin with, it’s important to recognize the toxic nature of the classic “no-pants-in-a-virtual-meeting” joke. The idea that the parts of you that exist outside of the camera’s frame don’t matter promotes body image dissociation. While it can be tempting to wear sweatpants (or no pants) in your classes, this choice affirms that not all parts of your body are equally important.
To combat this tendency, you should choose to wear an outfit that makes you feel put together at least once or twice a week. Besides possibly inspiring a bit more confidence, wearing clothes force you to consider your entire body and will expand your perception of yourself beyond Zoom. Your favorite pants can serve as a reminder that your legs are just as important a part of your body as your shoulders and face.
Another important truth that should inform your perception of yourself is that you do not live on Zoom (even though it can feel like it at times). Take advantage of where you are in the world to strengthen the connection between you and your body. An action as simple as a walk on a quiet path can recenter you, and it gives you an opportunity to see yourself outside of the Harvard-Zoom bubble. If a walk isn’t something that is possible because of the pandemic, any accessible activity that engages your mind and body will have the same effect.
In addition to these strategies, I hope that over the course of the semester, you hold yourself accountable. I did not hold myself accountable to maintaining my well-being until the fall semester was over which is why my mental and physical health suffered so severely.
Periodically, you should ask yourself: Do I feel able and strong? Do I feel proud of at least one or two elements of my identity and appearance? How can I improve how I feel about who I am? The answers to these questions can help you evaluate what steps you should take to begin to take care of yourself.
Your status as a Harvard student should have no bearing on your ability to love yourself. Yet, in the virtual world, I have found that the reflection you see on Zoom can distract from mental and physical health and make it much harder to appreciate the parts of yourself that aren’t on display.
As long as Harvard exists on Zoom, remember to try to love yourself for every bit of your mind and body — even the parts your webcam doesn’t catch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Note from the Editorial Board: The following piece includes discussion of severe mental health struggles and suicide. We’ve compiled a few resources that might be useful to any readers in need of help or support. Please make sure to take care of yourselves — seeking help is always worthwhile. 
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a certified listener, call 1-800-273-8255.
If you are enrolled, Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services offers no cost support, including Urgent Care appointments at (617) 495-5711.
For international students, here’s a list of some internationally available support hotlines that might be helpful.

Sometimes words fail us, especially in times of inconceivable loss. The recent suicide of Rachael Shaw-Rosenbaum, in her first year at Yale University, is one of these times.
We extend our deepest sympathies to Rachael’s family, her friends, her classmates, and all who remember her as “unapologetically herself.” We ache for Rachael, we ache for those she left behind, and we ache for those who share the pain she felt before she died.
Though we never had the chance to meet her, Rachael’s death hits far too close to home, leaving us hollow. We are not entitled to every detail of her story, but the plotline is one we know too well: We see it in our friends who struggle silently and bravely, every day. We see it when we are the first responders to our peers in mental health crises, the first to know when they are hurting from a pain we feel powerless to stop. Our attempts are not always enough.
Rachael’s story leaves us gasping for air because in another universe, her name could have been replaced with our friend’s name. Our own name.
Mental health struggles on campus are not new. Words failed us here at Harvard only a few months ago as we tried to grapple with our own loss to suicide, Thomas B. “Tommy” Raskin at the Law School.
The Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated students’ struggles — seeing our college experience come to a grinding halt and plagued by loneliness has been emotionally devastating to live through. But the roots of the issue run deeper and darker, and pervaded our lives before the virus. Loneliness has always been here, preying on what makes life worth living. The problem is only made worse in the pressure cooker that is Harvard, where rates of depression and anxiety are substantially higher than the national average.
We cannot let this be our normal.
The worst thing we can do, that Harvard and Yale can do, is stay silent and pretend that Rachael’s suicide and the mental health struggles students’ are facing, is business as usual. We need to talk about it. Undoing a culture that engenders such pervasive mental health issues requires effort on both the part of the administration and the student body.
Harvard, there is a problem here. That’s part of what makes Rachael’s death so hard for us to grapple with. This university is our home — one with reddish-brown bricks, colorful, metallic chairs. Joys and curiosities and sorrows. In this home, we need to feel safe and taken care of: While we truly believe that the Harvard administration cares about us, the University’s communication and execution of this genuine care sometimes falls short.
Harvard is students’ home even when they are on leaves of absence. Yet the policies that call for near complete ostracization of students on leave — being taken off House email lists, for example — suggest otherwise. Tiny bureaucratic details that may seem small to administrators — like the possibility of losing on-campus housing — make taking a leave, even for mental health reasons, a paralyzing and further isolating endeavor. Harvard needs to take care of its students when they are hurting, even if — especially if — they felt it necessary to take time away from campus. We don’t know the details of Rachael’s situation, but students calling for more forgiving leave of absence policies in the wake of her death should be heeded.
Academic culture at Harvard, especially in the middle of a pandemic, must also be more forgiving. Our campus is, by definition, run by people at the very top of their fields, who faced hyper-competitive academic structures and thrived. Our professors and lecturers, even if deeply empathetic, likely struggle to fully internalize the emotionally eroding impact of constant, ruthless rivalry.
While our university has our best interests at heart, good intentions alone will not alone be enough to help students.
Still, it would be narrow-minded for us as students to assume all the responsibility lies with our administrators, even if we believe major progress could emerge from the top, down. Each of us contributes to Harvard’s culture, shaping it with every word or interaction, on and offline. That culture — our culture — can be incredibly cruel.
Harvard is full of driven, ambitious people; that might be its most absolute quality. But the dangers of excess drive and ambition are caustic. We have previously condemned Harvard’s fetishization of exclusivity: comps, punches, and other elite divisors. We are used to treating those harms abstractly. That is a mistake.
“Just got rejected from every extracurricular I applied to,” Rachael tweeted in September of last year. We’ve heard that line before. It hurts to read. And it hurt to see how fervently our board recognized the pain, often suffered silently, that Rachael was brave enough to put to words.
We, as students, need to show each other grace. Instead of focusing on professional networks, build support structures and become part of other peoples’. As with anything, we only get through this together.
We don’t have all the answers, and can’t pretend to: Rachael’s passing leaves us lost. All we know for sure is that being kind to each other, around each other, will make this all a bit more bearable.
Our words aren’t enough today, and they won’t be tomorrow. But for Rachael, for our peers, for ourselves, we have to try. Someone needs to try to make these ivory towers kinder.

“You don’t have to go if you don’t want to,” my sister reminded me.
“I promised I would bring her souvenirs from France,” I sighed. It seemed petty to deny her this just because we were having problems.
Or maybe I was the only one who saw the problems. Gayatri met me in the lobby of her apartment building with a big hug, and I felt guilty for the treacherous thoughts I’d been having. I smiled as we filled each other in on the past few months — our first years at college, love lives, politics — but it was only a matter of time before our common ground came up: school. We had a small secondary school class of about 20 students that had stayed relatively constant over the four years, which made for lots of too-close friendships and drama I was trying to put behind me.
“I was so excited to get back in touch with Amit!” she exclaimed, speaking of her childhood friend. I’d liked him for a while, but he’d rejected me and made my life unpleasant for the rest of high school.
“That’s great!” I said, faking a smile. She saw through it, and then I fumbled. “Gayatri, you know how he was in school, how he’d manipulate us for academic help. Just be careful; he’s a bit insecure.”
I left later that night, relieved that I wouldn’t have to see Gayatri until the next winter but also wondering whether I had said too much. And sure enough, that one genuine moment came back to bite me.
***
On my first day of seventh grade, I got off the school bus, confused. My new school just outside Mumbai, India was 10 stories high, and I had no idea where to start looking for my classroom.
“I can show you where our classroom is,” said a voice. It was the girl who’d sat behind me on the bus. She had honey-colored eyes and dark brown hair that was almost but not quite black. “I’m Gayatri.”
As we walked up eight flights of stairs together, she told me everything there was to know about our class. “We have 25 students in the seventh grade international section,” she said, “and remember to never say you like ice cream.”
“Okay,” I said quizzically, panting as she led me into my new classroom. A dozen girls flocked around me, exclaiming over how tall I was, asking me where I was from and what America was like. I tried to look around for Gayatri, but she had disappeared. Indeed, I didn’t talk to her much in seventh grade, feeling lost in a new country with languages that passed through my ears but not my lips and lonely in a class where most of the students bullied me for being too studious. That year, I learned that long-distance friendships usually don’t last, and that “Ice Cream” was the nickname of a popular boy in our class.
Gayatri didn’t resurface in my life for more than 10 months, until she called me the night before the start of eighth grade.
“Maya, can we be best friends this year?” she asked.
I felt oddly flattered, and after a year with not much of a social life, the prospect of a new friend was welcome. “Yes! See you tomorrow on the school bus,” I said.
***
We sat next to the window in my living room, the shutters opened wide to let in a cool breeze, soothing us from the muggy Mumbai air. Our faces were lit only by the soft white overhead light that cast little flecks of color around us.
“It was so scary, not knowing what was happening, not knowing what people were saying about me,” Gayatri said, and I remembered last year, in seventh grade, when the girls in our class spread rumors about her to her boyfriend, who subsequently broke up with her.
My heart melted a little. There was someone else in my new school who understood how it felt to be shunned. We talked for what felt like hours, but only 20 minutes later she got a text from her mother waiting downstairs.
***
Gayatri and I were inseparable. We rode the bus together every day, chatting the entire way to school about our problems and exchanging advice. We found solace in each other. She needed me just as much as I needed her.
She held me as I cried my heart out after I confessed to Amit that I liked him and he told me to go away. “You didn’t do anything wrong,” she said firmly. “You just told him how you felt.”
I heard her words over and over again, feeling empty except for them. And even though my heart was broken that day in eighth grade, I felt blessed to have found such a supportive friend.
***
Field trips were not a common occurrence, and I was in an abnormally good mood. My friends and I sang songs and played games on the way to the museum, and I asked the curator lots of questions. So I was surprised when Gayatri called me that night, sounding upset.
“Are you mad at me?” I asked.
“You weren’t acting like yourself today. I know you’re a good singer, but you were hogging attention. And you were flirting with Amit.”
“Sapna was singing along with me, and we were talking to a lot of people today.”
“This isn’t like you. You’ve changed since you started wearing your contacts to school,” Gayatri said reproachfully. I could hear the anger in her voice and immediately felt ashamed but also confused. I didn’t understand why it made her so irritated to see me happy. I swallowed my pride and apologized even as I knew I was making a mistake.
***
Gayatri and I sat in my bedroom one night when we were 17, cross-legged on the floor, jamming to the latest songs from the “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” album together. Since we no longer attended the same school and had busy schedules in 11th grade, our time together was scarce. All of a sudden, the music stopped — her phone was ringing.
My heart sank when she picked up and greeted her boyfriend. “Hi Reena,” she said, calling him by a fake female name, so that my parents wouldn’t hear her talking to a boy. I closed my eyes as she spoke to him animatedly. I told myself not to be jealous. Her parents were much stricter than mine, and obviously she’d have more freedom to talk to him at my house than at hers. That was also why she forced me to go to the birthday parties of people I didn’t like and dragged me to the movies but sat with someone else.
After she hung up, Gayatri left to retrieve her toothbrush, not bothering to apologize. The moment was over.
***
Twelfth grade was a stressful year, and our meetings became even more infrequent. I tried to meet Gayatri the weekend before a big chemistry test, but as usual, she cancelled at the last minute. Later that week, when I was settling onto the couch after an exhausting day at school, I checked my phone to find a text from her.
“Can we meet today? Let me know fast. Also I won’t be free for a few weeks after this so please say yes. I miss you.” Gayatri’s bossy texts would normally make my blood pressure rise. I knew she was doing an intensive entrance exam prep program alongside school, but we always met at her convenience. For now, I was just tired. Before lying down, I unplugged my home phone and silenced my cell.
***
Once I went to Harvard, we talked even less. Gayatri and I exchanged messages every few weeks, but staying in touch was difficult. Part of me felt guilty that I had this new life, while she was still living with her parents. I didn’t need her as much as I used to — I made new friends at college who gave me more space, and I really bonded with my roommate during my study abroad program freshman summer. After I gave Gayatri the Eiffel Tower and French newspapers I bought for her from Paris, I exhaled, feeling relieved I wouldn’t have to see her for a few months.
“Bro, what did you say about Amit?” my friend texted me the next day.
My heart stopped as I read further: “He’s really upset. He keeps saying that you said he was insecure? I thought you guys weren’t talking anymore.”
“We aren’t,” I typed, dumbstruck. This was not the first time that Gayatri had shared something I’d told her in confidence. I wondered if I should confront her, if it was worth trying to hold together a friendship that had been splintered time and time again.
My Paris roommate’s words came back to me. “Well, if you feel like you can’t trust her, I think you have your answer.”
***
I had been ignoring her texts, and my heart would sink seeing the missed calls. But after she sent me an angry email sophomore year, I decided I had to stop being passive.
“Why aren’t you answering my calls?” she said angrily, picking up the phone.
My hands started shaking even though I had planned what I would say when she accused me.
“Gayatri, I don’t think we s-s-should talk anymore. Our f-f-friendship has become — toxic,” I managed to gasp.
I felt awash with guilt. I closed my eyes and thought about all the times we laughed and made up silly stories to understand chemistry but also the pain of her incessant teasing. There was nothing else to be done. Something had broken, and no amount of dialogue would bring closure for either of us.
Gayatri sent me some emails afterwards, and she still finds ways to send me birthday wishes. My sister tells me she’s being manipulative, but I’m not so sure. I think it’s quite possible that she doesn’t see how things fell apart, that she betrayed me without being fully aware of it. After I started wearing contacts and went off to college, maybe she didn’t recognize me anymore. But to me, she has become unpleasantly familiar — the weight of a shared past I no longer want to carry.

In “A DAY IN MY LIFE LIVING IN HAWAII,” Sienna R. Santer ’22 shows us exactly what we’re missing. In a video sponsored by Lululemon, Santer chats to her hundreds of thousands of subscribers as she performs her daily summer activities, which include a hike to a secluded tide pool, a swim in her manicured backyard, and sunset yoga on an empty beach. Beneath meticulously composed shots of footprints in the sand is appropriate paradise mood music: a thrumming, lazy beat, welcoming and warm, creates a dreamy anesthetic that numbs viewers to their “imperfect” realities so they can fantasize about what their lives could be.
Santer’s presentation of Hawaii, however benign her intentions, oversimplifies the truth about the islands. It’s not that the images she features are too pristine; the places themselves are recognizable, at least to me, and are accurate in their gorgeousness. There is, however, a gaping hole in the 16-minute video: Santer never once depicts a hint of local culture. With the exception of the title and one instance of overlaid text which blares “Makapu’u Lighthouse Trail,” she does little to indicate that the scenery she flaunts isn’t that of some other tropical isle.
Though perhaps the most visible, Santer isn’t the only Harvard influencer to mine Hawaii for its photogenic landscape. Clusters of Insta-happy Harvard students with tens of thousands of followers apiece have popped up in Hawaii over the course of the past year, flocking to a domestic quarantine location that contains an enticing flavor of exoticism. (Santer did not respond to a request for comment.)
I have mixed feelings when it comes to student tourism in my hometown. I absolutely love leading visitors to my favorite spots (the top of Kuliouou Ridge! Bellows Beach! Maunawili Falls!), feeding them the best local food, smiling when they try something sour and delicious and new. Giving these tours is a way to remind myself of the parts of Hawaii that I take for granted day to day. But the portrayals of Hawaii as a party paradise for slender college kids holding beers or backflipping into blue water rubs me the wrong way. I find this kind of vacation porn reductive: It erases the state’s complicated identity.
My local friends welcome both student and general tourists, but are also wary of their potential insensitivity. Ryan K. Hong ’22-’23, for instance, loves hosting people who are “willing to learn about Native Hawaiian culture,” but knows of some tourists who disrespect cultural sites, adopting the mindset of “‘Oh, this is my vacation, so I can do whatever I want.’” Micah I. K. Williams ’23-’24 explains that Hawaii has a “distinct set of values” which tourists sometimes overlook. “It’s about caring for the environment and respecting the place and culture,” he says. He returns my call from an Oahu farm full of noisy chickens.
Hawaii’s history as a monarchy violently overthrown by Western powers further complicates the relationship between locals and visitors. Nicholas L. Amador ’22 notes that locals often joke about being irritated by tourists, but the sentiment comes from “a real place of frustration.”
“There’s a long, deep-rooted colonialist history of missionaries invading and destroying the Native Hawaiian culture,” he adds.
And yet it is these outsiders that provide Hawaii’s main source of income and attract investment in the state’s infrastructure. The pandemic hit Hawaii with a devastating economic recession. With borders sealed, entire swaths of the island designated for tourism were barren. Expensive restaurants in Waikiki shuttered their windows with plywood. Empty hotels made the once glittering skyline dark and ominous.
The effects of the pandemic haven’t been entirely unfavorable. For the first time since Hawaii’s colonization, locals could enjoy their home without being forced to share it. Laughing, Pomai K. K. Ogata ’23 admits, “It was kind of nice during Covid when there were no tourists — the beaches were completely free.” Popular tourist spots are now less likely to be littered with trash; regions with reefs and sea life have had the time to recover from the poisonous effects of chemicals found in tourists’ sunscreen.
Now that restrictions have loosened, some locals have voiced disappointment about the return of foreigners. The story has even made regular appearances in The New York Times. Ogata points out, though, that those from developed areas of the state, who know firsthand the economic benefits of tourism, are more likely to forgive tourists for “mistakes” such as cultural ignorance and littering. By contrast, when I accidentally texted a random auntie from the rural Big Island about this article, she responded, “Tell the student tourists to go home!”
I think it’s possible for Hawaii to reject this binary altogether, providing a model for responsible tourism. Over the past year, I and almost all of my local Harvard friends have hosted college peers either in our homes or informally as tour guides. I agree with Williams that the most rewarding and educational trips to the islands involve interactions with locals. He says that tourists who aren’t guided by someone familiar with the area “miss out on that extra experience.”
Visitors without a connection to the island must resist the inertia to enjoy Hawaii as passive observers. Jessica Lee ’23-’24, for example, visited Maui for four weeks this March. Despite being insulated in a resort area, she was determined to gain a fuller understanding of the island. Though she did not conduct any research on Hawaii’s history beforehand, Lee compiled a list of activities that could educate her while she was there. She and her friends drove the Road to Hana, a lush, winding path along Maui’s East side, and traveled to see the Olowalu petroglyphs, rock carvings that serve as a tangible trace of ancient culture. The trip introduced her to aspects of the local mindset she hopes to bring home to California, which include “the aloha spirit” as well as “Hawaii Time,” a concept which may sound familiar to Harvard students.
But Robert A. Harraka Jr. ’24 found that “paradise” had more problems than travel TikToks —  like the ones Lee makes — revealed. An avid surfer from California, Harraka quickly adapted to the lifestyle of paddling out each day after work on Oahu’s South Shore. Although he was stunned by Hawaii’s natural beauty and its affectionate people, he confesses that the isle was not exactly the rosy haven he had expected. “A lot of the Indigenous peoples get abused and ignored, the infrastructure is lacking, public funding is lacking,” he says. “And you ask yourself, ‘Am I helping? Or am I making the problem worse?’”
Harraka’s experience is a testament to what I see as the impossibility of separating Hawaii’s culture and place. The two should be married to each other: visiting the physical location should entail accepting the responsibility of taking care of the surrounding environment (malama aina) and educating yourself on the colonial history of the land. Instead of thinking solely of what they can “take away” from a trip, whether that means memories, souvenirs, or photographs, tourists should also think about what they can “give” in return.
Williams puts it well: “People are coming to Hawaii and saying ‘What can I see? What can I take home? Where can I get the best pictures?’ You don’t have to throw all that away, but you should come with the mindset of ‘What can I do? How can I appreciate the culture and support locals? What choices can I make as a tourist that improve the place I’m visiting instead of just taking away from it?’”
As Hawaii continues to open up and students anticipate traveling in an exciting, post-Covid world, I hope they remain cognizant of the folks who live there full-time. Student tourists’ experience of Hawaii will only become richer when they learn about its bloody history and  interact with its local people. It will not only make their days in so-called “paradise” more meaningful, but will also allow Hawaii to break free from an entrenched colonialist approach to tourism. Otherwise, students’ glitzy Instagram posts may as well be manufactured. Otherwise, they may as well be anywhere.

I am tired — tired of seeing other people make money selling NFTs. An NFT of Jack Dorsey’s first tweet sold for $2.5 million, an NFT of a Logan Paul pokemon card for $2 million, and an NFT art piece from an artist named Beeple for $69 million.
What is an NFT, exactly? I am not sure. It stands for a non-fungible token, and it’s basically an image verified with the blockchain. If that explanation confused you, don’t worry about it: An NFT is just a series of smoke and mirrors to distract you from the fact you just paid an ungodly amount of money for a JPEG.
The only way you can feel good about dropping $2,203.13 on a gif of a Pringles can is if you tell your fellow tech bros, “It’s basically crypto though.” Like, no, Chad, this is not the next Bitcoin. It’s literally a gif of a Pringles can.
When it comes down to it, NFTs are basically just a way to commodify clout. There is no better example of this than Azealia Banks selling an NFT audio sex tape for over $17,000 earlier this year. And yes, that is just for the audio.
As a part of making these NFTs, the computers running the blockchain consume massive amounts of electricity. Right now, Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is the size of New Zealand and with each new run of an NFT, crypto’s emissions get closer to the size of a slightly bigger, small nation. Maybe that $1,100 NFT of a balding NBA player running down the court will comfort you as rising sea levels swallow Miami-Dade County.
This all got me thinking — if I want to commodify clout and raise controversy, then Harvard has about 380 years worth of history doing just that. So here is what I present to you: The Harvard NFT Collection, a series of our most absurd, outrageous, and controversial moments because nothing sells like public outrage.
President A. Lawrence Lowell 
Harvard’s 10th president, Lowell has been memorialized with his namesake house: Lowell. What has been largely forgotten is that Lowell was anti-Black, anti-Italian, anti-semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-Irish, anti-labor — the list goes on and on. Lowell’s ire was directed at any non-Protestant white man.
Lowell oversaw a secret court of University administrators which quietly expelled almost a dozen students for their sexual orientation in 1920.
My guess is Lowell’s NFT will fetch a high price after the renaming of Lowell House, prompting conservative commentators to decry cancel culture, and creating an extensive backlash.
Steven Pinker on Joe Rogan’s Podcast 
Few things on the internet are as surreal as watching Harvard professor Steven Pinker talk to Joe Rogan about “political correctness” in academia. Pinker made an impassioned case about how his past comments have been misunderstood, while he criticized the “speech police” for trying to constrain the realm of acceptable political thought.
I don’t really care about how free Pinker feels to debate innate differences in cognitive ability between sexes, but I do know anyone willing to tweet “Data: Police don't shoot blacks disproportionately. Problem: Not race, but too many police shootings,” is bound to stumble into exactly the media limelight that is going to send this NFT price through the roof. A National Review article from last summer claiming it would be “very very stupid” to cancel Pinker is already helping to prove my case.
Harvard’s Invention of Napalm
Listen, as much as Harvard likes to talk about being a bastion of intellectual curiosity and good vibes, what it has never really reckoned with is that is the birthplace of napalm — a superweapon that irrevocably changed the 20th century. As with every other entrant on this list, Napalm’s connection to Harvard is going to have its day in the media spotlight, and when it does that NFT is going to be a hot commodity, no pun intended.

The first party I attended at Harvard was, for the most part, unmemorable and inconsequential, as most Igloo parties are. The sights and senses were standard: perspiring bodies crashing together in the dark. The floor, sticky with dried alcohol. Music reverberating through your body, pounding so loudly that you might eventually mistake it for your own heartbeat.
What I remember most distinctly was not the party itself, but leaving it. As I walked down the narrow hallway leading out of the Igloo, a girl ran into me, spilling her drink on my favourite top. Instead of apologizing, the first thing she said to me was, “I don’t mean to be racist, but —” (never a good start to a sentence) “— you’re the prettiest Indian girl I’ve ever seen.”
She went on to tell me that she once went to a South Asian Association event and walked in thinking she would be the prettiest girl there because she was white (in her own words), but she realized that the Indian community actually contained some “hot people.” She told me I should “go to the Bhangra” and see for myself, as if Bhangra were a place I could visit.
What struck me most about this moment, though, wasn’t the girl’s remarks but my own immediate reaction. I wasn’t offended. I was flattered.
How could I have felt complimented when I knew I was being denigrated? As the entire ethnicity group to which I belonged was being effectively erased, how could I have felt, however briefly, seen?
Like plenty of other women, I’ve long been unable to shake the belief that I’m only “pretty” when I’m trying to be, and that night I was trying — makeup, favorite top, and all. So I appreciated the acknowledgement of my efforts. But of course, there was more to it than just that.
Growing up in Calgary, Canada where I attended a rural private school until I was 14, there were only a handful of students of color in each grade, and for some reason, I distanced myself from them. It felt like there was this special club that all my white friends were part of, and I made sure I was always right behind them, ready to walk in. Yet I consistently found myself standing outside it with the door slammed shut in my face.
At 10 years old, I didn’t know what this club was, exactly. All I knew was that the people in it were “normal” people — people who had normal names and packed normal-smelling leftovers in their lunchboxes. They got to be the leads in school plays. And TV shows. And movies. They got to be the pretty faces on school posters. And advertisements. And picture books.
I initially thought I wasn’t pretty enough to be part of this not-so-secret club. It wasn’t until later that I realized I wasn’t white enough. And it wasn’t until even later that I realized “not pretty enough” and “not white enough” were not unrelated.
As I grew older, I started to get used to the idea that I could start my own club. I was determined to create space for myself in a world where there was none. But fast forward to my first semester at Harvard, and as much as I felt I had stepped more comfortably and confidently into my own skin, here I was saying thank you to a white girl telling me I was the prettiest Indian girl she’d ever seen.
Flattery is not a sustainable or sincere form of self-satisfaction. It’s a feeling entirely dependent upon someone else’s affirmation. What I saw in that moment was someone finally opening the door to me, saying, here, come in. You’re not so bad. You’re not like them.
The part of me that, despite my efforts to silence her, had been secretly yelling let me in, let me in since the age of 10 was ecstatic. For a moment, I thought I could shed my “them” status, or at least get a little further away from it. I saw a reel of images play in my mind, flashing through all the brown faces that I too have been conditioned to see as inherently less “pretty,” and suddenly, I was the exception. For so long, my face had been among them, but now, it was above them. All because this one girl said so.
When your skin color automatically relegates you to a place below the threshold of beauty,  you must be exceptional, rising above everyone else in your lot just to reach that threshold — just to achieve the bare minimum. So the ecstasy of feeling exceptional for me, in that moment, was really the ecstasy of feeling that much closer to normal.
At once, I felt elevated and diminished. Because in order to feel like I was being lifted up to that threshold, I had to actually believe I was below it to begin with. In my own imagination, I had erased myself from the definition of beauty.
To that girl at the Igloo, I stood out. She was so hyperaware of my existence that she felt the need to comment upon it. But I know I was also invisible to her; I was just a wall for her to throw words at, not a person who might actually absorb those words. A person who might feel the incessant rhythm of words, images, and ideas — constructions of herself that she did not create — reverberate through her body, pounding so loudly she might eventually mistake them for her own heartbeat.
Even now, I feel myself caught, like many people of color, in the tension between simultaneous invisibility and hypervisibility.
It makes me wonder, what does it feel like to just be plain old visible? What does it feel like to exist in your own imagination? What does it feel like to be part of the club without losing part of yourself? And will I ever find out?

A chorus of voices pounded against the walls of Sanders Theatre: “U.S. out of Southeast Asia; butchers out of Harvard!”
Sanders Theatre, ordinarily tranquil and decorous, was in total uproar on the night of March 26, 1971, as the left and right clashed over U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Student demonstrators floated balloons with anti-war messages to the ceiling and threw marshmallows towards the stage of pro-war speakers.
As a reactionary response to anti-war “teach-ins” around the country and at Harvard itself, a band of conservative students had planned this “Counter Teach-In: An Alternative View” in Sanders. The group, Students for a Just Peace, aimed to combat what they saw as the underrepresentation of pro-war sentiment on campus.
SJP invited five pro-war speakers to share their thoughts: Dolph M. Droge, a White House adviser on Vietnam; Anand Panyarachun, Thailand’s ambassador to the United Nations; Nguyen Hoan, South Vietnam’s ambassador to the United States; I. Milton Sacks, a political science professor at Brandeis University; and Daniel E. Teodoru, Eastern coordinator for the National Student Coordinating Committee for Freedom in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Lawrence C. McCarty of the American Conservative Union moderated the event.
In many ways, Harvard was a microcosm of the political rifts of the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1967, demonstrators from the Harvard chapter of the left-wing group Students for a Democratic Society protested a recruitment visit by Dow Chemical Company due to the company’s role in manufacturing napalm, a deadly substance which, ironically, had been invented in a secret lab at Harvard just two decades earlier. In April 1969, students occupied University Hall after Harvard’s then-President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 rejected a list of demands, which included abolishing the ROTC and creating an Afro-American studies program. A year later, riots exploded in Harvard Square around both the trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale and the use of tax money for war efforts.
These events left many conservative students feeling fed up. SJP member Arthur N. Waldron ’71, who helped organize the counter teach-in, called Harvard’s political environment amidst the Vietnam War an “一言堂,” a Chinese term for a place where only one voice could be heard. In the wake of mounting discontent and disillusionment, the counter teach-in was meant to foster diversity within the discourse surrounding Vietnam.
Laszlo Pasztor Jr. ’73, another SJP member, advertised the event in The Crimson as “an attempt to combat the overwhelming prevalence of ‘force-fed’ antiwar feeling at Harvard.”
They planned to hold the event in Sanders Theatre — one of the largest halls on campus at the time — and ensured ahead of time that the space had cameras and recording equipment. At 6:30 p.m., an hour and a half before the event’s start, the organizers met in a room in the basement of the Phillips Brooks House, where a lawyer briefed them on contingencies in case of disruption — because of the charged political climate, they expected the event would be contentious.
Across the yard, SDS called a counter-rally at 7 p.m. to protest SJP’s lecture. Picketers clustered before the entrances of Sanders Theatre, holding banners, waving flags, and shouting slogans. Chants of the word “murderers'' formed a steady beat as the lecture’s organizers headed to Sanders with the visiting speakers.
Bonnie E. Blustein ’72, one of the anti-war demonstrators, recalls the day with clarity. “We were protesting the war, we were protesting Harvard[’s] racism,” she says. With her marched students carrying a banner that read “Defeat U.S. Imperialism” in English, Vietnamese, and Spanish, which they had made with the help of a Vietnamese student. “There had to have been 800 people inside and probably more outside, trying to get in.”
E. John Pennington ’67, who had served as the national secretary of the SDS, was one of the organizers of the counter-demonstration. He was surprised at the turnout. “Our nucleus of 40 people or so was shocked at the overwhelming number of people who came to ensure that the event could not become propaganda,” he says.
Because of the cameras that SJP had set up in Sanders Theatre, Pennington and his fellow organizers suspected that “the organizers of the Sanders Theatre event had one purpose: to create a propaganda film demonstrating that the anti-war movement was dead at Harvard.” Pennington emphasized that the goal of the counter protesters was to stop this film from being made, and not “to do something that would be seen as a violation of free speech.” Blustein and James P. Stodder ’71 both note, too, that they attended the protest with the intention of preventing a film from being made.
Five minutes before the start of the teach-in, security closed the doors to Sanders Theatre because capacity had been reached.
When the speakers came onstage, the noise level in the room quickly climbed to a din. McCarty, the moderator, approached the microphone, but could not be heard over the clamor. Some students waved flags emblazoned with the Viet Cong star and signs inscribed with the word “MURDERERS”; others pelted McCarty and the speakers with wadded leaflets, marshmallows, and miscellaneous detrita. Within a couple minutes, McCarty withdrew from the event.
“One of the speakers tried to mock us by saying we were ‘marshmallow revolutionaries’ since we were throwing marshmallows,” remembers Stodder, “to kind of say that if we were real revolutionaries, we would have been violent.”
Archibald Cox ’34, a professor at Harvard Law School who would go on in two years to serve as special prosecutor in Nixon’s Watergate trial, arrived at the scene in an attempt to calm the crowd down. “If this meeting is disrupted — hateful as some of us may find it — then liberty will have died a little,” Cox said over the protestors, as balls of paper rained over his head. “And those guilty of the disruption will have done inestimable damage to the causes of humanity and peace.”
After Cox’s impassioned speech, some demonstrators filed out, but a majority stayed stomping, clapping, and yelling. At 8:45 p.m., since officials were still unable to quell the protestors, Cox ended the event on Harvard’s behalf. Police escorted the speakers out to Allston radio station WGBH, where they would broadcast the rest of the conversation.
“Naively, I envisioned a serious factual discussion — that was the origin of the teach-in,” reflects Waldron. “I think a lot of the students [attending the event] wanted the same. It would have been fascinating and illuminating.”
After the counter-demonstration, Charles E. “Chuck” Schumer ’71, future Senate Majority Leader, referred to it in an article for the Harvard Independent as “a tour de farce,” arguing for a more systemic approach to change. “For bureaucratic power, with all of its inhumanity and inefficiency, is one of the few ways to get larger things done in the world,” he wrote. Blustein remembers Schumer as “one of the liberal movers and shakers” at the time. On the other hand, Daniel J. Pipes ’71, an SJP organizer, remembers him as someone who “wanted to avoid taking any firm stance.” Pipes claims that his peers never thought Schumer would be able to go into politics.
Pipes brought charges in a court created by Harvard in the wake of heightened campus activism, the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities, against Blustein and two other students — Martin H. Goodman ’70 and John W. McKean ’71 — for disruption. “The case against Blustein is memorable because I was grilled at length by a 32-year-old Alan Dershowitz,” Pipes wrote in an article this March reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the demonstration. “The future celebrity professor of law successfully deployed his formidable legal skills to convince the CRR that his client was innocent of the disruption I personally witnessed.”
Because this was an intra-university hearing and not a legal case, Dershowitz likely volunteered his services — unbeknownst to his defendant, Blustein. She says she was never notified of the hearing regarding the events at Sanders Theatre, and was acquitted in absentia. “I never had anything to do with Alan Dershowitz, and I hope I never do,” Blustein wrote in an email.
Before the Sanders Theatre protest, Blustein had gone before the CRR for her political activism when she and Ira D. Helfand ’72 were charged with harassing a professor. According to Blustein, the CRR accidentally sent her hearing notice to Helfand’s home, then forwarded it to her parents’ house, then to her dorm room in Cambridge, before it finally reached her in Houston, Texas, where she was living for the summer. To Blustein, this series of mishaps illuminated the inefficiency of the CRR.
Th CRR later delayed Blustein from receiving her A.B. degree. When she was convicted for her participation in an anti-war sit-in in the Littauer Center during May of her senior year, the court prevented her from receiving her diploma that June. She had to graduate the following year.
In a 1972 editorial titled “Abolish the CRR,” The Crimson’s Editorial Board argued that the CRR, a separate entity from the Administrative Board, had the sole purpose of repressing student political activism. “The CRR — which celebrates its third birthday this Fall — was established in the wake of the University Hall occupation to facilitate the political repression of student activists,” it wrote. Blustein also noted that faculty who came to the hearings were sometimes “appalled” at the shoddy practices of the CRR. In the Independent, Schumer called it “a body practicing whimsical justice that would almost certainly be declared unconstitutional in a federal court.”
In the CRR cases following the teach-in, the Committee found nine students guilty of disrupting the event; their punishments ranged in severity from forced semester-long withdrawals to one-year suspensions to degrees withheld altogether.
In addition to the CRR trials, Cox ended up pressing criminal charges against three students at the Counter Teach-In: John T. Berlow ’71 and James T. Kilbreth ’69 for trespassing and disrupting a public assembly, and Pennington for disruption alone. Cox dropped Pennington’s disruption charge and Kilbreth’s trespassing charge at the outset of the trial.
A video used by the prosecution showed Kilbreth clapping, chanting, and at one point, throwing a piece of paper at the stage. Two other witnesses claim they saw Berlow “clapping and chanting” at the demonstration. Both Berlow and Kilbreth conducted their own defense in court.
Berlow successfully argued that the event was open to all, so he was not trespassing. In their defense against the disruption charges, both Berlow and Kilbreth asserted that the speakers at the event were “butchers who did not deserve to be heard.” Berlow was acquitted of charges of criminal trespassing; however, both he and Kilbreth were sentenced to 30 days in jail for disrupting the Counter Teach-In.
Back at Harvard, Cox served on the CRR trials of the students, including Stodder’s.
When Stodder went before the CRR, he brought a bag of marshmallows which he invited the committee to throw at him as he gave his self-defense. “I suggested that unless one were to land in my open mouth, it would not do much to prevent me from speaking. This got a chuckle from Archibald Cox, as I recall.”
The CRR technically only gave Stodder a warning, but soon after the trial, Stodder learned that Harvard would no longer offer him financial aid — he had been taking loans from the college since his father decided he no longer wanted to pay for his “Marxist education.” Stodder recalls that the man who told him about his loss of financial aid “looked embarrassed and claimed it was in no way linked to Sanders Theatre. But my academic standing was good and the amount was trivial.” He interpreted this loss as Harvard punishing him for his political activism.
Without a way to pay tuition, Stodder withdrew from Harvard following his junior year. He eventually returned to Harvard almost a decade later to finish his Economics degree in the 1980-81 school year, after working industrial jobs and community organizing.
“Looking back, there isn’t much I would have done differently,” Stodder says. “We’ve lived so long with disappointment and stasis and retrogression that I’m very hopeful about the current environment.”
For Pipes, who went on to found the conservative think tank Middle East Forum, this event solidified his right-wing political views. He also writes extensively on his eponymous blog, where one of his most-accessed posts is titled, “Advice to Non-Muslim Women against Marrying Muslim Men.”
In the 50-year-anniversary post about the teach-in, he reflects, “The uniquely high profile of the Counter Teach-In — in which the largest hall at the country’s most prominent university was booked to take on the hottest issue of the decade — meant that the near-impunity of its disruption had a great impact.” To Pipes, the issue of free speech on college campuses today follows directly from universities’ treatment of protests over the previous decades. He disapproves of universities’ unwillingness to admonish these left-wing demonstrators, referring to the “flaccidity” of Harvard’s response to the Vietnam War protest in particular.
Dershowitz told Business Insider in 2015 that students staging anti-racism protests on college campuses are “not liberals. Liberals accept opposing points of views. Liberals believe in free speech,” — a criticism he did not level against Blustein, apparently, when he defended her 50 years ago.
“It was cultural as well as political,” Stodder says about the anti-war movement at the time. “We were hippies, we smoked grass, we had long hair.” Pennington, however, contradicts this characterization. “Most of SDS at Harvard were not the dope smoking irresponsible hippies this conservative article [by Pipes] described,” he says. “I remember distinctly because we knew the media would be there, that many of us wore coats and ties to the demonstration.” Pennington emphasized that the demonstration was not the flashy, substanceless show that conservative outlets made it out to be, but rather a successful effort to stop a “propaganda” film from being made.
Blustein has maintained a staunch conviction in the right to protest injustice — even, or especially, when it creates disruption.
“We were very proud of what we did at the time, and I’m still proud now,” Blustein says. “I’ve remained a radical activist, I’ve remained a Communist. So I would say at this point that what happened 50 years ago is less important to me than what’s going to happen tomorrow and next year.”
CORRECTION: April 14, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the class year of Archibald Cox ’34.
A previous version of this article misstated who had made and was carrying the banner that read 'Defeat U.S. Imperialism' during the counter-rally. It was not Bonnie E. Blustein ’72, but other demonstrators who were with her.

Alex W. Corey initially planned to play music, rather than to study it.
As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Corey was a bass guitarist considering a career as a professional musician until an overuse injury forced them to switch career plans. That shift led Corey to academia and prompted their research on the relationships between music, race, and sex.
Corey’s initial interest in music intersected with sex and race while they were studying English in graduate school. “In U.S. Black literature and African American literature, there’s this really strong strain of thinking that relates musical practice in the U.S. to questions of citizenship and belonging,” they explain. “That’s really what brought me to this question [about music] because I’d seen it being very masculine-centric, and I wanted to think about how gender influenced that.”
After finishing their doctorate, Corey took a position as a lecturer in Harvard’s History and Literature department in 2017. While lecturer positions do not offer the possibility of tenure, Corey took the position because they had family in the Boston area and the position was the “best opportunity” given the academic job market.
While at Harvard, Corey continued to expand upon their research interests at the intersection of music and identity. Their most recent work focuses on Ralph Ellison, the 20th-century author most famous for his novel “Invisible Man,” and explores the influence of Black feminism on Ellison’s work. “Black women's musical labor was really foundational and fundamental to major theorists of Black music in the United States,” they say. “[These theorists] routinely wrote primarily focusing on male musicians, even though Black women’s musical labor was really influential in their thinking.”
While most faculty research is funded by a combination of Harvard money and external grants, Corey’s most recent research was partly funded by unemployment checks.
Last June, Corey nearly lost their job when their appointment expired, instead they were switched from a full-time lecturer to a quarter-time lecturer. “It was a huge amount of anxiety,” they recall. “My reaction was scrambling [to find out] how do I apply for unemployment because I’m not going to be making enough money to support myself and my family.”
Non-tenure track faculty like Corey tend to lack the job security of tenured and tenure-track faculty at Harvard. Their positions initially last for one, three, or five years, and while they can be extended to three, five, or eight years, depending on role, these faculty are required to leave Harvard at the end of their contracts regardless of their performance. “It’s very hard to find industries in which the reward for being really good at your job is losing it, but this is one of them,” Corey says. Due to the pandemic, other non-tenure track faculty have reported their appointments were not renewed due to cutbacks in their department heightening the lack of job security afforded to faculty like Corey.
Because of these policies, Corey says they have been searching for their next job since their first year at Harvard. “[Teaching, research, and advising] would be my day job, and then my night job was applying to jobs,” they say.
Despite petitions calling on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to extend the appointment caps during the pandemic, administrators have maintained that non-tenure-track faculty are vital to the University’s teaching mission, but are hired into different roles than tenure-track faculty. An FAS review published last month reaffirmed the appointment cap system.
After receiving the news of their diminished hours last June, Corey was able to secure a position for last fall as an associate lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston in addition to teaching classes at Harvard. With a combination of income from the two universities and unemployment benefits, they were able to support their family.
However, their job search has continued. What they considered an “atrocious” academic job market in 2017 before arriving at Harvard has only worsened due to the pandemic. “Every industry was hemorrhaging employees because of the pandemic, so I was really concerned about trying to find another job,” they say. Corey notes multiple positions they recently applied to were canceled outright due to pandemic-induced budget cuts. Finding another job is crucial for Corey because of the necessity of retaining their health insurance during the pandemic. Corey has asthma, which puts them at a higher risk of severe symptoms from Covid-19. Health insurance is not just a personal concern: Corey also provides it for their family. “For a long time last year I was worried that I was going to be cut off of health insurance in the middle of a global pandemic,” they say. “I have two small kids and I have a partner, and we need my health insurance.” While Corey was able to keep their Harvard health insurance this year, it expires once they no longer work for the University.
Corey says they expect Harvard to fully end their appointment at the end of June. While they still hope to find a job in academia, their experience at Harvard has made them question the values higher education claims to hold. Corey says they are “concerned for the future of higher education based on the significant disregard for a large number of the people who do the teaching work at a university.”

She has this fear that she has no names that she has many names that she doesn’t know her names She has this fear that she’s an image that comes and goes clearing and darkening the fear that she’s the dreamwork inside someone else’s skull
- “Borderlands,” Gloria Anzaldúa
This collection of self portraits and poems was born out of an encounter I had at a Harvard party where a white girl told me I was the “prettiest Indian girl” she’d seen. More specifically, it was born out of my initial reaction to her words; I had so deeply internalized a negative image of myself and others who look like me that I felt flattered before I ever felt offended.
Last spring, for the final project in my Art, Film, and Visual Studies sophomore tutorial, I put on some makeup and one of my mother’s saris to look like the “pretty Indian girl” of someone else’s mind. I picked up shards of a broken mirror (which had accidentally fallen and shattered in my room) and my camera. Soon after, I also picked up my pen.
To be an artist is to create, and throughout history, there have been the creators and those created, the inventors and the objects invented. But those categories aren’t exactly mutually exclusive; after all, self-portraiture is proof that one can be both the framer and the framed. “both and" is a testament to living in contradiction — existing both within and beyond the projection of Otherness. The collection is about internalizing and sometimes benefiting from your own oppression while also actively working to overcome it.
Put together, the words in this piece comprise a poem that I see as my own kind of artist manifesto. Many of the lines are arranged so that they take the same shape as the mirror shards, reflected across the page. Mirrors are projections. Often, words are too, or at least they are one vehicle through which those in power have always projected their own fears and beliefs onto others. Like mirrors, words can both clarify and distort our perceptions of who we are. Like mirrors, words can put you in a box: they can reduce you to a mere body yet also push you so far out of your own that you no longer feel like you belong to yourself. Like the sharp pieces of a broken mirror, words aren’t inherently violent, but they can be used violently. And like words, mirrors can illuminate but can also cast shadows. They can both shroud and spotlight your existence, both erase and accentuate your presence.
The final image in this series contains a reflection of my own hand trapped in but reaching out of a mirror. The hand looks as if it is reaching out of my mouth because an artist’s hand is her voice. Self-portraiture is an act against the forces that seek to make you — out of “the dream-work” inside someone else’s skull — and an effort to become a maker, yourself. I believe that artmaking is, at its core, also a practice of self-making.

I don’t remember much of my childhood. I seem to have misplaced the memories, tucked them away in some box at a massive storage facility and forgotten the lot number. Still, amidst the blur of the first couple years of my life, one person always remains in focus: my nanu, my mom’s mom.
Back then, my grandma was always visiting our house, and I was always visiting hers. My parents, who worked long, grueling hours, needed all the child care help they could get, and Nanu lived just five minutes away from us. Her home was like an extension of mine, except it was full of so many small, special delights. In the morning, Nanu would carefully brush and braid my hair with a colorful hair tie from her vast collection. After she hand-fed me rice, she sometimes let me wash her porcelain plates, which were decorated with sprawling green fig leaves — a real grown-up task, in my mind. And at night, we’d lie sideways on her bed and she’d whisper silly stories into my ear until I drifted off.
I didn’t notice it at the time, but Nanu and I never traveled far from her home — Nanu couldn’t speak fluent English and couldn’t drive. Even so, I never felt trapped or confined while with her. Her home was a world in and of itself to me, one where we all just happened to speak another language.
***
At some point in third grade, I lost the ability to speak Bangla. Although I could mostly understand my family members, I could not form the words myself. The sounds were familiar to me, but indistinct, too fluid to split up into separate words.
I can’t fully explain how this happened. I know I was sometimes embarrassed to speak a second language. It didn’t help that my teacher often asked me to translate for an E.S.L. student in our class, a Bengali boy best known for regularly peeing his pants. I remember coming home one afternoon and telling my parents I’d never speak Bangla again. But I doubt they would have tolerated my impulse decision if my sister’s teacher hadn’t suggested, incorrectly, that learning both languages could stunt her academic development — more than anything, my parents wanted my sister and me to excel at school. In exchange, we sacrificed something much greater: family and communal ties.
Before the pandemic, I visited my grandma only a handful of times per year. Each time, we rarely spoke. She asked me how I was and offered to make me food; we either played with my younger cousins or sat on the couch and watched sentimental Hindi dramas. I could follow the shows’ plots without the aid of subtitles. They were always modifications of the same story, comforting but monotonous.
The silence was in no way uncomfortable; most times it was pleasant, even relaxing. But underneath was a low thrum of pent-up frustration, which I only became aware of every once in a while. There was so much I wanted to tell her — about my high school track meets, the school paper, later my college roommates — and so much I wanted to ask, that I simply could not.
Growing up, I was shy and reticent around strangers. In college, I knew I had made a good friend when I could share my innermost thoughts and feelings with someone, and when they could open up to me in return. I figured that’s what it was to love someone: to try your best to get to know them, within their limits.
At my most cynical, I wondered how Nanu could possibly love me if she didn’t know me, certainly not as well as some of my friends — and how I could love her in return.
I was aware of the broad strokes of her life — growing up in a wealthy family in Bangladesh, immigrating to the States with my grandpa, becoming a widow not soon after — but I could only make sense of them through photographs. In one, Nanu stands outside of a large compound in Biswanath, dressed in a patterned salwar kameez, young and pretty. In another, she smiles as she waits on a table at the Indian fusion restaurant my grandpa opened. In yet one more, taken after my grandpa’s death, she and my mom and uncle order soft serve from an ice cream truck. They wear t-shirts and jeans; she wears a light green sari. A frantic expression flits over her face, or so I imagine.
Even when I could connect the dots between the images, I never knew how to relate them to the person in front of me. I wanted my nanu to be like the grandmas on televisions, the ones sitting in rocking chairs and reminiscing about the past, but she was stubbornly rooted to the present. Whenever I’d ask her about her childhood or her relationship with my grandpa, she’d offer a brief reply. Then she’d wave her hand and say, “That was so long ago — what does it matter now?”
On campus, my identity felt so malleable, which was both freeing and disorienting. I longed for something solid to hold onto. I envied friends who were sick of hearing their grandparents’ stories over and over again or who could trace distinctive traits like strong chins or melodic singing voices down their family lineages. The desire was, perhaps, petty, but it came from a serious place: if I couldn’t know my grandma’s story, how could I know my own?
***
Not soon after school shut down last spring, I unlocked a new bodily sensation: a skin-prickling restlessness that emerged whenever I looked up from my work, that wouldn’t ease with exercise or calls to friends. Something was wrong, something was missing, but what it was I didn’t know. The sensation faded with time, but persisted. It only truly vanished when I saw my extended family.
That summer, my sister and I began to go on walks with our younger cousins and to small family gatherings in my grandma’s backyard. Masked and more than six feet apart, we didn’t discuss much, besides the sorry state of the pandemic and the one good thing to occur during it: the birth of our cousin, Naail. The get-togethers were awkward, it’s true, but they brought me a primal comfort. On days my uncle and younger cousins chose to stay indoors, either at work or school, I met Nanu on the front porch. I sat on the steps as she quietly watered the vegetables in her crowded garden, a plastic blue watering can in hand. The breeze brushed over my legs, which were warm from resting on the scorching concrete. I thought of nothing; I said nothing; I was more relaxed than I had been in months.
When I FaceTimed my friends, I sometimes obsessed over what I said. Even if I had managed to make them laugh, I kept wondering whether I had been entertaining enough, eloquent enough, normal-sounding enough. I knew better of my friends than to think like that, but at the start of the pandemic I felt like I could lose anything. With Nanu, I could be the unvarnished version of myself.
In October, Nanu’s mother died in her sleep, at home in Biswanath. I walked over to Nanu’s house as soon as I heard. I wasn’t sure what to expect. What would Nanu look like in her most raw state? Would she be sobbing? Or would she be eerily silent? And what should I do in either case?
The answer turned out to be neither. Nanu was sitting on the porch, staring forward into space. Her mother had lived a long, happy life; there was nothing to mope about. Or so she said over and over again, as if reassuring herself it was true. Since coming to the United States, Nanu hadn’t seen her mother for decades. She learned of her death from a 1 a.m. WhatsApp message.
I racked my brain for sympathetic Bangla phrases, but none seemed fitting. I had no idea what sort of woman my great-grandmother was, never mind a picture of her relationship with my nanu. I concluded it’d be better to let my aunt and uncle do the talking. They spoke such rapid Bangla that I could only catch bits and pieces — “age 93,” “immediate burial,” “at peace.”
Is this what it’s like to crash the funeral of a stranger, I wondered, before chastising myself for being so self-absorbed. Really, I was crushed by the thought I could do so little to support my nanu. Sitting quietly and listening and attempting to beam compassion out of my eyes didn’t feel very productive.
After an hour or so, everyone ran out of stories about my great-grandmother and motioned to head home. I was about to turn around and unlatch the front gate myself when I suddenly felt Nanu’s warm, sturdy body against mine. Her cheek was pressed into my shoulder. She had closed the distance between us — she was hugging me.
After some initial shock, my arms found their way around her.
“Thanks for coming,” she said softly.
I nodded, my face flushed with heat. So I had comforted her after all, even without words. I had cared for her, just as she had for me so many times before — I had loved her.
I squeezed her one last time, then let go.
***
The first winter of Naail’s life, my sister and I regularly trekked through snow to see him, to hold his squirming body in our laps. We knit him tiny hats, socks, and mittens. I wrote him letters in my journal; I wanted his future self to know just how well-loved he was, just how much of a joy it was for me to watch him grow. Aside from him, my cousins are all near in age to me; I’ve never cared for them in the same way.
Since then, my aunt has sent daily photos of him to our extended family group chat: evidence of him standing for the first time, of him greedily eating blueberries, of him tying his shoes (or at least trying to). I initially suspected I would become desensitized to them. But even now, every time I receive one, I can’t stop smiling.
I love him so strongly it often surprises me. He can’t yet express himself, in either English or Bangla, but it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t need to respond to me. What I feel for him is both simple and inexplicable. It is what I imagine my nanu feels for me.
I know that Naail will change as he grows older, his features sharpening, his sweet demeanor morphing into that of a teenager’s. I know that we may grow apart, that the time we share may be filled with awkward silences. I also know a part of me will always love a part of him.

“Female financial independence, female education, and female empowerment” lie at the heart of HerCapital, a nonprofit that Rabiya Ather ’15 and co-founder Zabreen Khan started to educate women about all things finance.
Aiming to empower female investors, especially those who may not be familiar with the financial services industry, Ather and Khan developed HerCapital to provide educational content about personal finance and investment. Ather was inspired by her upbringing and the need she saw to fill a gap in resources specifically designed for women’s financial literacy. She says she hopes to make HerCapital “the go-to community for women that want to start or want to learn about personal finance and investing,.”
Growing up in Pakistan, Ather explains how she was surrounded by strong female role models: “My grandmother was the head of our household, and my mom is a very strong woman. My dad is a huge feminist, and I was in an all-girls school, so everyone around me in every leadership position possible was a woman.” Being one of four sisters and coming from a family who valued education led Ather to realize the importance of women’s education from a very young age.
After moving from Pakistan to the U.S. to start her undergraduate degree at Harvard, Ather initially pursued healthcare policy — she was inspired by research she conducted with the World Health Organization on polio eradication in Pakistan. However, after interning at the WHO in Geneva her first summer in college, she wanted to make more of an “immediate impact.” Writing policy papers based on what Ather calls “theoretical suggestions” felt removed from actual practice, so she shifted her focus away from health policy and towards the application of math to solve financial problems.
Ather took this passion for empowering people to make financial decisions to a summer internship at Goldman Sachs on a trading floor in commodities. Reflecting on her time at Goldman Sachs, Ather says, “I've always been in solutions-oriented roles, so helping a pension or an endowment make a big decision. It is gratifying and it has been a huge educational experience.”
After spending almost six years at Goldman Sachs and gaining significant expertise in financial services and investing, Ather recalls that despite feeling competent in her day job, both her and her co-founder felt “quite uncomfortable investing our own personal wealth,” she says. The realization that they themselves played into the trend of women feeling less confident than men about investing their money was the inspiration for HerCapital. Their goal: “make the process of financial education and financial learning easier and more accessible for the average woman,” says Ather. HerCapital pools its members’ financial expertise and know-how to help remove barriers to entry.
Based on the data and anecdotal evidence from their female colleagues, Ather and Khan identified the problem as the gender investing gap: “A lot has been written about the gender pay gap, and even the wealth gap, but both of us felt that there wasn't enough attention being given to this investing gap,” Ather explains. “The concept is that obviously we’re getting paid less, and we have less wealth historically. But now with the wealth we do have, because we are investing 40 percent less, that gap is continuing to widen.”
As to why women may feel more uncomfortable investing their personal wealth, Ather cites the lack of targeted, appealing educational resources about personal finance as a major barrier. “If you look at the educational resources that are available, a lot of them are created by men, for men, and a lot of them almost feel exclusionary to women,” she says.
To close this gender investing gap, HerCapital hopes to develop and expand targeted educational resources that appeal to women in order to make “financial education more natural and less intimidating,” Ather says. In addition to building a world in which e women can have access to educational resources, Ather notes the importance of women starting conversations with each other around personal finance. Ather observed how her male colleagues and peers were having “money conversations in extremely informal settings, and that was leading to them taking action.”. By focusing on the turning point from conversation to action, Ather hopes to make financial education “more organic” so that the resources and community can “actually teach you about personal finance and empower you to make decisions.”
In addition to providing foundational financial knowledge, HerCapital also intends to delve deeper into specific industries by working with experts, partners, and contributing writers. In the long term, she says, interaction between founders and members is crucial to maintaining an engaged community.
As the company grows, Ather hopes to expand the HerCapital community, diversify and deepen the educational resources available, and develop more dynamic interactions with its members. Since its soft launch in 2019, the virtual community has garnered a significant following of women around the world in countries including Pakistan, India, and the U.K.
The next step is what Ather deems a “call to action” — a system that could provide [women with] personalized financial recommendations. Ather wants HerCapital to “dynamically interact with women to help them make the right decisions, or at least inform them of the various types of decisions they can make at each point in their life,” she says.
By incorporating more individualized feedback and fostering a sense of conversation with its community members, Ather hopes to see HerCapital keep “working for the community that we’re building it for.”

In 1950, Harvard students entering Widener Library could feast their eyes on three dioramas depicting miniaturized campus history. If they turned right, they could picture themselves standing in 1677, when Old College stood where Grays Hall is now and the original Harvard Hall had not yet burned down. If they continued down Widener’s west corridor, they could fast forward to 1775 and see Harvard “on the eve of the revolution.” Alternatively, if they turned left, they could see Harvard in 1936, and recall the pomp and circumstance of Harvard’s tercentenary celebrations.
Today, students climbing Widener’s stairs pass only water fountains and reading rooms. When Harvard renovated Widener in 2000, workers removed the dioramas. The Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s endowment, moved the 1936 diorama to its office lobby, while the other two sat in storage and gradually deteriorated. That deterioration led alumni from the Harvard-Radcliffe Class of 1961 to embark on a project to restore the dioramas in time for their 60th reunion this May.
Each diorama depicts Harvard in a different season and at various historical bookmarks in the University’s growth. The 1677 model depicts the completion of the first Harvard Hall, with the original building of the University, Old College, still standing. The 1775 diorama showcases Harvard Yard peppered with more colonial-era buildings, a year before the campus was turned into troops’ quarters during the American Revolution. At the time, Harvard Square was just a triangular patch of grass with two trees on either side. The Allston campus and Business School were nonexistent, nothing more than marshlands across the Charles in the painted backdrop that hugs the diorama’s horizon.
The 1936 model pictures Harvard at its tricentennial, and depicts a nearly complete Harvard Yard, the gym now known as the Malkin Athletic Center, and the River Houses as well as a more familiar, bustling Harvard Square.
The dioramas — commissioned to honor the late Japanese art curator Ernest G. Stillman, Class of 1908 — are painstakingly detailed. Dioramist Theodore B. Pitman, Class of 1914, and a team of 10 others went to great lengths to get the dioramas right, down to the last detail. The 1936 diorama, for example, has more than 2,500 model trees, nearly 900 hand-carved buildings, and more than 1,000 vehicles, all set on a 100-pound base with a painted backdrop.
In a 1947 Harvard Library Bulletin, Rupert B. Lillie, a landscape architect who worked on the diorama project, wrote that the dioramas were gifted by an unnamed “friend of Harvard” to commemorate the University’s 300th anniversary and show Harvard’s expansion from a one-house school to a full-blown research university. In his letter, he divulged his extensive research process in making the dioramas as historically and geographically accurate as possible.
Lillie and the team consulted several libraries, archives, and historical societies for maps and surveys of the Cambridge area. Any areas that weren’t well documented were “systematically photographed” block by block, including the positions of individual trees, Lillie wrote. Lillie even went so far as to reach out to the Cambridge Fire Department and Boston Elevated Railway Company to ascertain how to model firehouse and railyard equipment.
At one point, a woman came into Pitman’s studio, which was in Harvard Square, to view the work in progress — and promptly discovered that Pitman had placed a tree in front of the wrong window in her miniaturized house, according to a Crimson article at the time. Presumably, the detail-oriented Pitman immediately rectified the mistake.
The Pitman studio began with a contour map of Cambridge and cast a plaster base for the diorama. The team collected sea algae in Nahant, Mass. to be repurposed as miniature tree leaves, budding off of faux trunks composed of lacquer-sprayed wire. They constructed and individually detailed University buildings using savogran and wood, and occasionally ornamented them with brass. At a scale of one inch per 50 feet, Harvard’s imposing 195-feet-tall Memorial Hall was reduced to about six inches in length; its spire rose 4.5 inches in the 1936 model.
"The detail that they went to, it’s maniacal,” says Zachary B. Nowak, a history lecturer at Harvard who has done research on the dioramas. “They were just ridiculous about making the buildings accurate.”
The campus dioramas called the corridors of Widener Library home for half a century, but deteriorated without thorough upkeep. Though they were placed into storage in 2000, the Harvard Management Company restored the 1936 model for display in its renovated lobby, where it remains today.
According to Nowak, the other two models remain in a storage facility in Somerville.
In 2018, Newell Flather ’61, the then-president of the Class of 1961 — which includes both Harvard and Radcliffe graduates — somehow stumbled upon the dioramas and thought they desperately needed restoration. The Class of 1961 established a subcommittee to explore restoration options, conducted research, drew up plans, and identified a conservator.
Why did the Class of 1961 choose the dioramas as their permanent class gift to Harvard? “We are all over the age that most of us knew them and remember them with fondness. They had a certain magic about them,” says class member Todd Lee ’61.
On March 13, 2020, the 60th Reunion Committee announced that it had successfully raised more than $300,000 for the restoration, meaning that the project could go forward.
Sarah L. H. Madden, a project manager for Harvard Campus Services, wrote in an emailed statement that “a restoration artist, a painting conservator, a case designer, and a lighting expert” have all been enlisted to work on the dioramas, which will be finished and housed in new display cases by the summer.
For the last four months, conservator Barbara Mangum says she’s undertaken and nearly completed restoration work on the 1677 and 1775 dioramas.
“I was both in awe of the amount of detail that there was and then also kind of appalled by the condition,” Mangum says. “We have speculated that a cat walked over it, but a cat would be pretty careful.”
For the 1775 diorama, 80 percent of the nearly 2,000 trees and about 80 model buildings needed significant repairs, according to Mangum. Due to a huge crack down the middle, it also needed to be stabilized.
During the cleaning process, Mangum says she had to be careful not to vacuum up any miniature pedestrian and animal figurines, often as small as “the tip of your fingernail.”
In January 2021, the Reunion Committee voted to add a video component to the project. According to documents obtained by the Crimson, the Committee has raised around $80,000 out of the $130,000 needed in the campaign. According to Thomas N. Blodgett ’61, the president of the Class of 1961’s class committee, the Committee believed that they could not convince the Harvard Management Company to part with the 1936 diorama, so they decided to at least reunite the three dioramas via video. “We can juxtapose the same visual, the exact same visual angle, magnification, et cetera, on all three in three seconds with a video,” he says.
Lee, who says he has the “over-grand title of executive producer” for the diorama video project, plans to begin filming the dioramas later this month, both at the restoration studio and in the HMC lobby.
But after restoration, the dioramas’ future is unclear. Harvard still owns the dioramas, and no decision has been made on where they might be displayed. Both Lee and Nowak say they hope they can be displayed prominently in the heart of campus for others to learn from.
“[The dioramas] tell, in a quite powerful way, the story of the physical reality of Harvard at different points in its growth. We would like best to have them displayed on Harvard campus near the Yard where visitors can see them,” Lee says. “But we haven’t found a home for them yet.”
A 1955 Crimson article speculated the next date for a new diorama’s construction would be 2036, or Harvard’s quadricentennial.
“This model would include such post-1936 buildings as Littauer, the Graduate Center and Lamont Libraries, as well as future buildings,” the author of the Crimson article predicted. With the University expanding further into Allston and the Greater Boston area, a diorama of present-day Harvard would be far-reaching.
“We’re toying with the idea of a 2036 [reunion], when we will be 97 years old,” Blodgett says. “So that’s the dream, our dream.”

Matt, a Black junior at Harvard, joined his all-male final club because of its “huge population of Black people.” He’d known many of them from the Harvard Black Students Association and the Black Men’s Forum; they were people he admired, and their presence engendered a sense of ease and belonging for him.
He recalls thinking, “Why wouldn’t I want to be a part of it?” (Matt has been granted anonymity out of a fear of being ostracized by members of his club. For that reason, unless attached to a last name, all names in this piece are pseudonyms.)
The space he refers to pushes against the popular imagination of final clubs, which are notorious for the opposite effect — for embodying the confluence of exclusion, wealth, and whiteness so precisely that any analysis of them can end there. (When I say final clubs, I mean historically all-male clubs, which command the bulk of social space and power on campus.)
The opening scenes of the “The Social Network” — the Oscar-winning biopic about Mark E. Zuckerberg’s founding of Facebook — are probably the most famous depictions of Harvard final clubs in pop culture. Four tuxedo-clad white boys stand on the landing of a staircase; below them waits a crowd of women, maniacal anticipation dripping from their collective gaze. It’s the Phoenix Club’s first party of the year, and it’s like any other frat party, really — except for the tuxedos and the middle-aged bouncer and the rooms that feel disturbingly fancy for the college students dancing in them. Lamp light catches on the smoke from cigars; mahogany bookshelves line the walls; t. The vast majority of the boys are white.
In campus conversations and think pieces in national magazines alike, the image of Harvard final clubs as a sanctuary for rich white people persists without a counterargument. “Still White, Still Male,” reads a 2014 headline in The Atlantic. According to a Town & Country magazine piece written by Nathaniel Brooks Horwitz ’18, final clubs are spaces “in which to be other than a rich white man is to be lesser.”
Reading articles like that as a freshman, I didn’t blink an eye. But now, I wonder who fact-checked those statements. Do they imply a quantitative observation, or do they communicate such an obvious truth that no one would even bother investigating? While I don’t have a fact-check, either — final clubs don’t release their demographic information — the conception of their overwhelming whiteness seems poorly researched, at best.
I’m viscerally grossed out by all-white spaces; the overwhelming whiteness of an extracurricular, friend group, or social scene conveys more about its politics to me than a rejection of mainstream tastes or professions of anti-capitalism ever could. For better or worse, those particular alarm bells don’t go off when I enter final club parties. I’m almost certain that if they did, they would no longer be my primary site for good-old college fun. This is purely anecdotal, true for some historically exclusive clubs far more than others. Still, people of color — an admittedly catch-all category, but apt in its description of those whose supposed exclusion grounds so many condemnations of final clubs — are hard to miss, least of all by people of color themselves.
A recent essay by Kalos K. Chu '22-23, a Crimson editor, published in this magazine, asks “why anyone would want their worth assessed by a few dozen privileged, straight, white 19-22-year-olds.” The implicit assumption is a common one: that students of color in final clubs willingly subject themselves to white judgement, all for the sake of conditional acceptance from white structures. That to join a final club is to seek validation from white people — a manifestation of racialized self-hatred.
But Lily, a Black woman in a historically all-male but now co-ed club, offers a blunt rebuttal. “No fucking chance I joined to hang out with white lacrosse boys,” she says. “I definitely only joined for all the cool hot Black people. One thousand percent would not have joined if the Black people weren’t a part of the club, and the only appeal was like, the richest most obnoxious Europeans at Harvard.”
Nearly everyone I speak to echoes a tempered version of this sentiment. At the very least, the noticeable diversity of their respective club was a key reason why most people joined. Sam, a recent Black graduate who was in the Spee, pointed out that any desire to become “white adjacent” would have been fulfilled by pretty much every other part of Harvard. He just wanted somewhere to chill outside of “daddy Harvard’s surveillance,” and in the Spee, he was primarily friends with its Black members.
It’s true that some careers and educational paths — especially those entangled with institutions created and shaped by white people — probably do both rely on and catalyze internalized racism. And I don’t doubt that people of color in final clubs are seduced by the benefits of social capital, of occupying institutions whose allure is rooted in exclusivity and power.
Sam knew that he was “deeply embedded in the vestiges of privilege,” he says. “I gained some acceptance into the space. And my friends did too. And when we were granted the power to do certain things, you know, we were definitely very happy to do those things.” But the ‘power’ that he speaks to isn’t necessarily synonymous with whiteness. Several people, from a range of clubs, allude to how members divide into social circles along racial lines within those clubs; around campus, I’ve heard plenty of invocations of the “Black Spee” or “Black Fly.”
While interviewing Thomas, a Black member of the Delphic, I mention that oftentimes, one of my white friends would bring up another white person and I’d have no idea who they were. They’d be surprised. Apparently, this person was a huge figure in the social scene.
“Oh my god, right?” he agrees, laughing, knowing immediately what I was talking about. Our social lives are heavily intertwined with the world of historically exclusive final clubs — his from the inside, mine from its semi-porous borders. But within that world, a scene that can only be described as ‘white’ exists. And we both feel completely disconnected from it.
When I went through punch during my sophomore fall, I was acutely aware of the fact that final clubs offered a different kind of currency to me than to my male peers. If I ended up joining one — with the exception of two co-ed clubs — I’d gain a new group of women, bonded by some amorphous sense of shared identity, and access to all-male clubs in the form of dinners and parties. Men, on the other hand, would get to host the dinners and control the parties; the million-dollar mansions that house them and the workers who staff them would be at their disposal. I couldn’t believe that money was being thrown at random sophomore guys to fly to Toronto, Los Angeles, and Dallas, as a test of whether other random guys wanted to be their friends. I was both very angry and very jealous.
At the same time, I started to notice the unmistakable absence of Asian people — a discomfort that grew with every subsequent punch event. As a freshman girl at final club parties, I probably registered this but thought little of it; it wasn’t as stark back then, anyway, because more Asian people attend the parties than are in the clubs. But in this environment of direct social comparison, everyone’s itching to meet a set of criteria that are superficially labeled as cool vibes — and, apparently, very few people who look like me are able to meet them.
“I think that clubs said they’ll focus on becoming more diverse over the past few years. But as an Asian person, that’s not necessarily where the focus lies, which is neither a good or bad thing,” says Raymond Hunt ’21-22, an Asian member of the Delphic. “But it's certainly something you notice, just going to the events and seeing a lack of representation of you. No other Asian people.”
For me, that experience was a rude awakening. My high school image consisted of good grades and hard work and debate; I felt limited by that reputation, and, consequently, by my Asian-ness. In my eyes, those two things were inextricable — a linkage reinforced by decades of pop culture portraying Asians as a monolith of robotic intelligence — and rendered my actual personality irrelevant to how people perceived me. The model minority myth haunted me, like a ghost.
But at Harvard, I couldn’t be the model minority because everyone else kind of was, too — the overachieving and brilliant part, not the Asian part. So freshman year, I rarely thought about my race because for the first time, I believed I wouldn’t have to. I had absolute agency to define myself. I could be a social butterfly and get with cute guys and go out all the time — all of which seemed incompatible with my high school identity but that I always secretly thought was within my power. It was only when punch came along that I was forced to consider that my Asian-ness could still hurt me. Suddenly, startlingly, my face morphed into a burden, a distorted representation of me that I had to refute at every turn.
Maybe I should’ve always expected this. Throughout college, Hunt has felt “kind of disassociated from other Asian students because the social circles I’ve ended up with don’t have that many Asian people,” he says. “I was like, I don’t know if I should feel weird about that or not. Feeling like I’m not a real Asian person, I guess, is how I’d put it.” He speculates that this feeling derives from his engagement with the final club scene in tandem with his lack of engagement with Asian affinity groups.
I doubt that the two are entirely separate — or that, say, the near-zero overlap between final clubs and the Asian American Womxn’s Association, which I never joined either, is purely coincidental. Almost like strongly identifying with Asian womanhood is mutually exclusive with being the type of person who would join a final club. As if making an impression in this social scene requires performing some departure from Asian-ness — finding a way to distinguish yourself as edgy or artsy or any other persona that says you’re different from most Asians. If you’re an Asian woman, the world expects you to be quiet, cutesy, submissive. But no, not you — you’re cooler, you’re more irreverent. As Hunt articulates, you’re not a “real” Asian person.
The bleak picture of Asian representation in final clubs becomes even worse when you focus on South Asian representation, and worse still when you look for Latinx members. But beyond the obstacle course of actually joining final clubs — and the limited numbers of people who look like them once they arrive — the four Asian men I speak to have few red flags to report from their time in the clubs thus far. They feel wholeheartedly welcomed and supported, cherished for who they are, and what they care about. One, who is South Asian, says that while he approached punch with concern about clubs’ “relationship to minorities,” it’s turned out to be “really positive … Most of the other people in the club might not have had interactions with other South Asian people before, so you know, they’re constantly very genuinely curious about my heritage, what kind of foods I eat.”
Meanwhile, several people mentioned the “pipeline” that’s been built from Black affinity groups — like the Association of Black Harvard Women and the Black Men’s Forum — to final clubs. Without a doubt, Black people have the largest presence in final clubs of any marginalized racial group. I’ve heard whispers of a sinister half-joke floating around from white people: “I honestly wish I was Black during punch.”
But only the most uncritical analysis would conclude that the existence of a Black final club scene is wholly indicative of social progress. Sam wagers that fetishization, not simply tokenization, plays a role in Black men’s clout on campus. “They look at us and they’re like, ‘Oh my God, that’s a Black man who goes to Harvard. I love that. Let’s get them into the space,’” he says. “It really was people loving me for basically no reason. Like, sometimes we give them very little reason to like us. And because they wanted either to seem cool or progressive or hip, they would include us in these things.” In fewer words, Thomas agreed — in his experience, there was an expectation that Black punches would “be cool.”
Internal conversations about punch frequently revolved around white people’s desire to “get more straight Black men in the club,” Lily reveals. ‘Straight’ is an operative adjective here — it alludes to how straight Black men are often valued for their supposed hypermasculinity. The cults of personality that form around them for seemingly no reason, she says, illuminate the “obsession that final club culture has with them.” She wonders why the focus isn’t ever on getting more interesting white people. “Like, why are all the white men in this club fucking boring?”
This phenomenon, then, suggests how broader stereotypes operate in the microcosm of Harvard social life. Asian people are excluded from the culture, so much so that they’re antithetical to it; Black people are exploited by the culture, so much so that they’re often thought to dominate it. None of this is falsifiable, but I’ll go ahead and theorize: Asian students aren’t final club material, in large part because they’re Asian. Black students are by the fact of their Blackness alone.
Sometimes, the uncomfortable racial dynamics within final clubs easily crossover into the realm of explicit racism. During his first punch event, Sam remembers a white member coming up behind him and touching his hair, before asking if another Black member was his brother. He told the Black member, who sat the offender down and explained why what she did was wrong. A few years later, when he was on the other side of punch, the son of a rich Spee donor made it to the final round despite being a frequent user of the n-word. Only after several Black people stormed out of deliberations did members agree to cut him from the club.
“In this social space where we’re supposed to be feeling free and happy and having fun … something that we’re doing constantly — the Black people in these clubs and the people of color in general — is banding together to teach our white friends about certain things, or to respond to certain incidents,” Sam says.
The Spee Club did not respond to a request for comment.
At parties, Michael, a Black alum of the Phoenix, would hear offhand comments like, “Oh, a lot of hip hop’s playing” at final club parties across campus. Thomas can’t be certain whether all of his fellow club members would easily say the words ‘Black lives matter.’
Still, some say, the racial — or racist — elements of final clubs are hardly unique. “You have to accept that it wasn’t built for you, and, like in most parts of its history, hasn’t accepted people that look like you. But the same goes for Harvard, and for a lot of these institutions that we have and will go on to occupy in our lifetimes,” says Thomas. And if that’s true, then the historical whiteness of something doesn’t mean that people of color should abstain from it entirely. Refusing to sanitize a white space with band-aid diversity also risks leaving whiteness to persist unchallenged.
For many, the presence of people of color in final clubs — however they came to be there, however they may be treated — is a reason for optimism; choosing to be in one is even a powerful political statement. “I think all the time about what it’s like inheriting spaces that profited on the backs of my people. I’m a descendant of African slaves. But, you know, times are different,” Matt says. “Who am I to, like, deny myself access to all of Harvard because of my race?”
Next semester, Thomas will be punchmaster of his club, overseeing the multi-month process of admitting new members. He says he pursued the role because he wants to actively contribute to making final clubs more inclusive.
Others, though, hold a more cynical view, almost laughing at the idea that their decision to join a final club could be mined for a deeper meaning beyond alcohol, parties, and money.
“Why do I want to be a part of it? Because there’s a ton of rich people who will pay for shit for me,” Lily says. “I liked the house, and I liked the things that the house came with. And I liked enjoying those things. And I wish that I had a better reason.”
Sam, too, wishes that his rationale were “more profound” than what it was — knowing a lot of people of color in the Spee and wanting to hang out with them. Come senior spring, he began to regret joining at all. As fun as the luxurious social space was, as meaningful as his friendships became — six or seven members of his linking group ended up in his punch class — he couldn’t totally dismiss the instances “when our disempowerment was just made obvious,” he says. “Sometimes I wish that I had really thought harder about what I wanted my social structures to look like during college, and I wish that I had acted on those things a bit more aggressively.”
Still, when it mattered, he chose the Spee and chose to stay in it, over and over again. His sense of disempowerment didn’t overcome the value he derived from the club — however frivolous he acknowledges it to be. He could deal with the cognitive dissonance of enjoying a space that is, more than likely, inherently antagonistic to Black people. And so could Lily, her cognitive dissonance operating along the axes of gender as well as race.
By the time punch season ended, I’d joined a girls’ club and felt a subdued excitement about it. Everyone was lovely; I could see myself becoming genuinely good friends with many of them. But frustratingly, any social power accrued by a girls’ club seemed dependent on whether the boys with actual social power deemed it worthy of a few crumbs. Before dinner with a guys’ clubs, we were often told how much that club loved us, how cool they thought we were. An initiation task was to lick the floor of an all-male club. I’d bet a billion dollars that no one in that club has ever licked ours.
But then again, didn’t I want to join a club in part because of these very dynamics? I wanted to be able to hand my ID to a ridiculously professional bouncer and glide through the doors of a final club, safe in the knowledge that I’d be on every list; I wanted to dress up for steak and champagne dinners. And as much as I’ve intellectualized the hell out of all of it by now, identifying exactly where my gripes with myself lie, I’ll probably keep wanting those things when I return to campus. I’ll continue to partake in the mindless debauchery that the final club scene facilitates.
Thinking about how she might retrospectively describe being in her club, Lily says, “I was in college. So I did the thing that was fun … It wasn’t important enough to me to not do it. Because not doing it wouldn’t have done anything for anyone except maybe make me have less fun.”
Some people of color who don’t engage with final clubs view other people of color’s membership as a mind-boggling betrayal. Some white people dole out leftist judgement indiscriminately, ignoring nuances that, because of their whiteness, they’ve likely never had to consider. I’ve heard both. But Lily’s articulation is the verbal equivalent of a shrug — almost a defiant one. It indicates, ‘I don’t care that deeply about this,’ and also, ‘Why should I have to?’
Throughout the interviews, I continue to pick up on traces of this sentiment, even if it’s buried a little deeper. Both Ryan K. Hong ’22-23 (who is Chinese and Native Hawaiian) and Michael say that while they’re always conscious of their race, it didn’t really affect the way they engaged with punch. They acknowledge the possibility that race might’ve entered the calculus of those evaluating them, before quickly emphasizing the earnest hope that the final club scene values their holistic selves, beyond whatever racial checkbox they fill. In all honesty, they say, race wasn’t something they thought about too much. They just wanted to be seen as a potential friend, as someone that others could have good conversations with. “People of color are forced to contend with their identity all the time,” Thomas says. “Maybe we’re college students and we should just be staying in, but people of color need to have fun.”
Maybe, then, engaging with historically exclusive final clubs does not align with the moral compass that would dictate every action of their ideal selves. But there’s a decent chance that, through going to Harvard, they aren’t that person anyway. All I write about in this magazine is performing traditional ideals of femininity or submitting to traditional ideals of heterosexual sex is probably not empowering, even though they can so viscerally feel like they are. The fact that I’m an Asian woman makes it even more likely that doing one or both will land me squarely in a trope. And yet, I still sketch my little eyeliner wings and wear my little crop tops and send my absurd little texts.
It could be a cop out, but this is what I’ve come to believe: Existing as a person of color — especially as a woman of color — means experiencing some form of cognitive dissonance wherever you go, whatever you do. It’s nearly impossible to find a corner of this world that hasn’t been tainted by white supremacy and patriarchy; pure choices are few and far between. I’ve given up on trying to craft the minutia of my life into a perfectly coherent political narrative, and I’ve stopped perceiving what I do as a referendum on the integrity of my gendered and racialized identity. (It could be a referendum on my self-control, but that’s neither here nor there). I understand the impulse to, sometimes, just let cognitive dissonance be.
Throughout all of Thomas’s musings on changing clubs from the inside, on how “being Black in the club is a beautiful thing” and the good times he’s had with his fellow Black members, a shadow of doubt lingers — one that undermines the very premise of it all. He repeatedly comes back to one question: Should final clubs even exist?
“Over time, we become more inclusive, along racial lines, along gender lines, along sexuality lines […] It begs the question of whether these institutions that were necessarily exclusive — like their nature was to uphold white supremacy — it kind of begs the question of, do we need that?” Thomas asks. “What does Harvard look like where you don’t have to know three people on the list to get into a party where your friends are hanging out?”
Verbalizing his thoughts on the gendered aspect of final clubs seems particularly difficult. A motivating force behind his decision to join the Delphic was that it shared its space with the Bee — a girls’ club — at the time. Their union, which began after the 2017 sanctions on single-gender organizations, dissolved last fall after the sanctions were lifted, returning sole ownership of the 9 Linden St. clubhouse to the Delphic. Even before, Thomas says that there was “still some cognitive dissonance because […] we didn’t have the same name and we weren’t the same.” He pauses, sighing. “So, ah. It’s hard.”
I believe him, but I’m hesitant to attribute the whole of his discomfort to a difference in names alone. I wonder if the unease emerges from the fact that their temporary marriage never gave the Bee equal access to the Delphic’s wealth, accumulated over the course of its 90-year head start.
Most of the men that I interview are in clubs that have never been co-ed, and that probably won’t be anytime soon. A few express a desire for clubs to move in that direction, but are sure to reiterate that they totally understand the very fair reasons why guys might want clubs to stay all-male. Others, still, say that they were careful to choose a club that fosters a safe and welcoming environment for women (obviously!) while skirting the question of the clubs’ inherent sexism altogether.
Therein lies the question that I’ve purposely neglected thus far: How does my empathy toward cognitive dissonance, the grace I’ve tried to extend toward the men of color in these clubs, hold up in the face of the clubs’ glaring gender inequities? It’s one thing to reconcile your racialized identity with your presence in a racist space; it’s another thing when that space is both racist and sexist — and when you benefit explicitly from the latter, in spite of the former. How does marginalization along one axis of identity justify marginalizing others along another?
Of course, it doesn’t. I believe that all-male spaces are harmful and likely conducive to an echo chamber of toxic masculinity. Beyond discussing whether all-male spaces can yield social value — a discussion that, even with endless data on the prevalence of sexual assault, often ends as an irreconcilable difference of opinion — the material disparities between guys’ and girls’ clubs are proof enough of their fundamental problems. It’s outrageous that non-men are simply barred from tapping into an expansive pool of resources, networks, and hearty non-dining hall meals served in mansions between classes.
Every straight man in every all-male final club should be uncomfortable about this. Exploring how that discomfort manifests in men of color particularly — who are likely familiar with inequality in other forms — was intellectually appealing but grew increasingly silly to me. I didn’t know why their racialization should render them uniquely responsible for feeling bad about sexism or classism or general social exclusion. I didn’t know why it should be a focus of the only piece ever written about the experiences of people of color in final clubs. They should feel bad about it, as should anyone — and, I’d venture, white men most of all.
“You’re going to put people from marginalized backgrounds into Harvard, and then tell them that they shouldn’t also have access to these spaces that make rich white people’s lives more enjoyable and easier?” says Lily. “Like yeah, it sucks that we’re consolidating wealth amongst a small group of people. But to tell Black people that they shouldn’t be a part of it isn’t really what the issue is. Like, maybe abolish final clubs. But final clubs are going to exist, and as a Black person you’re morally bankrupt for being in one? That feels like an unfair indictment of the people whose fault it is not.”
Lily, Thomas, and Sam are the only ones who invoke the potential merits of abolishing final clubs. At the end of the day, final clubs are racist, sexist, and classist, and perhaps irredeemably so. Something has to give. But Sam cautions against scapegoating the “easiest targets” in lieu of analyzing the whole “ecosystem” of Harvard social life, in which so many problems attributed to final clubs can also be identified elsewhere. Comps exist; so do social organizations masquerading as legitimate extracurriculars but premised on exclusivity as much as final clubs. If criticisms don’t extend beyond this single target, he says, “final clubs version two are going to rise up and probably be even worse.”
It’s easier to call for abolishing final clubs than to offer a vision of a genuinely, sustainably inclusive social scene — and one that can be actualized at a school that holds elitism on a pedestal. We should think about what that could look like, whether it demands that we dismantle current structures or work with the ones that we have. If institutions like final clubs can never truly be good, is making them less bad a worthwhile pursuit?
In the Fox’s 2022 punch class of 20-ish guys, only five or six are white; men of color constitute a majority in the Fly. Evidenced by the old photos dotting their hallways, none of this could’ve been true of final clubs a few decades ago — Michael, who graduated only seven years prior, was surprised but heartened to hear the news. This emerging reality is hardly cause for absolution, let alone celebration. But I’m not sure it’s cause for condemnation either — it’s not another instance of people of color tricked, yet again, by the glittering goblet of whiteness.
Final clubs were made for white men. Now, people of color — who were never supposed to step through their gates at all — are carving out communities inside them. They’re drinking their alcohol and smoking their cigars. They’re reveling in these spaces, instrumentalizing the white men’s mansions for pure fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peter L. Slavin ’79 will step down as president of Massachusetts General Hospital, a role he has held for the past 18 years, he announced in a message to hospital affiliates Wednesday morning.
Under Slavin’s leadership since 2003, MGH twice ranked as the top hospital in the U.S. News & World Report “Best Hospitals” list, established numerous research programs including the Ragon Institute and the Center for Clinical Data Science, and spearheaded initiatives to combat racial and ethnic disparities in care.
Slavin’s departure follows that of former Brigham and Women’s Hospital president Elizabeth G. “Betsy” Nabel — who stepped down from her position last month. MGH and Brigham and Women’s form the core of the Mass General Brigham hospital network, known as Partners HealthCare until 2020.
Slavin wrote in his email to MGH employees that he had been considering this move for several months, after which he concluded that “there will never be a right time to leave.” He added that he intends to remain at MGH until his successor is chosen, noting that the hospital is currently undergoing a “crossroads of sorts” due to the pandemic.
“We’re emerging from the depths of a pandemic, we’re rethinking the way we work, we’re re-aligning into a true integrated health care system, we’re planning a magnificent new building, and we’re about to launch a bold comprehensive fundraising campaign,” Slavin wrote.
Slavin also noted that his “proudest” moments as president were “not necessarily in the best of times, but rather in the worst,” citing the resilience and collaboration among MGH staff throughout the course of the pandemic.
“We have seen that sense of support and purpose again and again, including this past year, when our staff drew upon the combination of grit, ingenuity and heart as they courageously marched into battle against COVID-19,” he wrote.
President and CEO of Mass General Brigham Anne Klibanski wrote in an emailed statement to MGH staff that the hospital saw a “time of significant growth and expansion” under Slavin’s leadership.
“Committed to the best clinical care for patients, Peter has fostered a culture that empowers the brightest minds to search for innovative ways to help each patient who looks to the MGH,” Kiblinski said. “He understands that care is truly excellent only when it is framed by kindness and compassion, and he embodies and models these traits every day.”
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 also noted in an emailed statement to The Crimson that Slavin’s leadership had kept MGH at the “forefront of clinical care and community service.”
“Ever since his days as a student at Harvard Medical School, Peter’s connections with our institution have run deep,” Daley wrote. “His acumen, passion and leadership in the practice of medicine for the betterment of humanity embody the spirit and values of Harvard Medical School.”
Slavin — who is also a Professor of Health Care Policy at the Medical School — wrote that he believes new leadership will enhance the long-term direction of the hospital at this transformative moment in medicine and society.
“Now seems like a fitting point in time to call upon a new captain for the ship, someone with new energy and new ideas, who can ably steer this great hospital forward into a bright and promising future as an anchor of Mass General Brigham,” Slavin wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will be the speaker for the Harvard Law School Class of 2021’s virtual Class Day ceremonies, the school announced Wednesday.
The celebration will take place online on Wednesday, May 26.
Warren currently serves as the Law School’s Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law, Emerita. She is a two-time recipient of the Sacks-Freund Teaching Award, which recognizes individuals for their teaching methods, commitment to students, and positive impact at the Law School. In her nearly 20 years teaching at the Law School, Warren criticized exploitative lending practices and government policies that she believed unfairly advantaged the business elite.
Following her career in academia, Warren entered the political fray and successfully ran for U.S. Senate representing Massachusetts in 2012. She was re-elected in 2018.
Between February 2019 and March 2020, Warren ran for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States, building her campaign on principles including restructuring the economy, eliminating corruption, and advocating for ordinary Americans.
Sarah D. Rutherford, a third-year law student and one of the nine class marshals responsible for selecting this year’s speaker, wrote in an email that the cohort “collected recommendations” from fellow students and “worked collaboratively” with the Dean of Students Office during the process.
“Senator Warren represents the best of Harvard Law School,” Rutherford wrote. “Her demonstrated intellectual accomplishments, commitment to service, and unwavering integrity are sure to inspire those who attend Class Day.”
Law School student body co-president Irfan Mahmud ’16 wrote in an email that he is “very excited” for Warren to speak to the graduating class.
“I think she will be a popular choice amongst the student body,” Mahmud wrote. “Really exciting to have a former professor as a Senator, Presidential Candidate, and U.S. leader.”
Rutherford added that Warren’s influential voice on national issues during the Class of 2021’s time at Harvard made her an ideal speaker.
“During our time at Harvard Law School, few people have shaped cultural, political, and historical conversation more than Senator Warren,” she wrote. “We are excited for her to send us off as HLS graduates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 600 Harvard affiliates signed an open letter asking University President Lawrence S. Bacow to designate federal Election Days as instruction-free “Democracy Days” that would offer a holiday to employees and students and provide civic engagement programming.
The letter, which has been signed by more than 400 current students and nearly 150 faculty and staff members, comes after petitions in the fall unsuccessfully lobbied Bacow to designate Election Day as a University holiday.
Nearly 50 campus organizations and more than 60 alumni — including former Board of Overseers President Michael H. Brown ’83 and former Institute of Politics Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 — also signed onto the letter.
The Democracy Day proposal, which was endorsed in a joint resolution by the Undergraduate and Graduate Councils, calls for a designating a day of civic engagement programming on Election Days. It argues that the plan would strengthen the University’s ties with Cambridge residents and increase voter participation among Harvard affiliates.
Alexander K. Park ’23, who helped organize the petition and co-chairs the Harvard Votes Challenge, said the petition calls for “a day on democracy, rather than a day off.”
“Rather than just having a day off — which is a very passive day — a day on democracy would really enshrine democratic values and ideals into everybody, which is why we want this robust programming on Democracy Day,” he said.
Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, who signed on to the petition, wrote in an email that Democracy Days could have “enormous” educational potential if the University plans events to teach “the history, workings, and effects of democracy.”
Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, another faculty signatory, likewise applauded the petition’s organizers for going “beyond the binary” decision of whether to hold or cancel classes on Election Day by proposing a new plan to highlight civic learning and action.
“Our country's civic bonds have been fraying, and experimenting with, and modeling, ways to repair and strengthen them seems core to the University's identity,” Zittrain wrote in an email.
Several of Harvard’s peer institutions, including Brown University and Columbia University, provide days off on Election Day. Lily Richman ’24, an organizer of the Democracy Day effort and co-chair of the Harvard Votes Challenge, said the proposal’s civic action programming would distinguish Harvard’s plans from the holidays offered by other schools.
The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Kennedy School reported that 48.6 percent of eligible student voters at Harvard cast ballots in 2018 — up from 22.4 percent in 2014.
Park and Richman said they are confident that time off for Election Day would have improved voter turnout among Harvard affiliates in 2020.
“As we head out of the 2020 election year, it felt really, really important to take these things that we care about so much — civic engagement and voter turnout — and institutionalize them to make sure that these processes are even easier for people going forward,” Richman said.
Harvard’s Human Resources policies currently state that employees “must be given time off with pay if such time off is necessary” for them to vote. The policy also says, however, that “normally such time off is not necessary because the period of time the polls are open extends beyond most normal work schedules.”
Mark R. Haidar, a Harvard Law School and Kennedy School student who helped organize the Democracy Day effort, said the proposal was released now in hopes of Harvard adopting it ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, one of the original faculty signatories, wrote in an email that he signed on to the petition because it “is a critical moment to stand up for democracy, voting, and voting rights.”
“The students are right and Bacow was wrong,” he wrote. “Election Day should be a holiday, as it is in most democracies. Harvard can be a national leader in embracing and promoting civic participation on our own campus.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote that school leaders are aware of the Democracy Day proposal.
“As President Bacow and other University leaders have expressed, Harvard encourages everyone in our community to exercise their right to vote, as it is indeed one of the pillars of our democracy,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement. “One way the University supports this important right is through human resources policies that provide employees with flexible, paid time off for voting.”
Pointing to a state elections law passed in Georgia earlier this month that adds new restrictions on voting in the state, Winthrop House Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers wrote in an email that providing time off for affiliates to vote would help improve voting accessibility.
“It’s nonsensical to declare commitment to being an anti-racist institution but not support any steps towards making voting more accessible,” she wrote.
“Voting does not exist in a vacuum,” she continued. “If you want to be anti-racist then you support a more equitable and accessible electoral process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President Bill Clinton reflected on the foreign policy challenges of his presidency at the inaugural Stephen W. Bosworth Memorial Lecture in Diplomacy, hosted Wednesday by the Harvard Kennedy School.
The virtual event was the first in a lecture series sponsored by the Future of Diplomacy Project at the Kennedy School to honor the legacy of the late Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth, who served as ambassador to South Korea under Clinton.
After opening remarks by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns interviewed Clinton about the diplomatic issues he confronted in his two terms in office.
Clinton said he believed America had “unprecedented” influence in the world at the time he entered the White House in 1993.
“I thought it was my job to try to build a world that America would be happy to be a leader in, but could no longer dominate — a world that could be as safe and fruitful as possible for the people of our country, and as many other countries as we could persuade that we should work together,” he said.
Clinton also spoke about his approach to diplomacy with Russia, which became an independent country after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
“Russia was really important to me, because it’s a great country with a storied history, and they were in bad shape when I took office,” he said. “I didn’t think that humiliation was a very good strategy. I thought we needed to help them build in a positive way.”
He also reflected on his strategy towards U.S. relations with China, noting that the U.S. “has no choice but to work with them.”
“With China, our ‘work for the best, prepare for the worst’ scenario means that we have to do everything we can to cooperate with them in fighting climate change,” he said. “There are lots of win-win solutions there that may reduce tensions everywhere.”
In response to a student question about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Clinton noted the need to assume that there will be other infectious diseases that spread throughout our “interdependent world” in the future.
He said public health “ought to become an integral part of our foreign and domestic diplomatic policy,” and expressed hopes that young people will want to be a part of “building an International Health Corps.”
Clinton also reflected on Bosworth’s legacy and described the ambassador’s bipartisan outlook as “the total psychological opposite to what we see today.”
“This us-and-them business is killing us in America,” he said. “And it’s bad business for diplomacy.”
In a statement after the event, Burns — himself a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and to Greece — also described Bosworth as “the ultimate diplomat.”
“He believed that America could succeed through diplomacy — through the peaceful resolution of disputes,” he wrote. “He was a listener who also believed we had to show respect toward other countries and find a way to resolve the most difficult disputes — on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere.”
The purpose of the event was threefold, according to Burns: to honor Bosworth, share wisdom from Clinton, and highlight the critical importance of diplomacy.
“We hoped to elevate in the minds of the Harvard community the importance of diplomacy and the need for the U.S. to make a greater commitment to it,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations awarded actress, director, and producer Taraji P. Henson its Artist of the Year award at its annual Cultural Rhythms event earlier this month.
The ceremony, which took place on April 1, concluded the 35th installment of Cultural Rhythms, an event the Foundation holds annually to showcase and celebrate cultural and ethnic diversity at the College. The show features student performances and a celebration of the Artist of the Year. Past honorees include Shakira and Denzel H. Washington.
During the ceremony, Robin M. Johnson, director of the Harvard Foundation’s Office of Diversity Education and Support, said the Foundation honored Henson for her contributions to both the entertainment industry and public conversations around race and mental health.
Johnson cited Henson’s nonprofit, the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, which seeks to destigmatize mental health issues among Black Americans.
“You have inspired us to break the silence, to quiet the inner critic, to resist the doubters and detractors, to speak our truth, to be our authentic selves, to find healing and hope, and to spark, cultivate, and fully experience joy in our lives,” Johnson told Henson.
Henson, who has starred in the Oscar-nominated film “Hidden Figures” and the television show “Empire,” said at the event she believes it is important to support other women, even in the competitive entertainment industry.
“I don’t compete with women. I compete with myself,” Henson said. “Women are my allies, and I wish that we could all get to this place.”
Derrick T. Ochiagha ’22, a student leader of the event along with Mariana Haro ’23, said another reason the Foundation honored Henson as Artist of the Year was for her work in empowering Black voices, especially those of Black women.
“She’s really helped carve out a new kind of role for Black women in television, and I think that’s something that really spoke to us,” he said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana called Henson an “inspiration” and virtually presented her with the award, which she held up to her camera for the Zoom audience of roughly 200.
In a typical year, Cultural Rhythms is held in Sanders Theatre. Harvard Foundation senior director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 wrote in an email that the challenges of Covid-19 — in addition to ongoing racism and xenophobia — made the Foundation “completely rethink” its approach to the show this year.
“Every year, we witness the tremendous talent that is alive in our community, but Cultural Rhythms is about so much more than talent,” he wrote. “In the face of challenges generations in the making, these performances are acts of cultural preservation, of self-preservation, and of resistance.”
The event also featured student performers, including the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College and Remka Y. Nwana ’23, who delivered her spoken word poem “I Know Who You Are.”
In an interview after the event, Nwana said she decided to perform because she is passionate about uplifting marginalized voices.
“My whole goal in life is to speak out for the voices that have been silenced and unheard,” Nwana said. “The theme of Cultural Rhythms this year, which was about fighting injustice and stereotypes — I felt it was centered around the stuff I like to go after in my poems.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Advocates and supporters of Ekpar Asat — a tech entrepreneur and brother of Rayhan Asat, Harvard Law School’s first Uighur graduate — gathered Wednesday in a virtual event commemorating five years since he was detained by the Chinese government and placed in a Xinjiang internment camp.
In a speech titled “For You I Rise,” Rayhan Asat said that April 7, 2016 — the day her brother was forcibly disappeared by the Chinese government — marks the “beginning of the nightmare” she has experienced daily for five years.
“I’m still in disbelief how one person’s life can be ruined against all reason at the pinnacle of his career,” Asat said. “A visionary who created opportunities for many up-and-coming writers, musicians, artists, and other young people. His focus was always on making the world better for others through collective effort.”
United States Senator Christopher A. “Chris” Coons (D-Del.) and University Professor Martha L. Minow delivered opening remarks.
Coons, who is the co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Human Rights Caucus, thanked Rayhan Asat and other advocates for their “work to shine a light” on the discrimination Uighurs faced in China. He said the United States should continue pressuring China to halt its “mistreatment of Uighurs.”
“We also must insist that China respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its own people,” Coons said. “I hope this time next year, we can hold an event in person celebrating Ekpar’s freedom with the Asat family, and with Ekpar himself.”
Minow, who was the dean of Harvard Law School during Ekpar Asat’s forced disappearance, said in a statement read by her mentee, Law School student Sondra R. P. Anton, that the Law School was “so delighted” to welcome Rayhan Asat as a Master of Laws student in 2016.
“The continuing effort to speak about and challenge this disturbing fact is vital to anyone who cares about the safety of and the dignity of Ekpar as an individual, and indeed anyone who takes seriously the human rights of each individual in the world,” Anton said on behalf of Minow.
Human Rights Watch China Director Sophie Richardson encouraged attendees to understand the situation on “a more human and humane level,” and said an individual such as Ekpar Asat is “hardly an enemy of the state.”
“Here is a young man who was once celebrated by the various authorities now detaining him,” Richardson said. “This is a person who had devoted his life and his intellect and his creative energies to being an entrepreneur, first, and then a philanthropist, providing assistance to children in education.”
In an emailed statement following the event, Asat said the Chinese government’s “unjust detention” of her brother “will not advance its interest.”
“I wish to visit the country and culture I grew up in without the fear of persecution,” she wrote. “And I hope to see a China where all Uyghurs are free and live with dignity.”
Irwin Cotler, chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, described the event as “timely and significant” and placed Ekpar Asat’s story in historical context by referencing past atrocities such as the Holocaust.
“What makes the Holocaust so unspeakable are not only the horrors of the Holocaust themselves,” Cotler said. “What makes them so unspeakable is that they were preventable. Nobody can say, ‘we did not know’ — we knew, but we did not act.”
In her emailed statement, Asat wrote that her brother has been in solitary confinement and was recently seen in a video where he appeared to be a “shadow of his former self.”
“I was devastated to hear about his solitary confinement knowing the damage it can cause even to a healthy young man,” Asat wrote. “It was a stark reminder that the sheer cruelty he’s facing every day is beyond the pale, and I must intensify my effort to free him.”
Asat wrote she was thankful for several individuals who assisted in preparing the event at the Law School, including Tzofiya M. Bookstein ’23, Rebecca S. Araten ’22, Joshua Moriarty ’21, and Anton.
“I hope to continue to lean on my incredible community,” Asat wrote.
Harvard freshman and musician LyLena D. Estabine ’24 wrote and performed a song during the event commemorating Asat, titled “A Song for Ekpar.”
“Keep holding on, things they will get better if we keep trying to heal one another,” Estabine sang. “Seek unity and fight for each other, we’ll make it through if we walk together, nothing says the darkness has to last forever.”
Despite having lived in fear for many years, Asat said that now — “joined by an army of friends and allies” — she feels empowered to continue her advocacy work and fight for the release of her brother.
“Today I want to say to my brother that I finally bid farewell to the fear that kept me silent for too long,” Asat said. “I fight for you.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a Wednesday interview that Harvard plans to follow a normal academic calendar in the fall semester as it transitions back to in-person operations.
Gay announced in March that the FAS is planning a full return to residential life and classroom instruction in the fall semester, including providing as much in-person learning as possible. To prepare for an in-person fall, the FAS is currently piloting in-person learning experiences, which Gay said began “late last week.”
“The first pilot class was in CS, and throughout the next several weeks, there’ll be a number of class sessions in Harvard Hall,” Gay said. “I also understand that [the Office of Undergraduate Education] is conducting some outdoor pilot sessions, including a singing class in the tent that’s going to set up behind Sever, a performance art class in Farkas, and also some sessions of undergrad lab classes.”
Gay said the OUE will survey faculty and student participants in the trials for feedback.
Gay also said the fall semester would operate under a traditional fall calendar, including Thanksgiving break. Notably, the calendar would not include wellness days, which were instituted this semester in lieu of a spring break.
“At this time, we’re not anticipating any changes to the established academic calendar for the upcoming academic year,” she said.
Wellness days have received a mixed reaction from students. While some have said they are “relaxing,” others have commented that wellness days have been “more time to do homework.” In a Tuesday interview with The Crimson, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said wellness days could possibly supplement — rather than replace — usual breaks in the future.
Gay also commented on the recent admission of a full cohort of students to the College’s Class of 2025. She said she “can't wait to welcome them to campus and to Cambridge in the fall.”
“We chose to admit a full class despite the many deferrals matriculating this fall because we really believe in the promise of this incredibly diverse and accomplished group of students,” Gay said. “We are committed to opening the door of opportunity to all talented students, even if it means confronting the challenge of accommodating more students on campus next year.”
The 349 students originally admitted to the Class of 2024 who deferred their matriculation for a year will be joining the newly-admitted cohort in the fall. Nonetheless, Gay said all students enrolled in the fall should be able to access Harvard-affiliated housing.
“As Dean Khurana has expressed, we are actively preparing for a larger number of students in the fall,” Gay said. “We’re looking at all possible options to accommodate students in housing on campus or in Harvard-affiliated housing near campus, really with the goal of providing Harvard housing to all students who want it.”
Gay said Harvard is “eager to welcome our international students back to campus,” although she recognized that these students may face “particular hurdles” as they prepare to return to Cambridge next fall.
“We have assured students that they can confidently apply for visas, knowing that we will offer in-person instruction,” she said. “We recognize that some students may confront delays in visa processing that will impact their ability to come to campus, and the College and GSAS are going to work directly with those students to help them navigate their program options.”
While Gay said she maintains the “overarching ambition and goal of a return to full operations in the fall,” she is aware that uncertainty regarding the pandemic will linger.
“Some degree of this is not entirely within our control,” she said.
“There are very few ‘red means stop, green means go’ moments,” Gay added. “There’s no expectation that we’ll move abruptly from the current status quo to full return. It’ll be something that will be introduced gradually, over these next few months.”
“It’s important to acknowledge that case numbers do continue to rise at a steady rate,” she said. “I take from that that we clearly have a long road ahead of us, and now’s not the time to become complacent.”
Gay shared that the FAS tentatively plans to announce its final plan for the fall semester — covering housing, financial aid, and re-entry protocol — in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Health and technology experts discussed the advantages and pitfalls of deploying artificial intelligence to improve health care equity at a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences panel Wednesday.
The event, hosted by the Center for Research on Computation and Society, featured talks by Heather Mattie, lecturer on biostatistics at the School of Public Health; David S. Jones ’92, a professor of the culture of medicine at the Medical School; and Nathaniel Hendrix, a postdoctoral research fellow at HSPH. Shalmali Joshi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Research on Computation on Society, moderated the discussion.
Mattie opened the event with a discussion on algorithmic bias, which she defined as an algorithm “biased against some group over another.”
She stressed that almost all steps in the “pipeline” of “creating and implementing” an algorithm are subject to bias.
The first area of improvement Mattie addressed was the issue of biased datasets.
“A lot of the genome mapping studies, most of the individuals in those studies were of European descent. They’ve started to try to balance out representation which is great — and so have clinical trials,” she said. “But those are two very big examples of an imbalance in who’s represented in the data and therefore, who we have more information about and can make better predictions for with our algorithms.”
Mattie also emphasized the importance of transparency in choosing an algorithm, and pointed out that many papers “fail or neglect to mention where their algorithm goes wrong.” In the context of health care, Mattie said even small errors can affect “millions of people.”
Also touching on the issue of representative datasets, Jones argued diversity in datasets involves factors such as employment, housing, income, and wealth, rather than simply race and ethnicity.
“If you don’t have all of these measures in your data set, there’s no way you’re going to get an optimal outcome because you’re analyzing an incomplete picture,” he said.
Jones also said he is skeptical of a practice known as race-norming, in which “you conduct a diagnostic test on people, but then use different norms to evaluate deviation from normal for people of different races.” He said this practice has been applied to pulmonary function tests for decades, among others.
“Now, with each of these [tests] there is an empirical basis — you can point to studies showing that the norms are different,” he said, “The question is whether those data are robust, and if the race-based norms reflect some kind of racist structuring of the society.”
For example, physicians have criticized pulmonary function algorithms for assuming lower lung volumes in Black people and normalizing lung damage caused by poor environmental conditions and medical care.
Hendrix followed the other speakers with an analysis of how clinical AI could be useful in determining the impact of certain health treatments.
“It allows us to estimate the clinical impacts of interventions that really have only told us how their performance is,” he said. “We can take, for example, a diagnostic AI, take its sensitivity, include it in a model like this, and estimate its clinical impact.”
While Hendrix presented other benefits of using clinical AI, such as its potential to bring down health care costs by “automating our disease monitoring,” he also cited problematic cases in which researchers do not have enough information on how well AI “agrees with human clinicians.”
Hendrix presented a contrast between two AI tools: one caught more cases overall, while the other caught more cases that physicians would miss.
“We have an AI that catches fewer cases overall, but it catches more of those cases that the clinician does miss,” Hendrix said of the second tool. “Even though it’s a lower performing AI, we might say, it might provide more value.”
Though panelists agreed AI in health care has fallen short in many regards, all said they have hope that if AI is implemented correctly, it can have lasting impacts on the health inequities and the effectiveness of health care.
“The question is: will we invest the resources and do these things well?” Jones said in a post-panel interview.

Whether you’re taking classes from your dorm room, an apartment, or your childhood room at home, one thing is probably true: you’re spending a lotttttt of time in that space. Far too much, probably. Sometimes I really don’t know how much longer I can continue to stare at the ~steaming~ dumpster (why does it do this??) outside of my window. Rather than buying another poster to hang in my Zoom backdrop to make myself look more edgy, I did myself a favor and invested in some beautiful, oxygen-producing plants!!
After experimenting with growing some tulips on my windowsill, I’ve progressed to growing a few tropical plants on my desk that offer a much better view than the steaming dumpster. At first, I was a little hesitant to go ham with plant-buying since I’m not exactly the green thumb type, but honestly, all of the plants I’ve bought have been extremely resilient despite my occasional forgetfulness, so if my plants can thrive, yours (probably) can too...
If you’re looking to get started on the journey of spicing up your room with plants and you’re in the Boston area, this is a shameless plug for niche, a plant store in Somerville. The store is filled with absolutely beautiful plants and personally really appeals to my I-just-became-a-vegetarian-and-I-want-to-be-environmental-royalty side, which I’m sure applies to at least 20 percent of Harvard students,,,,, maybe more.
ALSO, if you’re more of a lazy plant person, but want to grow yourself some fresh herbs or lettuce, I highly recommend the AeroGarden (thanks for the birthday gift, Mom). All you have to do is fill up the container with some water and liquid plant food, and the plants literally just grow themselves. No need to worry about making sure the herbs are getting enough sunshine, because the lights in the kit time themselves and let you know when to refill the water or plant food. I keep my AeroGarden on my windowsill, and in only a few weeks, I was able to grow Romaine lettuce for salads and some basil that made the absolute best pesto.
In my experience, some plants are honestly pretty hard to grow, especially because I frequently forget that I need to take care of them, and that they do not just exist purely for my amusement. But, don’t fear, there are some plants that are super low maintenance and also super pretty! My best advice would be to buy plants that are pre-potted (like tulips or other fast growing flowers) and only need to be watered a few times a week when the soil gets noticeably dry. Also, I’ve found my best bet is to buy a big pot that has a bunch of different flowers/plants in it, because at least some of them are bound to grow, amirite?
Be warned: the plant business is honestly addictive. The plants outnumber the people in my apartment at least four to one, and the ratio is only increasing. Bottom line... if you’re feeling bored of your study space and are looking for a little extra oxygen boost, go treat yourself to some plants and have fun with it!

Is your roommate leaving garbage all over the dorm? Did you wake up yet again from your neighbors down the hall blasting music? Want to just talk to your friends about your day, but don’t know how to start the conversation? Let’s face it — we’ve all been there before. With our iPhones in hand and an Instagram feed just waiting to be scrolled, it’s all too easy to avoid the tough, necessary, and sometimes really critical conversations. So, next time you have something to say or want to confront a friend about something on your mind, keep this guide as a reference.
Talk. 
It sounds simple, but sometimes initiating a conversation — even if it seems informal — is really challenging. How do you tell your roommates that you are constantly frustrated by the alarms in the morning that seem to wake up everyone but them? You tell them. Send a text to your roommates letting them know that something is on your mind and that you want to discuss it with them. Maybe suggest a conversation over dinner (or a bag of popcorn) – if we’re being all confrontational here, we may as well be eating yummy food :)
Be upfront ASAP. 
The longer you push off a conversation, the more intense the feelings sometimes become. Did your roommate forget to take out the trash? Did they say something that irked you? Talk to them right then and there, whether it be in that moment or that same day, so that the situation can fizzle out and not blow over.
Schedule a weekly debrief. 
Literally. Compare your schedules and find a time each week to sit down and catch up with one another. Maybe it’s just us, but Zoom really makes the days fly (zoom) by. It’s all too easy to get caught up with a pset or a paper and forget that you are surrounded by real (and not virtual) humans. We would suggest spicing up with weekly debrief by planning some cute, small activity to do. Talk about how you are feeling about this semester while knitting? Count us in.
Remember that we are all human and that these times are unprecedented (yes, that word is overused but nevertheless fitting).
We are all going through our own challenges and struggles, and each Zoom day comes with its ups and downs. If you are frustrated about something or just have something on your mind, most likely your roommates and friends do too. Make sure your voice is heard and reciprocate by being a good listener. You never know — maybe you and your roommates are even experiencing similar feelings!
Navigating conflict is always a challenge, especially during month nine hundred and fourteen of the global hot potato. While this list is by no means exhaustive or infallible advice, it probably can’t hurt to be upfront, honest, and compassionate in most situations. Take this as your sign from the universe to be confident and address whatever’s been on your mind lately!

Two decades before their careers converged as activist hedge fund managers, William A. Ackman ’88 and Paul C. Hilal ’88 were arguing about everything, including the physics of weightlifting in a Harvard gym. Bill recalls that he was always right. He would not have submitted a timely Social Studies thesis, however, without a kick from Paul.
The Lowell House roommates — who came to invest billions together at Pershing Square Capital Management — first met in their house dining hall after an introduction by a mutual friend. They reflect on finding fulfillment in finance and in the company of one another.
