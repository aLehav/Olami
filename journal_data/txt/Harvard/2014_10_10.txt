After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, the world watched as over 2,100 Gazans and 71 Israelis were killed in the latest war in Israel-Palestine. As bombs and rockets flew over Gaza and Israel, tensions ran high within the American Jewish community, and particularly among American Jewish college students. Some supported Israel’s operations, while some condemned them, and others fell somewhere in between.
Yet Hillel International, the umbrella organization for Jewish life at colleges and universities around the country, has failed to reflect the diversity of opinion among Jewish students. In a news update, Hillel International wrote that “the entire Hillel family” stood in support and solidarity with “the nation of Israel … [as well as] the government and people of Israel” during the war.
Yet, there was no consensus among “the entire Hillel family” on this issue, just as there is no consensus within “the entire Hillel family” on any issue relating to Israel-Palestine. Indeed, according to the 2014 Demographic Survey of American Jewish College Students, while Israel was by far the issue of most importance to young Jews, only 35 percent of those surveyed felt that supporting Israel was very important. If an issue is highly important, but also highly contested, as these data suggest, then open discourse on that issue is essential. As the self-proclaimed “Foundation for Jewish Campus Life,” Hillel has a duty to create a space for such open dialogue.
Yet Hillel fails to do so.
Two years ago, the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance planned an event, “Jewish Voices against the Occupation,” intended to be held within Hillel. The event featured two Jewish speakers—one American and one Israeli—who had participated in protests against the Israeli Defense Forces’ demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank. Yet because the event was cosponsored with the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, the event was barred from Hillel. Hillel deemed any official association with PSC, Harvard’s only Palestinian student group, as a violation of Hillel International’s Standards of Partnership. These standards bar Hillel from working with any speakers or organizations that “delegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel,” or support any form of boycotts, divestments, or sanctions against Israel.
Hillel’s standards introduce a political litmus test that precludes any meaningful engagement between Jewish and Palestinian student groups. Furthermore, at schools around the country, the standards severely limit the ability of Jews and Israelis deemed too critical of Israel to voice their concerns. The standards also exclude Jewish students from the Jewish community on campus. Ultimately, the Standards guidelines make any open and meaningful debate on Israel-Palestine within Jewish campus communities impossible.
In response to the banning of this event from Hillel, PJA joined with students at a few other Northeastern schools to launch the Open Hillel movement, petitioning Hillel International to abolish its Standards of Partnership and embrace political pluralism and open dialogue. The movement quickly gained momentum and grew to encompass dozens of active organizers and thousands of supporters around the country. In December 2013, the student board of Swarthmore Hillel unanimously voted to defy Hillel International’s Standards and become the first Open Hillel; Vassar and Wesleyan soon followed.
This weekend, Open Hillel will make history in yet another way. From October 11 to 13, we are hosting a conference here at Harvard, bringing together 300 college students and recent alumni from across the country. The conference will create a space for conversations not bogged down by Standards of Partnership or the political whims of Hillel’s major donors. It will feature leaders in Israel-Palestine-related academia and activism, including many who have been barred from Hillel and other Jewish institutions in the past, such as Judith Butler, Rashid Khalidi, and David Harris-Gershon.
It will be a place for participants of all perspectives to share their thoughts and ideas on Israel-Palestine. We’ll look beyond Israel-Palestine as well, discussing issues facing our Jewish communities here in the United States. In addition to panels on topics ranging from human rights in Israel-Palestine to race, gender, class, and sexuality in the Jewish community to competing historical narratives, our conference will feature opportunities for students to meet together and strategize about how to create change on their campuses and in their local contexts.
At this conference, young people from around the country will come together to create the open American Jewish community that we want to see.
We hope you will join us this weekend. Some students are trekking across the country to attend—you only need trek to the SOCH. Make your voice count.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week the Supreme Court decided to let stand appeals court rulings allowing same-sex marriage in five states, ushering the largest victory for the rights of same-sex couples across the country since the Windsor case in June of last year. The Court's orders tacitly confirmed the right to same-sex marriage in 30 states, for in letting stand the decisions in three federal appeals courts overturning bans on same-sex marriage in Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Indiana, and Wisconsin, the Court also paved the way for the six other states in those courts' districts to overturn similar bans.
Though the Court's decision not to hear arguments in practical terms is a victory for same-sex couples, it is still curious move. It is wonderful that now in a majority of states same-sex couples will have legal recognition of a right they should have had long ago, but the Court's actions have still delayed the question of a nationally-recognized right to same-sex marriage. Today, poll after poll has shown that a majority of the American people believes that same-sex couples ought to have the right to marry, and the Court ought to affirm this right explicitly in the near future. It took until 1967 for the Court to explicitly rule that anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional, and we hope that a similar delay will not take place with the case of same-sex marriage.
The Court and this country have made incredible strides in the direction of expanding the rights of same-sex couples to marry, but marriage inequality remains only one of many systematic injustices against members of the LGBTQ community in this country. The percentage of the population that identifies as LGBTQ is disputed, but nearly 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT. Fifty-two percent of the LGBT population lives in states that do not prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, and 83 percent lives in states with no laws banning "gay conversion therapy" for minors. Discrimination against the LGBT community is still virtually everywhere, and it is our duty to dismantle discrimination wherever we happen upon it.
Congress, by its inaction, has tacitly confirmed its belief that these issues are not a priority. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act should have been passed long ago. But in its current form, with a broad religious exemption provision tacked on, it is a shell of its former self. Civil liberties groups across the country have withdrawn their support. ENDA simply isn't what it needs to be, and it is shameful that Congress has let these issues fall by the wayside.
Equality and justice are the ends of long and difficult struggles, but victories are coming, and continue to come. We hope they come quickly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So there’s this girl, and she’s so fine and so fierce my heart does a little desire-mambo every time she walks into a room. And we’re talking on the phone the other night and I tell her about a new friend I made, who’s smart and radical and super cool, and also, I tell Ms. Desire-Mambo, “in a final club.”
This is something of a Deal for me, since I only have a couple good friends in final clubs, and isn’t it cool to analyze social structures with people who have slightly different standpoints than I do? And at this point in the conversation, Ms. Desire-Mambo kind of snorts, as if to say, "Reina, you are ridiculous,” and goes, “I’m in a final club! You’re friends with me!”
You know what the weirdest part of this story is? When she said that, I felt intimidated by her a little bit. This is a chick who knows what my boobs look like (though so does all of Adams B entryway, since I have an ideological aversion to window shades), a chick who knows about my weird sexual fantasies. We’re friends. We are Comrades. But one little mention of these institutions is enough to send me awkwardly cowering in my sparkly leggings like a gay seventeen year old who just met Penelope Cruz.
Why in fuck's name is this?
An article in the Harvard Political Review last week went pretty far in telling us why. It focused on “social exclusivity on elite campuses”—in other words, Harvard’s final clubs. It was an angry article. I can dig anger. I feel angry a lot. I feel angry when people exclude people. I feel angry about sexism. I feel angry about discrimination, and queer-bashing, and cruelty. I feel angry when pineapple is underrepresented in fruit salad. And sometimes, I feel angry about final clubs.
The article hits the critiques we’ve all heard: The structure of the male final club system causes many women to seek access through sexuality; female clubs, newer institutions, have smaller endowments and alumni networks; it can be awks to bring someone of the same gender to a date event; binary gender structures (as in bathrooms, sororities, boy scouts) are alienating to trans and gender non-binary students. Methodologically shaky data (cited in the article) tell us that final clubs absolutely contain members of color, but proportionately fewer than in the College at large. And class? The same combo of anecdotal evidence and Crimson surveys say that while a lot of working class students have great experiences at clubs, a legacy of disproportionate wealth still exists. Add to this the fact that you have to be invited to even apply for membership, and you’ve got networks that are particularly entrenched.
This stuff makes me want to weep on a regular basis. It’s nefarious, and it is structural. But here’s the thing: It’s everywhere.
Final clubs are not uniquely responsible for the problem of exclusivity on this campus, though they are particularly visible and afford specific types of access. Gender and class and race inequalities are endemic here, as they are in the broader world. This is true for the places I get my Friday night liquor—the Crimson, or the Advocate, or the Lampoon—as well as the places me and my sassy heels haven’t frequented since I was a freshman. Even Queer Students and Allies, which is dedicated to inclusivity, can feel alienating. And have you seen our admissions statistics? Do we all know that 30 percent of Harvard students come from households with incomes in the national top 2.5 percent?
With a five percent admissions rate, Harvard is predicated on exclusivity. But no one spends their Saturdays sitting in a lair with their pinkies to the corners of their mouths plotting evil. Final clubs are not monolithic; they’re a collection of institutions made of collections of people. And most people are nice. You’re nice. I’m nice. Your roommate is kind of an asshole, but that’s mostly sleep deprivation. And that’s the most important thing, and also the hardest: We can all have a bunch of feelings about final clubs as structures—I sure as hell do—and also realize that these problems are not any one person’s fault.
We have collectively inherited these systems, and all of us—having made the choice to come to Harvard—also know that choice isn’t much of a choice at all; all of us make decisions that are uncomfortable, are part of systems we don’t entirely identify with or that weren’t built for us, or have a great time in institutions that have effects we don’t want or intend. There are lots of reasons to punch a final club, just like there are lots of reasons to punch Harvard: It’s your ticket out of poverty; you like the people; your mom would be pissed if you didn’t follow in her footsteps; you really want to study folk and myth. People are smart: We know what the problems are, how we’re privileged, how we’re alienated. And we’re working on it: from the inside, from the outside, from the flipside.
Feel angry about final clubs. But don’t stop there. Because each of us is immersed in the big historical shitshow of this campus, and its big historical triumphs. Final clubs are a special shitshow that make me feel particularly too gay to function, but punch or not, we’re all dealing with this place. And the hard work of inclusivity—of thinking and talking and writing and legislating the fact that every single person matters—is everyone’s job.
So start in your final club. Start in your foosball tournament. Start in your goddamn common room. But for fuck's sake, start somewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 9, 2014, at 10:30 p.m.
David T. Ellwood ’75 will resign from his position as dean of the Kennedy School of Government at the end of the current academic year, the school said in a press release Thursday afternoon.
Ellwood is stepping down after ten years at the helm, making him one of the longest serving deans still in office and one of only two not appointed by University President Drew G. Faust.
He will return to teaching in 2016 after a yearlong sabbatical. Faust will launch the search for Ellwood’s replacement soon, according to a message she wrote to faculty and staff.
Ellwood—the eighth HKS dean since the School’s founding in 1937—said that he leaves HKS “in very strong financial shape,” pointing to the fact the School has raised $355 million of its $500 million capital campaign goal. With over 70 percent of the seven-year campaign goal raised in the first three years, Ellwood said that the end of the 2014-2015 school year is the optimal time for a new dean to transition into the role and “take it to the next level.”
His decade in office has also seen a significant increase in financial aid at the school—from $11 million to $23 million per year, according to the press release—along with the creation of new fellowships to encourage HKS graduates to pursue public service.
“This is a propitious time for a transition. I believe the school is poised for its next great leap,” Ellwood wrote in a letter to the HKS community Thursday afternoon. “Our mission is clear, our faculty is strong, our staff is committed, our students are remarkable, our alumni are courageous leaders in all sectors in virtually every nation, and we look into the future from a solid financial position.”
Ellwood graduated summa cum laude from the College in 1975 and joined the HKS faculty in 1980 before earning a Ph.D. in economics from the University in 1981.
Prior to 2004, Ellwood served as the Kennedy School’s academic dean for two terms. An expert in welfare, he also served under Bill Clinton as an assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
HKS professor Robert N. Stavins called Ellwood the “quintessential Kennedy School dean.”
“If it had been up to me rather than up to him, he would have been dean for life,” Stavins added.
Former Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison ’62—who originally hired Ellwood as an assistant professor during his tenure—said the recent initiative to begin a $100 million expansion and remodeling of the Kennedy School campus following Commencement will be one of Ellwood’s most significant contributions to the school.
According to Allison, Ellwood will be the only HKS dean “that actually has carried out a campaign to build us some buildings” since the school’s move to its current campus in the 1970s.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who hired Ellwood as dean, likewise praised the outgoing leader in an email Thursday.
"The Kennedy school is in a different and better place over the last 11 years because of what David Ellwood has done. He will be greatly missed. I look forward to his return to research on social problems; where I am sure he will make major contributions," Summers wrote.
In an interview Thursday, Ellwood said that he is looking forward to returning to teaching and researching at the Kennedy School following his sabbatical.
“This is a chance to get back into the domains that I care so deeply about and hopefully...find some answers that might make a difference,” Ellwood said.
Ellwood stressed that despite the official announcement of his impending resignation, he still has eight more months in his position and would like to continue his dedication to his faculty, staff, and and students.
“I much prefer to be remembered as a tornado than a lame duck,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, alumni, and top University administrators gathered Thursday afternoon for a celebratory dedication of the Office of Financial Aid to Kenneth C. Griffin ’89.
Griffin, founder of Chicago-based investment firm Citadel, donated $150 million to the University in February. At least $125 million of the gift will go toward hundreds of scholarships named after Griffin, for whom the Office of Financial Aid has also been renamed.
“Ken Griffin’s generosity has really been so large that it’s really nice to mark that with a celebratory event and the dedication of the financial aid office,” now Griffin Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue said in an interview shortly before the event.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67  kicked off the event by pointing to the impact of financial aid on his life as an undergraduate, joking that were it not for Harvard’s aid, he’d probably be in prison today. Fitzsimmons went on to laud the University’s constant commitment to financial aid, even during the 2008 financial crisis.
University President Drew G. Faust recounted that when she walks through the Yard on freshman move-in day in August, many students typically stop and thank her for the financial aid that Harvard offers. Now, Faust said, students will be mentioning Griffin.
“I think maybe those students are going to come up to me and next year be saying, not thank you Drew Faust, not thank you Harvard, but they’ll know. And they will say thank you, Ken Griffin,” said Faust.
Griffin, accompanied by his mother and sister, spoke about the priceless experience he had at Harvard and the way the faculty and staff immediately encouraged him to pursue his passions.
“The resources at Harvard—its professors, our fellow students, the libraries, its alumni—created for me the opportunity to pursue my passions in finance,” Griffin explained. “I set up my own trading center in my Cabot dorm room…with my computer, my fax machine, and my telephone. And Drew, this was before the day’s of cellphones. There were actually pay phones all over campus.”
Griffin said that he hopes that his gift can help provide a Harvard education to students from around the world, regardless of their backgrounds.
“That opportunity shouldn’t depend on coming from a wealthy family,” Griffin said. “It shouldn’t depend on knowing the right people.”
At the end of the celebration, Fitzsimmons pointed to the new plaque in the financial aid office commemorating Griffin and said that it will help undergraduates remain mindful of the generosity of donors.
“As great as this place is and as great as [the students] are, they need to think about the example that Ken Griffin has provided, and they need to think about paying forward, paying back…. These things don’t happen automatically. They happen because people really are thoughtful and they really care about the next generation," he said.

The Barker Center’s Rotunda Cafe will reopen next week following a multi-month renovation, and will now feature catering by Cambridge-based Hi-Rise Bread Company and drinks from Counter Culture Coffee.
The cafe’s opening marks the implementation of a long-delayed plan to make the location a point of intersection for arts and humanities on campus. It will play host to special events including advance screenings of films from Sony Pictures, musical performances, student arts exhibitions, and other programming designed to allow members of the Harvard community to share ideas and engage in creative conversation, according to Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division.
“We wanted to create a space that feels a little bohemian, a little clubby, where you would feel comfortable talking with your friends about something that interests you,” Sorensen said.
She added that Harvard will subsidize the cost of Hi-Rise’s sandwiches and other baked goods to make the cafe more accessible. AS for coffee, in addition to gourmet coffee selections provided by Counter Culture, the cafe will also provide cheaper coffee offerings starting at $2 a cup. As in the past, Board Plus will be a payment option.
Despite the presence of outside vendors, Harvard University Dining Services will continue to run the cafe, in order to keep the existing infrastructure and staffing. All baristas at the cafe will be Harvard students.
“They have all been taken to Counter Culture Coffee to be trained as baristas,” said Maureen Foley, special projects manager in the Arts and Humanities Division.
The interior of the cafe has also been renovated, and will feature leather sofas and restored flooring, as well as a speaker system that will pipe in carefully crafted Spotify playlists, Foley said. The cafe is also planning to use compostable utensils to reduce its environmental footprint.
According to Foley, the renovation furthers the objectives laid out by the Humanities Project, an 18-month collaboration of Harvard faculty that analyzed trends in the liberal arts over the past several decades in order to offer solutions to enrich and expand the community of humanities disciplines at Harvard.
“This really grew out of the Humanities Project, to create a community where people could informally meet,” Foley said. “The space is an effort to create that kind of environment.”
Sorensen and others will host a grand opening for the cafe on Oct. 22. The dean noted that the renovation and subsidy of foodstuffs was made possible by gifts from Hong Kong heir Adrian C. Cheng ’02 and the family of James F. Rothenberg ’68, a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body, and a prolific supporter of the arts and humanities at the University.
It is not uncommon for local food stores to supply Harvard-run on-campus cafes with food. HUDS has operated the Barker Center’s cafe since the previous operator, C’est Bon, closed all of its on-campus locations in 2001. Since then, all food at the cafe was supplied by Harvard.

One month after being implemented in all freshman dormitories, the new composting program run by Green ’17, a group of students from the Class of 2017 focused on sustainability issues on campus, is yielding mostly positive feedback.
The initiative began in August after a successful pilot this spring in Greenough and Mower halls; it places compost bins in all of the freshman dormitories on campus.
Using a door-to-door random sample survey, student representatives from Green ’17 and the Resource Efficiency Program estimated that about half of the freshman class is actively using the compost bins, while only an estimated ten rooms out of all of the freshman dorms are having issues with the program.
Conducted in mid-September, the survey collected self-reported responses from individuals from 78 rooms to assess whether they were using the compost bins in their dormitories and how effective the program was. Of the rooms questioned, 77 responded that they had not experienced issues, while one said they had issues with bag availability and an infestation.
The random survey conducted by student representatives attempted to reflect the number of students in each dormitory, covering every dormitory except for Massachusetts Hall. While Cliff F. W. Goertemiller ’17, co-head of Green ’17, said that the surveyors were not able to obtain a perfect balance in their survey results, the survey enabled a “ pretty balanced assessment.”
Fiona M. Davis ’18, a freshman representative for the Resource Efficiency Program, said students have been “really positive” about the composting initiative as the program tries to work out the kinks.
“I think at first people kind of were a little bit confused…but now that it’s been going on for about a month now I think people are really getting invested in it,” Davis said.
The Freshman Dean’s Office has also been pleased with the program’s results and is hopeful for its future. Davis added that the Resource Efficiency Program and Green ’17 hope to bring the program to the upperclassman Houses after it evaluates the success of program in freshman dormitories.
Some students, though, have reported issues with their compost bins, citing fruit fly infestations as an obstacle to successful composting.
Moses Kim ’18 and his roommates returned their compost bin to the trash room in his dorm after experiencing an infestation, he said.
“We would leave food in the compost bin, and I think we had a fruit fly infestation inside the bin, so we had to open it and shut it really quickly,” he said. “It was a hygienic issue mostly.”
Kim added that his room would be willing to compost if the infestation issue was remedied.
Rebecca A. Greenberg ’18, a Hollis resident, said she uses her compost bin every day regardless of the presence of fruit flies.
The Resource Efficiency Program is making compost-friendly cleaning supplies available in all the trash rooms in response to these problems. These supplies will include vinegar-filled spray bottles, paper towels, and compostable gloves.
Jasmine M. Waddell, resident dean of Elm Yard, said that the program works well for students who have previously been exposed to composting as well as for those that are just being introduced now.
“We have really created a demand so that when students move to the [upperclassman] Houses, they are going to expect [composting],” Waddell said.

The library in the History Department’s Robinson Hall was recently closed off to undergraduate students, when a sign reading “this lounge is reserved for graduate students only” was placed in the library entrance Tuesday.
“My sense is that undergraduates didn’t really use the space much,” said Cristina V. Groeger, a representative of the Henry Adams Society, the History Department’s graduate student organization. “Undergrads can still use the non-circulating books in the Lounge, but the understanding is that the space is for grad students primarily.”
The Henry Adams Society has recently sought to make the space more appealing to graduate students, added Groeger.
“We added coffee and a foosball table which were funded out of the graduate students organization budget,” she said.
According to graduate students who use the space, the Robinson Hall Library is seldomly frequented.
“Sometimes there are ten [students] and its already crowded, [but] usually [there are] two to three people,” said Daria Kovaleva, a first-year graduate student in the Department of Middle Eastern Studies.
Those who do visit enjoy the calm and private environment the library provides, Kovaleva added.
“When you’re alone it is inspiring because it is kind of like a home library but in this conservative and classical traditional style,” Kovaleva said.
She also noted that it is convenient that most of the students who study in the library are at a graduate level, making it easier to meet classmates and friends.
Groeger noted that the space was converted from a full library into a study space and seminar room in 2011.
“At the same time, graduate students who didn’t have any space...asked to use this space as a graduate student lounge,” said Groeger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students advocated for a more victim-centric handling process of sexual assault cases and debated safe social spaces on campus in what turned out to be a small group discussion about sexual assault and rape Thursday evening.
The event, which took place in the Lowell House junior common room, was hosted by the Harvard Political Union. Several College administrators were on hand to listen to students’ comments— including Lowell House Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03, Mather House Dean Luke A. Leafgren, and Meera Seshadri, an education specialist at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Some participants criticized the current handling of sexual assault cases for not adequately prioritizing the needs of survivors. They said the current investigatory process requires victims to speak multiple times about their experience, which some said may further increase distress.
Although participants said Harvard has made progress in reforming its investigation procedures, they agreed there is more to be done.
The conversation is yet another entry in a months-long dialogue about sexual assault policy on campus. In July, the University announced a major restructuring of its handling of cases of sexual harassment, including sexual assault. The new policy created a central, University-wide office to handle investigations and adopted a “preponderance of the evidence” standard for evaluating those cases.
During the discussion, students also shared their thoughts on the impact of social organizations on attitudes toward sexual assault. Some criticized final clubs and other groups viewed by students as “exclusive” for fostering unsafe social spaces. Others argued that advocates ought to work with members of such organizations to create change rather than working to eliminate them.
“We need to differentiate between structures and the people who inhabit them. You don’t join them in freshman year for nefarious reasons,” Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 said. “At a certain level, you need to have a conversation.”
Participants also suggested that discourse on sexual assault needed to extend beyond final clubs to critically examine organizations and traditions at Harvard that perpetuate an unhealthy culture. Some pointed to institutions, including the “comp” process, which new members must complete to join many campus organizations, as creating dangerous power dynamics between current members and those joining.
Nancy Ko ’17, an Harvard Polical Union member who organized the student discussion, said the idea for the event was originally sparked last semester after former associate Anthropology professor Kimberly Theidon was alleges she was denied tenure because of her public expressions of support for sexual assault victims.
“The reaction—the immense reaction—that [Theidon] received revealed something profound about anxiety on campus about [sexual assault],” Ko said.
Ko also said she believed the event’s affiliation with HPU, rather than a group focused primarily on sexual assault issues, may have attracted a group of students who have not previously attended events on the matter.
“Because this is not under a specific sexual assault group, it attracts people who might otherwise not find themselves urgently interested in the issue,” Ko said. “It attracts them to taking a moment and thinking about how these issues actually affect people on campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading reform conservatives or “reformicons” April Ponnuru, Ramesh Ponnuru, and Pete Wehner discussed the future of the Republican Party and the need for a more substantial party platform at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Fall 2014 IOP fellow Kristen Soltis Anderson, discussed policy solutions for appealing to middle-class voters and examined actual and possible candidates and issues for the upcoming 2014 and 2016 elections.
The evening began with an examination of the term “reform conservatism.” April Ponnuru, the policy director of the Young Guns Network, emphasized that reform conservatism is not a movement “reforming conservatism,” but rather one “offering reforms that come out of [a conservative] philosophy.”
“Conservatism needs to be updated,” added Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor at National Review. “Conservative insights have to be applied to the circumstances of today.”
All three panelists emphasized reform conservatism’s effort to appeal to middle-class voters, moving beyond what Wehner, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the Republican Party’s “reputation as being the party of the rich.”
The panelists also discussed the party’s prospects in the upcoming 2014 elections. Anderson expressed her concern over a strong Republican midterm victory, noting that the “election is an election about nothing” and that such victories would just be another set of “false positives,” like the races in 2010.
Ramesh Ponnuru added to the midterm discussion, calling the current situation an “odd political moment.” He noted that Republicans were “bank[ing] on just the unpopularity of the President” to win, while it would probably be much more meaningful to focus on and build a serious agenda surrounding issues like healthcare and education.
“Republicans are running as people who are hostile to the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “They are not running as people who have any serious plan to repeal it, or replace it, or reform it. And that’s what concerns me.”
The panel concluded with a discussion of the 2016 presidential election and the importance of reaching out to minority voters. Ramesh Ponnuru emphasized the need for a broad economic platform that would appeal to the entire electorate without necessarily focusing on “group-specific appeal.” He also stressed that even a 5 or 10 percent increase in the minority Republican vote would be crucial to future elections.
“The margin matters,” he said. “You don’t have to win the vote, you’ve got to win some of those votes. You’ve got to make a marginal impact.”
Daniel V. Banks ’17 disagreed with the catch-all policy Ramesh Ponnuru described, stressing the importance of conservative principles that go beyond just the economy.
“Obviously the economy is important to you regardless of what color you are, regardless of what ethnicity you are,” he said. “But there also needs to be an acknowledgment within the Republican Party that blacks, Hispanics, Asians face different problems in the United States.... There needs to be something more substantive addressing minority rights.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As workers begin the final stages of construction at 224 Western Ave., the future home of the Harvard-Allston Education Portal, many community members said this week they are excited for what they see as the potential for extended programming and an enlarged footprint for the Portal in the neighborhood.
Since its founding in 2008, the Portal has drawn widespread praise from Allstonians, who University records show have taken advantage of its ongoing mentoring programming and faculty lecture series in modest numbers.
The new space will continue to hold these events, but will also include a new art gallery, a flexible performance arts space, and an “innovation studio” which will serve as the classroom of the new “AllstonX” program—a combination between in-person faculty-led discussions and online courseware from HarvardX. University administrators are billing the $8.25 million project as “transformative,” and feature it as a key piece of their community benefits package for Allston.
The project “resets the notion of what a communal space can be for a neighborhood,” Ed Portal Director Robert A. Lue said in August. He could not be reached for comment this week.
According to Carol Ridge-Martinez, executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, many Allstonians are excited about the added value an initiative like the expanded Portal will bring to their community.
“It’s a quality of life amenity for the neighborhood,” Ridge-Martinez said. “It will make Allston and Brighton more attractive.”
Long-term Allston resident John A. Bruno, who attended a faculty lecture at the current Ed Portal earlier this week, agreed, saying that programming at the new Portal enters “uncharted territory.”
“I think the Ed Portal has performed above and beyond what everyone expected and now they’re moving and the expectation is at another level,” Bruno said.
Bruno is one of the roughly 1,300 people who the University says took part in one of the 50 events or programs held at the Portal between Sept. 2013 and Sept. 2014. In total, the Portal counts more than 2,200 residents of Allston and Brighton as members and has long considered itself as a space for their use.
Since 2008, 400 K-12 students have also taken part in the Portal’s hallmark mentorship program, which is staffed by Harvard undergraduates. The program, which was originally geared toward Allstonians, welcomes students from two Allston schools, Jackson-Mann K-8 School and Gardner Pilot Academy, that are part of Network D of the Boston Public School System. The Portal also hosts monthly principal meetings and a leadership program for minority boys, according to Network D Superintendent Cheryl Watson-Harris.
Still, for all the optimism surrounding the Portal’s move and expansion, some Allstonians said they are skeptical and that Harvard may be over-stating the implications of the project.
“I’m not sure what all that is going to amount to,” Allston resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 said of the move. “[Harvard is] building on a lecture program that has been going on for years [which is] a way of offering cultural value to the community. But transformative, it is not.”
The new Ed Portal space is slated to open in February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 13, 2014, at 11:20 p.m.
Last month, Gerald L. Chan altered the outlook of the School of Public Health in one $350 million swoop, but it looks as if the Hong Kong-born billionaire’s associates are taking a more piecemeal approach to reshaping the $100 million or more in property he owns in Harvard Square.
With restaurants near completion at 75 and 93 Winthrop St. and planned development at 40 Bow St. as well as from 382 to 392 Harvard St., the real estate mogul will usher in big changes for the neighborhood over the next few years as his much of his recently purchased property turns over to new tenants.
Though there are many proposed projects in the pipeline for Chan’s properties, the most imminent is Night Market, a Japanese small-plate restaurant, slated to replace Tamarind Bay as the occupant of 75 Winthrop St.
Jim Covino, Chan’s project manager for several of the Square developments, said that Night Market could open in a matter of weeks.
“In maybe a month I think we should be [ready to open]—it’s almost all built out now,” Covino said. “Staff is getting hired [now].”
Nearby at 93 Winthrop St., Parsnip, a new farm-to-table eatery, will replace Upstairs on the Square.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she does not know the establishment’s exact timeline but that she anticipates an opening later this fall.
“Parsnip continues to evolve, [and] it’s going to be spectacular,” Jillson said. “We’re still anticipating a November opening.”
Though Night Market and Parsnip are closest to completion, they are only two of several new developments on Chan’s properties, wrote Reenie McCarthy, director of Chan’s investment company Morningside, in an email to The Crimson.
In January 2013, Chan purchased The Hurst Gallery, a dilapidated building at 40 Bow St., across from the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humour magazine.
“Post-acquisition, we began the work to restore the exterior of the building to its historic appearance,” McCarthy wrote. “The apartments above the first floor will also be renovated and an application for a ground floor restaurant is in process.”
Plans for yet another restaurant on Chan’s property are also underway. Break Fast will open in the former location of Leo’s Place Diner, according to an article in April by Boston Restaurant Talk. The eatery will serve breakfast food from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Its layout will remain similar to that of the previous tenant.
The future of many of Chan’s other properties is less clear. According to McCarthy, the property manager of the former American Express building at 39 JFK St. is currently in talks with potential tenants to determine who will occupy the space next. McCarthy also wrote that the future of the residences located at 382-392 Harvard St. is still undecided, since the building is outdated and “requires improvements.”
Martha Flynn, assistant commissioner at the Cambridge Inspectional Services Department, said that renovations are also planned for the property at 18 to 28 JFK St., which Chan also owns and includes establishments such as UNO Pizzeria and Grill and Papyrus. Requests for alterations by various contractors have been approved by the department.
MAKING CONNECTIONS
Despite the large network of properties, the link between Chan and his real estate holdings is not always clear. Chan’s name is not directly connected to most of his properties, but they are all owned by separate foreign limited liability companies, such as Tarragon LLC and Plumosa LLC, which are all connected to the Morningside Group, Chan’s investment company headquartered in nearby Newton. The LLCs are also headquartered at the same Newton property, 1188 Centre St., though most are incorporated in Delaware.
Though the multitude of corporate entities may seem unusual, John Hynes ’80, the CEO of Boston Global Investors, said that it is common for pieces of real estate to be held by separate entities so that “if one falls, it won’t take down another.”
Chan’s recent donation to Harvard raises the possibility of transferring some of his Harvard Square property to the University. Andrew Johnson, an assessor for the city of Cambridge, said that the city could not restrict such a transfer.
However, Johnson did note that if Harvard takes the buildings off of the city’s tax roll, Harvard would be subject to the PILOT agreement, or a “payment-in-lieu-of-taxes,” which would require a payment similar to property taxes currently paid on the buildings.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 13, 2014 
An earlier version of a map accompanying this article incorrectly labeled two properties owned by Gerald L. Chan that require improvements, according to the city of Cambridge. In fact, the city said Chan's property at 382 to 392 Harvard St. requires improvements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell does not belong in the Ivy League.
Actually, let me back up for a second.
We here at The Crimson have several missions, chief among them educating and alerting our readers. But we also like to inspire.
Two years ago, one of our writers managed to do just that in writing “Columbia: The Ivy League’s Worst Athletics Program.” The scathing review of Lions sports drew 77 comments from personally offended readers and an ad hominem retaliation in The Columbia Daily Spectator.
It also led to a revival in Lions athletics. After winning one Ivy championship over two years, Columbia earned two crowns in 2012-13 and five more titles last year, tying the school record. You’re welcome, Lions.
Now Cornell needs the same kick in the butt, which is why I wrote that the Big Red does not belong in the Ancient Eight. And the facts bear it out.
Let’s start with a map of Ivy League schools. Seriously, pull one up. Now tell me which of these things is not like the others. Every school is within a three-hour drive of at least one other school, except for that one dot in western New York. You could pull up a map of New York for more detail, but Ithaca would not be on it.
Now let’s move to a timeline. Seven Ivy schools were founded in a 163-year period during the Colonial Era. Cornell opened almost 100 years later in 1865. Reflecting the change in times, it is also the only university of the eight with an English motto.
The Big Red’s argument for inclusion only gets marginally better when we move to today’s athletic fields. Cornell won six Ivy titles last year, its second fewest since 2001-02. I should add that none of those came in women’s sports. That’s not cool. And I haven’t even gotten to the Big Red’s 0-3 football team, which just lost to Yale, 51-13.
Cornell, we were cool with you when you had NFL prospect Jeff Mathews at quarterback, but now that he’s gone (and struggling to stay in the NFL), I just don’t know. The best thing about Big Red athletics at this point is probably the interactive Bear logo on its website (which, to be fair, is sweet).
I hoped recent displays of Cornell’s campus culture would provide the school with an argument to stay, but alas. Before Bill Gates visited the campus on Oct. 1, tickets sold out in mere minutes and students began scalping the free tickets to his talk for upwards of $200.
Anyone who has seen The Social Network knows that the proper response to a Gates visit is typified by one student who explains in the movie, “I showed up late; I don’t even know who the speaker was.”
Again, I don’t write all of this to be hurtful. I want to be helpful. If Columbia can turn it around, so can you.
That said, I don’t see Cornell proving its Ivy worth this weekend. Read why in this week’s predictions…
HOLY CROSS AT BROWN
This week brings another slate of nonconference action for most of the league, with this battle of equally mediocre Harvard foes being one of the most intriguing. While Brown’s (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) offense and its 11 new starters have understandably struggled, its defense has proven better than expected. The Bears have given up just over 17 points per game, and they should be able to contain a Crusaders (2-4, 0-2 Patriot) side that comes in having lost three straight.
Prediction: Brown 21, Holy Cross 13
COLUMBIA AT MONMOUTH
The Lions (0-3, 0-1) almost pulled off an all-time upset last week as they led defending champion Princeton late in the second quarter. After the game, Columbia coach Pete Mangurian explained why that was not worth celebrating.
“The problem is you don’t play halves,” he said. “You play a full game.”
He’s right, but Columbia must have misunderstood that lesson at halftime, because they clearly chose not to play in the second half of a 38-6 loss.
Prediction: Monmouth 34, Columbia 16
PRINCETON AT COLGATE
I suppose you can’t be too upset about a 38-6 win, but it will be interesting to see how the Tigers (2-1, 1-0) respond against one of the Patriot League’s better teams (3-2, 2-0 Patriot) after their slow start last week. With two weeks to play before Harvard’s trip to Princeton, the Orange and Black have looked far from daunting thus far.
Prediction: Princeton 38, Colgate 20
PENNSYLVANIA AT FORDHAM
Penn coach Al Bagnoli is making his departure a lot easier to stomach by starting the year 0-3. The Quakers (0-3, 0-1 Ivy) defense has given up over 30 points in each loss, and this week they face a Rams (5-1, 2-0 Patriot) team that has scored at least 40 in all six of its contests. It doesn’t take a Wharton grad to figure out that that does not bode well.
Prediction: Fordham 42, Penn 28
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
The only other Ivy game on the schedule this week will be one of the most enlightening of the season. These two teams pose the biggest threat to the Princeton-Harvard status quo after each dismantled Ancient Eight opponents last week. Yale (3-0, 1-0) has been particularly impressive, racking up 154 points over three weeks. Look for its offense to continue producing against a tough Big Green D (2-1, 1-0). A Bulldog win would set them up nicely before hosting Princeton in week nine and then traveling for The Game.
Prediction: Yale 34, Dartmouth 24
CORNELL AT HARVARD
Returning to The Stadium, the Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) will continue its procession toward its week five trip to Princeton. Even without senior quarterback Conner Hempel and junior running back Paul Stanton, Harvard will have enough firepower behind its stout offensive line to put Cornell (0-3, 0-1 Ivy) to bed early.
Prediction: Harvard 37, Cornell 13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third straight year under coach Tim Murphy, the Harvard football team finds itself undefeated entering the fourth week of the season.
But this year has been far from ordinary. Injuries to four key offensive starters—including senior quarterback Conner Hempel and junior running back Paul Stanton—have forced other players to step up. And they have responded in major ways, propelling the Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) to its current mark with big performances.
When struggling Cornell (0-3, 0-1) visits Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, the Crimson will hope that a similar team effort results in its second conference victory of the young season.
“I think that the long term challenge is to beat the very best teams in our league, and it would be great to have those [guys who are injured],” Murphy said. “But at the end of the day you’re going to have years like that. You just have to fight through adversity, you have to adapt, and you have to adjust.”
Both Hempel and Stanton—in addition to the potent aerial targets of senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn and tight end Tyler Hamblin—will remain sidelined this week. In their absences, the Crimson will turn to some faces that are becoming increasingly familiar.
Thrust into the spotlight with the injury to Hempel, junior quarterback Scott Hosch has demonstrated marked improvement over his three games. After an ill-advised throw resulted in an interception in his first appearance, the quarterback has not been picked off since.
Hosch featured a variety of throws in last week’s 34-3 win against Georgetown, finding the likes of junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer for quick screens as well as tight ends on posts over the middle of the field. The junior finished with only five incompletions, 293 passing yards, and one touchdown.
The team’s most reliable offensive option, however, has been senior running back Andrew Casten. Thanks to consistently strong blocking from an experienced offensive line, Casten has taken pressure off the young quarterback by plowing for seven touchdowns this season—including four last Saturday against Georgetown.
“If you get the running game established, you can usually get the passing game established,” Murphy said. “With our zone read run game, we obviously get a lot of people open on play-action passes.”
The winless Cornell enters Saturday’s matchup fresh off a demoralizing 51-13 defeat against visiting Yale. Hosch will likely be encouraged by the five passing touchdowns thrown by Bulldogs quarterback Morgan Roberts.
The graduation of second team All-Ivy quarterback Jeff Mathews has made the Cornell offense less prolific this year. Forced into a quarterback rotation between junior James Few and freshman Jake Jatis, the Big Red has averaged less than 11 points per game and has yet to score a rushing touchdown.
“When Jeff Matthews was the quarterback, it never seemed like the game was out of reach, no matter how many points you scored,” Murphy said. “In some respects, it will be a little bit easier to focus on what we have to stop.”
The matchup with Cornell will provide another chance for some of the Crimson’s relatively inexperienced defensive starters to continue improving. After surrendering an early field goal against Georgetown, Harvard shut out the overmatched Hoyas for the remainder of the contest.
The emergence of junior linebacker Matt Koran, who ranks first on the team with 19 tackles, represents a major reason for the Crimson’s success.
“The past couple years I’ve maybe gotten 10, 15 plays each game, and this is the first year I’ve had a significant role and gotten numerous plays,” Koran said. “I definitely think they’re leaning on me a little bit more this year.”
Despite Cornell’s weaknesses, Saturday represents yet another test for the Crimson. And with the annual showdown with Princeton just two weekends away, both the offensive and defensive units will embrace the reps that come with a competitive conference game.
“We know that [Cornell is] going to come out with a little bit more edge this week, after having a bad week last week,” Hosch said. “They’re going to come after us pretty hard, so we’re going to have to keep our A-game.”

After Red Bull’s lawsuit over false advertising (ICYMI, Red Bull does not actually give you wings), the company issued a statement last week stating that any Red Bull consumer in the last 12 years is eligible to receive $10 in cash or $15 worth of Red Bull products. Why is this relevant? No proof of purchase necessary.
This basically means that Red Bull is handing you money. For free. In other words, anyone can technically claim that money for themselves, regardless of whether or not they actually bought the product. Immoral? Maybe just a little.
Move quickly, though. Since the settlement is capped at $13 million, fewer than 1.3 million people will be given money. Call 877-495-1568 or go to this website to claim your money. See, all those vodka red bulls were a good idea after all.

PSA: That turkey you sometimes awkwardly walked behind on your way to class is being featured in an anthropology project. Yep that’s right, Max B. Schaffer ‘17 is conducting ethnographic research on the turkey that’s been frequenting the streets of Harvard Square and the Yard.
As an assignment for Anthropology 1610: Ethnographic Research Methods, Schaffer had to complete a “Day in the Life” of a person or place, and he naturally gravitated towards the turkey that was often situated in front of the Dunster Inn, where he currently lives. In order to track down the turkey’s location, he enlisted the help of the Dunster House email list.
If you are anything like Max and decide that turkey watching for over six hours is your calling, fear not. We have tirelessly worked to compile a full Harvard Square turkey log, detailed with a play-by-play of some of the nameless turkey’s favorite destination spots and why it was outside the Delphic at 9:24 a.m.

6:50 p.m.: Dunsterites debate about whether there is more than one turkeyTwo turkeys? A family? Will we ever know the truth?
Schaffer never gave up on his #turkeywatch, even when the going got tough. Schaffer recalled, “at one point, it was up on this ledge and I was standing directly in front of it, and it made this big noise and flew directly at me.” He continued to follow the turkey without hesitation. We give you an A+, Mr. Schaffer.
