After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a special election that stunned the Democratic Party last Tuesday, the citizens of Massachusetts elected Republican state senator Scott Brown to the Senate. While much debate has centered around the countless campaign gaffes committed by defeated Democratic candidate Martha Coakley, now is no time for retrospective second-guessing. With a monumental—and increasingly controversial—health care bill at stake in Congress, leaders of both parties must look past the superficialities of last week’s race and focus on the policy issues that affect the lives of all Americans.
President Obama’s win in the 2008 presidential election was due in part to a message of post-partisan politics. However, recent votes on the Congressional floor have shown that the politicking in Washington today is characterized by more of the same divisive partisanship from before. No members of the GOP voted for the Senate version of the healthcare bill, and only one Republican representative affirmed it in the House. With a filibuster looming upon Brown’s election, Democrats in Congress should now take a new approach to the formulation and passage of health care legislation. Both parties must work together, cast partisan and ideological barriers aside, and consider all interests to craft a workable bill to pass with votes across the aisle.
The new composition of the Senate will change the terms of engagement between Republicans and Democrats. While some in the Democratic party wish to see the current bill scrapped entirely until a less volatile period arises, this would be a costly mistake. The failure of healthcare reform to gain traction in Congress in 1994 derailed efforts to tackle the issue nationally until 2008; as the percentage of uninsured Americans continues to increase, the issue continues to become more pressing every single day. In addition, the perceived failure of the Democratic party to enact their agenda, even with a 59-vote majority, will create the impression that it is ineffectual and dogmatic; this image would cost them dearly in this year’s midterm elections. Democratic leaders must thus continue the work that has already been done.
The outcome in Massachusetts reflects a national stance on the healthcare debate in Washington, namely that 55 percent of Americans now feel that the current bill should be altered to garner more Republican support. Reworking the bill does not mean discarding it entirely. However, it is clear that the public wants to see an end to the fierce partisanship of the deliberation on Capitol Hill. Accordingly, the Democrats should honor the will of the people by opening up the legislation to Republican ideas to achieve a bill with the bipartisan support to ward off a Senate filibuster.
Some Democrats have regarded Brown’s election as akin to a political and moral apocalypse and have proposed several legislative ploys to pass the current version of the bill. We applaud Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s pledge to seat Senator-elect Brown before holding a vote on health care. Any technical exploitation of the limbo after the election would come across as manipulative and undemocratic.
However, another option that remains is reconciliation, a complicated legislative procedure that limits debate and amendments on bills and requires a mere 51 votes for passage. While this would circumvent the challenge brought upon by Brown’s election, it would not only be undemocratic but also, according to those familiar with congressional rules, would result in a watered-down bill missing key provisions to expand coverage and protect American insurance buyers. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad explained that “insurance market reforms, all the changes designed to encourage wellness and prevention,” among other things, could still be easily jettisoned because they do not relate directly to deficit reduction, which is the sole goal of reconciliation itself.
The legislative procedure is already confusing enough to the average American; Congressional leaders must not resort to such convoluted and reductive measures to pass bills as important and complex as healthcare reform. Again, the best approach to take looking forward is open discussion of the issues on both sides of the aisle. Only pragmatic accommodation can reconcile the bitter partisanship plaguing this process.
In the spirit of compromise, Democratic leaders may have to restrain their idealism and succumb to the political reality that Senator-elect Brown represents. Brown has vowed to kill the current version of the bill, leaving the Democrats with no choice but to change it or lament its demise.
It cannot be denied that the central tenets of the bill are controversial and politically-divisive; the near-perfect party-line vote late last year demonstrated that Republicans stiffly oppose the current, Democrat-dominated version of the bill. The politically expedient action to take now is to remove the provisions that make the bill most intolerable to Republicans in hopes that some middle ground can be reached. While neither party will be completely satisfied with the final product, the important thing is that it will stand the greatest chance of codification and will be most palatable to the general public while making many moderate improvements to the current health care system in the United States.
Though many provisions critical to reform will likely be cut under this process, their displacement should not be too heavily bemoaned. While the scope of the resulting bill will probably be far narrower than reformers had hoped, we believe that Congress should take up these crucial measures in the future, when there is less antagonism between the two parties and more opportunity for compromise. History leaves reason for optimism. The original Social Security bill in 1935 covered far fewer people than it does today, but efforts in subsequent years capitalized upon its passage to include addenda that expanded its welfare net. Similar expansions have occurred with Medicare coverage. Congress must seize the momentum of this bill and address the discarded elements in the near future to further ameliorate the malfunctions and inequities in our healthcare system.
Finally, both parties must make a more conscious effort to explain the details and potential impact of their legislative work. No American can be expected to peruse the 2,000-page document to formulate an opinion on the bill. This bill will dramatically affect all Americans and therefore must be made accessible and comprehensible to the public. Elected leaders must take it upon themselves to ensure that their constituents are knowledgeable about the significance of reform, in an accurate, unbiased manner.
Looking forward, the Democrats must end the finger-pointing over Coakley’s stunning defeat and focus on adapting to the political realities of the day. To ensure that the reform debate does not wither away with a partisan filibuster, the Democrats must work with the Republicans openly and honestly to improve the welfare of the people. Brown’s election by no means spells the end of the health care debate. If anything, it should herald the new era of compromise and bipartisanship that Americans were promised.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Scott Brown Wins Mass. Race, Giving GOP 41-59 Majority in the Senate,” read the headline on Roy Edroso’s blog at The Village Voice. Edroso was being wry, of course, but the Philly Metro wasn’t when it printed an article titled, “How will Dems recover after losing majority?” The sad thing is, the headline was not substantively in error. With the filibuster in effect, 60 votes or more is a majority. Forty votes or fewer is a minority. Anything in between is a gridlocked no man’s land where nothing of consequence can be passed. This situation’s proximate cause is the current Senate Republican Conference’s pernicious decision to use the filibuster at an unprecedented frequency.
As UCLA political scientist Barbara Sinclair has documented, only eight percent of bills deemed “legislation to watch” by Congressional Quarterly faced filibusters or filibuster threats in the 1960s. For example, when Lyndon Johnson was counting votes for Medicare in 1965, he assumed that a majority vote would pass and did not even consider having to break a filibuster. By contrast, in the 2000s, 70 percent of “legislation to watch” faced a 60-vote requirement.
This problem has increased markedly since the Republicans became the minority in the Senate in 2007. In the 109th Congress, from 2005 to 2007, motions to vote on cloture—the procedural manifestation of a filibuster—numbered 68. In the 110th Congress, from 2007 to 2009, that number more than doubled to 139. The current Congress is on pace to match that figure, with 67 cloture motions filed this year alone. The current Republican minority has chosen to filibuster anything and everything, subverting majority rule.
But this tactical decision by the Republicans has a deeper strategic purpose. Politically, there is no reason for the Republican minority to help the Democratic majority rack up policy accomplishments. If the Democrats pass major legislation, they can campaign on it in the midterm elections, preserving or even expanding their majority. This is especially true if Republicans sign on, which gives the legislation an attractive veneer of bipartisanship.
If, however, the Republicans are able to obstruct every Democratic initiative, the majority looks like do-nothings and are likelier to be thrown out of office. This worked in 1994, when Republican intransigence killed universal health care and in the process made the Democratic leadership appear incapable of accomplishing anything. It resulted in a GOP landslide that fall. The supermajority requirement in the Senate, then, is not just a method to prevent policies the Republicans dislike but also a quite effective campaign strategy.
I do not begrudge the Republican minority its love of the filibuster. It is making due the best it can, given the structural constraints of the current system. But if 60 percent is such a magic threshold, I implore the GOP to apply it consistently. Scott Brown won with 52 percent of the vote; Martha Coakley received 47 percent. If GOP Senate logic applies, that means Coakley won with six percentage points to spare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democrats look different these days. They look thinner.
Last week, they lost their sixtieth vote in the Senate to Massachusetts Senator-elect Scott Brown. But Brown’s victory is only the latest bruise. Three weeks ago, North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan and Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd announced their retirements. And last month, Alabama Congressman Parker Griffith switched parties.
True, more Republicans are planning to retire from Congress than Democrats—for now. But conservative Democrats who voted for Obamacare look pale for some reason. Maybe they’re sweating the fact that in Rasmussen Reports’ exit polls from last week’s election, 56 percent of voters said that health care was the most important factor in their decisions, and 51 percent opposed the Democrats’ plan—in Massachusetts.
Democrats’ troubles stem from their handling of health care, an issue on which their arrogance is patent.
The Democrats’ proposal arrogates to themselves control of a sixth of our economy. They demand that insurers disregard preexisting conditions, but insurers distinguish between the sick and the healthy because the former are more expensive. If insurers cannot charge different prices, they’ll charge the healthy more to cover the difference. And if plans prove too pricey, the healthy will drop them, sucking money from the pool and raising premiums for the sick. So Democrats want everyone to buy coverage or face a fine, yet the fine they’ve prescribed is too low to deter dropouts. A higher fine, they fear, would provoke outrage.
On top of this morass, Democrats assert that their plan, which subsidizes about 30 million people so that they can afford coverage, will lower the deficit. Fears of higher taxes and bigger deficits, they sneer, are unfounded. Their reasoning? The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says so. But they raise taxes to pay for the subsidies—a surcharge on the rich in the House of Representatives, a tax on “Cadillac plans” in the Senate—taxes that could have gone exclusively to reducing the deficit. And the CBO warns that the deficit will lessen only if Congress cuts billions from Medicare. Yeah right.
Yet Democrats scoff at critics. Republicans, they say, offer criticism but no solutions. What about Arizona Congressman John Shadegg’s proposal to allow people to buy insurance across state lines? Or Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan’s offer to tax employer-provided insurance and provide tax credits for individual coverage? Or Arizona Senator John McCain’s push for caps on exorbitant lawsuits against medical malpractice? Or former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney’s suggestion that states lift their mandates on insurers that force them to cover particular services—like in vitro fertilization?
“Please, Republicans are tools of Big Business,” they counter. Really? Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) authorized its lobbyists to spend $150 million on television commercials in support of President Barack Obama’s plan. Democrats had to bribe Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu and Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson with millions of dollars in funding to their states for their votes. And President Obama had to break his pledge to broadcast negotiations on C-SPAN, because the more people learn about his plan, the more they dislike it.
Besides their unworkable policies and their weak counterarguments, Democrats demonstrate arrogance with their flabby campaigning. “Republicans are culture warriors,” Democrats used to tell us, “who attack candidates’ personal lives to avoid discussing issues.” Yet Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds, the Democrats’ failed gubernatorial candidate, aired television ads attacking his Republican opponent, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, on his graduate thesis. President Obama, when he campaigned in Massachusetts for the Democrats’ failed senatorial candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, ridiculed Brown’s pickup truck. Coakley herself stressed Brown’s party label, believing his association alone could sink him. This year, Democrats are the culture warriors.
After these candidates flopped, Democrats patronizingly blamed their misfortunes on voters’ “anger.” “People are angry, and they’re frustrated,” Obama told George Stephanpoulos, “not just because of what’s happened in the last year or two years, but what’s happened over the last eight years.” This tactic smells stale. In 1994, Peter Jennings, then-host of ABC Nightly News, said voters threw a “temper tantrum” after Republicans won control of Congress. And Time magazine declared on its cover that Newt Gingrich had “perfected the politics of anger.” Democrats dismiss disagreement as mere emotion.
So here’s my plea for humility. President Obama should drop his plans for health care and focus on the economy, which remains Americans’ main concern. Democrats have spent months trying to fool people into believing that expanding government is fiscally responsible and have failed. The current floundering is only trying people’s patience.
Most damning is their attempt to pooh-pooh their defeats as the result of voter anger against incumbents. People have legitimate objections to Obamacare, and no amount of spin can change that. For Democrats to try, they make themselves look ridiculous—and desperate.

The international community has reached out to Haiti in an unprecedented manner. This is our opportunity, Haitians, members of the Haitian diaspora, and friends of Haiti to reach back in partnership. This task will not be easy, for a true partnership calls for more than monetary aid, colorful ideas, and the “sympathetic” revisiting of Haitian history. What is needed is a coherent and executable plan that will give agency, not pity, to the Haitian people as they reconstruct their country with international support. Too many times in the past, good intentions have died on Haitian shores, while seemingly good ideas have unleashed pestilence on the nation’s populace. However, this time we have no choice but to build a better coalition of those interested in rebuilding the country. The alternative is unthinkable.
The first phase of relief efforts must deal with the immediate catastrophic effects of the recent earthquake. The populations of hard-hit cities, such as Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and Léogâne must be evacuated immediately. Those who have relatives or the ability to establish themselves in other cities in Haiti should be facilitated in doing so. Those who are unable to do so should be sheltered in tent cities. The affected cities will essentially have to be leveled and rebuilt from the ground-up anyway. Why not move the people out of the way right now?
Even if food and other provisions were dropped en masse into the areas that desperately needed them, this would only be a temporary solution. People cannot live amongst rubble and decaying corpses in the long-term. Providing care to the afflicted, security, reuniting loved ones, and educating the youth are all things that would be more effectively delivered in the centralized environment of tent cities. Once people have been moved into temporary tent cities, work must be done to smooth their transition into more permanent cities. This is part of the second phase of Haiti’s reconstruction—the foundation of long term progress.
Cities such as Port-au-Prince should be built better than they were before. The buildings should be constructed in adherence to strict building codes—resistance to hurricanes and earthquakes is a must. The creation of an extensive sanitation system, the implementation of an organized public transportation system, and investment in a reliable power grid that uses green energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal will be crucial.
A well-trained and well-organized security force that is beholden to the legislature, protects the people, and protects the nation must also be created. Such security will be a critical element in attracting foreign investment to the nation.
These are some of the steps that can be taken to ensure a sustainable, healthy future for Haiti and her people. They are not plans that offer solutions with one hand and cause destruction with the other—an unfortunate pattern in Haiti’s past. Now, while we have the world’s attention and the news cameras still covering the story, we must collaborate and advocate such plans for Haiti’s long-term progress. E-meetings, e-mail lists, social networking websites, and Twitter are just a few examples of the types of technology we can use to connect with each other over great distances to combine our ideas. These efforts will help establish the bases of partnerships for reconstruction.
The subject of the leadership of these efforts is an issue that must be addressed. All stakeholders, including members of the Haitian diaspora and aid agencies should have a hand in leveraging experiences and expertise. Perhaps a council should be created by general consensus amongst stakeholders—separate from the Haitian government itself—to administer all things aid-related.
This is a necessary measure because Haiti can no longer afford to find its way to stability on its own. The nation needs a massive amount of help to establish foundations and institutions that have been neglected and destroyed over the past two centuries, but this cannot come at the expense of Haitian autonomy and self-determination.
Haitian soil, already barren from decades of extensive deforestation, is now cracked with the bodies of her children. However, there is a Haitian saying that goes, “Ayiti di: ‘Mwen pran move kou! Men, pa pè, m ap toujou la.’ ” This translates to, “Haiti says: ‘I’ve taken bad hits! But, don’t be afraid, I will always be here.’” This saying reminds Haitians, the Haitian diaspora, and friends of Haiti not to dwell in sadness but to spring forward with the unbreakable spirit and energy of Haiti’s people.

Campus vending machines may carry more than just sodas and sugary sundries this fall if the Harvard College Library’s pilot program for pre-paid Crimson Cash cards proves successful.
The program, which was initiated by HCL this month, sells pre-paid Crimson Cash cards via a new vending machine in the entrance to Lamont Library. The pilot program is targeted at University affiliates who have trouble using the traditional system—such as visiting researchers and international students—and aims to give them an alternative method of using Crimson Cash.
“We recognized that some of our users had problems putting Crimson Cash on their IDs because they had international credit cards,” said HCL Director of Communications Beth S. Brainard.
“Sometimes they are summer school students who are young enough that they do not have credit cards yet,” Brainard said.
The new vending machine is currently the only one that stocks pre-paid Crimson Cash cards and also carries a number of school-related supplies. Calculators, tape, note pads, pens, USB drives, and earphones are among the items that can be purchased alongside the pre-paid cards.
The cards, which are refillable, cost five dollars for every four dollars worth of Crimson Cash and can be used wherever conventional Crimson Cash is accepted. Brainard said that HCL is breaking even on the new cards and that the extra dollar fee covers the amount HCL pays for the card.
This experimental program is currently scheduled to run through the spring semester and over the summer, giving both University affiliates and summer school students the opportunity to utilize this new method of acquiring Crimson Cash.
The success of the program will determine whether or not it will be expanded to other HCL branches, but there are currently no plans to sell the cards outside of Harvard’s libraries.
“We will assess the program’s success by seeing how many times we have to refill the machine,” Brainard said. “If we are restocking Crimson Cash cards constantly, we will know that it is worthwhile to students.”

Plans are in the works to transform the empty one acre lot in front of Lowell House on Mt. Auburn Street into an idyllic garden with walking paths, seating space, and rows of fruit and vegetables.
The garden is currently in the design stage, but planting should begin this semester, according to Environmental Action Committee chair Katharine S. Walter ’10.
“We thought that having a green space and having an urban garden in Cambridge would be a great way to get students involved in sustainable agriculture,” Walter said.
A poll sent over House e-mail lists requested undergraduate input on the design and features of the garden, listing possibilities such as “avant-garde sculpture” and “state-of-the art composting systems.”
In the survey, students were asked to rank their preferences for what the garden should feature. Options included food, flowers and ornamental plants, open lawn space, performance space, seating, and artwork.
The poll also requested suggestions for possible garden names.
EAC member Zachary C. Arnold ’10 said that while funding sources for the development of the space are still uncertain, undergraduates will be working closely with the administration to determine possible funding.
So far, the Lowell House masters have been contacted regarding the garden, but are “not super involved,” Walter said.
Despite the uncertainty regarding funding and the garden’s specific design, Arnold said that the group hopes the garden will be planted by the end of the school year.
According to Walter, the garden planning began about a year ago as a project of the EAC.
The group envisions student volunteers maintaining and tending to the garden.
Walter said she also hopes classes will incorporate the space into their curriculum.
“It will be a great opportunity to have more outdoor spaces for students, which Harvard really lacks right now,” she said.

A medical malpractice suit brought against two doctors at a Harvard-affiliated hospital on behalf of a deceased Harvard professor was resolved Friday, ending in the exonerations of the doctors and awarding no damages to the plaintiff after nearly five years of legal battles.
In May 2002, renowned evolutionary biologist Stephen J. Gould died at age 60 from lung cancer just 10 weeks after doctors found the tumor, which had already spread to his liver, brain, and other organs. His wife, Rhonda Roland Shearer, brought suit three years later, claiming that the lesion that became cancerous was already evident in an X-ray taken of Gould’s chest in Feb. 2001.
Shearer named three doctors in the suit—Rebecca L. Dyson, who had examined chest X-rays taken in Feb. 2001 at Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Harvard Medical School professor Robert J. Mayer, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who had been Gould’s physician since 1993; and Salvatore G. Viscomi, who was exonerated earlier.
After deliberating for nearly five hours, the jury determined that neither doctor had been negligent, according to a clerk at the Mass. Middlesex Superior Court, where the trial was held.
“We are grateful that the jury looked at all the evidence and confirmed our view that Dr. Mayer provided high quality, appropriate, and compassionate care,” Dana-Farber spokesman Steven R. Singer said.
Mayer and Dyson’s lawyer William J. Dailey, Jr., credited the win to “very strong expert testimony on the part of the defendants indicating that they had complied with all practices at all times.”
The suit has been in the works since it was first filed in May 2005, and the trial itself lasted three weeks­—an average length of time for a medical malpractice suit, according to the court’s clerk.
Gould had battled serious health issues earlier in his life. In 1982 he was diagnosed with abdominal mesothelioma, a cancerous growth in the tissue coating many organs that usually comes about as a result of asbestos exposure.
Gould recovered from the mesothelioma and “functioned at a very high level,” according to Dailey. Doctors at Dana-Farber, including Mayer, continued to follow Gould’s health. But Gould also suffered from small bowel obstructions, which Dailey described as painful and debilitating intestinal blockages, and was hospitalized in New York in March 2002 for his sixth such obstruction when the lung cancer was ultimately found, already at the final stage of progression.
Gould, a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for “The Mismeasure of Man,” developed the theory known as “punctuated equilibrium,” which describes evolution as a sporadic, jerky process over a period of time rather than a smooth, gradual change in traits.
According to past Crimson coverage of the lawsuit, Gould was accustomed to a seven-figure income and was in the process of negotiating a $2 million book contract.
Mayer cared for Gould for nine years. Over that time, “they developed a close relationship and [Mayer] greatly admired and respected his patient,” read the statement released by Dana-Farber in 2005.
Neither Shearer, who runs the media watchdog site stinkyjournalism.org, nor her lawyer Alex H. MacDonald, could be reached for comment.

Beginning this semester, Harvard College students will be able to apply courses taken to complete secondary fields toward other non-concentration requirements—such as those for General Education, language citations, or the Core—the Office of Undergraduate Education announced this week. But the current stipulation that no more than one course taken for a secondary field may be double-counted for a concentration will remain in place.
“Many students and their advisers have said that they found the current rules to be overly restrictive,” FAS spokesman Jeff A. Neal wrote in an e-mail. “This change in the rule was, in large part, an effort to respond to feedback we’ve received from students.”
The secondary field program was initiated in 2006 to offer students the chance to “pursue focused study in one area outside of the concentration” by taking four to six courses in a particular area, according to the College’s secondary fields Web site.
The Faculty has discussed changing the rule for over a year, but wanted to wait for the three-year-old secondary field program to become more established before adjusting it, General Education administrative director Stephanie H. Kenen wrote in an e-mail.
According to Kenan, the original policy was created when FAS was considering a different plan for Gen Ed that involved taking three courses in each of three areas—natural sciences, arts and humanities, and social sciences. Undergraduate curriculum planners did not want students to take three similar courses in one distribution category and then fulfill nearly all of the requirements for a secondary field with the same three courses.
But the Gen Ed curriculum that was eventually adopted, which requires students to choose one course in each of eight different categories, rendered this policy moot, she wrote.
For now, the adjustment is expected to alleviate “administrative headaches” for students and advisors, Kenan wrote. A Faculty-legislated review of the entire secondary field program will occur next year, as mandated by the 2006 report on curricular renewal.
Former Undergraduate Council Chair of Undergraduate Education Sarah B. Honig ’10—one of two student representatives on the Educational Policy Committee, which helped construct the new double-counting policy—said she recalled proposing this more relaxed double-counting policy to the Committee when she was a sophomore.
“Before, it was one of these policies that didn’t really make sense,” Honig said. “Hopefully it will break down barriers for students who hope to branch out into different fields.”
Athena L. Lao ’12, who was involved in the creation of the recently-approved secondary field in Ethnic Studies, said she thought this change would benefit the growing program that she helped nurture into existence.
“It will only open up the secondary to more people who thought they didn’t have room in their schedules or thought they had too many requirements to fulfill,” Lao said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The machete-wielding attacker who struck a man on Jan. 21 in “The Pit” remains at large, according to the Cambridge Police Department.
At approximately 5:15 p.m. last Thursday, the victim attempted to separate two men fighting in the sunken area between the Out of Town News newsstand and the T entrance. One of the men then pulled a machete out of his backpack and struck the victim on the left shoulder.
Cambridge Police were called to the scene and the victim was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was later released.
Despite searching The Pit, Brattle Street, and Harvard Yard shortly after the attack, police officers were not able to find the suspect. Jennifer Flagg of the Cambridge Police Department said that witnesses described the attacker as a white male who is approximately 25 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, and between 150-180 pounds.
Harvard student Anna M. Remus ’13 echoed the sentiment of shock expressed by many Harvard students in response to the unusual and violent altercation.
“That’s just ridiculous. Why would you try to break up a street fight? I’m not saying you should carry around a machete, but common sense is kind of missing here,” she said.
Last week’s attack was the first in a series of recent knife-related incidents in the Square. A police scanner chatter issued yesterday stated that a man was stabbed in the neck by an unidentified individual on Dunster Street in Harvard Square around 3:00 p.m. Another chatter soon followed, stating that there were two men in the area with knives: one was said to be carrying a butterfly knife, while the other was identified as wielding a box cutter.
Joseph Rizkallah, owner of the local Middle Eastern restaurant Sabra Grill, said he believes that this level of violence in Harvard Square is unusual compared to his experiences living in the area.
“I have been here for 20 years, okay. There have never been any problems, really,” he said. “It’s a safe area and there’s never been too much crime.”
Despite the recent incidents, Rizkallah said he will continue to feel secure because of the proximity and presence of police officers in the Square.

With the plans for Harvard’s new contemporary art museum in Allston currently up in the air, Harvard Art Museum’s curator of contemporary art Helen Molesworth will leave Harvard to become the chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, ICA officials announced earlier this month.
Molesworth, who came to Harvard in 2007, said she was drawn to the Harvard curator position because of the proposed new museum, but decided to apply for the ICA position after she realized that Harvard’s plans would not move forward for several years.
“It’s become clear that the University has a very, very long-term plan for Allston. It won’t happen in my professional lifetime,” she said.
Molesworth said the new museum would have had ample space to feature the large-scale displays in which she specializes, but these exhibitions are more difficult to put on in Harvard’s current space.
“It’s as if I were a scientist, and all of a sudden they weren’t going to build a lab,” she said. “I am disappointed, but I also think that the world is a complicated place and we’re living through an extremely difficult financial crisis. It’s just not the right time in terms of my career and Harvard.”
While Molesworth has organized two small shows annually for Harvard, she will be responsible for nine large exhibitions per year at the ICA.
“At the ICA they have a very ambitious exhibition program,” she said. “There are many more opportunities. There’s more space, and all of the space at the ICA is for contemporary art.”
Despite her departure, Molesworth said she will continue her ties to Harvard and hopes to start an internship program for Harvard students at the ICA.
As Harvard’s first curator of contemporary art since the Art Museum established a department dedicated to the field in 1997, Molesworth made an “important and fundamental” impact, Art Museum Director Thomas W. Lentz wrote in an e-mailed statement.
“She will be missed, but our commitment to modern and contemporary art is unwavering and continues across several curatorial departments here at the Art Museum,” Lentz wrote.
While the future of the Allston museum remains uncertain, the Art Museum plans to expand its emphasis on contemporary art with a 4,000 sq. ft. permanent space in the renovated building on Quincy St., which is slated to open in 2013, according to Daron J. Manoogian, the Art Museum’s director of communications.
“It’s not as if that project we were planning in Allston was the sole venue for contemporary art,” Manoogian said.
Lentz added that the Art Museum will begin a search for Molesworth’s replacement soon but did not specify a time frame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia economics professor and Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz chastised regulators, bankers, and economists for their role in the ongoing financial crisis before a full audience at Brattle Theatre last night.
Stiglitz, a former World Bank Chief Economist who is known for his critical views of modern globalization, lambasted “market fundamentalists” for their devout adherence to capitalism, which resulted in loosened regulations and increased risk-taking.
“Obviously, the financial system undertook excessive risk,” he said. “The banks didn’t do what they were supposed to do, which was to allocate capital, manage risk, run a payments mechanism, and do it all at low transaction costs.”
Stiglitz participated in a question-and-answer session with J. Cullen Murphy Jr., the editor-at-large at Vanity Fair, as part of a book tour promoting his recent release on the financial crisis titled “Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy.”
Stiglitz also criticized the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve for lending money to banks without a vision of what a stable financial system should look like or an acknowledgement of the danger of risk-encouraging incentives.
Nor did he spare economists, whom he said have exhibited a sort of cognitive dissonance in using old data to analyze new investment vehicles.
“The economics profession has to recognize that some of the models that have been very dominant in thinking are very badly flawed,” Stiglitz said. “Markets are not as efficient, people are not as rational as we assumed.”
“It’s not just that there was a bubble,” he added. “I think we all recognize that there was a bubble, but if you look at the kinds of mistakes that they made—the kinds of intellectual incoherence—it is really mind-boggling.”
After speaking and taking questions from the audience, Stiglitz signed copies of “Freefall” at the event, hosted by the Harvard Book Store and the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations.
Stiglitz came to Cambridge after stopping in New York and speaking at the Smithsonian Institute and the World Bank in Washington, D.C., according to Rachel Salzman, a publicist for W.W. Norton, Stiglitz’s publisher.
Harvard Book Store marketing manager Heather L. Gain, who introduced Stiglitz and Murphy at the event, said she was pleased with the turnout.
“Despite the otherwise apocalyptic weather, I thought it went great,” she said.
Audience member Ataveyra Medina said she appreciated the sincerity of Stiglitz’s message.
“I really admire his work. I thought he was very frank,” she said.

Justin R. Timberlake will be honored as Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 2010 Man of the Year next Friday, Feb. 5.
If the event progresses as it did last year, the award-winning musician will receive the traditional Pudding Pot after a comical roast by some of the theatrical group's leaders.
Timberlake, 28, began his music career as the lead singer of 'N Sync, the popular '90s boy band that generated number-one hits such as "It's Gonna Be Me."
In 2002, the multiple Grammy-award winning artist launched a solo career with his debut album "Justified," which sold more than 7 million copies. He then came out with his second solo album "FutureSex/LoveSounds" in 2006. Timberlake shifted into the film business as well, acting in movies such as "Alpha Dog."
Past Pudding honorees include Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and James E. Franco, who was last year's Man of the Year award recipient.
This year, Timberlake joins Anne J. Hathaway, the star of movies ranging from "The Princess Diaries" to "Rachel Getting Married," who will be honored as the Pudding 2010 Woman of the Year on Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 1-8-2 record heading into the last game of the decade, it looked like the Harvard men’s hockey team would need something or someone special to help turn its season around.
That someone turned out to be freshman forward Louis Leblanc, a first-round NHL draft pick last year.
“He’s been a big asset ever since he set foot on campus,” captain Alex Biega said.
Leblanc started heating up when on Dec. 29 he scored one of the Crimson’s goals in a 3-1 upset over then No. 10 Quinnipiac.
But the freshman really got into gear in the new decade, scoring five goals in the past four games, the Crimson’s first unbeaten streak of the season. He scored two goals to lead Harvard to a 3-2 victory over No. 5 Yale, and then tallied two more the next game against Dartmouth. This makes Leblanc the first player to turn in back-to-back multi-goal games since Dominic Moore last performed the feat nearly seven years prior.
Leblanc’s efforts proved crucial again in the most recent game—a 3-3 tie against Rensselaer—scoring the game-tying goal with three seconds remaining in regulation. Early that night, he forced a turnover to set up an Alex Killorn goal, helping the Crimson rally from a 2-0 deficit entering the third period.
“I think what differentiates him is that he’s 100% willing to go into the corner and take hits,” Biega said. “He grinds out games.”
His recent and especially consistent efforts have prized him with his second straight ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week accolade.
It is this kind of tenacity that caught the eyes of the Montreal Canadiens, who picked him as their top draft pick, making him the first Quebec native to be selected first by the Canadiens in 21 years. Leblanc was 18th overall.
“It felt awesome. It was a dream come true,” Leblanc said in an email. “I’ve always been a Canadiens fan.”
Leblanc’s talents earned him a reputation in the province early on.
“I always heard growing up about Louis Leblanc, that he’s going to be a good player,” said junior Mike Biega, a Montreal native. “I’d watch [my brother] Danny play against him and people would always talk about Louis Leblanc.”
The Kirkland, Quebec native was the Most Valuable Player of the Quebec Midget Hockey League in 2007-2008 while playing for the Lac St. Louis Lions alongside Harvard teammate Danny Biega. The following year, he was named the United States Hockey League Rookie of the year. In his spare time, he won a gold medal with Team Canada at the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament.
But his rise to prominence hit a speed bump at the NHL Combine where his intention to play for Harvard proved to be a disadvantage. The NCAA 48-hour rule meant that he had to complete the entire process of interviews and testing in two days while prospects not bound for college had more time.
But it may have been this disadvantage that allowed him to join his favorite team as Leblanc had initially been projected to be a top ten pick, which meant that Montreal wouldn’t have been able to sign him.
But before he sets foot in the NHL, Leblanc will have a chance to develop his game while playing for the Crimson.
“Harvard is a great place,” he said in an email. “I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to come here. Coach Donato is a great coach and he knows his hockey.”
Alex Biega, a fifth round draft pick in the 2006 draft, made a similar decision.
“You have four years to develop and get bigger and stronger,” Biega said. “Obviously there’s the insurance of getting an education from one of the most prestigious schools.”
For Biega and Leblanc, both undersized players, the college schedule, which has fewer games than the professional schedule, allows for more time spent lifting at Palmer-Dixon.
But Harvard’s captain cites another benefit.
“You really grow as an individual [in college],” Biega said. “You come in a boy and come out a man. He’s really opened his eyes, seen what the world is really like.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two hours had passed. Seven other forwards had been taken. Most of the prospective players on-site in Philadelphia for the 2010 MLS SuperDraft had already heard their names called and were making the rounds through media and PR personnel.
Yet All-American Andre Akpan ’10, Hermann Trophy finalist, all-time leading scorer for Harvard (127 points), and unanimous All-Ivy selection, remained seated along with his family hoping for his name to be called.
Members of the media were coming up to me asking for my opinion on the precipitous drop of Akpan’s draft stock. I did my best to reason that his MLS combine performance (underwhelming by most accounts) had hurt him, but surely four years of dominance (including a stint with the U.S. U-20 Men’s National Team) would take precedent in team evaluations, right? At least for one team, that seemed to be the case.
At 4:07 p.m., with the 22nd pick in the draft, the Colorado Rapids selected Akpan. Three hours later, senior Kwaku Nyamekye, another member of the Crimson men’s soccer team was selected by the Columbus Crew.
Both players consistently outperformed their counterparts in Ivy League play—the question now remains, can they adapt their skills to the professional level?
Let’s take a closer look at the teams the duo have joined and their prospects for success.
SWEET HOME COLORADO
Akpan joins a Rapids team that is eager to enter the upper echelon of MLS clubs. Colorado has narrowly missed the playoffs in each of their last three seasons, but their off-season transactions (and talent on the offensive side of the ball) could beckon a new era of success.
The team boasts one of the best striker duos in MLS with US National Team member Conor Casey and Jamaican international Omar Cummings. The two combined to record 24 goals and 13 assists during the 2009 season.
With Akpan falling to the second round, the Rapids seized the opportunity to add needed depth at the forward position. Barring injury, Akpan won’t be playing a prominent role in the starting line-up but can easily grab some playing time off the bench if he can consistently outperform his competition. Forwards Pat Noonan and Facundo Diz will be Akpan’s main opposition for minutes; Noonan featured in 17 games last season and scored two goals while Diz only played 97 minutes the entire season.
Noonan was similarly a runner-up for the Hermann trophy and has played 12 times for the U.S. National Team, but has been on a decline in form since he became a prominent starter for the New England Revolution. Akpan, who almost resembles an amalgamation of Casey and Cummings, should take advantage of the knowledge and experience at his disposal. He won’t be able to replicate the success he enjoyed in college to the MLS as his speed is simply average at the Pro level, but his proclivity for finding the back of the net is a skill that can’t be taught.
With Casey potentially missing several MLS games if he gets called up to the U.S. National Team for this summer’s World Cup, Akpan may find himself in a situation where he can receive valuable playing time mid-way through the season. It will take about half the season for Akpan to adjust to the pro game but he may be primly positioned to apply the knowledge gained from his veteran teammates when minutes become available.
THERE’S A ROAD OUTSIDE COLUMBUS
Nyamekye’s journey from Switzerland to Cambridge has now led him to the 2008 MLS Cup Champions Columbus Crew. However, his transition from collegiate to professional soccer is wrought with obstacles.
Unlike Akpan, Nyamekye faces a far more difficult task in not only getting minutes with his squad but simply making the roster. MLS clubs can have a maximum of 24 players on the roster, four of whom have to be developmental players (A designation for players 25 years of age or younger who do not count towards a club’s salary budget).
Nyamekye was the Crew’s first of three picks in the fourth round—but had already selected two highly coveted players in the first round. Midfielder Dilly Duka (Rutgers University) and forward Bright Dike (Notre Dame) were selected with the 8th and 12th overall picks respectively; both will most certainly be on the Columbus’ opening day roster and will occupy two of the four developmental player slots afforded to the Crew.
To make the roster, Nyamekye will have to beat out University of Penn alum Alex Grendi, the two other rookies selected in the fourth round, and midfielders Kevin Burns and Cory Elenio.
If Nyamekye does manage to secure a spot on the roster (and doesn’t jet off for Scotland permanently, where he received a trial with Rangers FC), he faces another arduous battle to receive playing time at the center-back position. Columbus possesses one of the stingiest backlines in the league (They finished tied for third last season in goals allowed) anchored by two-time MLS Defender of the Year Chad Marshall and five-year veteran Danny O’Rourke. Behind them lie Andy Iro (sixth overall pick in 2008) and Eric Brunner (started in 23 games last season).
Kwaku’s versatility, however, could provide the Swiss native with a distinctive advantage. Nyamekye can play across the backline in multiple positions and the Crew may want to save a roster spot in case of an injury crisis.
Regardless of the tandem’s professional prospects, both Akpan and Nyamekye represent the success of Harvard’s men’s soccer program over the past few years. After only having three Crimson alumni selected to the MLS ranks during the league’s first 13 years, Harvard has now had three players selected in the last two years with the potential for more in the future given the abundance of young talent remaining on the roster.
For both Akpan and Nyamekye, I’m guessing the disappointment in waiting to hear their names called pales in comparison to the jubilation of beginning a professional career in the sport they love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You thought nobody cared about Ivy League basketball?
Well, apparently somebody out there does.
Kathy Orton, a writer for The Washington Post, spent the 2005-06 season following four Ancient Eight teams in their quests to win the league championship. Orton translated her notes into her book, “Outside the Limelight,” which was published this past November.
While Orton does a fine job of showing her readers the inner workings of Ivy League basketball during 2005-06 season, she does an even better job of illuminating the major changes that have taken place within the Harvard basketball program over just the past four seasons.
Orton writes about a Harvard basketball program that seems highly foreign from today’s reality.
While Orton describes a cast of scrappy players who know their playing days are coming to an end, the current squad is filled with higher-caliber athletes, many of whom aim to make basketball a career.
Orton writes about a team that largely flew under the radar, while today’s team has received national media coverage from ESPN, Time Magazine, and several other publications that project the Crimson to challenge Cornell for Ancient Eight dominance.
This change can be largely explained by the entirely new roster of players who don Harvard uniforms. (The book takes place one year before the start of the Jeremy Lin Era, meaning none of the Crimson’s current players were on the roster.)
But the greatest changes to the Harvard basketball program since the 2005-06 season have had more to do with the man now pacing up and down the Crimson bench rather than the players who are running up and down the court.
When Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker arrived in Cambridge following the 2006-07 season, he took the helm of a mediocre basketball program. During former head coach Frank Sullivan’s final season in charge, the Crimson finished 5-9 in conference play and failed to capture the ever-elusive Ivy League championship.
“As Division I basketball programs go, Harvard has one of the more barebones operations,” Orton writes of Harvard basketball’s recent Dark Ages. “With just a head coach, two assistants, and a trainer, the Crimson is the mom-and-pop store in the corporate world of college basketball.”
Harvard basketball found the perfect person to bring it into the corporate world of college basketball when Amaker arrived on the scene three seasons ago.
Amaker—who played and coached under Mike Krzyzewski at Duke before becoming head coach at Seton Hall and Michigan—has taken giant steps to turn a titleless team from the Ivy League into one that battles top programs on the court in games and off the court for standout recruits.
The once “barebones operation” now staffs three assistant coaches, a director of basketball operations, a trainer, and four team managers. Amaker now boasts his own website, (CoachTommyAmaker.com), hosts a coaches’ clinic in the fall, and coaches a summer basketball academy at Harvard that attracts some of the nation’s top high school players.
But most importantly, the third-year coach has been able to land some of those top players, stealing top prospects from such bigger-name programs as Vanderbilt and Stanford.
For all these successes off the court, the Crimson’s play on the court during Amaker’s first two seasons was far from impressive.
Halfway into Amaker’s third year as head coach, things have started to change for Harvard.
The Crimson is currently riding a six-game winning streak and finished non-conference play with the most victories in school history.
But as dramatically as the culture and atmosphere surrounding Harvard basketball off the court has changed in recent years, this is not the first time expectations have been high for the ballers from Cambridge on the court entering the heart of conference play.
In fact, the last time expectations were this high for the Crimson going into Ivy League play was four seasons ago—the same season Kathy Orton followed Harvard.
Despite lacking the corporate swagger the Crimson now possess, that mom-and-pop Harvard team managed to win its first six non-conference games and many expected the Crimson to challenge the league favorite—Penn, back in the day—for the league title. Just like this year’s team, expectations continued to mount as the Crimson captured its first two conference matchups against Dartmouth.
What remains to be seen is whether Harvard will continue to follow in the footsteps of its ancestor from a recently passed era or blaze its own path.
While the 05’-06’ Crimson crippled under the pressure—dropping nine of its final twelve league games—Tommy Amaker and his revamped Harvard squad will look to translate its big program attitude into some big program wins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suddenly and unceremoniously, the Christina Kessler Era is over for the Harvard women’s hockey team. The standout senior goaltender tore her ACL during practice last week, ending her season and college career. There’s plenty of hockey left for Kessler, who is on the Canadian Under-22 team and will likely be a national team fixture for years to come, but her loss deals the Crimson (10-5-4, 8-5-2 ECAC) a devastating blow. The squad faces the ECAC playoff hunt and seeks an NCAA Tournament bid with untested rookie Laura Bellamy starting between the pipes and junior Kylie Stephens returning to the squad as a backup.
Kessler’s tenure with Harvard ends with her name scribbled all over the school and NCAA record books. She holds the Crimson’s all-time wins and shutout marks with 64 and 25, respectively. In her sophomore year, Kessler notched 12 shutouts—at the time an NCAA record (Wisconsin’s Jessie Vetter tallied 14 blank sheets last season). Kessler finishes her career with a .9413 save percentage, which places her just ahead of Vetter (.9407) as the NCAA’s all-time leader.
As a tribute to the decorated netminder, let's look back on the top five moments of Kessler’s career:
5) HARVARD 4, MINNESOTA-DULUTH 0 (DEC. 2, 2006)
Kessler burst onto the college hockey scene as a rookie in 2006, picking up a pair of shutouts in her first three starts. Her clean sheet against the Bulldogs was part of a 150-minute stretch in which the freshman held her opponents scoreless.
Playing in a platoon with Brittany Martin ’09, Kessler gave Harvard coach Katey Stone uncanny depth inside the crease.
“They’re two of the best goalies in college hockey,” Stone said after the game. “How could you have one on the bench?”
4) HARVARD 2, ST. LAWRENCE 0 (JAN. 11, 2008)
With Martin hurt during the beginning of the 2007-08 campaign, the starting goalie job was Kessler’s to lose. The Oakville, Ont. native responded emphatically, putting together a transcendent season in which she led the Crimson to a 32-2-0 record and an NCAA Frozen Four bid.
On Jan. 11, Kessler blanked St. Lawrence with a 29-save effort. The 2-0 victory capped off a three-game stretch in which Kessler shutout a trio of tough opponents: Colgate, Boston College, and the Saints. The win also tied Kessler with Ali Boe ’06 for Harvard’s single-season shutout record of seven, a mark that Kessler would soon shatter.
3) HARVARD 0, MINNESOTA 0 (DEC. 5, 2009)
The Crimson’s historic 2007-08 season set a lofty and perhaps unrealistic standard for Harvard to uphold. The following season—Kessler’s junior campaign—was a disappointment for the goalie and for the Crimson as a whole, ending in overtime in the ECAC semifinals against a supposedly outclassed RPI squad.
But while Harvard hasn’t reclaimed its former dominance this season, it has performed beyond expectations considering it lost its top three scorers from last year to graduation. Prior to her injury, Kessler had been the anchor of the Crimson’s resurgence, posting a .944 save percentage and a 1.38 goals against average.
Kessler’s return to form was most evident when No. 2 Minnesota came to Cambridge for a weekend set. After the goalie shut out the Golden Gophers, 1-0, on Dec. 4, she returned to the ice the next night and repeated the feat. Harvard also couldn’t find net and settled for a tie, but the Crimson once again established itself as a national contender, with Kessler leading the charge.
2) HARVARD 2, CLARKSON 0 (MAR. 8, 2008)
The Crimson’s win over the Golden Knights was far from Kessler’s best performance of the 2007-08 season. Harvard dominated play and held Clarkson to just 13 shots, handing Kessler an easy shutout.
But the clean sheet marked Kessler’s 12th of the season and 15th of her career, extending her NCAA single-season record and tying her with Boe as the Crimson’s all-time shutout leader.
1) HARVARD 5, COLGATE 1 (JAN. 16, 2010)
It’s doubtful that Kessler ever imagined ending her playing days for Harvard in a routine 5-1 win during the regular season in a sparsely populated Bright Hockey Center. But the Crimson’s victory over the Raiders less than two weeks ago turned out to be the last in one of the most storied careers in Harvard history.
The win wasn’t without significance. It was the 64th for Kessler, putting her one ahead of Boe as the Crimson’s all-time leader and cementing her place as quite arguably the greatest goalie in Harvard history.

In a phone interview last week, coveted men’s basketball recruit Majok Majok said Harvard remains his favorite.
The Northfield Mount Hermon (Mass.) senior is scheduled to visit more schools during spring break—probably Georgia Tech and St. Louis—and he plans to make a decision afterwards, likely once his season has ended in March.
Majok is waiting to receive the results from his recent SAT, which will help determine his eligibility for Harvard, a consistent leader in his recruitment.
He also has high major offers from Stanford, Virginia Tech, and Notre Dame, and the 6′8 forward is currently deciding which of those schools to visit.
Of his late-December visit to Fordham, Majok said it “wasn’t too bad…Harvard is a better school, basketball-wise and academic-wise.”
The big man’s stock has been rising steadily thanks to his play during his final season before college. In a win over South Kent on Jan. 9th, Majok set a school record for rebounds in a single game with 26 boards, to go along with 19 points and 5 blocked shots.
“I’ve been playing well since the start of the year,” Majok said, calling it the “best basketball of my life so far.”
Majok’s ability to elevate above the rim has made him a mainstay in highlight reels (courtesy Northfield Mount Hermon Basketball).
Majok’s size and skills in the frontcourt would greatly bolster Harvard’s future class of 2014—currently made up of Northfield Mount Hermon’s Matt Brown and Laurent Rivard, Montverde Academy’s Ugo Okam, and Jesuit’s James Moore—but it remains to be seen if Crimson coach Tommy Amaker and his staff will be able to successfully lure a top prospect away from the pull of established college basketball programs.

Ever wonder what our House Masters do when they are not parenting hundreds of (sometimes whiny) college students?  Adams House Master Judy S. Palfrey '67 carried the Olympic torch through Canada this past Tuesday on Jan. 19.
Palfrey tells about the experience on the Children's Hospital of Boston's blog. She writes that passing the flame was “‘like’ no other experience I have ever had nor probably will have.” She was chosen as one of 20 Americans to carry the flame to highlight community action and living positively. Palfrey directs the Children's Hospital and, according to her Adams House bio, she has a "special interest in programs for children with disabilities."
As the President of American Academy of Pediatrics, she writes in the blog that the AAP is currently receiving daily donations from the global community to help pediatricians in Haiti and the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of the earthquake. “The work…for the children of Haiti is the embodiment of the love, courage and commitment that the Olympic torch is meant to symbolize.”

Having trouble picking a class to fill up that final slot? This third installment of our shopping week feature showcases interesting classes that aren't that hard and don't require a lot of work.
But first, the day's gossip:
We heard that the Economics 1630: "Economics of Sports and Entertainment" class was packed to almost outside the front door. However, the professor was very old and whispered when he talked, so every time the door opened, no one in the room could hear him.
In Literature and Arts B-85: "American Musicals and American Culture," which we recommended yesterday, the class watched several videos of the song "I'm Just Wild about Harry" performed by different people throughout the early decades of the 20th century. The final video was of Daffy Duck singing a Looney Tunes rendition of "I'm Just Wild about Hymie." Hymie, of course, was a kangaroo. Who knew?
In Science of the Physical Universe 12: "Natural Disasters," which we recommend below, students were told to close their eyes as the professor turned the lights off and played a loud recording. As the intensity of the sound grew, the students, we were told, felt as if they were shaking. When the lights came back on, students were shown a photo of the disaster in Haiti and told that the noise was what they would have experienced had they been physically there at the time, and that scene was what they would have seen had they been alive to open their eyes afterward. Whoa.
And now, your easy fourths, along with their Q scores:
