After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Francis D. “Bud” Riley, Harvard’s police chief of 25 years, just announced his retirement. An external review of the department he will leave behind — arguably no better than he found it — is underway. But it’s not enough — or really it’s too much. The time has come for a serious conversation about whether we really need a campus police force at all.
For decades instances of police brutality have sparked calls for police reform and increased accountability; however, activists are now demanding more sweeping changes, such as defunding and abolishing police forces, that seek to reduce the power of police and address more fundamental issues within the police system. These calls have only grown louder on our campus since last week when HUPD officers were spotted in Boston assisting the Boston Police Department at a protest over George Floyd’s murder and police brutality.
This backlash has already sparked significant changes to HUPD. Riley, who from his first year on the job pledged to reform the department’s racist reputation, announced he would step down after a bruising year, during which 21 current and former officers spoke to The Crimson about rampant racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism within the force. The University also announced an independent review of the department’s policing procedures — an improvement from the department’s ongoing internal review led by Riley, who HUPD officers cited as the source of the hostile work environment the review sought to assess.
But many more problems remain.
Policing is problematic not just in its often violent and discriminatory practice, but also in theory; the issue is not a few rotten apples, but of a rotten tree. By responding to the symptoms of pervasive social inequities, not the causes, policing perpetuates a cycle of violence, incarceration, and poverty.
Several groups on campus have already called for the elimination of HUPD — particularly the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition. We thank them for their moral foresight, courage, and leadership.
HUPD operates more or less like any regular police force and unsurprisingly is plagued by the same issues protested globally. Its officers receive the same academy training as Cambridge officers. They are authorized to police Cambridge, Somerville, and Boston. The only differences between HUPD and any other city police force? First, jurisdiction: HUPD officers have priority in responding to nearly all crime on Harvard’s property. And second, transparency: As a private police force, HUPD is required to release less comprehensive public records than municipal police forces. Instead, each incident to which HUPD is deployed is reduced to a one-liner in their daily police log, the department’s only public record. So HUPD isn’t just another city police force; in some ways, it’s just a worse one Harvard pays for.
Some readers might wonder why we can't simply reform our police department. Can't we just dismiss Anthony T. Carvello and other officers accused of using excessive force? Push for more transparency? Wouldn't thorough racial-bias training and stricter guidelines suffice?
No. For one, the past few months have taught us that “reform” can become a synonym for opaque internal reviews — at times headed by those they should be investigating — that yield no tangible results. And on a national level, there is evidence that such reforms, like requiring police to wear body cameras, do not actually decrease police violence. The “blue wall of silence” — the informal rule among police officers to not report on a colleague's wrongdoing —  complicates real change taking root within the system. And the widespread examples of police brutality observed in response to recent protests against police brutality illustrate how deep the problem goes.
The overwhelming majority of HUPD’s work — 95 percent of its caseload — deals with property crimes. To replace it, the University should instead opt for a pared-down security team modeled on Securitas guards around campus already, with first responders, other University officials, and social workers responsible for much of the current work of HUPD officers. This organization cannot be born of the current police force. The institutional rot goes too deep; no training or new figurehead will change it.
Poverty, homelessness, and pervasive racial bias in perceptions of criminality shape who is incarcerated in the U.S. Yet instead of addressing the root causes of crime with sympathy, we funnel resources into violent and discriminatory policing. From the current criminalization of poverty to America’s history of heavily racist drug legislation our federal government appears intent on using the police force to actively harm and imprison the communities it ought to be helping. Our University seems to be doing the same.
But it doesn’t have to be that way, and increasingly it isn’t. Camden, New Jersey dissolved its police force seven years ago and saw crime nearly halved. A veto-proof majority on the Minneapolis City Council announced its intention to disband the police department, pledging to explore alternative institutional options for public safety. Harvard could readily do the same.
And while there are many unanswered questions about how to implement such a policy at a national level, we are convinced that Harvard — with its extremely low violent crime rate — offers a fertile ground to explore and promote alternative ways to keep our communities safe. This might include redirecting HUPD funds to better the availability of mental health care or to address Cambridge’s widespread homelessness in a way that doesn’t involve having a police force assault those experiencing it.
Compassionate, sustainable relationships between people and the law are not bred from violence and fear. They come from a shared sense of ownership over the community and from mutual trust and respect. A criminal enforcement system like policing, with no such commitment, lacking the trust of many, and with deep, clear institutional blight, is neither compassionate nor sustainable. And it has no place on our campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge police officers responded to nearly 200 incidents during the month of May, marking the highest monthly crime total of 2020, according to CPD’s monthly crime report.
Break-ins and thefts surged as the total number of crimes rose to 194 in May — a 12 percent increase compared to April, according to the report. While violent crime decreased by 24 percent, property crime increased by 17 percent.
Thieves targeted motor vehicles, residences, and bike racks in May. Compared to 2019, the number of reported thefts in those three categories have collectively increased by 45 percent in 2020.
According to the CPD report, the recent increase in reported crimes can be traced back to a few types of calls.
“The jump from three house breaks in April to 13 in May, the 24% increase in larcenies from motor vehicles, and the 20% surge in larceny of bicycles when compared with the previous month were the key indicators fueling this incline,” the report reads. “Larcenies from unlocked vehicles, thefts of packages, psychiatric-related calls, a wave of commercial burglaries, and a deluge of unemployment frauds are on the radar.”
After charting ten weeks of data since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, CPD wrote that it is “still too early” to determine the effects of social distancing guidelines and the recent stay-at-home advisory. In Cambridge alone, Health Department officials have confirmed more than 1,000 positive coronavirus cases.
Since late March, CPD has responded to the virus by transitioning several services to an over-the-phone format and deferring many calls to the Cambridge Fire Department and other first responders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a recent paper from a team of Harvard economists, Americans' political orientation distorts both their worldview and their basic understanding of policy.
In a paper released last month in the annual issue of the AEA Papers and Proceedings, the three researchers sought to determine how Democrats and Republicans perceive different social and economic issues by comparing their perceptions to known statistics. Ultimately, the group demonstrated that political polarization skews Americans’ perceptions of verifiable facts.
Participants answered questions about social mobility, wealth inequality and tax policies, and immigration. The study found that both Democrats and Republicans overestimate the size of the United States immigrant population and underestimate immigrants’ level of education, but that Republicans were almost twice as likely to think that the average immigrant receives double the aid of the average nonimmigrant.
“Immigration is an area where there’s a very widespread misperception,” co-author and Economics professor Stefanie Stantcheva said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication. “One group is not necessarily more wrong than the other. Everybody’s quite wrong.”
Stantcheva co-authored the study with Economics Ph.D. student Armando Miano and the late Economics professor Alberto F. Alesina, who died from an apparent heart attack in May at age 63.
Additionally, the researchers found that Democrats underestimate the tax rate for the richest Americans at 28 percent of their income, while Republicans estimated 31 percent. In reality, the top tax rate in the U.S. is 37 percent of earned income.
Stantcheva said in an NPR interview that strong political leanings can affect how we seek out information, which can lead to confirmation bias.
“And this is how even the information we receive may be completely different from [what] other people receive,” Stantcheva said in the interview. “And this is how echo chambers and, really, tribes can form where the information received matches with what is already believed in.”
Stantcheva told the Gazette that the research has “a ton of policy interventions.”
“By understanding the thought process, we can actually design better learning,” she said in the interview. “We can design better information interventions that can actually help people understand the economy, economic policies, all these phenomena, better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana announced that five new faculty deans will join Cabot House, Eliot House, Kirkland House, Quincy House, and Winthrop House beginning July 1 in Thursday emails to affiliates of those Houses.
Ian J. Miller and Crate Herbert will serve as Cabot House Faculty Deans, Kevin J. Madigan and Stephanie A. Paulsell will serve as Eliot House Faculty Deans, David J. Deming and Janine M. Santimauro will serve as Kirkland House Faculty Deans, Eric A. Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod will serve as Quincy House Faculty Deans, and Stephen Chong and Kiran Gajwani serve as Winthrop House Faculty Deans.
The leadership change marks the largest turnover at Harvard’s houses in decades. Since 1998, only a handful of years have seen more than one new faculty dean pair.
Khurana thanked House members for their involvement in the search process, writing that the pool of faculty dean applicants was “remarkable.”
“Members of the community dedicated their time and energy and gave meaningful input that was invaluable in helping us make this decision,” Khurana wrote. “We were fortunate to have received applications from a truly remarkable pool of candidates, and this was indeed a difficult choice.”
In his email, Khurana also acknowledged the incoming group of faculty deans’ ability to lead their Houses during the “uniquely challenging times” caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the “disproportional threats” experienced by people of color for “merely existing in public spaces.”
The announcements cap a months-long search process that was markedly different from past years. Faculty dean candidates normally meet with House members for meals; this year’s slate of candidates interacted with affiliates remotely after the College dispersed in the middle of the spring semester.
Khurana also thanked the outgoing faculty deans, including Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke and Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan, for their commitment to the Houses.
In January, Lee Gehrke announced he would step down from his post in Quincy House following the death of his wife, Deborah Gehrke.
The Gearans acted as interim faculty deans of Winthrop House after Khurana announced he would not renew then-faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson after they completed their term. Winthrop residents started a petition earlier this year calling for their permanent appointments; the College responded by noting they were appointed only to serve as interim deans.
Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod wrote in an email to Quincy House affiliates that the Gerhke’s and House staff have “set the bar high.”
“We are thrilled to join the People’s House. Quincy is an extraordinary place, with a quirky, down-to-earth culture and look,” they wrote. “We are grateful for the magnificent stewardship of Lee and Deb Gehrke and their amazing house team.”
The new faculty deans also touched upon crises facing the country in their emails, namely the coronavirus pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, which sparked massive protests against police brutality and systemic racism across the country. Beerbohm and Duhaylongsod added in their email that they plan on working with staff and students to support House members.
“We’ve all seen acutely visible injustices, and we recognize the burdens that this places on the lives of Black students, Black tutors, Black staff members, and Black resident affiliates at Quincy House,” they wrote.
Miller and Herbert wrote in their email to Cabot affiliates that they will engage with House affiliates to determine what aspects of the House should change, and what should remain.
“We will reach out as we strive to see Cabot through your eyes,” they wrote. “We look forward to continuing the dialogue that started in the interview process.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Paulsell said she looks forward to engaging in meaningful dialogue with Eliot students.
“My dad was a college professor in the 60s and 70s. The War in Vietnam was going on, the Civil Rights Movement was still going on,” Paulsell said. “I grew up as a kid sitting on the edge of these conversations and listening to those students talk about what they cared about and worried about and loved. This opportunity feels like a chance to live in that sort of environment again.”
Paulsell added that her and Madigan's goal is to speak with every Eliot resident before the school year begins.
“We’re eager to get to know the [students] and be in community with them,” Paulsell said. “We’re hoping to create a place where students can really be themselves and relax and pursue their passions. Ultimately, we just want to create a place that feels like home.”
