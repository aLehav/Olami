After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When I look up,” thinks the elderly former slave Granada in a dream, “there are women as far as I can see, standing in the river one behind the other, generations going back to beginning time, from the very womb of God.” Jonathan Odell’s coming-of-age story “The Healing” contains a breathtaking density of beautifully written dreams like these. Odell, through this rich language, explores symbolic threads of identity, womanhood, and mysticism, and manages to tie together a narrative that transitions through the memory and imagination of one remarkable woman’s life. Though little creativity exists in the novel’s structure—nearly every element of “The Healing” seems taken directly from a classic bildungsroman—the novel exhibits contemplative force and realistic emotion. Odell weaves a story that, while rather abrupt in its ending, is tender and thoughtful in its exploration of a gifted woman, her mysterious past, and the strange young black girl with a metronome-like head tic she looks after.
The story, which takes place in Mississippi in the era surrounding the Civil War, begins when the elderly healer Granada takes in the young girl Violet, whose mother died from a botched abortion attempt of her second child. Granada, who is unsure how to help Violet recover from the trauma of this recent experience, decides to bridge the gap between them by telling her ward stories of her own childhood on a plantation in antebellum Mississippi. It is in this murky past that most of the narrative unfolds.
Granada’s story began when the plantation master’s wife took her from her enslaved parents. The woman, who was going insane, believed that Granada carried a piece of her own daughter’s soul because she was born at the same time that the dying girl succumbed to cholera. Granada subsequently underwent a complicated identity crisis, for her proximity to the plantation owners imbued her with great contempt for field slaves and additional prejudice against the darkest-skinned ones—including her own estranged mother. The catalyst for her transformation into a woman came from an old healer who arrived at the plantation to prevent another cholera outbreak. The woman selects Granada as her protégée after witnessing some hidden inner power in the girl. Odell weaves the story of their relationship with tenderness and wisdom; Granada eventually comes to find a place in a network of souls reaching back to her heritage in Africa and forward through generations.
While Odell for the most part does a commendable job navigating very charged topics—racism, womanhood, abortion, and the brutality of plantation owners—numerous aspects of the narrative remain disjointed. Granada breaks in and out of telling her recollections in order to interact with Violet, but there are points at which her lapses into memory appear contrived; for example, Violet points at masks on the wall to urge on an aspect of Granada’s story that seems naturally sequential, without need of prodding or reminder.
Another major flaw is Odell’s tendency to play the tropes of feminine “coming of age” and “wise women” too frequently—it becomes a literary crutch to rely on instead of exploring her character in further detail.  Granada is selected as an assistant by the itinerant healer, but the reader never learns exactly what her cryptic “gift” entails. This omission replaces a potentially substantial exploration of her character with a nebulous cluster of readers’ preconceptions about exemplary children chosen for their “gifts.” Similarly, Odell  later comes to rely on the supposed mystical aspects of womanhood to explain Granada’s shifting loyalties from the plantation owners to her fellow African-Americans. Hormonal upheavals aside, there are certainly many other reasons for a character to embrace her racial heritage. Here, it comes across as a hackneyed attempt to explain the workings of the female mind.
Stereotypes aside, however, “The Healing” draws strength from the power of its language as well as Granada’s emotional journey to reconcile her past with her present. “Throughout this season of signs, Granada learned to watch and to listen,” Odell writes. “She waited for the sight to burn bright, to light the way for her, to reveal her place in that river of souls.” Her enigmatic skills, coupled with descriptive and vivid language, enliven her story beyond its stereotypical boundaries. Her struggle to find her place in the world is poignant and relatable, even if this literary ground has been well-trod before.
“The Healing” is certainly not a groundbreaking work, but it does lend a moving perspective to an oft-told story. “The revelation was neither blinding nor thunderous,” Odell writes, as Granada finally connects to her past through healing another. In the end, Odell proves, stories about the human experience need not be revelations; the healing power of the human story is a truth that can be lovely with every retelling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, The Crimson reported that the interim director of Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center resigned following the recent deaths of two monkeys at the facility. These incidents occurred shortly after NEPRC was cited for violations of the Animal Welfare Act by the United States Department of Agriculture for alleged acts of animal mistreatment, ones that we denounced on these same pages not long ago. In response to the new deaths, HMS has suspended all new primate research and commissioned an outside committee to assess corrective efforts at the center. While this loss of life at Harvard’s labs is saddening and disturbing, the administration has responded well with its vigorous action in response to these recent developments, and we hope that it will lead to lasting improvements at NEPRC.
Primate testing is a particularly controversial form of animal testing, and it has been banned in nations such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, among others. In spite of the contentious nature of such testing, we believe that it makes valuable contributions to science and should be continued until viable alternatives can be found. Primates are the most genetically similar organisms to humans and testing and experimenting on them can lead to valuable breakthroughs that ultimately benefit human life. To give just one example, primate testing has contributed enormously to scientists’ understanding of Parkinson’s disease.
However, the very proximity to humans that makes primates ideal for medical research makes their mistreatment in Harvard’s labs all the more horrific. The details of the recent monkey deaths at NEPRC are sickening. One of the monkeys may have died because its cage lacked water. It would seem that the average pet owner would have proved more competent in this case than the staff at the labs. Thus, while primate testing is not problematic in and of itself, the manner in which Harvard has recently conducted it is simply unacceptable, and systematic reforms are urgently needed.
A research system that works properly would hold all individuals accountable for their actions. Whether individual negligence or lack of institutional oversight led to the monkeys’ deaths does not matter; those directly involved should be held responsible, and should pay for the loss of life with the loss of their jobs. To be sure, Harvard is not the only institution that seems to mishandle primate testing. Princeton, for instance, was cited for multiple offenses by the USDA in 2010. Yet Harvard should hold itself to a higher standard than its peers. By seeking to not merely comply with USDA regulations regarding the treatment of monkeys, but surpass them, the University can set a valuable example for others.
While the circumstances surrounding the recent primate deaths are still somewhat unclear, it is indisputable that something is not working well at NEPRC. We are pleased to see that the University is investigating and hope that systematic reform will prevent such events from happening in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have a fairly strong stomach. But the integrity of my digestive tract has been damaged by the demoralizing experience of Dorm Crew.
My need to “take a breather” while scrubbing a random person’s toilet is not enough reason to abolish Dorm Crew. The fact that I (and others) likely did a poor job of scrubbing, however, should be adequate. Dorm Crew is not hygienic, and that one fundamental flaw alone delegitimizes its existence. I have worked Dorm Crew on two occasions, and I didn’t feel like I had actually made people’s bathrooms significantly cleaner. Shinier? Yes. Cleaner? Probably not.
Dorm Crew is unsanitary because some of those who are cleaning others’ bathrooms do not have sufficient incentive to do a good job. If students clean somebody else’s sink, it may look nice. But when it comes to germs, appearance and reality can be very different. Though I am sure many Dorm Crew workers are careful to follow the appropriate protocol, even one worker could negate those efforts by mistakenly or negligently swapping the sponge intended for the toilet with the one meant for the sink.
I spoke with one friend (who regularly worked Dorm Crew in her freshman year) who validated my concerns. “The sponges weren’t replaced very often. The rags…were washed, like, maybe once every two weeks,” she told me, hoping that that is no longer the case. The Dorm Crew office did not respond to my request for updated information about this. But potentially overused cleaning supplies would undermine the work that committed Dorm Crew workers do. “They should actually test that shit to see how clean it is after,” my friend said (with no pun intended).
The point is, Dorm Crew’s services result in sparkling bathrooms, but they could be rife with bacteria. Harvard would never tolerate these issues from a third-party, professional vendor, and it should not lower its standards simply because student-workers provide the service. (Consider the uproar that would ensue if HUDS reused gloves.)
There is only one way to ensure that students’ bathrooms meet their own standards of cleanliness: make them scrub their own toilets, sinks, and showers. If students live in filth, it will be their own fault—but their own choice as well. It shocks me that Harvard doesn’t already expect students to clean up after themselves. Learning to advocate for ourselves is one of the most valuable lessons Harvard teaches us. To thrive here, students must take initiative, seeking out the best resources and opportunities on campus. Why compromise on that principle with Dorm Crew? Functioning as adults means taking responsibility for our possessions and not expecting others to clean up after us. We learned these values from Barney, but by relying on Dorm Crew, we undermine them.
Dorm Crew is an important source of employment for many undergraduates, and laying them off would impart undue harm. But disbanding Dorm Crew’s bathroom-cleaning service would not eliminate all its jobs. The Fall and Spring Clean-Ups would (and should) still exist, as these efforts are indispensable to preparing dorms for new groups of students. Additionally, workers will still be needed to staff the Dorm Crew office in Harvard Yard for freshmen to retrieve cleaning supplies and toilet paper.
Nevertheless, there should be other equally well-advertised and attractive employment options. Dorm Crew is popular in part because everybody knows about it. Students receive information about Fall Clean-Up even before arriving their freshman year. The Student Employment Office could promote other types of jobs, such as working as faculty aides or tutoring, with similar enthusiasm. These opportunities would alleviate the loss of cleaning jobs and enable undergraduates to contribute to Harvard’s intellectual community.
Harvard needs to put more effort into creating high quality part-time work opportunities for its undergraduates. Additional substantial part-time student jobs could provide students with other relevant work experience that they can draw upon in the future. As Harvard becomes more accessible to low- and middle-class students through financial aid, it should reevaluate the ways it provides meaningful and well-paying employment opportunities to them. Dorm Crew offers community, character-building work, flexible hours, and solid pay, but there can be other ways to achieve these ends. Ultimately, while the Dorm Crew office can still provide the G-Force and the Morning Mist, every Harvard student should supply the elbow grease.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The One State Conference that took place this weekend at the Harvard Kennedy School triggered an outpouring of furious debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conference, featuring speakers from various universities and diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds, explored a solution in which Israel and the Palestinian Territories would unite into a single secular state with equal rights for all. Some members of the pro-Israel Jewish community have declared the conference “anti-Semitic;” others, such as Harvard Students for Israel have disagreed with the conference’s ideas but emphasized its right to take place. As members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance and supporters of a two-state solution, we believe that this conference raised important issues that have a valuable place in the campus discourse on Israel-Palestine, but are concerned by some of the extreme rhetoric that it has triggered.
As progressives, we believe in principle that ethnicity should not be intertwined with the state. All citizens should be treated as equals; no voting laws, housing laws, immigration laws, or indeed any laws should distinguish based on ethnicity. To do otherwise inevitably leads to inequity and social injustice. Even declaring an official state ethnicity without enacting discriminatory laws symbolically designates certain people as second-class citizens. Of course, this equality need not detract from the cultural diversity, which would continue to exist on a local and personal level. The state simply should not be in the business of privileging one culture or religion over another.
Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to enact progressive principles in a world mired in racism and oppression. Abolishing all ethnic state lines today would simply be impractical in a world where ethnic states abound, from Slovenia to Japan to Bangladesh. Moreover, historical attempts at multi-ethnic states have frequently failed dramatically and violently—consider, for example, the Balkan states and Sudan. Even in multi-ethnic states that haven’t broken apart, one group is often oppressed or discriminated against.
Attempting to enforce our ideal on states with a long history of ethnic and religious conflict would simply cause more violence and perpetuate violations of human rights. Thus, while we would love to see a peaceful and egalitarian one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we think it only practical to continue working toward a two-state solution. It is unfair to ask the Israelis and Palestinians who dream of having their own ethnic nation-states to give up these aspirations without demanding the same of every country in the world. While we theoretically admire the ideals of a one-state solution, in practice, a single state seems an ineffective and dangerous policy solution—and so we cannot endorse or advocate for it in today’s world.  It is essential to end the oppression that many One-State Conference speakers noted occurs in Palestine today, but we doubt that a one-state solution could do this successfully. Thus, we hope that the Conference’s call for a re-envisioning of peace negotiations will galvanize those who truly support a peaceful two-state solution not to lash out, but to work harder for a truly just and effective path toward a two-state solution.
Although we cannot imagine that a one-state solution would effectively resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, alternatives to a two-state solution are legitimate topics of discussion, and the One State Conference was a good-faith attempt to propose a peaceful solution to the conflict in which all people are given equal rights. We understand the frustration that many—ourselves included—feel about the possibility of a two-state solution, as negotiations seem to be constantly unproductive and stalled. Indeed, fair negotiations are incredibly difficult given the current power dynamic in Israel and Palestine and Israel’s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories. These flaws have provided the impetus for academic conversation about other peace-making options, including the discussion that took place at the One State Conference last weekend.  Thus, the conference should not be regarded as an attempt to delegitimize Israel but rather as an attempt, albeit an imperfect one, to resolve the problems inherent in the negotiations for a two-state solution.
While we believe that there should be space on campus for discussion of a one-state solution, we are concerned about the inflammatory responses it has elicited from some in both the pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian communities. No solution to the conflict will be possible unless people engage each other in meaningful dialogue instead of exchanging insults of “anti-Semitism” and “racism.” Any statement that seeks mainly to demonize the other side and blame the entire conflict on one group is a step away from peace. We hope that Jews and Palestinians alike can participate in respectful dialogue, seek to understand each others’ perspectives, and thereby work towards a practical, peaceful, and just solution to the conflict.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since 2009, Harvard has been reorganizing its 73 libraries into a consolidated entity, the Harvard Library. Library staff members are deeply concerned that some of the proposed changes, including workforce reductions, will result in serious threats to the integrity of the Library. We worry that if the voices of staff are not heard and the reorganization continues on its present course, thousands of books and materials could be lost, service standards could drop to unacceptable levels, and human relationships that are key to research, curriculum, and collection development could be severed.
In recent communications, Harvard Library leaders have implied that staffing levels need to be reduced to put us in line with our peers, asserting that Harvard spends more on its library than other universities. But HL leaders have not provided the community with any data to support the assumption that this discrepancy is caused by “overstaffing.” We would expect Harvard Library to be more expensive to operate than its peers—it is larger, with a spectacularly broad and unique collection that requires sophisticated maintenance. It has significant offsite holdings, and offers deluxe services such as HD Transfer and “Scan-and-Deliver.”
Additionally, since 2009 (which is when the data comparing Harvard to other schools were gathered), Harvard Library staffing levels have dropped by more than 20 percent. More recently, the University offered eligible library workers an early-retirement package. With the threat of possible layoffs heavy in the air, many long-time staff members will likely take the package and leave. Harvard Library cannot afford to lose any more skilled workers. Across the campus, librarians and library assistants report serious quality problems resulting from understaffing and overreliance on poorly-considered cost-cutting measures.
In order to reduce labor costs, HL increasingly sends books and materials to external vendors for outsourced cataloging. The results are alarming: outsourced materials are frequently cataloged with mistakes in title, author, subject, or call number. Since staff members often do not have time or permission to make corrections, the errors have led to thousands of materials becoming undiscoverable. The materials reside physically on shelves or in the Depository, but patrons are unable to locate or retrieve them. Precious books, films, journals, documents, and other treasured resources are being lost.
In all library departments, students and temps provide valuable assistance to overworked permanent staff, but dependency on short-term staff actually creates more work. Although temporary workers seem low-cost, the amount of time permanent staff spend training them on sophisticated tasks, and checking and correcting their work, cancels out most or all of the savings. When a short-term worker leaves and is replaced, this process begins all over again.
Staffing shortages are also affecting circulation, with some departments reporting 30 percent staffing reductions since 2009. For smaller libraries, this often means that there is only one person on duty, and tasks like searching for missing items and preparing materials for transfer necessarily get set aside to help patrons. Staff regularly skip lunch and breaks, or work when they are sick, because there is no one else to cover for them.
Conservation technicians talk about how a deep understanding of their particular library’s collections allows them to know which of the rare, fragile materials need attention. Their unique expertise and cross-departmental relationships often enable them to repair items on the same day the work is requested. But as this skilled group becomes scarce, technicians struggle to maintain high levels of quality.
Librarians and assistants regularly work on projects that span departments and require advanced skills. Often these projects fall outside of official job descriptions, but they are vital to patrons’ efforts to carry out research, develop curricula, teach courses, and diagnose patients. If staffing levels are cut further or jobs are over-simplified, these critical functions will suffer.
No one person can claim to have the authoritative model for the great Library of the 21st century. But there is only one effective approach to such a major reorganizational effort: the process needs to be transparent and participatory. If the cautionary cries of library staff about severe understaffing and quality concerns are not heard and heeded, the Harvard Library Transition will not be successful.
One staff member sums up the urgency of the moment beautifully: “There is such a breadth and depth of knowledge within the library support staff that could easily be used to make the new Harvard Library a reality and a rousing success without cutting a single job. We are already at bare-bones staffing level in my library, and I hear the same thing from everyone I talk to. Don't fire us. You need us. Put us to work, give us new tasks, new ideas, new technology—we are knowledge junkies, we love drowning ourselves in books, media, anything containing the written or spoken word, and we can do anything you throw at us… I enjoy learning. For its own sake. That's what makes a librarian (or in my case, a library paraprofessional) tick. That's what I love. And I'm not alone, not by a long shot. Everyone I work with shares the same passion.”
Carrie Barbash, Alex Chisholm, and Bill Jaeger are organizers with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents close to half the Library workforce at Harvard. This piece was written with the assistance of unionized library staff and non-unionized librarians from across Harvard.

Although many departments have struggled with an inability to increase the size or diversity of their faculty in the years following the financial crisis, faculty searches in a few departments across the social sciences are indicators of early signs of recovery.
Most notably, the anthropology department filled three tenure-track positions this fall, its first new hires since the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced a freeze on searches in Nov. 2008. Department administrators are currently conducting a search for a professor with an expertise in post-Soviet Russia and plan to make a hire before the beginning of next academic year.
“We’re lucky that even in times of financial crisis, we have been able to hire,” Theodore C. Bestor, the anthropology department chair, said. “The department seems to be doing quite well.”
The ability to bring in new faculty members has constituted “a major transformation for such a small department,” Nestor said. The anthropology department currently has 22 faculty members, according to its website.
Anthropology Director of Undergraduate Studies Steven C. Caton said that, as a small department, anthropology has been “seriously understaffed” in the past few years, as older professors retired and the hiring freeze prevented replacement searches. Caton said he is currently teaching five classes and supervising the dissertations of 14 students.
“The social anthropology department in particular has been very short-handed,” Caton said. “The [FAS] dean’s office recognized this fact: there was a realization that they wouldn’t let the anthropology department wither on the vine.”
For Caton, this recent batch of hires is only the first step, as senior professors’ departures prompt new searches.
“We’re still understaffed,” Caton said. “You can’t set a magic number [of faculty hires].”
Still, many larger departments have found themselves playing catch-up after years of hiring freezes.
For example, the government department—which is the second largest undergraduate concentration—has shrunk from 50 to around 43 or 44 faculty members since the beginning of the financial crisis, government department Chair Timothy J. Colton said.
“FAS is committed to keeping things in a steady state,” Colton said. “There’s not going to be growth in FAS as a whole for a considerable period of time.”
Last year, FAS granted the government department one faculty search, but the position was not filled.
This year, the department was given three search mandates. So far, two assistant professors have accepted offers from the department, and a third offer is still pending.
But, with three senior faculty members set to retire by June 2013, government professors have said that these recent hires will not do enough to reduce the burden on the department’s faculty.
“We do have all our standing commitments to graduates and undergraduates covered, but it’s become difficult [to offer diverse course offerings],” Colton said.
Government Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch said that the department has often had to lean on visiting faculty or professors from other schools to teach its courses.
“A lot of our faculty are really stretched between their research and teaching,” Welch said. “Historically, these numbers creep up—it takes a while to recover.”
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said that the authorization to run a faculty search is only the first of many steps in the hiring process, further adding to the challenge of recovery. Levitsky said that the “whole set of political debates” within the department—ranging from which vacancies to fill first to the decision to extend offers to potential candidates—further complicate the process.
“The University has to give us a line, and we have to agree on who to take,” Levitsky said. “We have a lot of holes that we need to fill.”

Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and University President Drew G. Faust joined Allston-Brighton residents and local nonprofit leaders to recognize the nine recipients of Harvard Allston Partnership Fund grants on Friday.
The Partnership Fund, which has awarded approximately $400,000 to local non-profit organizations serving in Allston and North Brighton over the past four years, granted a total of approximately $100,000 to this years nine recipients.
The University and the Boston Redevelopment Authority created the fund in 2008 with a five-year, $500,000 endowment from Harvard.
This year, recipients—which ranged from adult education and after-school programming to country-side summer camps—were awarded a portion of the $100,000 dollars.
The West End House Camp, a 104-year-old non-profit summer camp in Maine, received $4,000 to fund eight two-week scholarships for boys from the Allston-Brighton community.
“Because of this grant, we can basically give these [low-income] boys a spot for free,” said Steve Lepler, the camp’s director. “This grant makes a major difference in the lives of many young people.”
The nine recipients were selected by a committee made up of local residents, city officials, and a Harvard affiliate.
Faust said that one of the program’s primary focuses was to “create opportunities for individuals.”
“These organizations are helping people to exceed expectations, helping people to create dreams,” she told the assembled crowd. “They are helping people set goals and then helping them reach those goals.”
The celebration comes as the University resumes planning for development in Allston.
In 2007, the University began construction on the Allston Science Complex, touted as a $1 billion mecca for stem cell research. But tensions grew between Harvard and neighborhood residents—who were excited by the job prospects and benefits the project would bring—when the University put construction on hold in 2009 due to financial constraints.
Menino said the event honored a fund that demonstrates Harvard’s commitment to improving the Allston-Brighton community.
“I think Harvard has been working hard with the community to make it a better place to live and a better place for people to raise their families,” he said.
The grant recipients also included the Charles River Conservancy, Family Nurturing Center of Massachusetts, Friends of the Honan-Allston Library, Gardner Pilot Academy, the Oak Square YMCA, The Fishing Academy, The Literacy Connection, and the Vocational Advancement Center.

Six and a half months after stepping down from his post at Harvard, Paul J. McLoughlin—former senior adviser to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds—was named the new Dean of Students at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Friday.
McLoughlin, who will begin his new job on July 1, was chosen for the position from a pool of four finalists.
McLoughlin said that Lafayette College was “the very perfect fit for me,” due to its small size, rigorous academic curriculum, and residential environment. He added that he expects to draw on his experiences at Harvard in his new position.
“Over the years at Harvard, I had the opportunity to listen to literally hundreds of students and to learn from them what matters most,” McLoughlin said. “I hope to listen and learn a lot in my first year [at Lafayette].”
After leaving his position as Hammonds’ right-hand man in mid-August, McLoughlin returned to Boston College, where he had completed his Ph.D. in higher education administration the previous spring, to teach graduate students and work on turning his dissertation into a book.
McLoughlin, whose research focuses on undergraduates at elite colleges who come from low-income families, said he hopes to help students thrive at Lafayette regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds.
When he left Harvard last August, McLoughlin told The Crimson that his experiences at the College “helped me focus on what I really enjoy doing and what I’ll seek in my next position—what I’m seeking now is certainly direct work with undergraduates, likely at a dean of students level, or a president level maybe eventually.”
During his time at Harvard, McLoughlin, now 37, rose through the ranks of the College’s administration at what many called a precocious pace.
He started at age 26, in 2001, as a counselor in the Office of Career Services. Two years later, he was promoted to assistant dean of student life.
When Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds began her tenure in 2008, she made McLoughlin her senior adviser and associate dean of the College.
McLoughlin’s tenure as Hammonds’ senior adviser was marked by the creation of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, the development of a structure for a five-week winter break, and expanded opening week programming for freshmen.
“Paul has great rapport with students,” said Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who worked closely with McLoughlin during his time at Harvard. “I think Paul recognizes that not to hear the students’ voice means that you’re working without adequate information and you’re not likely to be developing policies that will have any long-run success or staying power.”

Harvard Business School opened the doors of a new classroom last week—but instead of being located across the river, this time the classroom happens to be in Mumbai, India.
The new amphitheater-style classroom, which can seat up to 82 students, was modeled on the classrooms Business School students find in Boston. It will house the executive education programs the Business School already runs in India and replace the various temporary spaces the school has used previously.
“We wanted to create a historic space that maximized interaction, as opposed to conventional spaces that are more conductive to the lecture format that is more typical in India,” said Business School professor Tarun Khanna. “It’s been difficult to find the kind of space that facilitates interactive learning, of the sort we try to promote at HBS, so the new classroom is welcome.”
Khanna will be teaching in the classroom for the first time on Monday. His course is part of the executive education program and is entitled, “Building a Global Enterprise in India.”
The new center in Mumbai is the latest of the Business School’s international endeavors. The Business School has already opened regional centers in Europe, Latin America, India, China and Japan. According to Khanna, the new facility in Mumbai was a “natural evolution” following the creation of the Harvard Center Shanghai in  2008 to provide research support for faculty and to house similar executive education programming.
The Business School opened its India Research Center in Mumbai in 2005 and has run executive education programs in India for approximately six years.
“There’s incredible value in the expansion of business internationally, especially in emerging markets like India along with China,” Khanna said.
The classroom is located in a hotel owned by the Tata Group, a company headed by well-known Indian tycoon Ratan N. Tata, who is also a graduate of the Business School’s Advanced Management Program.
Tata donated $50 million to the Business School in 2010 to help fund the construction of Tata Hall. Tata’s donation was the largest gift from an international donor in the Business School’s history.
“India is capable of great things but we will only be able to realize our potential by continually studying and learning about what has succeeded here and elsewhere in the world,” said Tata in a statement. “Harvard Business School and Harvard University more broadly have a tremendous amount of knowledge to share in that endeavor.”
Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria has repeatedly emphasized the importance of India to the Business School’s global strategy.
“Our aspiration is to expand our intellectual footprint by working with business, government and academic leaders from across the country, all the while contributing to important discussions about India’s long-term economic growth,” Nohria said in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Future government concentrators will benefit from a strengthened advising program that will pair faculty members with undergraduates, following a set of reforms unanimously approved by the department faculty last Thursday.
The changes primarily affect students during their sophomore spring and junior fall semesters, when undergraduates are deciding their academic paths within the concentration. The reforms will roll out this fall and will begin with the class of 2015. Major changes include a research seminar requirement and increased opportunities to interact with professors directly through a new faculty mentorship program.
A committee of government faculty members that was created last September proposed the reforms. This committee studied data from exit surveys and worked with several student focus groups.
“We try to do a review of the undergraduate program every decade or so,” said government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who spearheaded the committee. “It was time to revisit our requirements.”
One of the primary changes to the department’s advising structure will be that the teaching fellows of the mandatory, spring-term sophomore tutorials will serve as advisers for their students. These teaching fellows, Levitsky said, currently undergo a competitive recruitment process and receive higher compensation than teaching fellows in other departments.
Further, sophomore students will be paired with faculty members to discuss “big picture interests” in one-on-one meetings, and juniors will be guaranteed faculty advisers for their theses if they apply through the government department, Levitsky said. These advising changes will supplement the current house-based advising system.
“We think we can do better with advising,” Government Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch said. She called the new teaching fellow advising system a “big innovation for sophomore year.”
Further, the government department will require students to take a seminar during their undergraduate career.
“Students who take seminars are usually happy with them,” Levitsky said. “It’s crazy that a student could graduate without taking a seminar.”
In addition to mandating that undergraduates enroll in a seminar, the reforms also dictate that students take a course focusing on quantitative and qualitative research methods of political science.
“We’ve debated for many years about the necessity of undergraduates being literate in political science,” Welch said. “We’re recommending that all government concentrators take Government 50: ‘Introduction to Political Science Research Methods’ or some sort of statistics course.”
Lastly, the department will compile a list of courses at the Harvard Kennedy School that qualify as government electives, simplifying the earlier process that required students to petition to take a course from outside the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“The undergraduate interest is often in the substance of politics,” Welch said.
She also noted that politics-related courses—such as Government 1540: “American Presidency,” which is offered jointly with the Kennedy School—are often popular with concentrators. The new list, Welch said, will be a “signaling and communication change” rather than an actual change in the relationship between the government department and the Kennedy School.
Both Levitsky and Welch acknowledged the challenges of meeting the demands for better advising from the government department, which is the second largest concentration in the College.
“We won’t be a cozy Slavic Studies department,” Welch said. There “has always shown a correlation between size of undergraduate program and satisfaction.”
Additionally, Welch said that the seminar requirement “does involve some challenges,” including scheduling seminars to accommodate universal enrollment.
But Levitsky said he is aware of the potential unpopularity of the reforms.
“One of the things that students love about government is its flexibility,” he said. “We’re making it less flexible. We’re imposing more requirements.”
But some undergraduate government concentrators were supportive of the ambitious reforms.
“Having a heavier quantitative emphasis will make the concentration a lot better,” government concentrator Brendan M. Fogarty ’12 said. “A lot of people graduate with a pretty poorly developed sense of quantitative reasoning.”
Greg A. Dibella ’12, who is a peer concentration counselor for the government department, also said that freshmen and sophomores are often “looking for a little more guidance.”
“I feel good about the upcoming changes,” Levitsky said. “The committee did its homework.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council has recently established several initiatives intended to increase communication between students and administrators, including a more transparent posting of deans’ office hours and a Lunch with a Dean series.
During a UC summit with administrators in January, Quincy House representative Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 asked Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, “Why is it so difficult for students to talk to administrators?” A lack of office hours and infrequent email communication made interaction scarce, Zhu said.
Hammonds thanked Zhu for her question but noted that she does in fact hold office hours.
“I didn’t even know that Dean Hammonds had office hours,” Zhu said. “This really made it obvious that we have a communication problem and that we need more direct interaction.”
Last week, administrators at the Office of Student Life posted their office hours on the OSL website. UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said that he saw this as a step toward improved administrative accessibility.
“We were pleasantly surprised at how receptive they were to our ideas and really engaging with students,” Bicknell said.
The UC is also currently organizing a Lunch with a Dean series, which will begin the week after spring break.
“We get to talk to these deans regularly by virtue of being on the UC,” said UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, who said she meets with Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson at least once a month. “But we wanted students to also have a chance to sit down with administrators and talk about the issues they are concerned about.”
Through the new UC program, up to 15 students will have the chance to sign up for a meal with two or three deans at one of the undergraduate dining halls every two weeks. A UC representative will facilitate the discussion.
“This is meant to be an informal, less intimidating way for students to speak to top College administrators and build relationships,” Yalamanchi said. “It’s always great to talk over a meal, because it comes with the realization that the other party is a person too.”

The darkening color of the peppered moth during the nineteenth century, often used by high school textbooks as a case study for adaptation, was confirmed as an accurate example of natural selection in a paper co-authored by a Harvard faculty member.
During the Industrial Revolution, English scientists noticed an increasing number of darker colored British peppered moths, an observation that has since been attributed to an adaptation to the soot-covered trees of the industrial era. As air quality improved in later decades, lighter colored moths regained their previous prevalence.
However, this finding garnered some controversy in the scientific community during the 1980s and 1990s, according to the paper’s co-author James Mallet, a lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
“It was just too good of a story, so scientists began looking for possible problems with it,” Mallet said.
The late Michael Majerus, a professor at University of Cambridge who was one of the first researchers to raise these concerns, set out on a six-year project to conduct experiments and make observations to improve on the previous work, according to Mallet’s paper. Using data from Majerus’ experiments, the paper evaluated the evolution of peppered moths.
“Majerus felt some of the experiments hadn’t been very well done, though he believed natural selection was the main factor that explained the change in color of peppered moths,” Mallet said.
Majerus utilized a random release procedure that allowed moths to land on branches and twigs in addition to the tree trunk itself. He also released the moths in smaller numbers and at night, according to the study.
“The peppered moth experiment is the biggest of its type,” Mallet said. “It was done in the most careful way that Michael Majerus, who is really an expert on the moths, could devise—and therefore it answers many of the possible criticisms that he and others had on the previous experiments.”
Mallet and three other professors from British universities used Majerus’ experimental data to write the paper that confirmed what most scientists have long accepted.
“With this new evidence added to the existing data, it is virtually impossible to escape the previously accepted conclusion that visual predation by birds is the major cause of rapid changes in frequency of melanic [dark] peppered moths,” the study reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite protests from within and outside of the University calling for the administration to cancel the One-State conference at the Harvard Kennedy School this weekend, panelists at the sold-out conference fired back at critics and advocated for the consideration of alternative solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Panels at the two-day conference examined the two-state approach, questioned how a one-state solution would work, and discussed obstacles to the realization of such a solution. Students and scholars packed into the Institute of Politics Forum to participate in the event, often challenging speakers with lengthy and detailed questions and comments.
Though critics of the conference anticipated the panelists would only present arguments for a one-state solution, attendees emphasized that the conference facilitated discussion and dialogue on varied possibilities.
The conference was organized by the Harvard groups Justice for Palestine, the Palestine Solidarity Committee, the Palestine Caucus, the Arab Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, and the Alliance for Justice in the Middle East.
In the weeks leading up to the conference, a number of groups and individuals came out in opposition to the event, inciting controversy about the nature of the discussion of a one-state solution and the issue of free speech.
On Friday, U.S. Senator Scott Brown called on Harvard to cancel the conference, the Boston Globe reported. He condemned the University for endorsing a “misguided idea,” according to the Globe.
A petition also circulated within the Jewish community calling on Harvard to disavow all affiliation with the conference. In response to the petition, conference organizers and speakers wrote a letter in defense of the event to University President Drew G. Faust and Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75.
As panels debated the merits of a one-state solution indoors, protesters from a local group called Christians and Jews United for Israel stood outside holding signs that said “Shame on Harvard, Haven for Jewish Hatred.”
Despite the protests, the event proceeded smoothly and remained unaffected by the opinions of some of its opponents, said Kennedy School student Ahmed Moor, an organizer of the conference.
Panels included discussion about issues of nationhood and cultural identity, the building a global movement, and the history of violence between Palestinians and Israelis. During some of the events, panelists responded directly to critics accusing them of promoting a one-sided dialogue.
Lena K. Awwad ’13 volunteered to work at the event with two other students from the Palestine Solidarity Committee, which co-sponsored the event.
Awwad said she has been involved with planning the conference for nearly a year, and was pleased with its outcome.
“Many people expected the conference to have one specific idea, but [the panelists] brought forth very different perspectives on a one state solution,” she said.
Tess M. Waggoner, a student at Kenyon College who traveled to Harvard specifically to attend the conference, echoed Awwad’s sentiments.
“I think if any protesters showed up and spoke to people here they would get many different opinions and none of them would be hateful,” she said.
Though Hillel president Sara Kantor ’14 did not attend the event, she did not agree with the manner in which the conference was presented.
“Harvard’s name has a certain power and it seemed to be presented as a Harvard one-state conference,” Kantor, who is also a Crimson arts writer, said. “It lends a certain legitimacy that this conference didn’t necessarily have.”
At the end of the conference, Moor said that the goal of the discussion was not to promote animosity between two groups, but to focus on the provision of human rights and equality at all times.
“This conference has been about what to do about reconciling between two peoples who deserve better,” Moor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics has launched a series of technology initiatives to create a more unified online community and to integrate technology with services and programs that the IOP already provides.
The IOP has created a new JFK Jr. Forum microsite and a IOP public service database online this spring, in addition to utilizing iTunes and YouTube to publicize events.
The microsite aims to be a cleaner, user-friendly site for current Forum events. It also offers access to the archived recordings of Forum events in an easier-to-view format.
“Our hope is that we can broaden the audience to the forum beyond [its] capacity,” said  C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, director of the IOP. “[We want] to have something for people around the world who might otherwise be interested in the content but cannot be at the Forum,” adding that the microsite also targets undergraduates and other Harvard affiliates who may have been unable to attend.
In addition to the microsite, the IOP has made Forum event footage available on iTunes and a YouTube channel to reach out to regular users of those sites.
“We don’t really have a preference [for what people use],” Grayson said. “We’re not trying to drive people to our site—we want people to view the forums in wherever it is easiest for them.”
Ibrahim A. Khan ’14, the Forum committee chair, will work with the Forum team to create video recaps of events that include clips of highlights for students to view afterwards, according to Grayson.
The IOP also debuted a new Public Service Job and Internship database, which expands the range of public service opportunities currently offered through the Office of Career Services’ system.
The database—which was launched this semester—focuses primarily on opportunities for undergraduates.
“We really thought we could bring something to help complement public service opportunities that the University offers, particularly for undergraduates—to give them that first chance,” said Kara M. Minar, director of career services at the IOP. “In public service it is a lot more difficult to get that first job, to get that toe in the door,” Minar said.
With 336 jobs and internships currently available, the database operates independently from the OCS jobs database. The IOP reached out to various alumni and former fellows to build up the database, with listings ranging from federal and local government positions to political journalism and think tank jobs.
Minar said she hopes that the database, along with the IOP’s career advising and panel opportunities, will attract students who would not necessarily think they fit in the traditional public service sector mold.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the more than 60 figures portrayed in the art of Annenberg Hall, three are women—two of whom are tending to children, while the third welcomes her warrior husband home to a life of domestic tranquility.
The pattern is replicated throughout Harvard—of the approximately 750 oil paintings that hang throughout the campus, about 690 of them feature white males. From marble busts to stained glass, Harvard’s art collection is stunningly grand and yet remarkably homogenous.
However, the long reign of this patriarchal portraiture may now be in jeopardy, thanks to the efforts of a professor determined to shake up the composition of Harvard’s male-dominated collection.
Jane J. Mansbridge, who has been a professor at the Kennedy School since 1996, is intimately familiar with issues of gender disparity at the Kennedy School, and has been a staunch advocate for women over the years through groups such as the Women and Public Policy Program at HKS. Mansbridge will serve as president of the American Political Science Association this coming year, which is among the highest honors in her profession.
But more recently, she has spearheaded a movement to add female faces to Harvard’s extensive art collection.
Because of Mansbridge’s elbow grease, a portrait of Ida B. Wells—an African-American journalist and early civil rights activist—now hangs in the Fainsod Room at the Kennedy School.
The portrait was commissioned in 2006 and cost $20,000. Then-president Lawrence H. Summers approved the request to use the president’s fund to cover the expense.
“Things like portraits on a wall can have real effects on people’s behavior,” says Mansbridge. “John Bargh and other psychologists of automaticity show these effects can be unconscious—if you’re in a room where all the portraits are of white males, you’re being primed to think that white males run everything.”
At the Kennedy School in particular, the gender imbalance among the faculty has been extreme for some time. Women make up just 19 percent of the senior faculty and 27 percent of the junior faculty at HKS, according to the 2011 annual report by Office of Faculty Development and Diversity.
While initiatives such as WAPPP have encouraged female students to seek careers in politics and public service, the gender ratio of the faculty is indicative of deeply ingrained inequalities that have historically kept women out of both government and portrait halls alike.
In conjunction with Mansbridge’s presidency of APSA, and the increased emphasis on gender equality and education at the Kennedy School, the timely addition of these portraits marks a step toward healing the gender rift that has plagued women in politics for so long.
POWERFUL PIGMENTS
When painter Stephen E. Coit ’71 read a Harvard Gazette article in 2003 announcing the allocation of funds for new portraits, he jumped at the chance to contribute to the diversification of Harvard’s collection.
Since 2003, Coit has painted over a dozen portraits of underrepresented leaders throughout history.
“When I was in Lowell House back in the late sixties, diversity was whether a portrait showed one hand or two,” says Coit.
Coit notes the significance of the portrait of Rulan C. Pian, a former professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and Music, that now hangs in Cabot House. “It makes a strong statement to anyone who sees it, which is that she was a woman of Asian heritage, and that she made a contribution to Harvard,” Coit says.
The portrait of Pian was the result of an initiative launched in 2002 by S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation. The Harvard Foundation received $100,000 from Summers to fund its Minority Portraiture Project, which commissions portraits of underrepresented members of the Harvard community. Former Dean Archie C. Epps III and former Director of the Bureau of Study Counsel Kiyo Morimoto are among those that Coit has painted.
While the Harvard Foundation has focused on diversifying portraiture more generally, Mansbridge has focused her efforts on the inclusion of women.
In addition to Ida B. Wells, Mansbridge has overseen the commissioning of a portrait of Abigail Adams. A potential portrait of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is being discussed. Sirleaf received a Masters of Public Administration from the Kennedy School in 1971 and served as last year’s commencement speaker.
Mansbridge says that at times it has been difficult to secure funding for the project. Because the Kennedy School has fewer discretionary funds than other schools, Mansbridge has had to rely on the president’s fund and the Women’s Leadership Board of the Kennedy School.
“Students from the Kennedy School go out and try to make the world a better place, which is not always a lucrative thing to do, so money for these projects can be tight,” says Mansbridge.
RECASTING GENDER ROLES
The obvious lack of women in Harvard’s art is largely paralleled in the makeup of its current faculty.
Part of the gender imbalance is due to the fact that women have long been deterred from entering fields that are perceived as more “masculine” than others, according to Mansbridge.
For example, international relations is an area that has long been dominated by men. But just as Harvard’s walls are being shaken up by women, so is the field of international diplomacy.
“International affairs are no longer just state to state, and diplomacy is no longer just men in ties sitting around mahogany tables,” says Cathryn A. Clüver, executive director of the Future of Diplomacy Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
In her tenure as president of APSA, Mansbridge said she hopes to redefine and diversify disciplines such as international relations and political economy—a field where all 10 tenured HKS faculty members are men.
“If you define international relations in the old way—when it was thought of as ‘bombs and bullets’—you’re going to get a predominantly male field of applicants,” says Mansbridge. “But if you open it up and make it more about human rights, you’re going to attract more women.”
Nicole Carter Quinn, associate director for finance and administration at the WAPPP, says that the art initiative plays a critical role in both recognizing the values of women leaders and broadening attitudes about women in traditionally male-dominated sectors of politics.
“Jenny [Mansbridge] is someone who really embodies the mission of the Kennedy School, which is ‘ask what you can do,’” says Quinn.  “She’s worked tirelessly to make change and get some deserving women on our walls.”
THE OBSTACLES OF TRADITION
While issues of perception are part of the problem, recruitment presents an even bigger challenge.
Constructing a recruitment process that does not favor men in any way is much easier said than done. But as HKS becomes more aware of the complex factors that define applicant pools, it has adapted its mechanisms for fighting gender imbalance accordingly.
“Faculty selection processes should always be meritocratic, but it’s hard to do it right,” says Iris Bohnet, academic dean of the Kennedy School and director of the WAPPP.
Bohnet describes the need for “gender equality nudges,” such as hiring in bunches rather than sequentially, that lead to more effective consideration of employee diversity. She points out that no process is perfect, but that collecting more data will ultimately allow the school to refine its practices to assemble a more balanced faculty.
“Quantitative research will teach us how to close these gaps,” Bohnet says.
Mansbridge emphasized the importance of using objective metrics to ensure an even playing field.
“We know from the research that women do quite well in meritocratic processes, provided they’re not discriminated against for having children,” says Mansbridge.
Word-of-mouth recruitment methods often lead to the exclusion of marginalized groups, she says. “We have to make sure the channels are open in more than just old-boy network ways.”
For instance, Mansbridge says she supports reaching out to the military, which is famously meritocratic, as a way to draw women into fields in which it is often difficult to find female candidates.
“The challenge is working out a structured way of casting a broader net, and we have not yet figured out a way to do that very well,” says Mansbridge.
THE ART EFFECT
The nitty-gritty of recruitment aside, the new portraits of women have been most impactful in their psychological effects on the community and its institutional memory.
“These portraits are about changing the images of success that we have in our head, given the history that we have,” says Bohnet.
The portraits have also served as a source of inspiration to the current generation of up-and-coming politicians.
“This project is really exciting,” says Jenny Ye ’13, president of the Institute of Politics. “At Harvard we see portraits everywhere, and for women it’s encouraging to see that leadership is a lot more diverse than what’s hanging on the walls.”
Perhaps the most poignant product of this new portraiture is an oil painting of former professor Edith M. Stokey, who passed away this past January. Considered the “founding mother” of HKS, Stokey was a trailblazer for women at the Kennedy School and left behind a legacy of compassion and public service.
Her portrait, unveiled in 2008, now hands outside the office of the Dean.
“Portraits should try to say something inspiring to future generations,” says Coit. “That’s the point of all of this, and that’s what we’re trying to accomplish through art.”

After successful pilot programs last summer, the College’s two new summer research programs—the Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences and the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations—have expanded their undergraduate research opportunities in the social sciences and business for the summer of 2012.
Modeled after the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering, the ten-week summer programs were originally launched in June 2011.
BLISS allowed undergraduates to conduct research with professors in fields spanning sociology, psychology, and statistics, while PRIMO connected students with Harvard Business School faculty in areas ranging from behavioral economics to innovation management. Applications for the program were due Feb. 27, and participants will be informed by the end of the month.
The success of the pilot programs has encouraged program administrators and faculty to expand the programs, according to Gregory A. Llacer, director of the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives.
“This is definitely something that Harvard undergraduates want—the ability to connect with Harvard faculty. We are definitely looking at an [increase] in interest from faculty, with a broader array of projects being offered this year,” Llacer said.
Former BLISS participant Esther S. Wu ’13 echoed Llacer’s sentiments, expressing support for the expansion of the programs.
“It was great to do research with experienced professors that really watched out for us, taught us, and helped us grow.” Wu said. “I hope to see BLISS and PRIMO grow bigger in the future years.”
Fellow BLISS participant Gregory Yang ’14 praised the structures of the programs, which encouraged students to engage with faculty in cutting-edge research and organized social activities for participants outside of their research commitments.
Llacer and other program administrators plan to maintain the formats of the programs so that participants this year can continue to enjoy the benefits of comprehensive summer research programs.
“The fellows and faculty seemed pretty much happy with it, so we will not make any particular substantial changes,” Llacer said. “The model seems to work.”
Christopher E. Hernandez ’13, who worked at Professor Jason P. Mitchell’s Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab through BLISS last summer, agrees changes are unnecessary.
“I would not change a single thing about BLISS,” Hernandez said. “It became the perfect combination of important social sciences research that made you feel you were hard at work and exciting student interactions that allowed one to still feel like he or she was on summer vacation.”

The Harvard men’s basketball team will certainly be glued to a TV screen on Tuesday night, watching the game that may just determine the fate of its season: Penn versus Princeton. The Crimson clinched at least a share of the Ivy League title with Saturday night’s victory over Cornell, but the last time Harvard basketball tried this whole sharing-the-title thing, it didn’t work out so well.
If Princeton defeats Penn on Tuesday, Harvard wins the Ivy League title outright and clinches a spot in the tournament for the first time since 1946. But if Penn defeats Princeton, the Crimson splits the title once again and will have to compete in a one-game playoff for the league’s automatic bid.
We’ll go out on a limb here and say that the three rules of real estate—location, location, location—apply to Ivy basketball as well. At the moment, it’s not clear who would host the potential playoff, though Yale, Columbia and other New York schools are all possible hosts because of their central locations.
Unlike last year, New Haven has been kind to Harvard basketball this season, and in the Crimson’s trip only in 2012, Harvard was dominant in a 30-point win over Yale.
Then again, if it’s in New York, we might get yet another Jeremy Lin ’10 sighting.
Where would we really like to see the game played? The Bahamas. Namely because we selfishly want an excuse for an exotic spring break vacation. But for the sake of the team, the Crimson is a perfect 3-0 the Atlantis basketball arena (well, ballroom), taking the Battle 4 Atlantis title over Thanksgiving.
We’re not putting a lot of hope into this whole Atlantis idea. But even with a five-hour flight, thousands of dollars in travel, and overpriced resort food, it still beats the hell out of New Haven.

The last time New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin ’10 and Boston Celtics Rajon Rondo and Paul Pierce shared a court was in November, at Lin’s collegiate home hardwood during the Boston Charity Classic. Lin and the Celtics stars joined other NBA players at Lavietes Pavilion in a charity contest for a friendly game at the height of the NBA lockout.
Sunday’s meeting was less amicable. Rondo guarded Lin in an overtime 115-111 win for the Celtics, and the Boston point guard posted a triple-double. The Harvard alum ran into foul trouble early and shot poorly in the first half but still scored 14 points.
Lin’s introduction to the crowd at TD Garden was met with a loud but mixed reaction. Even with the hype coming in, Lin was taken out after just three minutes after two quick fould.
Lin managed only two points in the first half, turning the ball over four times in that span. But the Harvard grad put together a much better performance in the third and fourth quarters, tallying 12 after halftime, including a three-pointer with two minutes remaining in the game to pull the Knicks within a point of the lead.
In overtime, Lin had difficulty driving to the basket, missing two layups and having a third blocked by Celtics big man Brandon Bass.
A handful of Harvard-clad fans were in attendance to complement the increasingly popular blue No. 17 Jeremy Lin jerseys. But despite Linsanity, some Celtics fans from Harvard had little trouble staying loyal.
Asked if he found himself rooting for Crimson legend Lin at Sunday’s matchup, self-described diehard Celtics fan Jon Rosenthal ’15 left no doubt as to his loyalty.
“Of course not. He’s a Knick,” Rosenthal said. “I’m not a sellout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW  YORK, N.Y.—Just over five minutes into the second half of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s crucial contest at Columbia Friday night, the sold-out crowd at Levien Gymnasium erupted into a standing ovation. But it wasn’t one of Lions’ junior point guard Brian Barbour’s nine field goals—or even one of four Harvard dunks—that ignited the lively crowd, but rather a sighting of Jeremy Lin ’10 in the stands.
Lin wasn’t the only famous face in the crowd, as renowned film director and adamant Knicks fan Spike Lee also found himself in Levien Gymnasium a few seats over from the point guard of his NBA team of choice.
“I know [Harvard] coach [Tommy] Amaker,” Lee said. “I said, ‘You guys play Columbia yet?’ He said, ‘No.’ So I said, ‘Send me tickets and I’ll come to the game.’ Simple as that, my first Harvard game ever. I live in New York and this is the first time I’ve been to this gym.”
According to Lee, Lin’s presence on the NBA stage has helped make a name for Harvard basketball.
“Jeremy Lin is elevating the brand,” said Lee, who was spotted wearing Lin’s Harvard jersey at the Knicks game on Feb. 19. “You get a Harvard jersey on the court, you get respect no matter where you are anymore.”
Celebrity sightings aside, there was no shortage of excitement Friday night, as Columbia took Harvard to its lone overtime of the season and first extra minutes since Feb. 4, 2011, when the Crimson dropped Penn at the Palestra, 83-82, in double overtime.
“We talk to our kids all the time about this type of game and atmosphere and crowd,” Amaker said. “All this season, we’ve been in a lot of tough, hard-fought games, and we’ve found ways to win most of them.”
Columbia lost its shooting stride during the game’s final stretch, scoring just 22.2 percent and 33.3 percent from three, allowing Harvard—which shot 60 percent from the field—to sail to a comfortable seven-point lead after five minutes of extra time, capturing the victory, 77-70.
“We just started hitting some shots,” junior forward Kyle Casey said. “They changed their defense to a zone, and we were a little stagnant when we first started attacking it. In overtime, they stayed in it to start, and we moved the ball pretty effectively and got some open shots which broke the game open a little bit.”
BARBOUR SHOP
On the Lions’ side of things, one player was instrumental in keeping the game close: Barbour.
The point guard—who averages a team-best 15.5 points per game—had six points in the first half on 2-for-7 shooting, but exploded in the second to finish the game with 23.
“[Barbour] is so hard to guard off the dribble,” Amaker said. “He’s so crafty and slithery and he makes plays. I thought they had an outstanding team performance, and I thought he led the way in so many ways.”
Another big-time contributor for Columbia was rookie center Cory Osetkowski, who came off the bench to score 10 points on four-for-eight shooting from the field along with one steal and two assists.
Osetkowski led an impressive effort from the Lions’ bench, which outscored their Harvard counterparts, 21-15, on the night.
The Columbia offense capitalized on 13 Harvard turnovers, scoring 24 points off of Harvard’s mishaps to keep the game within range despite an impressive 56.3 percent shooting night from the Crimson.
INSIDE-OUT
Harvard’s post play was instrumental in the beginning of the game, as the Crimson netted 18 of its 34 first-half points in the paint, outscoring Columbia by an eight-point margin in the category. The Crimson finished the game with a whopping 40 points inside.
“The game plan was just to attack, and a lot of penetration was open today,” Casey said. “I think we just took the opportunity and executed and finished well around the paint.”
Perhaps not surprisingly, after the first half, the forwards, co-captain Keith Wright, freshman Wes Saunders, and Casey, led the team from the interior with seven, seven, and six points, respectively. Casey and Wright finished the game with 19 and 16, as Harvard’s post play pushed the team to its first victory of the weekend.
“We hope our post players can be efficient like they were this evening,” Amaker said. “That certainly makes for our offense. Everything is geared toward that, for us to play inside out. [Casey and Wright] did an outstanding job of finishing around the rim and being a presence.”
But in the second period—and especially in overtime—Harvard shifted its focus to rely more on outside shooting. The Crimson attempted just three shots from deep during the entire first half, netting two of those attempts and went two for seven in the second half. In overtime, Harvard matched its first-half total, knocking down two of its three three-pointers.
Casey in particular had a strong night shooting. The junior made both of his three-point attempts on the way to a 7-for-11 mark from the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team concluded its five-game season-opening trip to Florida on a sour note, falling, 4-2, in Sunday’s finale of the 2012 USF Under Armour Invitational to tournament host University of South Florida. After winning its first two games Friday, the Crimson left the 17-team invitational, held at Eddie C. Moore Complex in Clearwater, Fla., at 2-3 overall after dropping its final three contests.
“We looked at the competition, and everyone was close,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We could have lost all five games, and we could have won all five games.”
SOUTH FLORIDA 4, HARVARD 2
The Bulls (14-3) took control of Sunday’s game early, scoring a run in each of the first two innings off Harvard sophomore Laura Ricciardone before tacking on two more in the fourth.
The Crimson’s (2-3) offense was limited throughout by USF sophomore Sara Nevins, who tallied eight strikeouts and allowed only one earned run in 6 2/3 innings of work.
Harvard did have its chances against Nevins, loading the bases with no outs in the fifth inning before Nevins struck out three consecutive batters to retire the side. In the sixth inning, the Crimson’s first two hitters again reached base safely but did not advance beyond second base, as Nevins worked her way out of another tight spot.
Harvard added a consolation run in the seventh inning, but the final result was never in doubt.
“We had very high expectations going into this weekend, and I don’t think we met those,” co-captain pitcher Rachel Brown said. “There’s a lot of room for improvement, but there were a lot of positive things that we saw as well. We were hitting the ball well, just right at players.”
“We created a lot of opportunities for ourselves [this weekend], which is really exciting, but we left [37] runners on base,” Allard said. “What we need to do next weekend is begin to capitalize on some of those opportunities.”
MIAMI (OHIO) 2, HARVARD 1
In its second contest Saturday afternoon, Harvard fell, 2-1, in extra innings to Miami (Ohio).
The two teams were at a stalemate for most of the game; Brown carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning, and the Crimson lineup did not record more than one hit in any inning. With no runs scored by either team in the first seven frames, the contest continued into extra innings.
Senior shortstop Jane Alexander’s RBI single in the top of the eighth looked to be a game-winner for Harvard, given the manner in which Brown had shut down the RedHawks (1-4) over the previous seven frames. But Miami managed to rally in the bottom half of the inning, tying the game on a wild pitch before claiming the victory with a walk-off single by Shanyn McIntyre.
“It was a game where we had a lot of opportunities, but things didn’t fall our way,” Brown said. “It was the most frustrating of the five games. Things didn’t quite click for us. We were getting a lot of runners on base, but we weren’t stringing rallies together.”
WESTERN MICHIGAN 3, HARVARD 1
Despite jumping out to an early lead, the Crimson could not sustain its offensive production, ultimately suffering a 3-1 defeat to Western Michigan (4-7) early Saturday afternoon.
Alexander’s RBI single in the third inning put Harvard ahead, 1-0, but the Crimson was unable to hold its advantage for long. The Broncos scored two runs in the bottom of the fourth inning and added another in the fifth, assuming a lead they never relinquished. Western Michigan pitcher Meredith Whitney then quieted the Crimson’s bats, allowing just two hits the rest of the game.
HARVARD 2, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 0
Keyed by a strong pitching performance from Ricciardone, Harvard continued its early success Friday with a 2-0 win over Loyola Marymount (13-8).
A pair of two-out singles from sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange and sophomore catcher Allison Scott put the Crimson on the scoreboard in the fourth inning before sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson singled in Alexander in the seventh to put Harvard up two runs.
It was all the cushion Ricciardone needed on her way to recording the team’s first shutout of the season.
HARVARD 2, TOLEDO 1
In its opening game of the year, the Crimson secured a 2-1 victory over Toledo (4-10) behind timely hitting and a solid outing from Brown.
The Rockets’ Lindsey Tobias tied the game up in the fourth inning with an RBI single, but Olson mustered an immediate response with an RBI single in the bottom half of the inning. Brown was able to protect the lead on the mound and earned her first win of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a brief, one-year lapse in national titles, the two highest individual honors in college squash once again belong to Harvard athletes.
Sophomore Ali Farag and freshman Amanda Sobhy—both newcomers to the Crimson this season—secured the men’s and women’s CSA Individual Championships, respectively, this weekend at the Alumni Gymnasium in Amherst, Mass.
And the matchups were not very close, as Farag and Sobhy sweept five straight opponents, 3-0, on their way to the Pool Trophy and Ramsay Cup, respectively.
“I think that they are probably the two strongest players ever to play in college squash,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “Definitely Amanda is. Some might disagree on the male side, because there have been some other very strong players. But there’s never been a male player as dominant and exciting as Ali…and there’s no one probably close to Amanda’s level.”
In the finals of the women’s national individual championship, the undefeated Sobhy took down the defending individual champion, Yale’s Millie Tomlinson, 11-5, 11-7, 11-7—Sobhy’s closest match of the season.
“Sometimes when you go through matches and they’re too one-sided, once you go up against someone closer to your level, you’re too used to winning rallies easily,” Way said. “Millie’s a good squash player, but the challenge was mostly inside Amanda’s head.”
In her first four matchups of the weekend, no player was able to capture more than four points in a single game, as Sobhy tore through the competition on her way to the Ramsay Division championship.
“Obviously, I’m happy to win the intercollegiate title,” Sobhy said. “My opponent [in the final match] played really well, and I was glad I got through it 3-0.”
Farag followed suit just one hour after Sobhy captured her CSA individual title, downing Columbia’s Ramit Tandon in a three-game match in the finals of the Pool Cup.
“[Ali] is a very exciting player with a beautiful touch and a lot of deception,” Way said. “His opponent plays a similar style…. It was beautiful squash, and hats off to both players. It was the most exciting finals that has ever been played.”
Farag nearly dropped the first game, just edging Tandon in extra points, 12-10. But the Crimson sophomore transfer student took the next two games with increasing ease, wearing down his opponent en route to 11-8 and 11-4 wins, respectively.
“The first game was very tight,” Way said. “It was a very close game, and Ali almost lost.”
Tandon entered the Pool Trophy’s final matchup with Farag on the heels of a win over defending national champion Todd Harrity of Princeton, 3-0, while Farag handled Trinity’s Vikram Malhotra by the same score in his semifinal.
With the wins this past weekend, Farag and Sobhy became the first pair of Harvard squash players to secure both CSA Individual Championship titles the same year since then-freshman Laura Gemmell and Colin West ’10 completed the feat in 2010.
But although Sobhy and Farag spearheaded the Crimson effort in Princeton,  N.J., Harvard sent a total of 13 athletes to the championships this past weekend.
One of those 13 squash players was sophomore Tommy Mullaney, who lit up the courts as a freshman, earning an 8-1 record at the No. 7 spot by the end of last year’s regular season. But despite success as a rookie, Mullaney underwhelmed for most of his sophomore campaign. Mullaney got back to his winning ways this weekend, taking home the second round consolation final of the Molloy Division.
“[Mullaney] lost his game for few months but it came back for the last few weeks,” Way said. “He was just superb. It was the Tommy of old, and he played brilliant squash.”
Freshman Haley Mendez represented well for the women’s team, taking Tomlinson to five games in the Ramsey Division second round before eventually falling, 9-11, 11-5, 11-3, 9-11, 11-6.
“She played the most perfect game of squash and was very close to beating [Millie],” Way said. “Friday night was the match of the tournament for her and a highlight from the point of view from how well she played.”
After dropping her match to Tomlinson, Mendez went on to win two more matches, including a 3-0 takedown of teammate Nirasha Guruge, 11-7, 11-9, 11-8.
“[Mendez] improved a lot over the course of the season,” Sobhy said. “She was very dedicated all season and has been training hard. She played really well over the weekend.”
After this weekend, Harvard—which boasts a slew of sophomores and freshmen in top positions—has secured four of the six major championships in college squash: both national individual titles, coupled with the women’s Ivy and national team titles. And this recent success bodes well for the still-young Crimson squads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 5, 2012, at 9:05 p.m.
After commencing day two of competition with a promising 27-point lead, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (6-2, 6-0 Ivy) sank to second place behind No. 24 Princeton (8-0, 7-0) in the 2012 Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championships, held this weekend held at Princeton.
The Tigers seized this year’s title with 1,523.5 points, while the Crimson trailed in second place (1,446). Columbia claimed third (1,107.5), followed by Yale (966.5), Dartmouth (764.5), Penn (756), Brown (596.5), and Cornell (575.5).
“We swam well. We just came up a little short,” sophomore Chris Satterthwaite said.
This weekend’s result represented Princeton’s fourth consecutive season title and Harvard’s four straight second-place finish.
The Lions posted their greatest point total ever in the championship meet, earning their third straight third-place finish. And the Big Green had its best result since 1981, coming in fifth.
Starting the championship the same way they would finish, the Crimson and the Tigers took turns leading the 200-yard free relay.
Yet just as in the meet, Princeton edged ahead of Harvard, as the Tigers touched the wall first at 1:18.92, winning the event for the fourth consecutive year and swimming the second fastest time in meet history.
The Crimson team—composed of Satterthwaite and classmate Oliver Lee and freshmen Griffin Schumacher and Zachary Walters—trailed by less than a half of a second (1:19.17) while Columbia took third, clocking in at 1:20.49.
“The relays were an area that we were a little weak in, but we knew that coming into the meet,” Satterthwaite said.
In the 500 free, Princeton’s Paul Noelle won his first of three events of the weekend, clocking in at 4:18.92. Yale’s Rob Harder followed with a time of 4:20.66, and Columbia’s Dominik Koll finished third (4:21.68).
In the one-meter dive, Harvard freshman Michael Mosca earned the title with a mark of 359.55 points. Princeton’s Stephen Vines came in a close second (347.65), and Penn senior Jeff Cragg took third.
The Tigers won the final event of the night by logging a DeNunzio Pool and meet record in the 400 medley relay with a time of 3:11.38.
But the Crimson finished the day in the lead, 27 points ahead of the Tigers, 471-444. With 289 points, the Bulldogs trailed both teams by more than one hundred points.
In day two of the meet, several pool and meet records were shattered, as the Princeton men stole the lead.
The Tigers opened the day with their third consecutive win in the 200 medley relay and set an Ivy League, meet, and pool record with a time of 1:25.89. Their nearest opponents, Harvard and Yale, battled for second and third, with the Crimson edging out the Bulldogs.
Later that day, Brown posted first- and second-place finishes in the 100 fly when sophomore Tommy Glenn clocked in at 46.73 and freshman Jeffrey Strausser followed narrowly with a time of 47.87.
Glenn’s first-place finish represented the Bears’ first Ivy title in the event in more than a decade.
In the third and final night of the meet, Noelle once again came out on top, winning the 1650 free and earning his third title in as many nights with a pool record of 15:00.16 to extend the Princeton lead.
First-place Harvard finishes in the 100 free and the 400 free relay cut the deficit to 35.5 points and placed the Crimson within striking distance of the Tigers.
But Princeton victories in the three-meter dive, the 200 back, and the 200 breaststroke allowed the Tigers to fend off Harvard and sustain its winning streak.
Princeton closed out the night ahead by a margin of 76.5 points and claimed sole ownership of the 2012 Ivy League title.
“We need to find a way to score a few more points as a team, but all in all it was a nice effort this weekend,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Though the Crimson fell short of first place, it had several impressive performances, securing four first-place individual finishes and setting six new school records.
Satterthwaite furthered Harvard’s campaign, achieving three Ivy League titles in the 50 free, 100 free, and 200 free, meriting a share of the Phil Moriarty Award, given to the meet’s top point-earning swimmer.
“[Earning the award] was definitely something I did not expect going into the meet," said Satterthwaite, who shared the honor with Princeton's Noelle and Jonathan Christensen, who each earned three titles. "I continued to swim well this year.... And it worked out."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After handily defeating No. 10 St. Lawrence twice earlier in the season by a combined score of 13-2, the No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey couldn’t solve the Saints on Friday night, falling in a 2-1 overtime loss in the semifinal of the ECAC tournament at Cornell’s Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y.
“Both times we played them it was very early on in the season,” junior Josephine Pucci said. “We knew that they were a different team, and they knew they were a different team…. It was a new day.”
St. Lawrence (24-9-2, 15-6-2 ECAC), the eventual ECAC champion, was able to slow Harvard’s (22-9-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) highflying offense, which had scored 18 times in its previous four contests, including nine goals in a sweep over Princeton in the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament last weekend.
“Normally in those big games you’re going to see low scoring games with defense coming up big,” Pucci said. “We did our best to shut [St. Lawrence] down, and we had some great backchecking from the forwards. And I think St. Lawrence did the same thing.”
Both teams were close to adding several more goals but came up short.
“There were probably four posts for both teams and a couple inches here could have made it a much different game,” junior Jillian Dempsey said. “We definitely had three posts that I can think of for us. If those went in, who knows what the outcome would have been.”
The Saints were also able to limit the Crimson offense to one power-play goal out of seven attempts. Harvard killed all three St. Lawrence’s power play.
Defense reigned supreme in the first period, as neither team was able to get on the board despite five power-play chances between the two squads. The Crimson held the edge in shooting, 9-7.
The Saints controlled play in the opening second frame, peppering Harvard goalie Laura Bellamy with shots but only managing to score one goal, the first of the game, on an unassisted effort by junior Kelly Sabatine.
The Crimson countered with a Dempsey goal assisted by Pucci and freshman Sarah Edney. Pucci’s shot the puck from the point was blocked, but Edney was able to get the rebound and found Dempsey, who put the puck away.
Harvard looked poised to grab the lead in the third period, outshooting the Saints, 10-4. St Lawrence goalie Carmen MacDonald held off the Crimson surge and helped kill both Crimson power plays, forcing the 1-1 contest into overtime.
“I wished we could have scored another power-play goal,” Pucci said. “I think that would have made a big difference in the course of the game, but St. Lawrence did a great job on the [penalty kill], and we couldn’t get through that tightly packed unit.”
In overtime, the Saints dominated possession, and Sabatine sealed the win with a goal 3:14 into the overtime frame.
With the victory, St. Lawrence advanced to the conference finals, where it later topped Cornell to earn the ECAC title.
The loss to the Saints proved to be a season-ending defeat for the Crimson, as the team failed to earn a berth in the NCAA tournament.
“Overall it was a very fun season,” Pucci said. “But when it comes down to it, you want to win a championship.  I think there were a lot of positives and now knowing it’s over, we hopefully have a chance to look at those positives and build on them.”
Dempsey added similar sentiments about the game and the season.
“We fought hard, and we had a hell of a season,” Dempsey said. “We really thought we were going to win, and we knew our season was on the line. We wanted to keep playing hockey this year so, now we are done, the season is over. And I think that’s what hurts the most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have been Junior Parents Weekend for Harvard, but the Harvard women’s water polo team also found extra fan support from the many visiting freshman, sophomore, and senior parents who also came to support the team this weekend as it hosted the Harvard Invitational at Blodgett Pool.
But despite the extra support, the Crimson went 1-3 on the weekend, falling one by one point to No. 18 Princeton and Iona.
Harvard (8-5) faced two ranked opponents, No. 12 San Jose State and the Tigers, in the first two games of the tournament, in addition to Bucknell and Iona later on.
“We definitely put it all out there this weekend,” said sophomore attacker Shayna Price, who is also a Crimson sports comper. “It was tough playing four games in one weekend, and I think we took each game for what it was worth. I think even though it’s hard to lose games, we did pretty well.”
IONA 11, HARVARD 10
In its final contest of the tournament, the Crimson lost, 11-10, in sudden-death overtime to the Gaels (6-4).
The match started off slow, as both teams were unable to take advantage of numerous scoring opportunities.
Eventually, Harvard established a 3-1 lead with goals from Shayna Price, co-captain Devan Kennifer, and junior two-meter defender Elise Molnar.
Although the Crimson maintained a narrow lead for most of the match, the Gaels were able to capitalize on several offensive opportunities to keep the score close. Iona eventually tied the game, 9-9, with 33 seconds left in the fourth quarter to send the match into overtime.
In the first overtime period, with four defenders draped over her, junior attacker Aisha Price flipped a backhanded shot into goal, putting Harvard up 10-9. The Crimson scored again in the frame to take the two-goal edge.
In the second overtime, the Gaels responded with two scores of their own, finding the back of the net with 12 seconds remaining in the period to make it 11-11 and send the game into sudden-death.
In the ensuing frame, Iona was able to net a goal attempt with the shot clock winding down to top Harvard, 12-11.
“The positive thing is we can learn a lot,” Aisha Price said. “[Harvard coach Ted Minnis] always says you have to lose big games to win them.”
This was the third match between the two squads this season and all have been decided by one goal. The Gaels lead the season series, 2-1.
HARVARD 13, BUCKNELL 8
In its second game of the day on Saturday, the Crimson rebounded from a close loss to Princeton, topping Bucknell (8-8) for the second time this season.
Shayna Price and Kennifer paced the Harvard offense with four goals apiece as the Crimson cruised past the Bison, 13-8.
Kennifer also tallied a season-high eight steals to lead the Harvard defense.
PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 8
In the second meeting between the Crimson and the Tigers (16-1) this season, Harvard once again was unable to defeat its Ivy League rival, falling, 9-8.
“I don’t think anyone on the team has beaten Princeton yet,” Aisha Price said. “So that was a tough loss.”
The Crimson struck first, scoring three goals in each of the first two quarters, to open up a 6-3 lead against Princeton going into halftime.
The Tigers answered with their own three-goal run in the third period, holding the Crimson to just one score. And with three goals in the fourth, the Tigers managed to take a late lead and edge the Crimson, 9-8.
“We had a 6-1 lead. There’s no excuse for that,” Kennifer said. “We had them. I don’t think we believed enough, and I think that win would have been a lot more important for us than the Iona game.”
SAN JOSE STATE 15, HARVARD 8
The Crimson began a four-game weekend on Friday night with a loss to No. 12 San Jose State (20-10).
Harvard fell behind early in the first period as the Spartans established a 4-1 lead. But the Crimson fought back. By limiting San Jose State to one score and tallying three goals in the second frame, Harvard pulled within one goal to end the first half, 5-4.
In the second half, it was all Spartans.
Netting four goals in the third period and six in the fourth, San Jose State widened its lead in the final 16 minutes and limited the Harvard offense to just one score in the third and three scores in the final frame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing over 2,200 miles from home, the Harvard baseball team’s season-opening three-game series against No. 7 Arizona came to a disappointing end, as the Wildcats (8-2) defeated the Crimson (0-3), 13-2, at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson, Ariz. on Sunday. The Wildcats’ rout belied strong performances from the Crimson in games on Friday and Saturday.
“Every game we expected to win,” sophomore outfielder Jack Colton said. “We know we can hit anyone, and our pitchers can get anyone out.”
ARIZONA 13, HARVARD 2
Though the Wildcats’ lineup did its share of damage, registering 13 hits against Harvard, the Crimson’s six errors in the field did not help its cause. The three runs allowed by Harvard starter Jacob Kremers were all unearned, though the freshman still received the loss. Freshman Tanner Anderson relieved Kremers and allowed five runs in one and two-thirds innings, though only one of those was earned.
“You can’t make six errors and expect to beat anyone,” Colton said. “We kind of fell apart. We didn’t play good baseball, and they took advantage.”
And with Arizona playing solid ball defensively, Harvard never had a chance to get back into the game. The Wildcats didn’t commit an error behind starting pitcher James Farris, who threw seven innings and allowed just two runs on eight hits.
While Arizona was playing its 10th game of the season, the Crimson struggled to shake off its winter rust, playing on an outdoor surface for the first time in 2012.
“It’s definitely a disadvantage going outside for the first time and trying to get our timing down,” Colton said. “It’s so different from playing inside the bubble. It will take us some time to get used to playing outside, but I was surprised how well we played and how loose we were.”
ARIZONA 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard gave Arizona a scare in Saturday’s matchup but fell, 3-1, in a contest marked by missed opportunities.
A Crimson fielding error in the fourth inning extended the frame for Arizona, and with two outs, Wildcats Riley Moore and Brandon Dixon stroked back-to-back RBI doubles, scoring the first two runs of the game.
The score remained 2-0 into the seventh inning, when Harvard loaded the bases with nobody out, following a walk, single, and hit batsman. But Harvard was unable to capitalize. Arizona pitcher Konner Wade forced a pop out and a double-play ball to escape the danger unscathed.
In the eighth inning, the Crimson again looked to close the gap with the Wildcats, as an error and bunt single moved runners to second and third with no outs. Sophomore right fielder Carlton Bailey was tagged out at home on a fielder’s choice groundout, but Harvard responded, again loading the bases with a walk by senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds.
The next batter, senior first baseman Marcus Way, finally put the Crimson on the scoreboard with an RBI groundout, but with two outs and a chance for Harvard to tie the game, Arizona reliever Matthew Troupe struck out pinch hitter junior Robert Wineski, ending the threat.
Despite the loss, the team was encouraged by its ability to defy expectations and hang with one of the elite teams in the country.
“I don’t think they expected us to come out as hard as we did,” Colton said. “The results weren’t really there, but we showed glimpses that we can do some things this year.”
ARIZONA 7, HARVARD 1
Harvard found itself stifled in its season opener Friday by a dominating pitching performance from Arizona right-hander Kurt Heyer and lost to the Wildcats, 7-1.
Heyer overpowered the Crimson hitters with 14 strikeouts in the complete-game victory. The Crimson did manage six hits, but the lone run Heyer allowed in his nine innings on the mound came on a solo home run by freshman outfielder Brandon Kregel.
Heyer’s Crimson counterpart, Harvard senior Brent Suter, held Arizona hitless through three innings before allowing three runs in the fourth. The Wildcats pulled away later in the game, scoring two runs each in the sixth and eighth innings off Crimson relievers senior Conner Hulse and junior Matt Doyle.
“It was a lot more competitive than the score showed,” Colton said. “We’re a pretty young team, a little inexperienced, but we’ve got some players. We totally expect to be competitive and win a lot of games. We’ve can surprise a lot of teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling behind, 5-2, in the first half, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (1-1, 0-1 Ivy) made a run to pull within one goal of Cornell early in the second. But the Big Red closed the game with a fury, putting away seven goals in the last 18 minutes to secure a 12-6 victory on Saturday at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium.
“We came out a little slow against a very good Cornell team,” junior Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “They capitalized on our early turnovers. We started a nice comeback but then relaxed a little, and once again, Cornell continued to put the ball away, and we weren’t able to respond.”
The Big Red got on the board first when senior Olivia Knotts scored off an assist from senior Shannon McHugh 2 1/2 minutes into the contest.
Harvard responded quickly with an answer of its own. Junior Danielle Tetreault put away a score one minute later.
Cornell then exerted a dominant run, scoring four straight goals to grab a 5-1 advantage with 2:45 left in the half.
Freshman Lindsay Toppe started the Big Red run when she attacked the net and lofted a shot between two defenders and past the goalie for the score. Junior Caroline Salisbury ripped a shot past the Crimson goalie, giving Cornell a 3-1 lead. Salisbury followed by bouncing in a free-position shot.
“It’s all about momentum and building off your run,” VanderMeulen said. “That’s when you become a really good team, when your run turns into a consistent game plan.”
Tetreault finally brought an end to the Big Red run with 1:40 to go in the half, firing a low free-position shot that was initially stopped by the goalie before rolling into the net to bring the Crimson within three, 5-2 at the half.
“The first half it takes some time to feel things out, and we have struggled with this in the past as a team,” VanderMeulen said. “In this game I think we came out trying to feel them out. We definitely need to come out harder from the start and avoid the need to catch up.”
For the opening minutes of the second frame, it appeared as if the Crimson had moved past its first-half woes. VanderMeulen started the comeback surge by finding sophomore Jenn Leffew cutting in front for a score.
The Crimson maintained the momentum as Leffew cut to the goal, drawing the defense before finding junior Micaela Cyr in front of the goal. Cyr flung the ball into the net, pulling Harvard within one with 19:51 to go.
“We started to work together as a team and understood that we can’t win individually,” VanderMeulen said. “When we started working together we pumped each other up, and that’s when we started putting some goals away and making a comeback.”
The Crimson had several good opportunities to tie the game up a minute later, but Big Red goalie Kelly Weis kept Harvard off the board. Cornell then extended its lead to three, as senior Jessi Steinberg scored consecutive unassisted scores.
“There was a point at 5-4 where we were within reach but then unable to build upon momentum. It’s a point we need to look back on to figure out what went wrong,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “Unfortunately, and credit to their team, they were able to respond to the effort we brought out in the start of the second half.”
Cyr orchestrated one last comeback attempt by winning the ensuing draw control, sprinting in front of the Cornell defense, and rifling a low bounce shot past the goalie to pull the Crimson back within two goals.
But that was as close as Harvard got. The Big Red closed out the game with a 6-1 run that ended the Crimson’s hopes of a comeback.
Harvard is anxious to get back on track Tuesday when they take on James Madison at home.
“How we respond to this game is going to be huge,” Baskind said. “The hope right now is that we are going to study this game and really learn from it as a team. We need to take a step back and focus on the things that went wrong that we will be able to improve upon. Every season has its highs and lows, but the lows are really only defined at the end of the season by how much you were able to take from them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final matches before the NCAA tournament, the Harvard wrestling team finished eighth at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships this weekend in Princeton, N.J.  Five individual Crimson wrestlers earned spots on the podium.
No. 6 junior co-captain Walter Peppelman finished second at the 157-pound weight class, while No. 12 junior Steven Keith placed third at the 133-pound class.
On the mat for the first time since Jan. 28 against Army, No. 5 co-captain Corey Jantzen won his first two matches before declaring a medical forfeit in his next two. Jantzen’s performance merited him sixth place in the 149’s.
At 184 pounds, sophomore Cameron Croy went three for five on the day, landing in sixth place, while freshman James Fox finished in seventh in the 197-pound weight class.
With their wins, Peppelman, Keith, and Jantzen qualified for the NCAA tournament on Mar. 15-17.
Giving the Crimson its top showing at the EIWA Championships, Peppelman had a better-than-projected performance. After earning an 11-0 major decision against Brian Tanen from Lehigh and a 4-0 victory over Jake O’Hara of Columbia, both of whom he beat earlier in the season, Peppelman faced the No. 2 seed of the tournament, American’s Ganbayar Sanjaa.
In a minor upset, Peppelman pinned Sanjaa before the end of the first round of the semifinals. With the victory, Peppelman advanced to the championship match against Kyle Dake from Cornell, a two-time national champion at the 141- and 149- weight classes.
The score stayed 0-0 throughout the first and most of the second round, but a late takedown by Dake put the Big Red grappler ahead, 2-0, heading into the last frame. Deciding to start on bottom, Dake escaped in the final period to take the 3-0 advantage in what ended up being the last point of the match.
Though Peppelman lost in the championship match, the junior still turned in a strong performance shortly before he wrestles on the national stage.
“It was a good opportunity to see what I need to fix so that hopefully I can pull one out in two weeks,” Peppelman said.
"Walter will most likely end up wrestling [Dake] again in the NCAAs, so I think it was a good warm-up match, a good dry run for when he needs to beat him at nationals,” Jantzen agreed. “Walter just had a great tournament."
Keith, after being upset, 3-1, by Navy’s Aaron Kalil in the semifinals, battled his way back to a quadruple-overtime thriller in the third-place match against Mason Beckman from Lehigh, the only wrestler who has pinned Keith all season.
[Kalil] out-scrambled him a little bit,” Peppelman said. “But I feel like he outwrestled his opponents on the whole.”
In regulation against Beckman, Keith was down, 2-0, going into the final minute of the match, but a crafty takedown knotted the score at two and sent the duo into overtime.
After three long overtimes with no scoring, Keith finally finagled a takedown in the fourth segment of extra minutes that notched him the third-place spot on the podium.
“Steven had a tough loss in the semis, but he wrestled back really strong,” Jantzen said. “I’m pumped to see him in nationals. I really think he can win the whole thing.”
Meanwhile, Jantzen accomplished his goal of the tournament: to qualify for NCAAs.
Sidelined with an injured shoulder for five weeks, Jantzen showed no signs of being out. In his first bout back, he handled his opponent, 11-0, before he turned around and pinned Alex Pellicciotti from Bucknell at 0:36 in the quarterfinals.
“It’s great [to be back],” Jantzen said. “Wrestling’s just such a big part of my life and is something I’m just so passionate about. I can’t really explain in words how excited I am to be back.”
After the two wins ensured him a spot in the NCAA tournament, Jantzen decided to rest his shoulder for nationals and declared a medical forfeit in his last two matches.
For Croy, going into his final match, the sophomore knew he had to win in order to make it to the NCAAs. But Navy’s Luke Rebertus, who beat Croy, 7-5, earlier in the tournament, was too much for him, and he lost again, 3-2.
“Cameron ended up losing, but he had a really solid tournament, and he definitely learned some things that he can take into next year,” Peppelman said. “Overall, we’re peaking at the right time as a team, and individually, everybody is doing the same.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field squads earned fourth-place finishes at last weekend’s Heptagonal Championships, the Crimson finished in the top 10 again this weekend at the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America Championship Meet and  the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship Meet.
The men placed sixth place at the IC4A championship meet, scoring 29 points, while the women tallied 26.50 points, good for ninth place in the ECAC.
“The whole team that was competing really stepped up this weekend,” said senior middle distance runner Darcy Wilson. “We all came to race today, and everyone had standout performances.”
To compete in the IC4A and ECAC meets, athletes had to meet qualifying standards at a previous invitational in the indoor season. The Harvard men’s squad tallied 55 qualifying performances this year, while the women had 66.
IC4A CHAMPIONSHIP MEET
Hosted at the Boston University Track and Tennis  Center, the IC4A Championship meet pitted the Harvard men’s squad against competitors from 46 schools. Behind balanced scoring that came from on and off the track, the Crimson scored 29 points on the weekend and finished just four points shy of a top-five finish.
Wilson chipped in 10 points for Harvard with a pair of strong 800-meter performances in the last indoor meet of his collegiate career.
“There was nothing to lose this weekend,” Wilson said. “I went out there and gave it all I had.”
Wilson finished in second place in the hotly contested 800-meter run with a time of 1:49.98. Cornell’s Rutger Admirand placed first in the event, while Louis Gibilisco of Mt. St. Mary’s finished in third. The trio made for an exciting finish to the race, all crossing the finish line in a span of less than one second.
“I wanted to put myself in the best position to score high, so I hung with the lead group and battled for four laps,” Wilson said. “I was pleased with my last lap…. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough to get the leader.”
Just 80 minutes after notching eight points for the Crimson with his second-place finish in the 800, Wilson competed on Harvard’s 4x800 meter relay team, and along with sophomore Ryan Romain and juniors Weishen Mead and Zach Herring earned sixth place and two team points in the event.
Earlier on the track, a pair of two-sport athletes added a combined three points to the Crimson’s team total. Sophomores Andrew Ezekoye and Damani Wilson, who are also members of the Harvard football team, ran the 60-meter dash in respective times of 6.92 and 6.93 seconds to finish in seventh and eighth places.
“It’s hard to quantify the impact that [Ezekoye and Wilson] have had [on the track and field program],” Saretsky said. “They bring a tremendous amount to the program. Not just their athletic ability, but [also] their attitude, the way they carry themselves. They’re great young men, and we’re happy to have them on board.”
Freshman Ben Glauser took home third place and six team points for the Crimson in the shot put with a throw of 17.95 meters. Glauser, who won the Ivy Championship in the shot put a week ago, fell to his toughest competitor, Cornell’s Stephen Mozia, who outdistanced the rookie by over nine inches to earn first place in the event.
ECAC CHAMPIONSHIP MEET
The Harvard women took ninth in a field of 50 schools in the ECAC Championship meet at Boston’s Reggie  Lewis Center.
The top performance of the weekend for Harvard came from the women’s distance medley team. Senior Nicole Cochran kicked things off for the Crimson by running the 1200-meter leg. She then handed off the baton to Erika Veidis for the race’s 400-meter leg. Seniors Meghan Looney and Kailyn Kuzmuk rounded out the relay with the 800- and 1600-meter legs, respectively.
The squad ran away with the event. Cochran and co. earned first place and bested their nearest competitor by over 10 seconds,  topping the old record by a staggering seven seconds.
“Nicole really got things going for us,” Saretsky said. “She really closed hard, and from there we were, no pun intended, off to the races…. She set the tone for the others.”
Junior Mary Hirst contributed five points to the Crimson’s total by finishing in fourth place in the high jump. Hirst matched her personal best by clearing 1.77 meters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In two five-game matches this weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team extended its winning streak to five games, edging out both George Mason and Princeton in hard-fought road wins.
“As we play more, we keep gaining confidence,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “We’re figuring out ways to win even when we’re not playing at our best, and that counts for a lot.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
The Tigers (6-5, 5-3 EIVA) put Harvard (11-2, 5-2) in a hole early on Saturday afternoon, taking the first two sets, 25-22 and 25-23, at Dillon Gym. With a lot of back-and-forth rallies, Princeton was able to pull ahead due to service aces and Crimson attacking errors.
“Princeton was playing very well in the first couple of games,” sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. “We weren’t really rising up to the challenge [in] those first couple of games. Our offense wasn’t really on fire, and we weren’t playing good defense.”
That all changed in the third set when Harvard was able to pull out a key 25-19 win.
Notching 18 digs throughout the five games, Gibbons led a Crimson defense that brought the team back into the contest.
Baise believed the defense had substantially improved since the teams’ last meeting.
“Princeton was well up over .300 hitting the first time we played them, and now they’re under .200,” Baise said.
While the defense strengthened, the Harvard offense picked up steam as well. Trading points with the Tigers throughout the fourth game, the Crimson went on a six-point run sparked by a kill from sophomore middle blocker Will Chambers and a service ace from senior outside hitter Matt Jones. The Crimson eventually took the fourth frame, 25-21.
Riding this momentum, the Crimson jumped out to an early 8-2 lead in the fifth set. Even after two timeouts, Princeton could not rally. Two kills by Jones sparked another 5-0 Harvard run.
Jones and sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden led the Crimson offense against Princeton, knocking down 15 and 16 kills, respectively. Madden sealed the set with a kill, giving Harvard the final victory, 15-7.
“We definitely had a lot of confidence going into game five, and it showed,” Jones said.
HARVARD 3, GEORGE MASON 2
The Crimson came out strong against the Patriots (6-11, 2-4), winning the first frame, 25-18, at George Mason’s Recreation Athletic Complex in Fairfax, Va., on Friday night.
Harvard closed the set on three back-to-back kills from Jones and a service ace from freshman middle hitter Caleb Zimmick.
“We had lost to them, 3-0, at our place, so it was important to get [off] to a good start and try [to] show them that we were ready to compete this time and get a revenge win,” Jones said. “The first set we did a really good job of that. We came out really strong.”
But George Mason did not go down quietly. Swapping points and multiple service errors with the Crimson, the Patriots were able to power past Harvard, 25-22 and 25-23, in the second and third sets.
The Crimson turned it around in the fourth set to take an early 7-6 lead off a Jones kill. Harvard kept its offense firing with consistent attacking from Zimmick and freshman outside hitter DJ White.
“I think we got a little momentum and confidence back, and that’s what made the difference,” Baise said.
Early in the winner-take-all fifth set, the Crimson faced an 8-4 deficit due to a string of attacking errors.
But with a number of hitting errors on the George Mason side, coupled with a service ace from Jones, Harvard clawed its way back and took the tenuous 13-12 lead.
The Patriots kept it close, knotting the score at 15, before the Crimson earned two straight points to take the fifth set, 17-15, and the match, 3-2.
Jones led Harvard with 20 kills, and junior setter Rob Lothman provided 53 assists for the Crimson offense.
“It’s a testament to our team’s mental toughness that we were able to actually come back from a pretty significant deficit in the fifth game,” Gibbons said. “I think just the mental focus of everybody on the court and [our] will really showed.”

If come Housing day you end up one of the unlucky (or fantastically blessed) few to be Quadded, do not despair. Living in Pfoho, the highest-ranking Quad House three years running, you won't mind scheduling your life around Shuttle Boy. What's great about Pfoho? One commenter wrote, "Polar bears EVERYWHERE. Also the sex."

House Spirit: Once you're back in the Quad for the day, you're all stuck together, and proximity inevitably breeds strong House community. You'll start wanting to put a "pf" in pf-ront of ever pf-hrase that starts with "f". But it's pf-ine, a testament to the House's pf-antastic House spirit. Few Houses have masters dedicated enough to regularly bring late-night sweets to stressed out studiers in the pf-library or wear a polar bear costume to class on Housing day. "The community of Pfoho is amazing, like one huge family," wrote one commenter, and its true, but if you're not quite down with the House spirit scene, Pfoho can become kind of overwhelming. Pfoho ranked sixth on the House spirit poll.
 
Housing Quality: As one commenter put it, "N+1 housing, big closets, mirrors everywhere [and] no cockroaches" make Pfoho housing pretty pf-ucking pf-antastic. Although some sophomores end up in tight rooming conditions, if you want a single in Pfoho, you have a good chance of getting one. Many rooms boast two-level setups, kitchens, and sometimes, even enough space to make a ball pit. Some students complain that the Jordans, the Quad's own DeWolfe, is separate from the House community, but cable TV and floor-length windows make up for the extra five minute trek to the dining hall. Most likely for its massive suites and lack of vermin, Pfoho ranked number one on Flyby's housing quality poll.
 
Dining Hall: What's better than a normal dining hall? A double dining hall, of course. Described by one Pfohoser as "the center of our social and study scene," Pfoho's two-tiered dining hall is host to everything from date auction stein clubs to spontaneous piano-accompanied sing-alongs. The space is noticeably emptier during the day, but why shuttle it back to the Quad when Pfoho is the one House with permission to eat in Adams anytime? Plus, fewer mouths to feed means better food for those few times you make it back to the Quad for a midday meal. Overall, distance won out and "not having the comfortable home feeling of eating meals in my own dining hall" earned Pfoho the fifth place spot for dining hall quality.
 
Facilities: Pfoho boasts arguably some of the best facilities on campus. It's not hard to find a free common space to study in, especially during the day. At night, people flock to the recently renovated Junior Common Room which boasts a massive flat-screen TV, a psychedelic light fixture that changes color every few minutes, dart boards, a pool table, and comfy, booth-style seating. The Quad Grille serves up mozz sticks and milkshakes every day until the early hours of the morning. Pfoho has everything from a photo studio (pfoto studio?) in the basement to a Happy Room, equipped with multi-colored beach chairs and wallpapered in images of sandy paradise. The athletic facilities in Pfoho, however, are a bit lackluster.
Rating: At the end of the day, location is everything and if there's one thing that Pfoho (and Quad) residents complain about, it's the 10-minute plus trek to the Yard. Great facilities, unbeatable housing, and the classic "it's not as far as you think" excuse can only get you so far—Pfoho ranked sixth out of 12 in the House rankings overall.

As  part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting   reviews and  rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over   the next few  days. Click here to read more about the series.
It seems that Houses, like data sets, tend towards the mean as they get larger. In that vein, this year's poll revealed that Leverett is just about average. Leverett is the biggest of the 12 residential Houses, with students spread across three different buildings whose variety give the House its charm. From McKinlock Hall (or Old Leverett) to the Leverett Towers to housing on two floors of 20 DeWolfe St., Leverett pleases those who tend toward more modern housing while still accommodating residents yearning for an ivy-lined, stereotypical Harvard building. Residents praise the middle House along the river for its "beautiful river view," "MONKEY BREAD," and of course for the fact that "Jeremy Lin lived there." As one resident eloquently put it, the best thing about Lev is "EVERYTHINGGGGG."
House Spirit: Leverites seem to be divided on the matter of House spirit. Leverett pulled a solid seventh place in the poll, and many respondents brought up House community as their favorite thing about Lev. According to one resident, the House boasts "lots of spirit and always cool community dinners." Another Leverett staple lauded by students is the Masters' Open Houses, which feature the renowned monkeybread. Providing a different perspective, one resident said that "there is absolutely no House spirit,” another said that "honestly, it is pretty boring," and a third agreed that there is "not much constant House spirit."
Housing Quality: The wide variety of housing and unusually good rooms for residents in their first years as Leverites is a source of glee from many a poll respondent. One resident exclaimed that "having an amazingly large quint as a sophomore" is the best thing about the House, while many referenced the views from the lofty Leverett Towers. Leverett's diversity of housing has something for everyone. Unlike those of other Houses, Leverett's two residential buildings embody a wide variety of architectural styles. Old Lev was built in 1925 and encircles a courtyard in an architectural style typically associated with Harvard. McKinlock Hall is also home to Leverett's dining hall and most of its social spaces. The Leverett Towers, with their own courtyard, look out over the Boston skyline. Some residents, however, bemoan a lack of guaranteed n+1 housing for seniors, asserting that "the senior housing kind of sucks."
Dining Hall: Leverett's d-hall is the one source of complaints for many poll respondents. The dining hall of the most populous House on campus can get overcrowded, and one resident complained that "there are some times when you walk into the d-hall and don't recognize anyone." The d-hall consists of many tables that seat six people, often making it difficult to find a private seat or to find a place to sit with a few friends. The dining hall was ranked tenth among Houses, the lowest of Leverett's rankings. One Leverite even said that the worst thing about the House was the dining hall, adding "the food is pretty damn bad."
Facilities: Leverett has ample social space, most of which is located in Old Lev. Leverett complements the standard pool table with a newly-added foosball table. Its JCR is designed in a style much like those of other old River Houses, giving residents a comfortable but classy space to relax. Some Leverites complain about the walk from their dorms to the dining hall, but with so many different options, that comes off as a minor detail.
Rating: With solid rooming and good location, Leverett just barely missed the top half of Houses in the rankings. Still, it's a desirable House, and for this reason ranked seventh out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
7. Leverett
8. Currier
9. Mather
10. Winthrop
11. Cabot

Forget for a minute the problem sets, papers, and midterms that are looming over your head this week. Fast forward five days—it's Friday and you're officially on Spring Break!
One problem: if you didn't have the time or foresight to plan your week of freedom, and if you're not headed home, you're probably stuck in good old Cambridge, Mass. for the week. Luckily, the Undergraduate Council is looking to fund students staying in Boston over the break.
The UC Student Initiatives Committee is giving away $2,000 worth of Spring Break 'Getaway Grants' through which students can get a maximum of $30 each for a planned outing. A simple application asks students to list a brief proposal and the expected expenses.
"We imagine that this $30 per person will extend as far as students' imaginations go," said UC Ivy Yard representative Salena Cui '15. "They can even choose to go on a bus trip to New York if they want!"
UC representatives said that the point of the initiative is to encourage students to go out and explore the city and use the UC's funds. Creative ideas and outings are encouraged, they added.
"Five minutes to fill out this application will lead to a life's worth of memories," said UC Crimson Yard representative Ting-Ting H.T. Liu '15. "So do it."
While that's obviously an exaggeration, we do think these $30 could go a long way in funding a successful day or weekend trip.
Applications are accepted up until 3 p.m. on March 8, and decisions will be sent out on March 10.

With a belltower that casts shadows across its romantic, ivy-covered courtyards each morning and afternoon, Lowell House is known first and foremost for its beauty. This River House may not have a view of the Charles, but its residents don’t seem to be too upset. One commenter discussed loving Lowell because of "the people, the dining hall, the house masters...everything!"
House Spirit: House community is a point of pride for Lowellites. One resident wrote, "I think the community is the strongest of all the houses." Masters’ teas were consistently cited as one of the best parts about the house—a tradition that has gone a long way towards fostering Lowell camaraderie. However, Lowellites distinguish between community and House spirit, the latter of which the House seems to be sorely lacking. A disgruntled commenter complained, "As freshmen on housing day there were barely any Lowell people at all." Consequently, Lowell came in ninth for house spirit.
Housing Quality: Lowell is simultaneously praised for its convenient location and berated for its lackluster housing options. Sophomore suites are notoriously tiny, and although the options do get better later on, the insect infestation, stench of sewage and leaky roof tend can make rooms unappealing. One resident tried to be optimistic about the house’s cockroach infestation, writing that the critters appear "only at the beginning of the year, though—then they’re gone." Nice try, but Lowell definitely has room for improvement when it comes to housing. This year, it ranked tenth out of 12 for housing quality.
Dining Hall: The eatery is consistently listed as residents’ favorite part about Lowell. Yellow walls and graceful chandeliers give this dining hall a cheery, classic atmosphere. While Houses such as Quincy and Adams are routinely criticized for being too crowded during peak meal hours, Lowell’s dining hall seems to escape the rush. One resident also noted that "the tutors are all interested in you and will sit and have a meal with random people," something that goes a long way towards fostering Lowell's sense of community. However, despite its aesthetic value, Lowell’s dining hall has been cited as having sub-par food and a "terrible brain break." Lowell came in ninth for dining halls.
Facilities: One resident put Lowell's primary appeal well: "Location, Location, Location." Lowell sits conveniently between the Yard and the River Houses, which makes it easy to both roll out of bed for class in the morning and meet with classmates for late night psetting. From a stunning (though sometimes aggravatingly loud) belltower, to a climbing wall, to its very own squash courts, Lowell offers a host of unique amenities. However, Lowell’s centrality also means that it is surrounded by final clubs—one resident said that the worst part about Lowell is "its proximity to the Fly and the Owl." Another commenter complained about "the animals that sometimes live in the courtyard."
Rating: Lowell’s community, central location, and incomparable beauty put it decisively in the upper half of houses in this year’s ranking. However, lack of spirit and cramped housing kept this otherwise enviable house from making its way to the very top. Overall, Lowell ranked fifth out of 12 in the House rankings.
