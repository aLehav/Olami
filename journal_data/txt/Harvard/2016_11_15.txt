After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well, the election’s finally over, but almost nobody predicted this outcome. In many of the left-leaning parts of the country, the atmosphere was a sad and angry one. How did the late night comedy shows, which tend to skew left, treat Trump’s win?
Starting with “Democalypse 2016” on “The Daily Show” and Stephen Colbert’s “Stephen Colbert’s Live Election Night Democracy’s Series Finale: Who’s Going To Clean Up This Sh*t?” the mood went from nervous to shocked to somber as it became apparent that Trump would win. In the former of the two shows, Trevor Noah and the other Daily Show correspondents got progressively more unsettled, as Roy Wood Jr. was drinking “Pepto-Bismol” by the bottle. By the time guest Ana Marie Cox came out, everyone was in full panic. Stephen Colbert, too, signed off stunned. Desperately looking for states that hadn’t called in yet, he tried to pull himself together and end on a note about how divided America was in order to bring everyone together. While his signoff moved millions of Americans, the tone of late night television on Wednesday night wasn’t close to as positive, although the hosts tried their hardest to make jokes.
Even with a day to recover, most hosts were still shocked. Overall, late night shows tended to cover the same variety of topics, including: how to explain the election results to one’s children, the legalization of marijuana in four states (Trevor Noah: “They go low, we get high”), the pollsters (Jimmy Kimmel: “Nate Silver has been downgraded to Nate Bronze”), and the political division in America. Shows had a variety of approaches, however, to the post-election aftermath. Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon spoke on the election for the first few minutes of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon” in a joking tone and then continued with their shows as scheduled. On “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Stephen Colbert spent the first half of the show talking about the election by himself in a more composed but sadder state than the night before and afterwards talked about it with his guests, looking desperate for them to bring some joy to the show. While he had jokes, it was clear he wasn’t in a happy mood. Seth Meyers seemed to feel similarly on “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” nearly in tears as he lamented Hillary Clinton’s defeat. He tried his hardest to make jokes, but came off as too alarmed. He spent most of the night discussing the election, except when Wendy Williams came on, at which point he seemingly wanted only to talk about pop culture.
The two shows that spent the most time covering the post-election were “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” and “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.” Samantha Bee has a lot of experience with political coverage; although she was shocked and horrified, she seemed very together and was able to give one of the best post-election shows as a result. She spent the show passionately arguing that electing Trump was a bad decision, although she ended on a positive note, with guest act Lizzo giving a tremendously moving performance of her hit “Good as Hell” preceded by an a capella rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Trevor Noah also had a great show set up: He was frazzled as well but is a naturally calmer comedian than many of the names mentioned previously and was able to help guide the show through his correspondents' panic. The highlight of the night as a whole, however, was when correspondent Hasan Minhaj gave an impassioned speech about his fears and his anger at Trump supporters that resonated better than any joke made that night.
On a day of extreme shock and anguish, late night comedians tried—but couldn’t necessarily give—any reassurance.  Instead, the best moments were the raw, personal ones, like Hasan Minhaj or Seth Meyers trying to stay positive about the idea that one day a different woman could become president. Nobody really felt in the mood for jokes, including the writers, as Samantha Bee pointed out. As a result, many pieces seemed dull and awkward because they couldn’t resonate. Although many late night comedy shows tried to do post-election coverage as they would any other subject, no one was really laughing this week.

“Anna. It’s Reese. No, the other one. Hey, listen. I’ve written a new safety video for Air New Zealand, and I want you to be in it. It’s like a Hollywood cop movie,” Rhys Darby says from within his bathtub in “Safety in Hollywood #AirNZSafetyVideo”. With themes ranging from Hollywood to the “Hobbit” to “Men In Black” to surfing lessons, Air New Zealand has very unconventional and entertaining safety videos.
The videos the airline creates are completely bizarre. Most safety videos do not include talking dogs, bad French accents, and hearing aids, but Air New Zealand has made sure to change that. The settings do not resemble any airport or airplane. In the “The Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made #airnzhobbit” people ride everything from a horse to a giant eagle. In normal safety videos, like this one for American Airlines, the actors dress like actual flight attendants. In Air New Zealand videos, however, they pick costumes to fit the theme of the video.
The airline features celebrities such as Rhys Darby, Anna Faris, and Betty White and integrates popular songs and films into their safety videos. “Safety in Paradise” alone features Christie Brinkley, Jessica Gomes, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis, and Ariel Meredith in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition (which totally seems appropriate for an airline to celebrate). The song that plays in the background is “Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities. But the familiar faces and music likely pique the interest of passengers more than the bland videos of Air New Zealand’s competitors.
Besides, the important content of the videos is not overwhelmed by the entertaining storylines. For example, “Men In Black Safety Defenders #AirNZSafetyVideo” is a parody of the film “Men In Black,” but it covers all the necessary aspects in a safety video—stowing all personal belongings, buckling seatbelts, putting on air masks, bracing against an emergency landing, finding and inflating lifejackets, prohibiting smoking, and turning off electronics. The videos simply take the information that has to be said in any ordinary safety video but change the context of the video.
Overall, Air New Zealand successfully overcomes the blandness that conventional safety videos contain, yet it still works to maintain the life-saving content. There is only one thing left to do. It’s time to fly Air New Zealand, mate.

Comedy writer and Harvard alumnus Steve M. O’Donnell ’76 was the head writer for the late night comedy shows “Late Night with David Letterman” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” He has also written for “The Simpsons,” “Seinfeld,” and “The Chris Rock Show.” The Harvard Crimson interviewed him about his work and how he first got his start in the television industry.
The Harvard Crimson: Who is the funniest person you have worked with in the past?
Steve M. O’DonnelI: I had an identical twin brother, also a writer also quite involved in comedy, who also went to Harvard and who was a lifelong pal and a sometimes collaborator called Mark O’Donnell. In our professional lives we collaborated pretty rarely... but we did write a piece for Esquire about our own lives, and I suggested we do one in the form of a catechism, you know, questions and answers such as we had growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, in our Catholic catechism books. That kind of explored not only the questions of creativity and humor and so on but also the somewhat sideshow-ish feature of our lives. Mark passed away four years ago, so I am the surviving twin, but I still talk a lot [about him] because he was the funniest and the greatest. And very good-looking.
THC: What activities did you pursue at Harvard that helped engender your love of comedy or else were particularly beneficial for your career?
SMD: [My brother] had numerous small productions that were humorous and interesting and very promising at the Loeb Ex from 1972 to 1976…. [My brother and I] performed a [play] called “The Intellectuals” at the Ex. I am sure there is no copy or recording, but it was a memorable experience for me, and I think the audience got a kick out of seeing identical actors each saying asinine things.
I was on the Lampoon, as was Mark O’Donnell. We were both very inept cartoonists and blossoming writers…. There was a kind of horrible, corrupt wonderfulness about the Harvard Lampoon. When I was there, we would have these fancy dinners every couple of weeks where you’d wear tuxedos; half of them were secondhand (mine certainly was); but anyway, they’d have these great dinners, and there is a beautiful entrance—I won’t describe it too much, because it’s all super-secret though—with a great sort of medieval hall and with these great dinners, and often people would make toasts and smash their glasses like something out of Tolstoy. All your friends and colleagues were also humorous and smart…. But the dinners at the Lampoon were wonderful. Other than the drama of the smashing crockery and the blood and so on, the camaraderie [with the members of the Lampoon] on a gray afternoon was always pleasant… and I am still friends with some of those people.
THC: What was your first job, and how did you get your start in comedy?
SMD: I had some odd ones. I sold some magazine and newspaper articles in my hometown of Cleveland after college. I had couple of strange jobs before that. I was a tour guide at the Paul Revere House, and I was a teaching assistant in American history in North Carolina, and when I came back to Cleveland to, as we used to say, “to get my head together,” I worked as a moving man…. I had this urge to cartoon and write and I went and talked with an editor of Cleveland Magazine, pitched a couple of articles, and sold them—I think the first was why Cleveland was the biggest city in the nation where Pepsi outsold Coca Cola, and I made it humorous…. From there I got a job at a local greeting card company writing greeting cards, which turned out to be a great preparation for writing late night comedy because we did a lot of writing, like volumes and masses. You got in the habit of writing dozens of things a day, most of which would get shot down for some corporate or personal reasons or another, and I got to know so many other writers and cartoonists. I especially enjoyed getting to know cartoonists, who in some ways are more fun than writers, because writers can be sort of gloomy and preoccupied and self-centered; cartoonists are more ready to have fun somehow.
So I did that job for almost two years, then went to New York to seek my fortune, as they say…. [I] got a job at the Museum of Broadcasting, which led to a job in the NBC tape library, and it was in the tape library that I wrote a submission for the Letterman show, which was the first job that I got in television…. I suddenly could take taxi cabs and tip hat check girls, which was a redeemable pleasure that went along with having more than $89 a week in your paycheck…. I loved that job. I was there for 13 years, almost [ten][10] of which I was head writer.
THC: In the past you’ve talked about the grueling nature of perpetually coming up with material for the show. How did you come up with this information? Where did you draw inspiration?
SMD: I go to a library and check out books that have not been checked out in a long time, and I copy whole sentences out of them, and so far, nobody has gotten the wiser. No, I have to say there are certainly times where coming up with stuff seems a little bit harder than others, but that seems less the struggle in my experience than trying to sell something or trying to deal with the politics in a show. Those seem like the larger challenges. It’s sort of like your dinner table conversations; you never really worry about that drying up…. There’s always something to speak to even if you don’t necessarily like to write about current events—I’m not a big political commentator, but there’s always some kind of ridiculous cultural and social phenomena as well…. You want more to surprise [your audience], and one always asks [oneself], what would I like to hear? What would I like to see? To some extent that is what serious writers imagine as well—what sort of story do I crave hearing—and you provide it as best you can.
THC: If you had to sum up the work that goes on behind writing for television in three words, what words would you use?
SMD: Well, one of them, I think, would be joy, because it ought to be a joy. If you are just doing it to say that you’re in TV, that’s not really good enough. It should give you a kick; it should be a pleasure for you. Then I will say surprise, simply because it is nice to surprise people with an unexpected turn even if they sort of think they see or expect a turn coming. And then maybe I’ll very pretentiously bring up my third element as truth, because I think a funny line has a little more effect on people if they recognize some truth in it. Though having said that, I also like complete and utter nonsense in which there is not a shred or molecule of truth in what you say. So I’ve pretty much negated my whole lofty premise.
THC: What kind of television do you like to watch? Do you find yourself watching it solely from an audience point of view, or do you ever find yourself viewing it more critically?
SMD: I think I’ve remained pretty much like an audience. I don’t take the same pleasure in late night shows, maybe, because it’s just because [it is something] I have been supersaturated with, but as everyone tediously echoes this is a golden age of quality of drama in the long form… like “The Sopranos.” Those are good things; we did not have that kind of stuff [back then]. But if I go to a movie now, I feel like I’m wasting my money most times. “Oh boy, ‘The Avengers.’ Great, terrific, can I leave now?” But when you’re watching “Breaking Bad” or “Boardwalk Empire” or something like that, you go: “I’m into this!” There is enough time to develop the characters.
This isn’t really comedy. The comedy I like to watch still are things like “South Park”… and there are a handful of comics I like to watch, like Norm Macdonald; Sarah Silverman, who I’m a big fan of; and I’m friends with a very funny comic called Susie McDonnell, who I get a kick out of and who’s a funny writer as well.
THC: What advice do you have for students who want to delve into the world of comedy?
SMD: I would urge any writer—but particularly someone who wants to write in late night television—to keep up a Twitter account or something journal or diary-like just so that they are in the habit of writing and commenting on things every single day, so it’s not like they think they’d like to do it and another year goes by and they get caught up with something else altogether. And I think, get in the habit of the craft part, the professional part, to be able to comment in an amusing manner on what’s happening in the culture. It’s also a good habit for any writer—serious, unserious or something in between—to write every day and just to make that a habit. And I will bring back… [the earlier idea of] joy. Take some pleasure in it. If you’re doing it to prove something to someone else… well, you may do that, but is that really what you are looking for? Take some pleasure in it. That’s what it’s all about. And I guess that’s true for anesthesiologists as well!

The title of Chilean-American musician Nicolas Jaar’s second full-length album, “Sirens,” could be interpreted in several ways. One of them is as a thematic continuation of a series of EPs released last year, called “Nymphs [II, III, and IV].” However, it seems likely that the titular sirens are not meant to allure—rather, they are a political alarm. “Sirens,” Jaar’s most socially engaged album to date, is a surprisingly mature exploration of the connections between the current political realities of both Chile and the U.S., and his relationship with his father. It utilizes his distinctive style for an ambitious new purpose—making electronica that functions as protest music.
The experimental nature of Jaar’s music—a fusion of futuristic jazz and electronica—allows him to create architecturally interesting songs. On “Sirens,” he confidently distances himself from any resemblance to the structure of pop songs that was still present on his early works (such as “Mi Mujer”). The very duration of the majority of songs, which largely exceed six minutes, attests to that. This length is essential in successfully achieving his aim of making political electronica. It allows him the flexibility to create space for his sounds to resonate (which may sound too convenient given the title of his first album: “Space is Only Noise”). However, this does not mean that his style can be characterized as minimalist; instead, the runtime of his songs allows the remarkable sound design to shine through.
Sound design is the most important instrument Jaar uses to lend the album cohesion. Radio screeches and hesitant fragments of high-pitched, video game-like sounds are present throughout his oeuvre. On “Sirens,” however, he deftly weaves almost onomatopoeic sounds with clearly acoustic or electronic creations to an unsettling effect. Perhaps the most prominent example is that of shattering glass, which carries metaphorical political meaning. Shattering glass is among the first sounds that appear on the record—it flickers around descending piano arpeggios on the brutally critical opener “Killing Time,” which references the refugee crisis in Europe and the clock-related arrest of the 14-year old Ahmed Mohamed. That same sound later reverberates in the beat of “Three Sides of Nazareth,” which also compellingly integrates another anxiety-inducing symbol—ticking clocks—into its rhythmic structure.
“Sirens” also features forceful, yet far from straightforward lyrics. Jaar sings in both Spanish and English, with the Spanish language songs more explicitly related to Jaar’s experience of Chile. Thus the standout “No” features the words “Ya dijimos no, pero el si está en todo” (“We already said no, but the yes is in everything”)—a reference to the consequences of the 1988 referendum that ejected the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from power. The earnestly heartbreaking crescendos of “no nada cambia” (“no, nothing changes”) on “No” are contrasted by the cynical “History Lesson”—the most conventional and simultaneously the most meta-musical song on the record. Its extreme bitterness in response to the lack of true societal change is conveyed through the juxtaposition of the almost infantile sweetness of the production and the unpleasant bluntness of the lyrics: “Chapter One: We fucked up.” However, “Sirens” with a seemingly direct address from Jaar to his listeners: “Oh… but… baby… Don’t you decide it?” which might be an expression of futility even in democratic conditions or a hint of hope.
The politics of “Sirens” seeps into the album’s cover art. It consists of lottery paper that, when scratched off, reveals a picture of Times Square with a controversial installation by Nicolas Jaar’s father (the contemporary visual artist Alfredo Jaar). The words, “This is not America” flash on a screen over a map of the U.S., intending to highlight the common neglect of most South American countries in the public discourse regarding “America.” “Sirens” frequently uses recordings of Nicolas Jaar’s childhood conversations with his father, which seem to bridge the gap between Jaar’s two national identities and physically link songs such as “No” and the English-language “The Three Sides of Nazareth.” Jaar’s newest record succeeds in drawing attention to the issues his father emphasized without losing any artistic merit. The personal aspects of “Sirens” hinted at through the use of his archival recordings are more powerful precisely because of the album’s political implications.

It is 6:07 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 11. This article is due at midnight, and I’ve just begun to write it. Why? I think the reason is obvious, but let’s just say that the events of Tuesday turned my week into a whirlwind of grief. The anger I felt on the wee hours of morning of Wednesday turned into denial by mid-afternoon and early evening. I have not gotten over that stage yet. I don’t even want to know what depression will look like.
A few weeks ago, I began curating a Houghton exhibition that is to be put up around the time of Inauguration, celebrating the most powerful office in the land. Despite the unforeseen result, the exhibition will go on. One of the remarkable features of this nation is its people’s incredible faith in its institutions, of which the Presidency has been the most revered. We will see if this picture will change in the next few months.
One of the items that will be included in this exhibition—in fact, the item that opens it—is a proclamation by President George Washington promulgating this country’s first Thanksgiving holiday to be held on November 26, 1789 (call number AB7 Un33P 789bb, HOLLIS number 007193023). In this proclamation, President Washington thanks “Almighty God” for a litany of blessings:
"... for the great degree of tranquillity, union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately instituted; for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge."
This country has had its ups and downs. It has not always been tranquil, united, and plentiful, nor have its denizens always possessed full “civil and religious liberty.” It has always worked toward all of these goals, however: The Constitution, after all, makes the goal of the “People of the United States” that of forming “a more perfect Union,” and that Union is, supposedly, based on the creed that “all men are created equal.”
Later in the proclamation, President Washington reverts from thanking to praying. He asks God
"... to pardon our national and other transgressions; to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such as have shown kindness to us), and to bless them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us; and, generally, to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as He alone knows to be best."
True religion aside—this country is supposedly secular—I suggest all Americans make Washington’s prayer their Thanksgiving prayer this year. May the government continue to guarantee the “safety and happiness” of all inhabitants of this land, and may “civil and religious liberty” continue to be a given. Indeed, let us pray, ask, or wish—whether we are Christian, Muslim, atheist, or anything else—that the “National Government” will remain a “blessing” to us” and that it will be one of “wise, just, and constitutional laws.” Let the whole world be blessed with “good governments, peace, and concord.” Let us know and practice true virtue and remind ourselves daily to be kind and ethical while eschewing evil. Finally, let us remain prosperous.

UPDATED: Nov. 16, 2016, at 9:34 p.m. 
Students across the University’s schools will have the opportunity to cast their ballots for or against unionization under the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers’ plan this Wednesday and Thursday. This contentious election will resolve months of debate following the National Labor Relations Board’s decision granting students employed as teachers or researchers the right to form a union. Because these students also function as employees, it is vital that they have the ability to unionize if they so choose.
Nevertheless, the particulars of the agreement being voted on should preclude employed students from seeing the formation of a union as a beneficial foregone conclusion. Approximately 4,000 students from across the University’s schools, including undergraduate course assistants and teaching fellows but not research assistants, would be eligible to join the proposed union. These students’ degree programs, fields of study, and types of employment all vary greatly, so it is unclear how a union representing all of them would be best able to accommodate issues important to any given subset of the employed student body. Students must weigh the benefits of collective bargaining against the drawbacks of allowing other students to vote on issues that do not directly affect them.
Furthermore, the advantages to this measure are especially uncertain, given that there is no precedent in academia for a union this all-encompassing. Union organizers at Harvard have not proposed an alternate method of student unionization that would organize smaller groups of students—the “micro-bargaining unit” tactic that the Yale graduate student union rejected last month.
Additionally, unionization is by no means the only way for graduate students to increase the benefits they receive. Last semester, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences doubled the amount of money and time students receive for parental leave. Employed students may well determine that forming a union may be the best avenue to improving their work environment, of course, but it is not the only way for them to do so.
Students eligible to vote must also be cognizant of the ways in which the HGSU-UAW would, and would not, be able to influence student life. Unionization will not serve as a panacea for all the issues facing employed students at the University, and will only affect bargaining for wages, working conditions, and the like. It will have little effect on advisor relations or other aspects of the student experience, and students wishing to improve those aspects of being at Harvard should be wary of looking to the HGSU-UAW to do so.
These issues are critically important ones, not just for currently employed students at the University but for students yet to arrive. Therefore, employed students have a duty to each other and to their successors to take time before the vote to educate themselves about these issues, and decide whether or not they think unionization under HGSU-UAW is prudent before casting their ballots. It is not our place to tell employed students how they should vote on the matter, but we strongly urge them to consider the importance of this election, and to examine the potential drawbacks to unionization as well as the potential benefits of the union before voting.
CORRECTION: Nov. 16, 2016This editorial was updated to clarify that the Yale graduate student assembly, not Yale graduate students, rejected the "micro-bargaining unit strategy." The Yale graduate students have not yet voted.

Zoe: “Don't worry, we'll take our country back,” a promise made by Donald Trump throughout his campaign and echoed throughout election night. I didn’t understand what he could mean by “take back our country,” as if his country and my country weren’t one and the same. His sentence haunted me as I obsessively refreshed poll data on election night. I wanted to believe that Trump’s view wasn’t the majority’s. Wanted to believe that those final states would swing away from red and towards an affirmation that they would fight for me, for my community, and for the people that I love to be recognized as members of this country. I have never felt more heartbroken than when I realized that those states were never going to change, and that this country might not be mine.
Ruben: I woke up on Wednesday and, for the first time in my life, questioned whose America I was living in. A boy who’d said the Pledge of Allegiance every morning of his eighth grade school year over the loudspeaker to the point where it’d become his personal prayer—an incantation to his country—woke up wondering if this was his country any longer. A boy who led the Pledge of Allegiance at his high school graduation questioned his citizenship as his country elected a leader who made it clear that his browness, his biculturalism, and his love of country have no place in Trump’s America.
Z: As a little girl, I thought that no words could truly encapsulate the love and pride I felt for this country. Seeing the stars and stripes of the American flag flying in the wind meant justice, safety, and opportunity. It meant that everything was going to be okay, because I was and always would be free. I didn’t want to live anywhere else because I was made to believe that being American was the very best thing that you could be. I was filled with awe at how lucky I was to be a member of a country known for being the protector of the world, for being a melting pot of diversity. I learned the Star-Spangled Banner with pride, sang “Proud to be an American” with complete conviction, and told myself that it didn’t matter that the Founding Fathers wouldn’t think my skin was the color of a true American. Things were different now. America was different now.
R: And the pain this realization caused had me hunched over myself, sobbing tears saturated with the salt and sacrifices that my parents made in immigrating to this country. Through my dry heaves, as I grasped for oxygen in air polluted by hatred, I remembered that I am a patriot. I will fight for this country, even if it is so deeply flawed. Even if it has legally excluded individuals simply because they were not white. Even when the hypocrisy that characterized this nation’s foundation has proven that it is not dead. I will love this country and fight to own it. When people threaten to “take it back,” I will ask them when it has ever not been theirs.
Z: On November 8th, 2016, everything I believed to be true changed; all of those truths about this country I held close to my heart as a little girl became lies. Forty-seven percent of the country voted for a man who called my people criminals, drug dealers, rapists, and with their vote they told me this wasn’t my country to claim. Now, I feel like I’m on a roller coaster and the destination is unknown, the pit in my stomach only seems to grow. I keep thinking of the 11 million undocumented Americans, who stand to lose everything they’ve ever known and worked so hard to achieve, ripped away and deported without a piece of paper to prove the citizenship I know they deserve. To my fellow women who may lose their right to choose what happens to their own bodies. To my brother who just wants to be able to marry the man he loves. What will happen to them? I’m angry—angry that their futures weren’t enough, that their right to humanity wasn’t enough to sway half the country and swing those states.
R: In the fallout of this election, white liberals have told me to comply in denying people’s humanity by normalizing hateful rhetoric just like they do. Don’t force me to hold my words, my anger, and my humanity inside of me. If I’m not able to yell that my humanity is at stake, it will burn. It will burn my throat, and my tongue will be no more than charred ash. If some of you are ready to speak across the aisle, then do so, but do not forget that the individual whom you attempt to extend an olive branch to has denied me my humanity. The branch will be burnt, covered in the blood of the countless Americans of color who have died under the crushing weight of racism. Don’t you dare ask that I force my shaking, brown, melanin-soaked fingers to hand the tainted olive branch alongside you. Not until the other side has seen the ugliness covering the branch.
R&Z: We believe in democracy. But we will not stand and be told that a candidate and a movement that has denied my place in the nation in which we’ve lived in for our entire lives should be listened to. Until they retract or repent or even do the bare minimum of acknowledging that racism, misogyny, and xenophobia have no place in our government, we will continue to do what we’ve been doing for years.

The tone is light as Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19 sit down for an interview about their candidacy to lead the Undergraduate Council.
The two met on a UC retreat in fall 2015, initially bonding over a shared taste in music: they listened to tracks from Kanye West, Taylor Swift, and Fetty Wap on the bus.
However, it was only after finding out they shared roots—both Gonzalez and Popovski hail from southern California—that they became close.
“I knew that this was a keeper friend right here,” Popovski said of Gonzalez.
Gonzalez, the ticket’s presidential candidate, is a junior in Mather House concentrating in Social Studies. Popovski, running for UC Vice President, is a sophomore in Dunster House who plans on concentrating in Economics.
Though friends and supporters have many stories to tell about the duo, three adjectives in particular were their most common descriptors: genuine, enthusiastic, and caring.
“[Gonzalez] was always the one who would be amping everyone up, making everyone laugh, and getting everyone excited,” said Emily Corrigan ’19, one of Gonzalez’s teammates on Mather’s intramural soccer team.
“He brings that level of energy to everything he does,” she added.
Nicholas Whittaker ’19, a fellow UC representative and friend of both candidates, said Popovski “has the biggest heart of anyone. He just cares so much about everyone and everything.”
Outside of the classroom and Council, the candidates remain involved on campus. Gonzalez participates in Fuerza Latina, a Latino student group. Popovski, meanwhile, consults for the TAMID Group, a consulting and finance organization that focuses on Israeli business.
However, both Popovski and Gonzalez said the UC remains their primary focus on campus.
“I’ve made all of my closest relationships at school on the UC,” Gonzalez said. “I go to all of the UC-sponsored social events because that’s my social life, and it’s dope.”
Both candidates have served on the Council since their first years at Harvard.
“You mean there’s more to life at Harvard than the UC?” Popovski joked.
The ticket, running on a platform with the campaign slogan “Our Harvard,” say they hope to make campus more inclusive and its resources more accessible for all if elected to the top of Harvard College’s student government.
The first tenet of Gonzalez and Popovski’s three-pronged platform advocates for the better use of existing social spaces on campus. The candidates said they hope to lessen the burden of hosting parties as a way to “empower students” with social experiences generated by students, and not College administrators.
For first-year students, Gonzalez and Popovski say they want to make common rooms readily available to book for parties. For upperclassmen, they want to institutionalize “fast track” party registration that lets students notify their Houses of dorm room parties with shorter notice.
Their plans come at a time when the College has pushed to promote more campus social events for students. Some Houses like Mather and Cabot already have instituted similar expedited party registration systems, and designated party spaces on campus such as Adams House’s Molotov have recently been opened to host social gatherings.
Both Gonzalez and Popovski have worked within the UC to open private Harvard Square business as social venues for students. The Council’s current leaders, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Danny V. Banks ’17 spearheaded “Club 1636,” which hosted undergraduates at Felipe’s Taqueria, the Hong Kong restaurant, and Tasty Burger.
According to Madeleine H. Stern ’18, the ticket’s campaign manager, Gonzalez and Popovski worked with Rather and Banks to organize one of the events.
“Their dedication to ensuring the success of the event, and by extension that every student who showed up felt welcome there, was contagious,” Stern said.
In recent years, College administrators led by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana have stepped up their involvement in undergraduate social life. Specifically, Khurana has called unrecognized single-gender social organizations such as final clubs at odds with the College’s values, and in May, he and University President Drew G. Faust put forth sanctions barring students who join these groups from athletic team captaincies and College endorsement for top fellowships like the Rhodes.
Gonzalez and Popovski have voiced “conditional” support of the sanctions, which will go into effect starting with next year’s Class of 2021.
“We recognize that in the lead up to the announcement of the sanctions there was a severe lack of student voice being represented in those talks and those decisions,” Gonzalez said, adding that he and his running mate are both in favor of the sanctions’ ultimate goal of gender equity.
“[Popovski] and I agree ideologically that gender equity… is the place we want to take our Harvard in the future,” Gonzalez said.
Nevertheless, much like other UC leadership tickets, Popovski added that he and Gonzalez want to avoid “vilifying” students who participate in the soon-to-be sanctioned groups.
Earlier this semester, the College announced the membership of a committee to implement the sanctions. Although the committee counts 20 undergraduates in its ranks, Gonzalez and Popovski want to establish an additional “standing committee” to oversee enforcement.
In the second part of their platform, Gonzalez and Popovski say they want to prioritize students’ mental and sexual health. In both arenas, their platform looks to place trained mental health and sexual assault prevention liaisons in closer contact with students.
Specifically, Gonzalez and Popovksi call for more professional counselors and peer counselors to be stationed at each upperclassman House. Their platform suggests giving Harvard University Health Services’ mental health clinicians non-residential tutor privileges—and therefore dining hall access—in the 12 residential Houses.
Gonzalez also said he sees a need for more student mental health counselors, and hopes to make it easier for low income students to fill those roles. Specifically, Gonzalez said he thinks peer counseling positions at Harvard should fulfill work study requirements for students on financial aid.
As for sexual health, the ticket says they recognize that preventing sexual assault will likely require a campus-wide shift in culture. Their proposals come at a time during which the University administration has implemented new measures aimed at curtailing sexual assault, in light of a 2015 survey that revealed a sexual assault climate Faust described as “deeply disturbing.”
This fall, for instance, the College launched an online training program,   required for all students, which aims to inform students of campus-wide resources for sexual assault victims and educate students on Harvard’s own policies. The UC more generally has also pushed for anti-sexual assault education—its Finance Committee decided last semester to mandate sexual assault prevention trainings for clubs requesting high levels of funding from the Council.
Gonzalez points to personnel changes within Houses as a way to shift Harvard’s culture towards healthier sexual conduct.
The ticket's platform suggests placing Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators peer tutors in Houses to supplement current Sexual Assault and Sexual Health tutors’ programming.
“We advocate for the institutionalization of at least two student CARE peer counselors in every House, just the same way that every House right now has a funded, institutionalized Resource Efficiency Program representative and a Food Literacy Project representative,” Gonzalez said.
On the whole, Popovski and Gonzalez said they think all undergraduates could benefit from more campus-wide conversations on healthy sexual conduct, similar to the way freshmen attend sexual assault prevention trainings before fall classes begin.
“[Popovski] and I will not end sexual assault at Harvard or in America, but what we can do is take concrete steps within our own community here at Harvard to continue with a cultural change,” Gonzalez said.
Following a year of increased activism over race relations across the University, Gonzalez and Popovski’s platform also seeks to make the College more inclusive for students of all backgrounds and identities.
For both candidates, celebrating diversity has been important in their lives at school and away from campus. Gonzalez, the child of two immigrant women, is the only student to ever attend Harvard from his high school, and Popovski lived in Israel for seven years.
“Our campaign is about empowering diverse student experiences,” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez and Popovski’s platform proposes creating a campus multicultural center, a common request by students and cultural groups. Harvard administrators and students have discussed building a center since at least the 1990s.
The two suggest repurposing a floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles into a space for their proposed center. They say that as the Smith Campus Center is renovated, offices currently in the SOCH will move closer to the Yard, freeing up the building.
The candidates have also pledged to reach out to cultural groups on campus, asking leaders of the groups to attend and speak at UC general meetings.
“Right now we don’t proactively reach out to underrepresented groups; it’s more of them coming to us,” Gonzalez said. “In order for us to be a representative student body, we need to proactively go out to those groups.”
According to the candidates, their past experiences make them “the strongest ticket when talking about issues of diversity.”
“We’re bringing diversity to the forefront of an institution that’s historically been defined by white, straight, Protestant men, and we are not all of those identities,” Gonzalez said. “We recognize the extreme importance of having diverse voices brought to the table.”
As their interview draws to a close, Gonzalez and Popovski’s initially more casual tone has shifted to a serious and determined one. Repeatedly, the ticket has emphasized tangibility and deliverability on issues at the center of Harvard students’ lives.
“Everyone has the same goals, but [Popovski] and I have the ideas to make them happen,” Gonzalez said. “We’ve got tangible proposals to the issues that everyone cares about, and we’ve got the strength of character to carry it through.”
At a debate with the election’s three other tickets, Gonzalez described his plans for UC leadership as a “mission,” which he hopes will bring Harvard’s thousands of undergraduates together.
Speaking to what distinguishes them from other tickets, they cited their unique approaches to solving common issues on campus, again referencing their campaign slogan.
“That’s why our slogan is ‘Our Harvard’, and that’s why when we talk about [the] campaign, we talk about our spaces, our health, our experiences,” Gonzalez said at the debate Friday evening.
Popovski added: “No matter where you come from, no matter your financial status or who you know, you should have a support group at Harvard, you should have a community, a home at Harvard.”
Voting in this year’s UC presidential election begins Monday, Nov. 14, and lasts until Thursday, Nov. 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Courses in the General Education program have seen enrollment drops in all categories this past semester, according to Stephanie H. Kenen, the administrative director of Gen Ed.
The drop comes during an interim transition period as the College moves from one Gen Ed program to another. The new program, created after a year of review and slated to be rolled out in full in the fall of 2018, requires students to take departmental classes in addition to classes within four Gen Ed categories—as opposed to the current eight. During the transition period before the full rollout, students can fulfill requirements under either the old or the new system; and under the new program, many students have  fewer remaining requirements.
Before the fall semester began, Kenen went through the records of all enrolled students by hand to determine what requirements they had fulfilled under the new Gen Ed model. Because many students realized they had unintentionally fulfilled requirements, Kenen said there was an overall enrollment drop in the Gen Ed program, especially in the Societies of the World category.
“The demand was way down across the board,” Kenen said. However, “It’s one semester, and that does not make a trend.”
In addition, Kenen said classes within the History, English, and Classics departments saw declines in enrollments this semester because many students had already completed requirements in Gen Ed categories for which classes in those departments often fulfill, such as Culture and Belief and Societies of the World.
The Gen Ed program was overhauled after several years of conversation about review. A committee was formed in the spring of 2014 to develop a revamped Gen Ed program, and in the spring of 2015 that committee found the program was “failing on a variety of fronts.” After a year of discussion and debate among professors, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to approve the new program in March of 2016. Last fall, University President Drew G. Faust said when the Faculty was envisioning a new program, they should ensure students receive a liberal, interdisciplinary education that emphasizes elective opportunities and literacy in writing and mathematics.
Determining the right number of Gen Ed courses to offer under the new program is one of the tasks ahead, Kenen said. In addition, Kenen said she wants to increase the program’s transparency and flexibility for students. To achieve these goals, Kenen hopes to update each student’s records with the requirements they have fulfilled before the start of the spring semester.
“We learned a lot over the summer about what not to do,” she said, indicating that the changes could have been communicated better to students during break. “One huge focus is being as transparent as we can with students.”
In addition to communicating effectively about the Gen Ed program with students, Kenen said she hopes to consult undergraduates about courses that will be developed for the new program.
“I’d love to get input from students,” she said. “If Gen Ed is supposed to help students link what they’ve learned in the classroom to what they do outside, what does that mean from [their] perspective.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a fall in which so-called “locker room talk” dominated national discourse, Harvard had its own story on the thread: the men's soccer team's annual lewd “scouting reports,” which ultimately led to the cancellation of their season.
The Crimson broke the news of the practice occurring in 2012 last month, and after Harvard found the "scouting reports" continued through 2016, the University cancelled the rest of the team’s season. Local and national press covered the developments closely—with journalists saying the story garnered headlines for both the Harvard connection and its relevance to broader national conversations over sexual harassment.
The evening news of the cancelled season broke, a local CBS affiliate dispatched a van to campus to interview students. Larger media outlets—the Boston Globe, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and the New Yorker—followed with stories and commentary in the following days. After first reporting on the University’s decision to cancel the team’s season on Nov. 4, the New York Times ran another version of the story on its Saturday front page.
“The soccer team story gained more traction than others of its ilk for two reasons—because of Harvard’s swift response and because of the timing,” Katharine Q. Seelye, the New York Times reporter who authored the front page story, wrote in an email. “The Crimson broke the story in the midst of a presidential campaign in which Donald Trump had already if inadvertently elevated the topic of sexual assault to a campaign/character issue.”
The Crimson reported the University had cancelled the men’s soccer team’s season on Nov. 3, after an Office of General Counsel review found the team had continued to rank women’s soccer recruits by perceived physical attractiveness and sexual appeal through 2016. The Crimson first reported on the practice occurring in 2012. Even during academic year that has seen a historic dining hall workers’ strike and the first recruitment season after the University announced penalties against unrecognized single-gender social organizations, it was reports of the soccer controversy that perhaps gained the most traction with outside media.
The initial story on the “scouting reports” produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team has so far been viewed more than 300,000 times on The Crimson’s website, and the followup story on the team’s season being cancelled has been viewed more than 200,000 times.
“A bright light shines on Harvard at all times because of its status in higher education,” said Matt Pearce, a reporter who covered the story for the Los Angeles Times.
Other journalists also noted that Harvard’s name made the story more salient.
Nicholas Lemann ’76, a former dean of the Columbia Journalism School and staff writer for the New Yorker, agreed that the fact that “it’s Harvard” gave the story more prominence, though he offered an alternative explanation for why that increased the story’s significance.
“[The New York Times] is a publication whose top editorial positions are filled with Harvard graduates, and lots of media take their cue from the New York Times,” said Lemann, a former Crimson president. “Harvard gets more coverage, rightly or wrongly.”
The story came out several weeks after President-elect Donald Trump was embroiled in controversy over a leaked video from 2005 in which he made lewd comments about women, and called the incident just an example of “locker room talk.” The Washington Post was first to report this story.
Seelye suggested that news of the soccer controversy was particularly relevant given Trump’s rhetoric, and showed that kind of language pervaded even Harvard.
“The story is significant nationally because Harvard is supposed to be a beacon of enlightenment and equality,” Seelye wrote. “For [readers], it confirmed that ‘locker room’ behavior occurs pretty much everywhere.”
Pearce placed the controversy within the context of another story thread, that of sexual assault on college campuses.
“The idea of a grotesque document where men were putting together reports about fellow Harvard athletes speaks directly to the conversation about sexual assault on campus that has been intensively covered the last few years,” he said.
Lemann agreed with Pearce’s assessment, adding that the widespread coverage plugs “into an already-existing big story.”
After the University cancelled the men’s soccer team’s season, The Crimson reported that past men’s cross country teams produced yearly spreadsheets about members of the women’s team, sometimes writing explicit comments about the women. Shortly afterwards, Harvard’s Athletics Director asked the Office of the General Counsel to review the team. At Columbia University, the wrestling team is also under investigation after racially and sexually explicit group messages were made public, according to the Columbia Spectator.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government professor Danielle S. Allen was appointed a University professor on Monday, the highest honor a Harvard faculty member can receive. She will take on the role on Jan. 1, just a year and a half after arriving at Harvard.
The title of University professor was created to “honor individuals whose groundbreaking work crosses the boundaries of multiple disciplines,” according to Harvard’s website. Current University professors include Nobel laureate in Economics Eric S. Maskin ’72, former University President Lawrence H. Summers, and other preeminent scholars like Henry Louis Gates Jr., Laurence H. Tribe ’62, and Stephen J. Greenblatt. There are currently 25 in total. 
University professors have the flexibility to teach and pursue research at any of Harvard’s 12 schools. Allen will join  Stephen Owen, a scholar of Chinese literature, with the title of James Bryant Conant University Professor.
In addition to her role within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Allen holds a faculty post at the Graduate School of Education and is the director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, which “seeks to advance teaching and research on ethical issues in public life,” according to its website. She was also recently appointed co-chair of a University-wide task force to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to foster campus diversity and inclusivity.
Allen is a widely-published political theorist and classicist. She is a regular contributor to the Washington Post, a former chair of the Pulitzer Prize Board, a former MacArthur Foundation "Genius" Fellow, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In an interview with the University-run Harvard Gazette, University President Drew G. Faust said, “Danielle Allen is one of the most distinguished and creative scholars of her generation.”
Allen currently teaches two undergraduate courses, Government 94cz: “From Voice to Influence: Understanding Citizenship in a Digital Age” and Government 1060: “Ancient and Medieval Political Philosophy.”

UPDATED: November 15, 2016, at 1:05 p.m.
It is Friday night, and the eight candidates for Undergraduate Council leadership are gearing up for the Crimson Crossfire debate. Six of the candidates—the UC veterans—are clad in varying degrees of business casual. But the last ticket switched up the dress code.
At the end of the row are Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18, holding J.P. Licks coffees and wearing twin “Harambe” t-shirts, a nod to the deceased gorilla who became a popular internet meme.
The crowd seems ready for jokes and gags from the two, but as Solomon and Moore begin to speak, it becomes clear that their irreverent shirts do not fully capture the tone of their campaign.
Both juniors in Lowell House, Solomon and Moore are UC outsiders, having before never served on the undergraduate governing body. Instead, they spend more of their time training across the River: Solomon plays men’s tennis and Moore runs track and field.
Solomon is a Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator from Texas and—according to the ticket's campaign representative Xavier Gonzalez ’18—the unofficial social chair of the tennis team. Moore, who hails from Washington, concentrates in Environmental Science and Engineering and previously worked as a Resource Efficiency Program representative.
As student-athletes, Solomon and Moore say they want to bring an oft-neglected perspective to the UC and “electrify Harvard” by expanding the College’s social scene. Harambe t-shirts aside, Solomon and Moore say they are taking this election seriously.
“I think a lot of students write off athletes because they don’t have the time to fully dedicate to UC, and I push back on that completely,” Moore said. “There’s commitments that we’ll have that perhaps clash with UC as far as time is concerned, but that doesn’t mean we’re not fully invested in both.”

It’s been years since two varsity athletes served as President and Vice President of the UC. But Solomon and Moore criticize the UC for what they see as a homogeneity of experiences, and say they can bring fresh insights to the table.
A decorated tennis player, Solomon says that athletes deal with the same difficulties as other students, but often more intensely.
“There’s a lot of time commitments that we have,” Solomon said. “I know my coach in particular really harps on ‘make sure you’re getting enough sleep, make sure you’re eating healthy in the dining halls, make sure if you are struggling in class ask for help.’”
To address a few of the issues Harvard athletes face, Solomon and Moore are advocating for hot breakfast in House dining halls, extended dining hall hours, and more flexible course add-drop deadlines. They believe these policies would be benefit all students, but perhaps are more pressing for those involved in varsity athletics.
“They’re good things for every student, but we’re a little bit more sensitive to those issues. If our coach demands a lot from us on the track and let’s say our dining hall is closed early, and then we’re out of food for the night, that’s really going to hurt us,” Moore said.
Their teammates also say the pair’s backgrounds in sports have trained them well for leadership. As members of close-knit teams, Solomon and Moore are accustomed to being held to high standards, said Lane Leschly ’20, a member of the men’s tennis team.
“There’s a certain amount of accountability and execution in athletics that is phenomenal and could really help for the UC presidency,” Leschly said. “We have partners who we’re accountable to for our performance every single day so that we don’t drop the ball, and goals that we make and stick to every month—they can’t be too far-fetched or too out there.”
Beyond their athletic perspectives, Solomon and Moore are pushing for what they call “electric politics,” a pledge to bring a more dynamic social atmosphere to campus.
“We’ve found that there’s a lot of people complaining, a lot of people are a little bit disgruntled, have issues, have qualms [about social life on campus],” Moore said. “We’re trying to make things just a little bit more open, a little bit more free for people to have fun, sort of blow off steam on the weekend.”
Solomon and Moore say they oppose the University’s historic sanctions on single-gender social organizations for what they characterize as the policy’s blanket treatment of a complicated issue. A member of the all-male Fox Club, Moore said he thought University administrators made too many assumptions in designing the policy, and didn’t sufficiently consult with the students affected.
“The issues that we have with the sanctions is that they don’t address the cultural component. They point fingers and say this is what’s wrong, but that’s not really a solution,” Moore said at the Crimson debate. “There’s a lot of people that I’ve met over my time here at Harvard who are great people. They’re involved in the final club scene. It’s important to remember that just because people are involved with something doesn’t mean that’s who they are. That doesn’t mean they believe in everything that those places represent.”
Solomon and Moore list a “Wet Yard,” expedited party forms, and House bars and coffee shops among their social life priorities.
Solomon said he thought existing policies that restrict alcohol in freshman dormitories create a dangerous environment by driving freshman to drink in secret, but relaxing those policies could improve freshman social life.
“We’re not advocating for people who are underage to drink by any means, but if you would choose to drink alcohol we’re saying that it should be allowed in the Yard,” Solomon said. “Your door should be open so, for example, if there are any noise complaints your proctor could walk in, but they’re not going to dump out the alcohol in front of your face.”
“There’s students who come from all over the world who are 21, who come from a culture where alcohol is acceptable,” Moore added. “We want to be aware of those people, coming from those different backgrounds, and we don’t want to take away from them.”
Another component of “electric politics,” Moore said, is helping students create more social options for themselves. Solomon and Moore are advocating to bring fast-track party forms to all Houses and dorms, a policy that has already been implemented in Cabot House and Mather House.
“We’re trying to make it so that if you want to throw something last minute—it's the modern era, right, so people make plans quickly in a matter of hours—someone can go from not having anything going on on the weekend to having too much going on,” Moore said.
In addition, Solomon and Moore say they want to work to unite student groups across campus, and are pushing for a program that would bring together students from different social spheres together for a meal. They’re also advocating for a multicultural center, a perennial ask from students and cultural affinity groups.
As the only UC ticket without any experience on the governing body, Solomon and Moore say they know they face an uphill battle. Still, they say their lack of UC experience does not mean they lack qualifications.
“We haven’t had UC experience, but I think that’s a positive and a negative. We look at the positive side,” Moore said.
While Solomon and Moore are optimistic about their outside perspective, some of their competitors have questioned their ability to do the job. At the debate Friday, presidential competitor Scott Ely ’18, during his closing statement, made a comment that Solomon and Moore took as a comparison of their candidacy to that of President-elect Donald Trump.
“We know what happens when we elect people who don't have experience,” Ely said.
Shortly afterwards, Solomon and Moore’s campaign Twitter account, @SoloMooreHarvUC, tweeted “Shots fired by Scott...  Apparently fresh perspectives don't matter,” referencing Ely’s comment. The next day, they doubled down: “Mid-afternoon Saturday thoughts: Ely-Bonsall slogan is "Let's Start Now" - why haven't they started yet!? Been on UC for years supposedly!” they tweeted.
Outsiders or not, the two believe that their unique position as student-athletes and UC outsiders will enable them to unite students across Harvard.
“‘Electric politics’ means we’re going to try and electrify this campus, whether it’s from the social scene, whether it’s from offering our unique, different perspective, or whatever it may be,” Solomon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company—the University’s investment arm—is aiming to sell some of its natural resource assets after the endowment’s value fell almost $2 billion during fiscal year 2016, Bloomberg reported last week.
Citing two anonymous sources with "knowledge of the matter," Bloomberg wrote that HMC, which oversees Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment, intends to restructure its $4 billion natural resource holdings. In fiscal year 2016, HMC’s natural resources portfolio shrunk by 10.2 percent, falling markedly short of the investment arm’s internal benchmark of 1.4 percent for the year.
In an emailed statement, Emily Guadagnoli, a HMC spokesperson, wrote that the company is “refining” its approach to natural resources investing.
“The team is focused on refining HMC’s natural resources strategy and streamlining assets that are concentrated across certain asset classes and geography,” Guadagnoli wrote.
In particular, she pointed to the recent hiring of Colin Butterfield—a farmland investor—as the head of the company’s natural resource division in mid-August. Butterfield joins an HMC in transition: N.P Narvekar, the former manager of Columbia University’s endowment, will take the reins of the University’s investment pool in December and replace Stephen Blyth, who resigned in July after less than two years as CEO. Narvekar will be the fourth CEO at HMC in a decade.
Harvard’s current natural resource portfolio–comprised of assets from across the globe, including vineyards in California, and timber in Central and South America—constituted 10 percent of Harvard’s endowment in FY 2016. While the asset class did not meet internal benchmarks in FY 2016, it has performed well in past years.
In HMC’s annual endowment report, interim CEO Robert A. Ettl wrote that the “environment for direct natural resources investments was challenging” throughout FY 2016, citing declining commodity prices. Additionally, Ettl specifically mentioned two declining assets in South America: one “experienced severe drought during the crop season as well as an unusually high cost of production,” and the other “declined as a result of a challenging economic and political environment that made it increasingly difficult to find secure financing.”
In recent years, peer institutions have outpaced Harvard’s endowment growth. In fiscal year 2016,  Yale, Columbia, and Princeton returned 3.4 percent, -0.9 percent, and 0.8 percent respectively.
In FY 2016, Harvard posted its worst returns on the endowment since the financial crisis, returning negative 2 percent on the endowment—a drop that University President Drew G. Faust said would constrain budgets. Beyond the poor investment returns, several financial flows affect the endowment's value, including the $1.7 billion HMC distributed to fund over a third of Harvard's annual budget.
Amidst HMC’s recent underperformance, Narvekar will take the reins from Ettl as HMC’s CEO on Dec. 5. Experts and financial analysts predict Narvekar will likely continue to restructure Harvard’s “hybrid” investment model, which some have criticized as inadequate.

The height differential between Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and her running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 may be the first thing that strikes students who visit the website of the pair’s campaign to lead the Undergraduate Council. But place Sachee, the candidate for UC president, on top of Khansarinia’s shoulders—as pictured in one of their promotions—and their rapport becomes clear.
They say they embrace each other’s goofy habits, unique fashion tastes, eccentric personalities, and passions for understanding Harvard College’s complex administrative system. As their campaign slogan puts it, they are interested in “piecing it all together.”
Sachee, a Currier House resident, is the current chair of the UC’s student relations committee and a former UC Secretary. She is serving her third term on the Council. Khansarinia, a Cabot resident currently serving his second term on the Council, is now the chair of the rules committee and was formerly the UC parliamentarian.
Sachee and Khansarinia have worked on many UC projects, such as organizing the first Freshman HUDS Appreciation Day and promoting diversity as gender and race liaisons for the Council. They say, however, that there are still many reforms to be made.
The pair is focusing their campaign on promoting “organic change,” hoping to determine areas of reform through discussions with student groups and to utilize the UC’s resources to support groups in their own efforts.

Sachee and Khansarinia said they have a clear and organized set of tangible proposals that they created by listening to a diverse set of student voices.
“We went to different communities on campus and saw what they wanted,” Khansarinia said.
Through gauging the concerns that various student organizations raised, Sachee and Khansarinia developed their platform, which focuses on three pillars: “arriving," or supporting freshmen; "vibing,” or improving College social life; and "thriving," or enhancing student life generally.
They say the College too often treats students as a monolith and relies too much on blanket policies for different student organizations on campus.
At a debate hosted by The Crimson Friday night, Sachee lambasted the University’s sanctions against members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, who—starting with next year’s Class of 2021—will be barred from athletic captaincies and College endorsement for top fellowships like the Rhodes and Marshall.
“It’s a one-size-fits-all policy—a policy that is not nuanced, and gets rid of women’s spaces on campus,” she said at the event. Sachee, a member of the all-female Bee Club, added in an interview that she co-wrote a letter condemning the policy when it was announced in May.
“Instead of more town halls, task forces, and conversations that lead nowhere, we need actual change,” Khansarinia said.
The pair said they want to partner with student groups to create more nuanced policies. For instance, they proposed partnering with Harvard Student Agencies to build a textbook accessibility program for all students.
“We want to partner with student groups and students to give every single student a voice,” Sachee said.
In a campaign advertisement, the pair claim to have endorsements from more UC representatives than the other three tickets. Sachee and Khansarinia said they have also been endorsed by more cultural organizations than any other ticket. These groups include the Asian American Association, Association of Black Harvard Women, Harvard Nigerian Students Association, and Harvard College Iranian Association.
Al B. Corvah ’18, a UC representative for Mather and the pair’s campaign manager, described Sachee and Khansarinia as two of the most “composed, reflective, and compassionate members of the UC.”
“This is apparent to me in the ways they can interact with members of the student body,” Corvah said. “Because their personalities are so geared for leadership, I believe they will be accessible and approachable and effectively advocate for the interests of the students.”
Corvah also said he is confident the duo will be able to strike a fine balance between working with the administration and partnering with student groups.
Sachee and Khansarinia continuously said at The Crimson-hosted debate on Friday that partnering with student groups will allow them to accomplish goals in the short term and advocate on behalf of students on issues that they care about.
Sexual assault prevention, mental health resources, and social life are topics that almost all the tickets are focusing on.
According to Sachee, however, what sets her and Khansarinia’s candidacies apart from the other tickets’ is that they will work to partner with student groups and students with different perspectives on campus.
“Change is going to happen in smaller communities, so we really want to bring it back to empowering student groups,” she said.
The pair wants to create a “multicultural cabinet” that will bring together a group of leaders from student cultural organizations to promise them an opportunity to address their issues with the Council and administrators.
Victor C. Agbafe ’19, a UC representative for Dunster, said he supports Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign and their proposed efforts to partner with student organizations.
“Any time you have a proposal for any of these administrators, for you to sell it to them, they’ve got to see that there’s a vested student interest and what better way to do this than to involve student groups and give them a direct voice,” he said.
In their campaign flyer, Sachee and Khansarinia said as representatives of a group of 6,700 students of different backgrounds, perspectives, and interests, they will emphasize the importance of student involvement.
“We want to empower you and give you a voice so that you guys can tell the UC that this is how we want to get things done,” Sachee said.
Regarding sexual assault, Sachee and Khansarinia said they hope to take actual steps by requiring every undergraduate to take a workshop from the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators. They said they will work with CARE to make sure that it has enough funding and resources to recruit and train members who can give these workshops.
Sachee said she has already institutionalized the role of a gender inclusivity liaison on the UC to raise awareness about sexual assault, and she said she has reached out to as many women as possible for the position.
“The work Yasmin has already done in more than doubling the number of women on this council not only shows that she’s a great leader, but she wants to empower other women on this campus,” Khansarinia said.
As the only ticket with a section of their platform focused on improving freshman year, Sachee and Khansarinia have specific plans to fund cultural and affinity group bridge programs that welcome freshmen to Harvard.
“We are not presumptuous enough to say that we know what students from... every background want,” Khansarinia said. Instead, he said the duo wants to work with student organizations to facilitate both short-term and long-term goals at a much faster and effective pace.
He added that the UC acts best as a support for student groups across the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cheering and linking arms, about 200 people congregated on the steps of Widener Library Monday and called on Harvard to protect undocumented students after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election.
Trump’s win provoked surprise and concern across Harvard’s campus, stirring anxiety among students of color in particular. Of the roughly 40 undocumented students at the College, several have expressed fears of being deported with Trump—who has proposed building a wall between Mexico and the United States, among other anti-immigrant policies—in the White House.
Students in Spanish 126: “Performing Latinidad” planned the protest and wrote an accompanying petition to Harvard administrators that has collected more than 4,000 signatures. The course, which examines Latino identity in arts and literature, incorporates performance art and activism in its curriculum.
“The protest came out a lot better than planned,” said Enrique Ramirez ’17, an undocumented student and protest organizer. “I think the turnout represents the feelings people have, and a disposition to get involved after the election.”
Five students gave speeches at the demonstration, describing their own experiences of growing up undocumented and the significance of Trump’s anti-immigrant platform for their own lives.
Laura Veira-Ramirez ’20, who has been involved in immigration advocacy since she was in high school, urged the audience to “fight” the anti-immigrant rhetoric that helped propel Trump to victory.
“The fact that people didn’t think of [his victory] as a reality allowed this to happen,” Veira-Ramirez said. “We have to fight now, and we should have started fighting a long time ago.”
Bruno Villegas ’19 argued the issues undocumented immigrants face transcend party lines. “We’ve been used on both sides of the aisle,” Villegas said. “This isn’t a political issue, it’s a human issue.”
After the speeches ended, dozens of demonstrators marched to University Hall to deliver the petition to administrators, chanting, “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here.” Protesters successfully submitted the petition to administrators, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris reached out to protest organizers and scheduled a meeting for Friday, according to organizers.
Khurana joined other faculty in standing among protesters at Widener Library. He said he is “deeply concerned” over the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a government program that allows many of Harvard’s undocumented students to work, drive, and reside legally in the U.S
The petition describes Trump as “an imminent threat” to DACA and argues that Harvard’s commitment to diversity is now “more pressing than ever.”
 Calling for “concrete action” rather than “sympathy,” the petition demands the hiring of a new Assistant Dean of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the creation of an office to support undocumented students.
“The College... is currently working to identify and consolidate resources and connect undocumented students who have specific questions and needs,” Khurana wrote in an email.

Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19 say they are no strangers to the struggles many Harvard students face and are presenting themselves as leaders that can affect true change. The candidates, who have both served on the UC since their freshman year, are campaigning on a platform of elevating student voices and making resources in education, sexual assault, and mental health more accessible.
Both hailing from Michigan, Ely and Bonsall said they have much in common. The two have developed a close bond serving together on the UC’s Education Committee, which deals with issues of undergraduate education at Harvard. Ely is the committee’s current chair and Bonsall is a vice chair.
Under their leadership, the committee has been involved in advocating for a Latinx studies secondary, reintroducing the American Sign Language class, and shaping the new General Education program. The committee also started a UC partnership with Harvard Business School to promote the online platform HBX and the HBS Wintersession program.
Ely is the longest serving committee chair currently on the Council, and Bonsall also serves as one of two co-directors of the Student-Faculty Committees, which allows students to work alongside faculty to shape and implement campus-wide policies.
“The one thing that impressed me about them more than almost anyone else on the UC is their commitment to civic duty,” said Neel Mehta ’18, a UC representative on the Education Committee. “They have really worked harder than anyone and given more results than anyone.”
The duo are running under the motto “Let’s start now,” portraying themselves as candidates who are eager to incorporate student voices and oriented toward action on campus issues. Ely and Bonsall’s platform revolves around four main points: making student voices heard, sexual assault prevention, financial accessibility, and mental health care.

Both Ely and Bonsall said they believe not all student voices are being heard on campus—an issue they said was exemplified by the University’s May announcement of sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Under the policy, which will come into effect starting with next year’s class of 2021, students who join these organizations will be barred from holding athletic captaincies and receiving fellowships like the Marshall and the Rhodes. The administration has held meetings with undergraduate and graduate leaders of these organizations and town halls about the sanctions.  The policy is currently being reviewed by an implementation committee comprised of faculty, staff, and undergraduates.
Bonsall and Ely said they believe students were insufficiently involved in the drafting on the sanctions.
“In this case it seems like they’ve decided to beg for forgiveness rather than ask for permission or advice,” Bonsall said.
The pair said they have had conversations with members of sororities and want to make sure that the University recognizes the benefits students say they get from participating in certain unrecognized single-gender groups. Recently, Ely helped co-write a referendum question currently on the UC ballot, asking students to vote on whether the College should repeal the sanctions.
“We’re going to take a strong stance and stand up for women’s groups, Greek organizations, these groups that provide great networks for students on this campus that are just a great resource and support community for all of them,” Ely said.
Besides the issue of sanctions, Ely and Bonsall hope to allow all voices of Harvard to be heard by creating UC caucuses that would represent historically underrepresented groups at Harvard such as black students and first-generation students.
Another issue Ely and Bonsall believe is pressing for Harvard is preventing sexual assault, which Bonsall called a “moral imperative.” Both said they felt disturbed by a report released by the sexual assault prevention task force earlier this year, which detailed the prevalence of sexual misconduct on campus.
“I remember receiving the email, sitting in Adams courtyard,” Ely said. “I was sitting there in shock reading all 40 pages of the report of the horrors that had gone on at this university and being driven to do something about it.”
As outlined on their published platform, the two are working to provide training from Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators within the 12 undergraduate Houses and have talked to OSAPR to provide more accessible support for sexual assault victims.
Ely and Bonsall allege the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response is understaffed and that the average wait time for walk-in meetings is excessively long.
OSAPR Director Alicia Oeser wrote in an emailed statement that the office “is continuously working with the University to… find ways to better serve the Harvard community and evaluate any necessary changes to the department’s organization and structure.”
Bonsall has been involved in the UC Finance Committee’s initiative to require leaders of student organizations receiving large amounts of UC funding to undergo sexual assault training. The two plan to extend the training to the entire student body with the aim of ensuring that students can act against inappropriate activity they may see around them.
In addition, they said they hope to double the Grant for an Open Harvard College, which allocates $30,000 for initiatives that address designated “compelling interests,” including sexual assault and harassment.
Ely and Bonsall also see a lack of mental health resources as a pressing issue on campus, especially given what they characterize as Harvard’s high-stress environment.
To address this issue, they plan to improve resources by better publicizing mental health resources, making sure peer counsellors receive more funding, and providing more channels for students to give feedback on mental health services.
Currently, Ely and Bonsall are involved in planning a pilot program to have members of Counseling and Mental Health Services become more involved in events in each House. The initiative is set to start next semester and complements OSAPR’s current CARE tutor system in the Houses.
Bonsall and Ely also said they plan to tackle financial and educational accessibility at Harvard, a topic they believe has not been addressed sufficiently by the current Council. Both Ely and Bonsall are the first from their high schools to attend Harvard, and Bonsall is a first-generation college student. They said their backgrounds allow them to best address issues such as the costs that come with attending Harvard.
As a student on financial aid with a work requirement, Bonsall cites his high textbook costs as a struggle for himself and many others. According to Bonsall, this personal experience was what drove him to become involved in the student government at Harvard.
“The last generation of Harvard students, student leaders, and administrators made it possible for anybody with the ability and inclination to get in,” Bonsall said. “Now, they need to make it possible for everybody to have equal opportunity to take advantage of everything Harvard offers. That’s the generational task for us.”
As part of an Education Committee initiative, Ely and Bonsall said have already reached out to Harvard Student Agencies about starting a student-run book exchange that would allow students to sell and buy books at an affordable price.
According to Ely, their goal is to allow all students to “fit in” and “take advantage of every opportunity that exists here.”
Outside of the Council, both Ely and Bonsall are both active in student groups. Ely, an economics concentrator, is a member of the Institute of Politics and is also involved in Harvard College Faith in Action and the Christian a capella group Under Construction.
“Scott has amazing character. He is very kind, a good listener and really gets stuff done,” said Molly L. Richmond ’18, who knows Ely from both HCFA and Under Construction. “He has a strong Christian faith and that definitely impacts and influences how he lives in the world.”
Bonsall, a prospective government concentrator, is an active member of the Harvard College Democrats and writes for the Harvard Political Review. Additionally, he works as an usher for the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum.
No ticket with a sophomore has won a UC presidential election in nine years. However, Bonsall said his track record on the Council makes him qualified for the position.
“Experience is no guarantee of wisdom or insight,” Bonsall said when questioned at the “Crimson Crossfire” debate Friday evening. “Last year as a freshman I was able to be very active on lots of issues relating to freshman life.”
As Freshman Representative for Elm Yard, Bonsall was part of the group of freshmen that successfully pushed for a laundry room in Matthews Hall, printers in every freshman dorm, and an extended and expanded Brain Break.
“We want to be the ticket that offers the experience and has the bandwidth to make what we want happen,” Ely said in their closing statement at the debate. “Let’s start now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students say lecturer Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo, who teaches the popular class Government 1359: “The Road to the White House,” has largely hidden his political leanings during his classes, even though it was recently made public that Rosillo will advise President-elect Donald Trump during his transition to the presidency.
Some emphasized that, despite his personal political beliefs, Díaz Rosillo has so far taught the course—which, in part, covered Trump’s electoral success in depth—without visible partisanship.
“I think, personally, he had an opinion, but he made sure to stray away from giving his personal opinion,” said Charlie S. Krumholz ’18, a student in Government 1359. “I don’t think there’s been any bias in the teaching at all.”
Abby Bloomfield ’20, also enrolled in Díaz Rosillo’s class, agreed.
“I also think that his political affiliations have not really impacted the way his class is taught,” she said. “I did not know for at least the first half of the class that he was a Trump supporter.”
Díaz Rosillo, who declined to comment for this article, will serve as Trump’s “Executive Authority Adviser” for the president-elect’s “Policy Implementation” team, Politico reported Friday. Since Trump’s unexpected victory early Wednesday morning, the President-elect’s transition team has worked to assemble his new administration.
Also on the policy team, according to a leaked document obtained by Politico, is Ado Machida, a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, and Andrew Bremberg, an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Krumholz said he believed Díaz Rosillo’s appointment was well-deserved. He added that he thought Díaz Rosillo was one of the only professors at Harvard to accurately predict Trump’s chances in the election.
“I don’t think it’s partisanship, is necessarily why he was appointed,” Krumholz said. “I think he was literally somebody who was very good at what he did, he was the only person right.”
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, a resident of Dunster House who knows Díaz Rosillo in his capacity as Dunster’s resident dean, said he was also “not surprised” by Díaz Rosillo’s selection. He said he had known for a while that Díaz Rosillo supported Trump.
Freeland noted, however, that he wanted to consider the “implications” of Díaz Rosillo’s involvement with the Trump administration given how “viscerally upset” many on campus were by Trump’s election. He said it was hard to reconcile students’ feelings with the work Díaz Rosillo must now perform for the Trump administration.
“Obviously Carlos isn’t doing this work on behalf of Harvard University,” Freeland said. “It’s still hard to know that Harvard is nonetheless being brought into that network.”
Bloomfield took a slightly different view. Though she identified herself as a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and said she had been “very upset” by the election results, she expressed enthusiasm over Díaz Rosillo’s appointment to the transition team.
She said that she—along with a handful of other students in Government 1359, all Clinton supporters—recently invited Díaz Rosillo to a student-faculty dinner. During the meal, she said, Díaz Rosillo answered their questions about his new role.
“Since the election, I’ve listened a lot more to people, both professors and my peers, to try to understand their point of view,” Bloomfield said. “I’m glad that we go to a school that has intellectual diversity and has faculty members all over the political spectrum, I think that’s really meaningful to me as a student.”
At the close of Díaz Rosillo’s class Monday night, Bloomfield and a few of the students who attended the faculty dinner approached the lecturer’s podium and asked Díaz Rosillo if they could take a picture with him. Smiling, he agreed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 53 percent of surveyed undergraduates hold an unfavorable view of Harvard’s policy penalizing members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, according to a recent Crimson survey.
Of the 1,847 students who responded to the question, 26.1 percent reported a favorable view of the policy, which, starting with the Class of 2021, will prevent members of final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus or athletic leadership positions and receiving College endorsement for certain fellowships. Roughly 20 percent of surveyed undergraduates said they had no opinion on or did not know their position on the policy. 
The question was asked as part of The Crimson's 2016 election survey, which was open in October.
Since its announcement in May, the College’s unprecedented policy has faced criticism from students, national Greek organizations, and members of Harvard’s faculty. Former Dean of the College and computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 has been a particularly vocal opponent, arguing that the policy limits students’ freedom of association and introducing a faculty motion that he believes would strike down the policy. The motion is expected to go to a vote at the next Faculty meeting in December.
Despite the vocal opposition, a number of students, coaches, and other Harvard affiliates have expressed support for the policy as a necessary step towards addressing perceived gender inequity on campus.
The Crimson’s survey marks the first large-scale attempt to gauge student opinion on the sanctions, with more than a quarter of Harvard undergraduates recording their views. The survey did not account for potential selection bias.
Responding to the survey’s results in an interview last month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a main architect of the policy, said “I hope students will inform themselves of the wide variety of information available around the impact of single-gender social organizations.”
“I hope they will understand that the College’s commitment to non-discrimination is one that we believe is critical if Harvard is to be the standard for higher education in the 21st century,” Khurana added.
In September, Khurana convened a committee of students, staff, and faculty tasked with creating the implementation strategy for the policy when it goes into effect next fall. The committee, led by University Professor and Eliot House Faculty Dean Douglas A. Melton and Music and African and African American Studies professor Kay K. Shelemay, includes 20 undergraduates. The group will submit a set of recommendations to Khurana by the end of next semester.
Responding to the survey’s results, Melton wrote in an email that he and Shelemay “have already heard many constructive and critical comments from students and faculty.”
“Through our work on the Implementation Committee, which is primarily populated with students, we are moving ahead and and plan to offer strong recommendations to the Dean in due course,” he wrote.
At the implementation committee’s inaugural town hall in October, student attendees criticized the policy, asking administrators whether it would require students to report one another’s organizational affiliation.
Following a Faculty meeting earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust emphasized that a policy was essential to address what she called the rising influence and exclusionary practices of single-gender social organizations on campus, but said that aspects of the policy could be subject to change.
Some students continue to raise objections to perceived College overextension into student social life. Carlos R. Albors-Riera ’18 said he thought the policy “seems too intrusive” although he supports initiatives to create “more social spaces” on campus.
Brabeeba Wang ’18 said that though he agrees with the policy in principle, “the execution is poor.”
Students will have another opportunity to weigh in on the sanctions in the upcoming Undergraduate Council elections, after UC representatives voted earlier this month to include a ballot question asking students whether they believe final clubs and Greek organizations should go gender-neutral. That question joins another on the ballot—whether the College should repeal the sanctions altogether.
Current UC candidates for president and vice president have also expressed concern over the policy. In a debate last Friday, three of the four pairs of candidates said they oppose the sanctions while the other pair said they support the College’s policy “conditionally.”
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, a supporter of the sanctions and a member of the implementation committee, responded to the survey statistics and UC candidates’ opposition to the policy in an email.
“We recognize that transitions are difficult and this historic change at Harvard will not come without fierce defenses of an unacceptable status quo,” he wrote.  “As someone who engaged in a school-wide campaign but one year ago, I advise candidates to not bend to the temptation of public opinion on such a contentious issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Star athletes are supposed to ride off into the sunset on top. We long for one last memory that represents a microcosm of their greatness. We want them to end their careers with an exclamation point, à la Peyton Manning winning the Super Bowl in his final season with the Broncos.
But in collegiate sports, ending one’s career on top is often out of the hands of student-athletes. You commit for four years to a school and have to stick around through the good and the bad. There’s no switching teams or elongating your career for one more year if all doesn't go as planned in your final season. Once your fourth season comes to a close, you just have to hang it up and move on. There’s chance for any ring chasing. It’s over.
Corie Bain is one of the best—if not the singular best—player in the history of Harvard women’s volleyball. Three time unanimous All-Ivy First Team nods, second all-time at Harvard for aces, sixth in assists, sixth in digs per set, to go along with 859 kills—only 74 short of 10th in Harvard history—as a setter primarily.
More important than her stats and accolades, however, were her rings—two of them, to be exact. In the two years that Harvard captured the long-elusive Ivy throne, she was the best player of those teams. Getting a player as talented as Bain to come to Cambridge for four years was a dream come true for Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss and the rest of the coaching staff.
All dreams, however, do not have a fairytale ending. In her final weekend donning Crimson, Harvard was already eliminated from title contention after two consecutive Ancient Eight titles. So, when Corie Bain suited up for her final weekend in the Malkin Athletic Center, there wasn’t much on the line. There was no way for the Crimson to finish higher than fourth place in the conference table. Her legacy as an all-time Harvard great was already cemented.
You wouldn’t have been able to tell that from the way she played, however.
“She brought so much fire and a clear passion for the game,” sophomore Brooke Istvan said.  “We were all able to rally around that and play for her.”
In the Yale game, she played the role of facilitator. Trained as a setter, the California native did just that. Bain recorded 38 assists—a conference season-high—including one to sophomore Jocelyn Meyer to close out the fifth and final set against Bulldogs.
The next day, the senior was honored on senior night—which, as the only senior on the team, was effectively Corie Bain night—she led the offensive charge for the Crimson, a role that she had not seriously picked up into college. She registered a team-high 39 total attacks, converting on 14 of those chances. Not only did she notch double-digit kills, but the co-captain notched her eighth triple-double of the season with 23 assists and 14 digs.
For Bain, the rewards from this season won’t be reaped until a few years down the line. As the only senior on the team, her mentorship and leadership on the court shaped the young core of the program going forward so that in the next few years, the Crimson will have a chance to compete for the top spot once again.
“I learned a lot about leadership and finding strength through adversity this season,” Bain said. “It was one of the hardest seasons I had as a volleyball player. We had a lot of obstacles that were out of our control….I think that the most rewarding aspect of it was watching the younger girls learn this program meant to me and what it can give them in their future. I know that they love it, and I see their passion growing for it every day.”
Up 14-10 in the fifth set of Bain’s last collegiate match, Harvard had a chance to put the game away and finish the conference season at .500. After a Crimson serve and a subsequent dig on the Yale attack, Harvard had a chance to end the match. Lined up on the right side, Bain crept up to the net as sophomore Anna Uhr was about to set the ball. It floated in Bain’s direction and, for the last time in her Crimson career, the senior leapt and sent a strike over the net, which the Yale blockers sent out of bounds.
Then, for the last time, Bain pumped her fist, smiled ear-to-ear, and embraced her teammates. She was not leaving Harvard on top of the mountain for the third-straight season, but in that moment, it didn’t matter.
“It’s not always going to go perfect,” Bain said. “If volleyball has taught me anything, that’s absolutely the lesson I’ll take away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football is hurting.
On Friday night, the Crimson had a chance to clinch a share of the Ivy League title by beating Penn. In doing so, the 2016 team would have become the first in program history to win four straight championships.
More was at stake than the Ancient Eight crown, however. In 2015 the Quakers beat Harvard, 35-25, to ruin an undefeated season. Last year’s seniors graduated with a three-way share of the title, but also with the irremediable pang of that November loss.
This season the Crimson wanted Penn. The players wanted the matchup, and the coaches did too. Privately it was a grudge match for last year’s result, the defeat that senior halfback Anthony Firkser called the emotional low point of his career.
Well, he has a new low point now. On Friday night, Harvard lost. With 20 seconds left, the score stood at 14-14, but the Quakers threw a goal-line touchdown and then returned a last-second Crimson fumble for a second score.
Penn players celebrated with fans and family; Harvard players drove six hours back home.
The Crimson should have won, but didn’t. Harvard outgained the Quakers, 352 yards to 284, and held the ball for nearly 12 minutes longer.
Before Penn’s final touchdown drive, the hosts had snapped the ball exactly once on the other side of midfield. That incredible fact reflected the dominance of the Harvard run defense, which conceded 21 yards rushing on 20 attempts. Overall the Quakers punted nine times and relied on their red-zone defense to keep them in the game.
At the end of the night, though, these laudatory statistics meant nothing. Only two numbers mattered, and those numbers shone in neon: Penn 27, Harvard 14.
Next week the Crimson has a serious shot at redemption and emotional uplift with the annual slugfest against Yale. Rivalry games always matter, and in 2016 a victory in the Game would assure Harvard a share of the Ivy championship.
But even so, even if the Crimson smacks the Bulldogs into oblivion on Saturday, the Penn defeat will still hurt. Some losses are just permanent.
You could see that feeling in the eyes of defensive linemen James Duberg and Langston Ward. The two seniors drew the unlucky task of facing the media after the Quakers matchup, and they stared like statues.
Physically they are strong men. But behind the press conference table, they looked broken.
Who could blame them? You spend months pushing your body, you play through injuries, you get up early to do sprints, you stay up late to finish problem sets, and you sleep on buses. You give up a normal life. And then you give some more.
Throughout this whole process, you work, want, need to win. You rationalize the sacrifices by envisioning the final celebration with your teammates. Except that, in this case, you lose.
The loss came because Penn has the best quarterback in the conference and possibly the best wide receiver in FCS football. In three flawless minutes, senior playcaller Alek Torgersen marched his team 80 yards down the field. He completed eight of 10 passes and hardly hesitated.
The key play came early in the drive, when the Quakers faced a third-and-eight from their own 39. Everyone in the stadium knew where Torgersen was throwing—to third-team All-American Justin Watson, who already had 90 receiving yards on the night.
But nothing could prevent the inevitable pass. And nothing could prevent Watson from making the catch.
A defeat as crushing as this one leaves a long trail of rubble. Memories stick out like jagged rocks. The dust never really settles.
For Harvard players, especially seniors, I suspect that nothing can mitigate the loss to Penn, not even a win against Yale. There is no re-doing or appealing. There is, instead, disappointment that will fade but not disappear.
The only consolation lies in the hurt that the team feels. To an outsider, this statement sounds maudlin and overly dramatic. But it’s the truth. To want something so much that you can’t bear to lose it—that is the gift of sports.
In the immediate aftermath of a career-defining defeat, this gift might seem worthless. In fact, nothing matters more.

T-minus five days to the best event of the year, Harvard-Yale. For the uninitiated, Harvard-Yale is the biggest football game of the year, and likely the only one that will actually motivate Harvard students to leave their dorms/cave-niches in the libraries and get out to a sporting event.
Over the next couple of days, Flyby is turning into Harvard-Yale HQ. Check back each day for new information about the best way to celebrate Harvard-Yale, and if there are any last-minute changes to the day’s schedule you need to be aware of. Because, if you are anything like us, you likely ignore the Office of Student Life’s weekly rundown of campus events on principle.
Unfortunately, last weekend’s email was kind of important.
Harvard-Yale is a ticketed event, meaning you’ll need to secure your spot in the stadium before Saturday or your eager Yale counterparts might buy you out. To grab a spot in the student section, head to the following dining halls:
Monday, Nov. 14: Eliot and Pfoho  (5-7 p.m.)
Tuesday, Nov. 15: Annenberg (from noon-2 p.m.) and the Winn (5-7 p.m.)
Wednesday, Nov. 16: Annenberg (5-7 p.m.)
Thursday, Nov. 17: Quincy (5 p.m.- 7 p.m.)
Or you can pick up tickets at the Murr Center ticket office until Nov. 17, during regular business hours.
And yes, the tickets are free for Harvard students since we’re hosting this year. But, if for some reason you’d like to purchase an extra ticket (let’s say you’re inviting your bae from BC to the big game), we recommend you scour Harvard’s Free and For Sale Facebook group before heading over to the game’s official website. Tickets are $50 a pop, but you can likely find a discount from your peers.

Before The Game on Saturday, there’s an entire Friday to fill with fun (and Thursday if you don’t have Friday classes...and Wednesday if you’re a senior who’s already lined up a consulting job). So what do you do before The Game? You pre-Game, obviously.
In college parlance, “pregaming” means drinking cheap alcohol in your room (with friends, hopefully) before going to an event so that you don’t have to pay for it. Flyby makes no assumptions about your imbibing preferences, so here are some pre-Game suggestions for beer connoisseurs and teetotalers alike.
The morning of:Zoe’s (Dunk’s if you’re on a budget; Henrietta’s Table if you’ve already got your signing bonus from Bain) — If you’re 21+, and under no other circumstances, you’re probably going to have a few adult sodas on Saturday. Don’t be dumb: protein up before you toss ‘em back. Bacon and eggs will give you a proper base on Saturday so that Sunday isn’t the worst day of your life. And you know what? Grab a coffee while you’re at it. I’m guessing you didn’t sleep much the night before. Even if you choose not to drink, no one has ever complained about a hearty brunch!
The night before:HYpe: The Harvard-Yale Dance - On Friday from 11pm-2am, you can find your Yale-spouse (#powercouplesonly) at this dance in Annenberg, co-sponsored by the College Events Board and the Undergraduate Council. We know this might surprise our readers, but Harvard and Yale undergraduates don’t care that much about football and there isn’t enough bad blood that the two student bodies can’t mix.
Host your own pregame - Don’t want to live in a social dystopia where everyone is looking for a party but no one is hosting one? Then take some initiative and turn your common room into School Spirit Central. DAPA is giving out grants for substantial food, so your party can be both an inclusive social space and a mecca for responsible drinking. Potential themes: Why Can’t We Be Friends (if you’re inviting Yale friends), Blue and Crimson (food coloring can do wonders on cookies and cocktails), Geeks and Nerds (invite people on Facebook and randomly assign them ‘geek’ or ‘nerd’; see how people interpret their assignment).
Go to an a capella concert, stand up/improv show, or mixer - Check out this link for a full list. Chances are you know someone—a roommate, a section crush, that kid you ate with in Annenberg one time—who is part of one of these groups. And a lot of these are joint shows with the Yale counterparts of Harvard groups. That’s like a football game, but it’s not a sport so it’s more appropriate for us nerds!
