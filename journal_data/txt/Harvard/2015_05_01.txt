After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As much as I have enjoyed writing my “Artistic Matchmaker” column throughout this semester, I have found its tone to be frustratingly speculative. The takeaway of each post has been limited to “these two people ‘could’ work together” or “these interdisciplinary projects ‘could’ be amazing,” without any evidence of such a project really coming to fruition. For this reason, when I first heard about “battle hymns,” a collaboration among the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, the Boston Children’s Chorus, and the Harvard Dance Project, I was eager to delve more deeply into this real-life example of the type of partnership I had been exploring only on a more theoretical level. Through its amalgamation of dance, history, architecture, visual art, and music, “battle hymns” combines everything I have written about in this column so far—art as a different reality, as a metaphor, as social commentary, and as a force of change, as a universal language, as a recontextualization of time and space—into a single artistic undertaking that truly showcases the creativity and intellect of the Harvard community and whose motivations and merits should not be ignored.
“battle hymns,” which will take place on May 2, is the second installment in a three-part concert series given by the Holden Choruses called “…unfinished work…” which commemorates the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War. “…unfinished work…” is interdisciplinary collaboration at its most consummate, combining not only different art forms but also distinct academic circles. Distinguished Harvard faculty members such as professors Timothy McCarthy and John Stauffer helped develop the narrative of the concert series by gathering primary source documents from the Civil War, including letters and petitions written by members of the Harvard community. These faculty members have been listed as “creative consultants” in the concert program, signaling a genuine intersection of artistry and academia toward which Harvard’s arts scene seems to be trending, particularly with its new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration.
One of the cornerstones of “battle hymns” will be David Lang’s “after stephen foster,” a work for mixed chorus, children’s choir, and dance ensemble. This unique combination of performers invites a reflection on the connections between music and dance, which the members of Collegium understand well. “Singers often forget that singing is a physical activity, just like dancing,” explains Collegium member Taylor E. Weary ’16. “Although singing can seem unnatural—just standing in one place, having sound coming just from your mouth—it really does require your whole body. I think working with more kinesthetic artists like the Dance Project has really helped to bring that out for us.”
Collegium manager Lauren E. Goff ’16 expands on this idea by recounting a memorable moment in the second section of Lang’s piece, set to Stephen Foster’s poem “Was My Brother in the Battle?,” in which individual dancers enter into the personal space of the singers onstage and make eye contact with them. “While the singers are verbally asking this question of ‘was my brother in the battle?’ the dancers then express that feeling more physically and almost ask it back to the singers,” says Lauren. Such moments indicate a literal breakdown of the boundaries between ensembles and between art forms, enabling unique interactions between groups and individuals.
The interdisciplinary nature of “battle hymns” helps drive the concert’s underlying historical narrative. “The integration of dance and singing is part of this bigger narrative that we’re trying to paint,” says Collegium member Lijia Xie ’17. Deviating from what Lijia calls a “sing-bow-clap type of concert,” or a traditional concert consisting of a routine performance and applause, this collaboration presents instead what she describes as “a larger story told visually and orally, with the goal of challenging our audience to think about what might be missing or misrepresented in this narrative.” Clark adds that the Harvard Dance Project, directed by Jill Johnson, has brought incredible insight to Collegium and to their repertoire through their “use of art-making to ask really important questions about ourselves, about society, where we are, and where we’re headed.”
Indeed, in its effort to incorporate modern perspectives, this narrative is not only historical but also current and forward-looking. The concert will take place in Memorial Hall, highlighting the venue’s often-overlooked role as a Civil War memorial and as an emblem of a complicated, unreconciled racial and social history at Harvard. The phrase “…unfinished work…”, taken from Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, suggests that the work to which Lincoln referred over 150 years ago is still unfinished today. In this vein, Collegium member Daniel J. Hellstrom ’18 hopes “battle hymns” will extend Lincoln’s mission and encourage audience members to “think more about the ‘unfinished work’ not just in our own society, but also in other places around the world.” Collegium member Michael C.A. Leonard ’17 adds that one of the most pressing issues in this concert is addressing the unheard voices in Memorial Hall’s commemoration of Civil War martyrs: “Memorial Hall makes no mention of Confederate soldiers, black soldiers, or women … Our hope with this concert series is to get people to think about those missing voices more.”
Through its resolution to transcend both artistic disciplines and time periods, “battle hymns” is likely to be an engaging event for both the performers and audience members and serves as a sign of equally exciting artistic projects to come within Collegium and in the Harvard arts community at large. “As someone who has been careful or skeptical about the notion of interdisciplinarity, this has been a transformational experience for me to see how exciting and meaningful it is for the chorus to connect with scholars and with other artists,” Clark says. “I’m hoping that this is just the beginning of rethinking and redefining the work that we do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She found that tears were dropping onto her wrists. She could hear Lai breathing beneath the sound of air moving through her own lips, which she tried to press together to keep her crying inside. The light from the monitor at the corner of her vision expanded as everything blurred. Every few moments she tried holding her breath, but after just a few seconds she felt that her chest would burst, and so she’d inhale and so another few tears would drip down her face.
The good thing about Lai was that he let her cry. She’d been afraid that he would try to touch her, hug her, say something to the effect of telling her she shouldn’t cry. She wished the glow from the computer were a solid thing—she could hold onto it while she shook. Lately her dreams had been populated by different iterations of Lai, walking toward her, walking away from her, always a haze surrounding him so she couldn’t clearly see his face but knew, even without seeing, that it was him. Most often, they stood a few yards apart, and although the haze obscured his mouth, she knew he was speaking to her. She couldn’t hear him. The dream went on for hours. She could never wake herself.
He let her cry. This was a favor. The tears slowed. He was still swiveled towards her.
“Should I leave?” she said.
“I don’t know.”
“Do you want me to?”
“I don’t know,” he said. She felt her throat begin to contract again, and her face grew hot. “I don’t think so.”
The space between them felt too small all of a sudden. Earlier her body had itched to be closer, to merge herself with him, to pretend that she didn’t know and that everything was the same as before he’d told her. Now she wanted to be away. Even the other side of the house felt too close. “I can leave,” she said. She stood up and teetered forward, her hand brushing his shoulder as she tried to balance herself.
Lai started to move to catch her. “No, Maria.”
“It’s fine.” She began to cry again. “I’m sorry.” She kept saying it in her head. She couldn’t tell when she had said it aloud and when she hadn’t. “I’ll just go,” she said.
“Stop, Maria.” He steered her back into the chair. “Don’t do this. Just sit down.”
“I’m sorry.”
“I know.” He sighed. He pushed his own chair a few paces backwards. “Why do you always have to do this?”
Maria sniffled. Her eyelashes had clumped together, so she blinked at him. “What?”
“You know what I’m talking about.”
She didn’t know. She shook her head. His words sounded like they were coming through mist.
“We’ve talked about this.”
She shook her head again. The inertia felt good. She wanted to keep shaking her head forever, but a headache was pulsing up her neck. Lai sighed.
“Please say something,” Maria said.
“What do you want?”
“I asked you.”
“I want to hear what you have to say.”
She wiped at her cheeks, but it was no use. New tears got caught in her sleeve. “Don’t make me leave,” she said.
She felt the air move sharply around him as he looked at her. “What do you mean?” he said. “I wasn’t going to ask you to leave.”
“Are you sure about that?”
“Maria.” He hooked his feet around the legs of his chair, his torso tilting forward. “Is that what you’ve been thinking about?”
“What?” Maria looked up and rubbed her nose. “What’s wrong?” Her sleeve came away shiny with mucus.
His mouth was soft, turned down in a flattened O. Maria wasn’t sure what had softened it. She felt her legs go rigid beneath her. His face was open with what she would only later recognize as disbelief. His hands spread wide against his knees, palms pressing so hard into his corduroy pants that she thought they must’ve been striped by the time he moved to touch his face as he said, “Even after all this time, you don’t know.” Fingers grooved the skin of his cheeks. “How could you not know?” His voice yielded as a pinky slid against the edge of his bottom lip.
He continued to stare at her. He was like the person Maria had once been, who she hadn’t been even for some years before she met Lai, who she saw reflected in the way his shoulders thrust forward even as the rest of his body strained away from her, chest collapsing, stomach caving inward, a hunched person drinking alone at a party, frightened, disdainful, glazed over with stubbornness, unable to see anything but what came through her own eyes. She realized she hadn’t done what he’d wanted from her, but she’d also never fully known what he wanted—although she doubted if Lai would’ve known had it been him—and now he’d seen all the corners of what she didn’t know. She sniffed. She sandpapered her sleeve across her nose once more. The mucus from before rubbed a wet trail into her face, sticky, and she wiped it away with her fingers, touching them together to feel the viscosity before brushing it onto her pants, the scraping against the fabric almost as loud as the dread that filled her, knowing that Lai was waiting for her to speak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We may be three weeks removed from Divest Harvard’s Heat Week, but we will likely be debating the conversations it started about the proper means and ends for student activism for as long as universities and injustice continue to exist.
Harvard has a long history of activism and civil disobedience, stretching back at least to Henry David Thoreau, class of 1837. In particular, Divest Harvard’s sit-in at Massachusetts Hall was reminiscent of two earlier episodes in the University’s history: the 1969 occupation of University Hall by students protesting the Vietnam War, and the 2001 occupation of Mass. Hall by students seeking a living wage for Harvard’s workers.
The 2015, 2001, and 1969 occupations have superficial similarities. In each, a relatively small group of students occupied a major administrative building in an attempt to force the University to accede to their demands. The results, however, were quite different.
Some of the differences have to do with the institutional response. In 1969, the President of Harvard was Nathan Pusey ’28, whose default position was to dismiss student demands to change University policy as wildly inappropriate. The students who occupied University Hall in 1969 reinforced Pusey’s belief by using force to evict some administrators.
Pusey’s attitude led him to send in about 400 local police officers less than 24 hours after the occupation began. In the one-sided melee that followed, dozens of students were injured, and forty had to be sent to emergency rooms. The results of this violence was predictable: Much of the student body began supporting the demands of groups like Students for a Democratic Society and went on a nine-day strike from classes. Ultimately, the military’s Reserve Officer Training Corps left Harvard and the University established an Afro-American Studies Department, two of the strike’s major demands.
In 2001, the University’s response was far less confrontational. When 52 members of the Progressive Student Labor Movement occupied Massachusetts Hall, the University allowed them to stay for 21 days, and President Neil R. Rudenstine came to discuss the issue with them. Instead of facing one hundred police, the occupiers enjoyed the support of one hundred fellow protestors encamped in Harvard Yard. The President of the AFL-CIO, U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy ’54-’56, and former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich all supported the students. The occupation ended when President Rudenstine established a commission to review the University’s compensation practices.  That commission recommended that Harvard pay all its employees and contracted workers a living wage.
The story of Divest Harvard’s recent occupation obviously resembles 2001 far more closely than it does 1969. The University accommodated the protestors, outside support was evident, and the occupation disrupted little beyond its intended targets. The official response was also similar: an offer of dialogue on the major issue. Unlike in 2001, however, the University did not really budge on its position, nor did it offer to undertake a review of its policies.
Clearly, Harvard has become far better at dealing with student protest. The intransigence and derision of 1969, disastrous as it was, quickly morphed into a willingness to deal with students.
The nature of student protestors has also changed. In 1969, they had non-negotiable demands and were willing to cause an indefinite disruption to University life. Only when the faculty began taking concrete steps towards severing ties with ROTC did the strike end. In 2001, students were willing to desist their occupation after the formation of a committee—hardly a stirring victory in and of itself, but a harbinger of more significant progress to come. This year, Divest Harvard provided a timetable for its occupation. The administration just had to wait it out.
These differences in student tactics provide a small glimpse into what makes protest tactics effective. Like all strategies, occupation forecloses some options and opens others. In 1969, the University chose to use violence, which ultimately worked in the protestors’ favor. In 2001, it eventually chose dialogue. The protestors could have held out for a more obvious capitulation, but decided instead to accept a bureaucratic proposal that ultimately led to the result they wanted. Two weeks ago, the limited timeframe allowed the University to avoid direct engagement, though President Faust did offer a meeting.
Of course, Divest Harvard likely never intended to force an immediate resolution to the divestment issue. Given its timetable for ending the sit-in and its efforts to avoid disruption as much as possible, their action was more of an intermediary step, to display its depth and garner more support.
Ultimately, in every situation, protestors and the administration are engaged in a debate to see whose ideas have the moral force to carry the day. When administrators choose dismissive and violent tactics, they will lose that debate as they did in 1969. When protestors display a certain degree of organization, discipline, and long-term commitment, as they did in 2001, they may achieve their goals even without rallying the entire student body. And when protestors limit their actions in both scope and timeframe, they are simply laying the groundwork for a more decisive set of engagements. In the ongoing battle over divestment from fossil fuels, that round is yet to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 24, the world commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. During this period from 1915 to 1923, over 1.5 million ethnic Armenians were killed in the declining Ottoman Empire and its successor state, Turkey. Historians overwhelmingly agree that the events in question constitute genocide—Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term genocide, was inspired by the Armenian Genocide to do so. Yet, despite the horrors inflicted by the Ottoman and Turkish governments on their own people during the early twentieth century, many nations and institutions refuse to recognize the Genocide as such. The United States shamefully remains such a nation. As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, we hope the victims receive the recognition they deserve.
The actions of the Ottoman and Turkish governments during the early 20th century must be called a genocide; to do otherwise is to ignore the facts of history. Following the Ottoman defeat in World War I (in which some Armenian nationalists aided Russia against the Empire), Turkish leaders began a program of retribution against the Armenian people. Forced relocation, property seizures, and mass executions became the norm in Turkey. These actions were part of the nationalist policies of the Young Turk Party, and the New York Times at the time reported that the Turkish government “organized” the “systematic...massacres.” By 1923, Turkey was no longer a plural society with major populations of Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians—ethnic cleansing had paved the way to national unity.
Modern attempts to deny labeling these atrocities as a genocide should be condemned. The Turkish government and the Armenian diaspora both have major lobbies in Washington, and Turkey thwarts each year’s attempts to extend U.S. recognition to the Armenian genocide. Turkey has also made clear that recognizing the genocide will lead to worse relations between the U.S. and Turkish governments. Ankara doubtlessly holds strategic importance to the United States, and our relationship with the country should not be taken lightly; however, to prioritize politics over the genocide of 1.5 million people is nothing short of craven.
In Turkey, today it remains a crime—“insulting Turkishness”—to even mention the Armenian Genocide. Beyond the problems of criminalizing speech, this law enters the dangerous territory of willfully ignoring the ghosts of the past. Countries throughout the world—including our own—must do better at recognizing the specters of past atrocities. Attempts to obscure violent histories must be opposed. Hasan Cemal, whose grandfather played a leading role in the Genocide, has said that the state must apologize for its wrongdoing. Cemal is correct: A formal apology is the first step toward healing.
100 years is far too long to ignore the Armenian Genocide. As the Armenian community continues to grieve and commemorate, we hope that the United States will extend the recognition that the Genocide warrants. We also hope that Turkey will embrace its difficult past—as all nations must—and work to amend it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I think about this evening a lot. Late September of freshman year, Annenberg. The leaves just starting to turn. Maybe you remember it. Maybe you were there.
I was sitting at one of those big old wood tables with a group of people who I kind-of-sort-of-hoped were becoming my friends.
All at once, they stood up. Every single one of them. Their clothes strangely formal. Their mannerisms strangely covert. As they all left, I heard in a set of murmurs the destination: the Hasty Pudding Club.
I didn’t know what that was. But I knew I should feel bad for not being summoned there.
Freshman year I wore big pearl earrings and too-tight pencil skirts. I declaimed poetry drunk. I was ravenous, and I was here.
Harvard was my playground; my scary, scary playground. A new place, fresh, where I could mold myself like putty, where I could turn my nerves in my hands. I could make out with who I wanted to. I could sit at any table in Annenberg. I could be anything I wanted.
Except I couldn’t.
I remember feeling, after everyone left for the Pudding, that my peers must have been so much better than I was at making friends. They must have been prettier, funnier, sexier, more charming. They must have been sleeping with hotter men. I would have to step up my game, I remember telling myself, put my makeup on more carefully, drop better literary allusions, if I wanted to get ahead.
It took me years to understand that there were other words to describe what factors had made me feel excluded that night. Not prettiness, or funniness, or conversational ability. Rather: hometown. Secondary school. Class.
For every single one of us, Harvard is a strange, amazing dream. But it’s a different dream depending on where we come from. For some of us, stepping onto this campus is comfortable, if exciting—a new space filled with friends.
For others, Harvard is an alien—and often alienating—world.
Harvard is a place where we learn skills. It’s also a place where we make friends. Good friends. Deep friends. Friends who we learn from, friends we support and are supported by, friends who shape who we are.
But friendship is not just about who we party with on Saturday nights.
Who we sleep with, who we lunch with, whose club we join is not just a factor of how well we talk, how well we socialize, and what we’re interested in. A lot of times, it’s a factor of where we come from, what kinds of resources and communities we’ve previously had access to. And often, our friends dictate the kinds of opportunities we have access to in the future, from social spaces to jobs.
The network is where intimacy becomes power.
There’s been some mischief afoot: Someone, this week, posted an (apparently somewhat flawed) list of dudes on this campus in final clubs. You might have seen it by now. Besides the list, an incredibly robust discussion about gender, power, social space—and, yes, the act of posting the lists themselves—has sprung up on the site.
We can debate all day whether or not the site itself was an “appropriate” gesture. But there’s a more important underlying question here: How is this discussion about social space, about who hosts and has access to parties, who is a host and who is a guest in clubs, also a discussion about social mobility? About the distribution of opportunity on campus?
How do the networks that exist here—the networks we are part of before we even come in; the networks that exist far after our time here is up—affect, not only how we get down, but how we get ahead?
Lots of us are socially mobile at Harvard - we enter exclusive spaces with no previous connection, from backgrounds radically different than the norms of this place. And that’s amazing.
But a lot of us are not.
That’s a big problem. But it’s also a big opportunity. If our social networks can keep us back, exclude us, propel us forward, or concentrate power in the hands of the few, they can also change the world.
Intimacy, and its connections the networks that distribute resources, is power. And through restructuring the way we do intimacy, we can create better institutions here and elsewhere.
Justice in our social life is social justice.
We can be kind and respectful to our sexual partners, knowing that sex, love, and intimacy are things that can empower us or hold us back.
We can talk to our friends and peers about the discomfort we might feel about social structures on campus.
If we have access to exclusive social spaces, we can restructure those spaces from the inside to be more inclusive.
I think a lot, a month away from graduation, about that night freshman year. Me perching nervously in my corduroy pencil skirt, a battered copy of Ulysses peeking out of my brown leather bag, neck splotched with hickies, hands splotched with ink.
I have learned and grown a lot since then. I have met people I never thought I would meet, become a person I never thought I could be, loved people both within exclusive spaces and without. I’ve done well.
But we can do better. Not only for those of us at Harvard struggling to be socially mobile in a space whose norms and institutions seem calculated to keep us down, but for the broader society that our social networks, through their connection to professional power, disproportionately affect.
After all, what is Harvard—what is any powerful institution—but an extended network of friends?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services workers, along with the UNITE HERE Local 26 union and other organizations, hosted a rally around the Smith Campus Center outdoor plaza on Tuesday to launch their campaign for a new labor contract with Harvard Campus Services.
The agreement between the HUDS union and the University does not expire until June 2016, but Local 26 President Brian Lang emphasized the importance of early discussions due to last fall’s changes in healthcare benefits plans that have affected non-union University employees and could potentialy Factor into the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers' upcoming negotiations.
“Harvard is going to say to us, ‘We want to have the same healthcare system for everybody at Harvard,’” Lang said. “If Harvard is engaged in discussions on healthcare with HUCTW, faculty, and others, we want to be part of these discussions too.”
In September 2011, Local 26 and the University negotiated a five-year contract that was met with mixed reactions from HUDS employee. While the contract included an annual wage increase of 2.73 percent and the establishment of a joint committee to monitor workplace conditions in dining halls and oversee the sustainable foods program, it left out other important demands, such as year-round work for dining hall employees.
“There is no reason why an institution with this wealth and this level of intelligence cannot engage with dining service workers to remedy the problem of diminishing incomes among dining service workers on campus,” Lang said.
“There are all kinds of things that need to be done during the summer to replenish the campus,” he added. “Why can’t they offer those positions to dining service workers?”
Nearly 100 people attended the kick-off rally, ranging from current HUDS employees to other members of Local 26 to Harvard students. For the first half hour of the scheduled rally, picketers marched counterclockwise around the Smith Center outdoor plaza to the tune of an eight-person band consisting of Local 26 union members. For the second half of the rally, Lang, members of the Local 26 union from Harvard and other Boston universities, as well as Harvard students spoke, expressing their energy and vigor in kickstarting the contract campaign.
Fatima Leighton, a HUDS employee in Annenberg dining hall who spoke at the rally, echoed Lang’s comments and also pointed to this past winter to highlight the need for reforms in the contract relating to hazardous weather conditions.
“What I really want to see in the next contract is better language for us so that when we have a blizzard, we can stay home and not have to use our vacation time,” Leighton said.
Lang did not give a specific timetable for negotiations, but said that his union has attempted to reach out and establish dialogue with Harvard.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard "remains committed to a constructive labor-management relationship and building on these positive first steps during the next round of negotiations in 2016.”

Eighty-four percent of campaign contributions made by a group of 614 Harvard faculty, instructors, and researchers between 2011 and the third quarter of 2014 went to federal Democratic campaigns and political action committees, according to a Crimson analysis of Federal Election Commission filings.
During the three years, the Harvard affiliates represented in analyzed public filings gave nearly $3 million to federal campaigns and candidates. Each of Harvard’s schools leaned to the left in the contributions made by their affiliates, many by wide margins. Ninety-six percent of donations in the data set from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which includes Harvard College, supported Democratic efforts. That figure was even higher—nearly 98 percent—at Harvard Law School. Harvard Business School was the most Republican, with 37 percent of its contributions supporting Republicans and 62 percent going to Democrats.
For this story, The Crimson analyzed the federal donations of contributors who reported Harvard University as their employer and were listed in Harvard directories and websites as professors, lecturers, fellows, associates, researchers, and scientists, as well as visiting fellows and professors. The data set does not include people who only work as administrators.
Donations from faculty members with appointments at multiple schools at Harvard only counted toward the total of the school at which they have their primary appointments.
The contributions data is made public by the Federal Election Commission. The data does not include contributions made to independent expenditure, or super PACs, and nonprofits groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that engage in electioneering communications. It does include contributions to candidate-linked PACs.
The data supports the commonly held belief that Harvard’s professoriate is largely liberal, raising questions about the ideological diversity of the faculty and what impact that may have on teaching and research.
Harvard’s flagship faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, manages instruction at the undergraduate College and in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. FAS is also one of Harvard’s most left-leaning faculties or schools, according to the data set. From 2011 through October of 2014, the 183 FAS affiliates included in the Crimson analysis contributed $486,452 to federal campaigns and candidates, representing 17 percent of the University’s total.
Of the FAS total, $465,652, or 96 percent, went to Democratic efforts.
“I am amazed at how high that number is,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said.
FAS faculty, instructors, and researchers included in the analysis donated $18,200 to Republican campaigns and candidates.
Within FAS, the Physics department included the most donors in the data set, at 21, followed by the History department with 12, and the Economic and Government departments with 10 each.
The top 10 donors in the data set within FAS together donated $217,708, or 45 percent of all contributions by faculty with primary appointments at the school. The largest FAS donors in the data set include Chemistry professor emeritus and Nobel laureate Martin Karplus ’51, University professor and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, and Psychology professor Steven Pinker.
Speaking generally on the engagement of Harvard faculty on political issues, Smith said faculty at different schools vary in how much they speak with the public and government officials about topics relating to national politics.
“I certainly think that our faculty care deeply about [political issues],” said Smith, who had no donations listed in the data set. “You’ll see a difference in degree, what the Faculty of Arts and Sciences might be doing versus what the faculty at the Kennedy School would be doing.”
While the Kennedy School had fewer donors in the Crimson analysis, they were on average more generous than their FAS colleagues. The 69 contributors with first appointments at the Kennedy School gave $366,503 to political campaigns and political action committees, representing 12 percent of the University total. While about 86 percent of Kennedy School contributions went to Democrats, HKS affiliates contributed the second largest amount of Republican donations across the University, at roughly 10 percent of all Republican contributions in the data set.
The Business School’s 75 donors in the data set were the most generous. Seventy-five individuals in the data set with primary Business School appointments gave $913,015 collectively, accounting for 31 percent of contributions from faculty, instructors, and researchers across all schools.
The Business School was also the kindest to Republicans, with surveyed affiliates giving $334,850 to GOP  candidates and campaigns. That figure was 83 percent of all University contributions to GOP campaigns, but it still was not a majority at the Business School, where surveyed faculty, researchers, and instructors sent 62 percent of their contributions to Democrats.
Among its Harvard colleagues in the analysis, the Business School was an outlier. Faculty from the Law School in the data set gave the second-largest amount of money to political campaigns and committees at $692,792. Almost all—98 percent—of these contributions went to Democratic campaigns. Ninety-five faculty members, instructors, and researchers with primary appointments at the Law School in the data set contributed 24 percent of all Harvard faculty campaign donations.
While more than 600 faculty, instructors, and researchers contributed during this time frame, a large portion of Harvard’s faculty’s total political contributions come from a relative few. The top 10 donors across the University in the data set collectively donated more than $941,000, or almost a third of all contributions.
The University’s top donor in the data set was Business School professor Arthur I. Segel, whose $165,175 in donations went overwhelmingly to Democratic campaigns and organizations. As for non-Democratic campaigns, Segel donated $1,000 each to U.S. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and former Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for the state’s Senate seat in 2012. He also gave $500 to former Maine Governor Angus King, who bid for the Senate successfully in 2012. King ran as an independent but caucuses with the Democrats.
The third-largest donor in the data set was Martha L. Minow, who has been the Law School’s dean since 2009. Minow contributed $105,250, all to Democratic campaigns and organizations, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and campaigns for U.S. Senators Al Franken ’73 and Timothy Kaine, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, and the Obama Victory Fund.
Through Law School spokesperson Robb London, Minow declined to comment for this article.
Only one person with a primary FAS appointment, Suzanne Farver, made the top-10 list, with $86,700 in contributions. A nonprofit manager working on environmental issues, Farver is also an instructor at Harvard Extension School, which FAS oversees through its Division of Continuing Education.
Farver, who runs a course in corporate sustainability strategy and rarely comes to campus, described her work at the Extension School as “very much a part-time job.”
University President Drew G. Faust is not listed as a donor in the data set.
While donations from faculty across all schools leaned heavily Democratic, some specific campaigns stand out as their largest beneficiaries.
The Obama Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that supported both Obama’s reelection and the Democratic National Committee, was the single largest recipient of contributions in the data set in this time frame, at $541,001, or 18 percent of all donations. The second largest recipient, with 10 percent of total donations, was Obama’s official re-election campaign, Obama for America. It received $294,107 from faculty, instructors, and researchers in the data set.
The third- and fourth-largest beneficiaries were former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney’s second unsuccessful presidential bid, respectively. Both occurred in the 2012 election cycle.
Other organizations in the top 10 include party-wide Democratic campaign committees; the campaign committee of Massachusetts Democrat Edward J. Markey, who ran for the U.S. Senate in a 2013 special election and was reelected in 2014; and the campaign committee of Connecticut Democrat Elizabeth H. Esty ’81. First elected in 2012, Esty represents Connecticut’s fifth congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.
According to faculty members who donated to her campaign, Esty is personally connected to faculty members because both she and her husband, Yale professor Daniel C. Esty ’81, are College alumni. Faculty from the Business School, Law School, and Kennedy School made up almost all of her faculty donor base in the data set, which contributed $47,000 to her campaign committee.
Laura J. Maloney, Esty’s spokesperson, said Esty contacts all donors and is responsible for her own fundraising, adding that her races were competitive.
Faculty donors interviewed maintain that their political preferences do not impact their teaching and research. They said the motivation behind contributing to campaigns was often partially personal, involving relatives or Harvard alumni whom they respect and know, and was not just ideology or issue-based support.
“I think most faculty here are pretty careful about not imposing their political views on the students, and there may be some who do. For me it’s not a good idea,” said Business School professor Jay W. Lorsch, who donated $64,350 in contributions in the time frame, all to Democratic causes. “Students should be encouraged to think for themselves.”
To others, however, the lopsided ideological breakdown of Harvard’s core of faculty and instructors could present problems for the educational mission of the University. In a speech at last May’s Commencement, former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg critiqued what he called a culture of intellectual repression within American higher education.
“Great universities must not become predictably partisan. And a liberal arts education must not be an education in the art of liberalism,” Bloomberg said.
Government professor and Republican Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 argued that University faculty’s liberal leanings narrow the scope of research topics addressed on campus, as well as the academic conversation in the classroom to a point that does not reflect the political atmosphere in the country.
“The only debate we get here is between the far-left...and the liberals,” Mansfield said. “It gives students a view that a very narrow spectrum of opinion is the only way to think.”
Mansfield has donated $1,000 to Arkansas Republican Thomas B. Cotton ’98, a U.S. Senator elected last year whom he knows personally, as well as $250 to Gabriel E. Gomez, a Massachusetts Republican who ran unsuccessfully against Markey for the state’s Senate seat in 2013.
To the president of the National Association of Scholars, Peter Wood, “disproportionate numbers are manifestly a problem and it is something colleges and universities need to take seriously” should faculty begin being outspoken about their politics in their classes.
Smith, the dean of FAS, said he hoped that the political discrepancy would not affect faculty’s teaching, but he added that political beliefs might still affect the questions that faculty investigate in their research.
“It might have an effect on how people choose the problems that they work on in their own scholarship,” Smith said. “That would not be too surprising a result to me.”
Still, Smith said he thinks his faculty aim for balance.
“All the faculty I have ever come across have always been careful to present the material, both sides of the material,” Smith said. “They want that balanced presentation so that the students can learn from a full set of information."
Other faculty suggest that the intellectual culture of Harvard challenges students to think critically and selects for instructors and faculty members who are committed to the values of intellectual debate.
“I think that this is an institution that really chafes against simplistic adherence to one point of view or approach,” said Lawrence D. Bobo, chair of the African and African American Studies Department. “It is one of the great virtues of the University.”

Contributions data were compiled from publicly available Federal Election Commission records of donations to federal election candidates and political action committees. The data does not include contributions made to independent expenditure, or super PACs, and and nonprofits groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that engage in electioneering communications.
After all contributions were collected from the first quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2014, only those donors who listed Harvard University as an employer were considered. Federal election laws require donors to disclose their occupation and employer. The contributions were organized into Excel files via an R script.
The data set was further refined to only include Harvard employees engaged in instructional work or research: Specifically, we include professors, lecturers, fellows, associates, researchers, and scientists, as well as visiting fellows and professors in our analysis.
The donors’ employment and positions at Harvard were then confirmed through use of the University’s internal directory and websites. Details on secondary appointments and affiliations and departments were also added to the dataset.
Individuals who are deceased or who no longer teach at Harvard are also included, based on their affiliations at the time they donated.
All filtering and analysis was done in Python.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly half of young Americans reported little or no confidence that the criminal justice system treats individuals equally regardless of race or ethnicity, according to new findings of a national poll conducted by the Institute of Politics.
Respondents to the IOP’s biannual poll of more than 3,000 18- to 29-year olds also expressed doubt toward the effectiveness of demonstrations against police brutality, reported as a fresh wave of protests occurred in West Baltimore this week following the death of Freddie Gray.
“Regarding the #BlackLivesMatter protest, a majority of 18- to 29-year olds do not believe that these protests will make a meaningful change or difference,” said IOP polling director John Della Volpe. “Thirty-nine percent of 18- to 29-year-olds think these protests will be effective in making change: among whites, 29 percent; among black americans, it’s 60 percent; among Hispanics, it’s about even at 48 percent.”
Eighty percent of survey respondents thought requiring body cameras for police officers on patrol would be effective.
The poll was administered from March 18 to April 1 in English and Spanish, and broadly examined issues ranging from social media and political engagement to trust in sociopolitical leaders and institutions. As the 27th poll the IOP has conducted since 2000, the results carry a margin of error of 2.4 percent.
The poll also found that 11 percent of respondents had been a victim of sexual assault, but that only 9 percent of sexual assaults experienced by survey respondents happened on a college or university campus. Hispanic women who were victims of sexual assault were more likely than white or black women not to report the incident.
Among other key findings from the poll  is that young Americans lean solidly Democratic for the 2016 presidential race, with 55 percent preferring a Democratic president and 40 percent preferring a Republican one.
The poll found that former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds a significant lead among potential candidates in the Democratic field, with 47 percent listing her as their first choice if the primary were to be held today. That figure shadows over the second-place contender, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, with just 11 percent of respondents listing her as their first choice, though Warren has repeatedly stressed that she will not run for the 2016 presidency. Clinton’s figure dwarfs the 1 percent that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who launched his campaign on Thursday, received.
The divided Republican field contrasts sharply, with its front-runners Ben Carson and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul barely edging past the competition at 10 and 8 percent, respectively. Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee are close behind at 7 percent, with Scott Walker, Sarah Palin, and Ted Cruz at 5 percent each.
The findings also highlight a change in how American youth view their country’s role in the world. Twenty-three percent were in favor of preemptive attack if necessary against potentially hostile nations instead of waiting to be attacked, up from 16 percent in 2014; 35 percent thought the U.S. should take the lead in resolving international crises, up from 25 percent in 2014. Sixty-one percent thought the U.S. should let the U.N. take the lead in addressing these global conflicts, down from 74 percent in 2014.
“There’s a desire to show a more forceful American hand overseas,” Volpe said. “What I’m specifically referring to is [that] 57 percent of young Americans support using ground troops to participate in a military campaign against ISIS including a majority of both Democrats as well as Republicans, majority of every age group and every region of the country.”
IOP Director Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams spoke to the importance of conducting a poll on the millennial population.
“We believe it’s important to listen to our young people and be enriched by their thoughtfulness on the issues of the day,” Williams said. “Many are leading now, and our very lives will depend on their leadership and the choices they will make in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With current Harvard Law School Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove set to depart for Yale Law School this summer, members of Law School student groups—including affinity groups and the Board of Student Advisers—are working with the school’s human resources office and an outside consulting firm to formulate the qualifications for Cosgrove’s replacement.
Namely, students involved in the process said that they hope to hire a new dean who has had professional experience with diversity and inclusion. At this stage in the process, students said they have worked with the human resources office and Diversified Search, the consulting firm that is leading the search for the new dean, to develop a job description for the position. Students and Marie H. Bowen, chief human resources officer at the Law School, also said students may later be involved in the interview process once candidates have been identified.
The dean of students at Harvard Law School is responsible for extracurricular and out of classroom aspects of the Law student experience. Cosgrove also serves as a Title IX officer at the Law School, which has recently started implementing a new set of Title IX procedures which break from Harvard’s centralized framework.
Students who are participating in the search process said last semester’s protests and activism in response to the non-indictment of police officers who killed unarmed black men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, brought to the forefront the importance of diversity and inclusion at the Law School.
In December, a number of student groups, called the “Harvard Law School Affinity Group Coalition,” co-signed an open letter criticizing Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow and the Law School administration for their response to the events in Ferguson and Staten Island. Student groups part of the coalition include Harvard Law School Lambda, an LGBTQ group, and Harvard Middle Eastern Law School Students Association, among others.
“That’s something we really think is important, is finding a new dean of students who will make sure the diversity and inclusion issues that Harvard Law students have been expressing are a priority to them,” said Leland S. Shelton, the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association.
Student leaders from groups that are not part the affinity coalition, including Isabel J. Broer, the president of the Board of Student Advisers, also said issues of diversity and inclusion are primary concerns in the search process.
“We’re asking a lot of our perfect candidate, but this year has really made very clear that Harvard Law School has some work to do on making this community one that is welcoming to all students,” Broer said.
But just how to ensure that student concerns convert into an ideal dean of students remains to be determined.
“That’s the million dollar question,” said Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, a co-president of Students for Inclusion, a student group at the Law School that focuses on the common concerns of different affinity groups.
Bowen said incorporating student input and working with a consulting firm is a “unique” characteristic of this search.
“We’re really doing a significant amount of outreach because of the importance of the position for the student experience here,” Bowen said.

Students are creating an online map for Ivy League students to sign up and register their summer locations plans.
Summer Playbook—the web-based student initiative that displays Ivy League students' summer locations—is launching its map Friday, hoping to enable roughly 1,500 college students who have signed up to meet and interact with each other.
The site officially opened April 14 for students to register their travel plans, but Friday will be the first time that registered students can find fellow students with similar agendas, according to Summer Playbook founder Luke R. Heine ’17.
Heine said the initiative began in 2014 as a Google form that he had distributed to Harvard students to help students meet each other as they traveled for that summer.
According to Heine, the 2014 form received 800 signups and involved meetups in 36 countries across six continents. After last summer, Mark F. Steinbrick ’17 and Stanford student William Bauer joined Heine in further developing the project. Together, they developed the website and established partnerships at other Ivy League schools.
Daniel V. Banks ’17 participated in Summer Playbook last summer, and while in Serbia, two other Harvard students that he did not previously know contacted him.
“We ended up traveling to Istanbul,” Banks said. “They came to Bulgaria and stayed in my apartment, and now, I’m actually good friends with them.”
The 2015 Summer Playbook has opened up beyond Harvard, such that any Ivy League college student can sign up. As an organization, Playbook now has student teams at each Ivy League school in order to help integrate the initiative into their local communities, Heine said.
Although both the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard Innovation Lab endorsed Summer Playbook, Heine said the site is primarily intended to operate independently from Harvard-affiliated groups. The organization recently filed as an LLC in the state of Delaware.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week and a half ago, students packed the Winthrop Junior Common Room for an off-the-record meeting to discuss social exclusivity and final clubs. This week, conversation surrounding the unrecognized social groups took a more anonymous turn, as a blog published lists of dozens of students who are reportedly members of male final clubs.
The Tumblr blog, entitled “Hey There Harvard, I’m In A Final Club,” went live earlier this week and has since drawn dozens of anonymous comments and questions, many criticizing the decision to post the clubs’ alleged membership lists. By Thursday afternoon, most of those comments were taken down, but the lists of final club members remained archived and viewable as of Thursday night. A post explained that the comments were removed in an effort to remove any “undue negative tone or bias.”
According to the blog, the site’s purpose is to offer information on club membership so that students know who to talk to about the impact that final clubs have on undergraduate social life. Club lists were compiled by a group of Harvard students inside and outside final clubs, according to a Thursday night email from the account listed on the site as belonging to the blog’s administrator.
“The dialogue surrounding the final clubs has been shrouded in mystery for far too long because no one, especially not the guys in the clubs, are held accountable for the way the clubs affect the social scene,” the site’s frequently asked questions section read, though the post has since been removed.
As of Thursday, the only FAQ remaining on the site is a post explaining why membership lists of female final clubs are not posted.
“[T]hey are all less than 30 years old and by all accounts have negligible influence of the social scene here...none of them own property (though quite a few rent and one of them does throw parties occasionally at that rented property) and...we don’t have the names!” reads the post.
The blog’s administrator or administrators posted Wednesday that there were some errors in the membership lists that would be updated, though that post has since been removed.
The site features a submission section where students can email names of final club members or request corrections to the posted lists. All submissions will be kept confidential, according to the blog, but they must come from a Harvard College email address.
“It’s almost impossible to know for certain who is in a club and who is not if you are outside of that specific club because they are so secretive,” the since-removed post read. “That’s exactly what we’re trying to fix by opening the lists to the public.”
Shortly after the blog went up, it drew criticism for publicly posting lists of final club members. “I think this site misses the point on some fundamental levels,” one anonymous post read earlier on Thursday before it was taken down. “Moreover, I believe that what you’ve done in creating it constitutes an egregious violation of privacy.”
More than 20 students listed on the site as final club members did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peeking out between the enormous enrollments of the CS50s and Ec10s of the Q guide sits NEC91r, a supervised research tutorial in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department. Its sole student in the fall of 2013, Christian G. Sidak ’17 was the only undergraduate to study Syriac-Aramaic at the time.
Sidak decided to attend Harvard with every intention of pursuing Aramaic. However, upon his arrival in Cambridge, he learned that the professor who taught Aramaic A, the beginner Aramaic course, was absent on sabbatical.
Unfazed, Sidak approached the director of undergraduate studies for NELC and petitioned for a class in Syriac-Armaic. According to Sidak, the petition process presented no challenges, as the department easily found a professor who was willing to teach a one-person seminar in the ancient language.
“Those who are concentrating in Near Eastern Studies are generally just interested in studying Arabic, Jewish studies, or modern Middle East,” Sidak said. “When you come along and you’re someone who isn’t interested in studying that, the department becomes very accommodating.”
Since then, Sidak still studies Syriac-Armaic in a one-on-one setting due to his advanced proficiency.
"I, probably, out of Harvard faculty and students, have the highest level of spoken Syriac, but that’s only because nobody does it,” Sidak said.
While Sidak remains the only student in his class, the support he received from the College to pursue individualized learning is not unique. For students who choose to pursue courses in which they are they only student enrolled—dubbed "n=1" classes—the personalized attention enhances their learning, but the lack of fellow students can hinder their experience.
A PERSONALIZED CURRICULUM
Students pursuing ancient Aramaic and other endangered languages are not the only ones forced to enroll in n=1 classes. Languages as common as Danish, modern Greek, and even Italian each offer one-on-one instruction. Due to lack of enrollment, professors of these one-person language classes must adjust class curricula to cater to students’ personal interests.
Elizabeth C. Keto ’18 is currently the only student in Italian 40: “Advanced Oral Expression and Performance.” The course typically draws six to seven students, according to its preceptor Elvira G. Di Fabio.
Di Fabio said Keto enrolled as the only student posed a unique challenge for Italian 40, which is designed to have a group of students perform a play entirely in Italian at the end of the semester.
“Of course, I asked Elizabeth if she wanted to do a one-woman show,” Di Fabio said. Instead, Di Fabio said, they ended up talking about what her individual interests were.
Di Fabio eventually decided to restructure the class curriculum around Keto’s academic pursuits. A prospective concentrator in the History of Art and Architecture, Keto agreed to meet with Di Fabio at the Harvard Art Museums instead of a traditional classroom. As a final project, Keto would connect her analysis of museum paintings to course texts.
Di Fabio’s Italian 40 is not the only class that has had to adjust its curriculum due to one-student enrollment.
Faced with a scheduling conflict, James T. R. Loomos ’16, a Greek-American who grew up speaking Greek with his grandmother, enrolled in a Classics research seminar as an alternative to Modern Greek 105: “Greek Cinema.” Whereas Modern Greek 105 is taught in English, Loomos’s personalized research seminar is taught entirely in Greek.
“I wanted to study the Greek language,” Loomos said. “The smaller the class you get, the more attention you get. So because the class is tailored to me, I speak in Greek and write papers in Greek.”
ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER
Although students enrolled in these one-person language classes cite a personalized curriculum as the most rewarding aspect of the experience, many note that they also come with a great disadvantage is the absence of peer participation and conversation.
Mickey J. Mackie ’17, who grew up speaking Danish, has been studying the language in a one-on-one setting with the same professor for the past four semesters.
According to Rune Aabo, Mackie's teacher, Mackie’s proficiency is unmatched by other students at Harvard. However, these advanced language skills carry some inherent disadvantages, Aabo added.
“The drawback of a one-person language class is that [Mackie] relies on me solely for practice,” Aabo said. “She gets to practice [with Aabo’s beginner Danish class] too, but I’m the only point of reference at her level or above.”
Aabo notes that even adding one or two more students at the same level to the class would add to the student experience. Di Fabio agreed with Aabo’s sentiment.
“The syllabus for the Italian 40 counts on a community project. It is a course intended for a group of students–a small group of students–but more than one,” said Di Fabio, who said she would consider not teaching the course again with only one student.
A MANAGEABLE CHALLENGE
While some professors of n=1 courses claim they would prefer teaching fuller-sized classes over smaller ones, students generally find the experience to be rewarding. Mackie attributed her positive experience to the close relationship she has developed with her teaching assistant.
“Rune and I are good friends. When you’re learning languages, you talk about everything,” Mackie said. “We’ve definitely shared a lot of personal stories with each other that I probably wouldn’t share with any other teacher.”
Other students also highlighted the importance of compatible teaching and learning styles.
“You better like your professor,” Sidak said. “If I didn’t get along with them, that would be a huge problem.”
A more manageable challenge, students note, is the increased accountability they feel towards their work because they are the only students in their classes.
“Coming from a typical lazy student perspective, you’re always the one that has to answer the questions,” Loomos said. “l have to turn in every paper, answer every question. But one of the reasons my Greek has improved so much this semester is because I’m the one that always has to be on.”
In general, students enrolled in n=1 classes said the experience is worth the pressure of individualized attention. However, they warn that students interested in pursuing a one-person class must have a high degree of interest in the subject they are learning.
“You shouldn’t be pursuing one-person classes lightly,” Sidak said. “They are meant to provide opportunities for students who are very passionate and are not able to pursue that passion otherwise.”

It looks like we might soon be graced with the presence of our favorite Gossip Girl– that is, across the river at Harvard Business School. In a recent interview with Stylist magazine, Blake Lively said that she wants to attend HBS: "I have a dream to go to Harvard Business School and one of these days I will do that...in my spare time!"
Perhaps these dreams might have been inspired by the actress' recently-launched website called Preserve, a lifestyle site that also sells different types of products made by artisans. Side note: there is a tab on the website called "Blake's Closet," so does that mean we can try to mimic the glamorousness that is Blake Lively (and then fail really badly and wonder why we thought it was even remotely possible in the first place)?
Yes, Blake Lively, please come! We knew you were on the right track all the way back when Serena van der Woodsen chose not to go to Yale after getting in.

Talk show host Conan O’Brien ’85 implored students to take the sexual conduct climate survey in a video sent to students by President Drew Faust on Thursday.
In the video, O’Brien joked about his age, saying he graduated from Harvard in 2005 (sorry, Conan, we fact-check), and told students to get off Buzzfeed and take the poll.
“Come on,” he said. “You spend your whole day on Buzzfeed taking surveys to find out which Full House character you are. The least you can do in my opinion is fill out this survey.”
He later admitted that on the 90’s sitcom Full House, he would be the character Michelle, who was played by Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (You can take that survey here.)
On a more serious note, he added that the survey, which is a Harvard-specific version of an Association of American Colleges survey that 28 schools will conduct this spring, could have an important implications for preventing incidences of sexal assault.
“As members of the Harvard community, we all share the responsibility to stop sexual assault,” O’Brien said.
The survey closes on May 3.
