After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rustling of newly fallen leaves may be an iconic sound of fall, but it certainly isn’t the only one.
Every year when this season finally comes around, college fans rejoice as the sounds of their fight songs take over football stadiums across the country.
As a school that clings to tradition, it’s easy for us to understand how a few notes, combined with roaring crowds, heated competition, and fierce school pride, can turn into a ritual.
While the Crimson’s “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard” may not inspire quite the same electric atmosphere as those songs of lore like USC’s “Fight On” or Ohio State’s “Buckeye Battle Cry,” it has nonetheless earned its place in the history of Harvard athletics.
In fact, the song, written by A. Putnam ’18 has also earned its place on several lists of  “Top College Fight Songs.”
Although the most recent rankings mock it for being more likely to incite a sing-along at a Nobel Prize committee meeting than a football stadium, the “decorum and tradition” are undeniable, warranting it the No. 8 spot on one set of rankings.
Other lists herald “Ten Thousand Men” for the fact that “all Harvard freshmen learn it within the first few weeks of being on campus.” (It’s a nice thought, but we may have to disagree.)
Unfortunately, cross-town rival Boston College’s “For Boston” has us beat in most rankings and claims the title of oldest collegiate fight song in America (written in 1885).
But not to worry – the Crimson’s tune beats out that of any other Ivy League school, as Cornell is just barely mentioned at the end of one list on account of a rumor that it inspired the adoption of the lion as MGM’s mascot.
Take advantage of the next chance to join in the band’s rendition of “Ten Thousand Men” at next weekend’s football game against Lehigh at Harvard Stadium.
But you weren’t one of the freshmen that learned it your first week here? Learn it now: http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hub/sounds/tenthou.shtml.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"Oklahoma: where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain!" or should we say, "Where the eights come sweepin' down the lane?”
This weekend the latter was definitely the case in Oklahoma City, Okla. where the annual Oklahoma Regatta Festival and Head of the Oklahoma regatta returned to the Oklahoma River. The Festival includes dragon boat racing, kayaking events, and rowing, as well as festivities for the community. And this year Crimson rowers have joined in the fun.
The Harvard men's heavyweight rowing team sent an eight of upperclassmen to the Head of the Oklahoma this weekend. The boat consisted of seven seniors including Ben French, Anthony Locke, Connor Griffith, Dave Wakulich, Phil Matthews, Alex Soutter and Chris Kingston, as well as two juniors, Sam O'Connor and Mike DiSanto.
On Saturday afternoon, the Crimson raced in an 8,500 meter head race down the Oklahoma River against crews from across the nation. Harvard placed second out of 10 crews overall in a time of 11:57.95. The West-coast rival California Golden Bears won the race in a time of 11:50.08, and traditional Ivy League opponent, the Princeton Tigers, finished third in 12:04.38.
The afternoon race was in actuality a qualifying event for the regatta's grand final: a 500-meter sprint raced last night under the lights. The Crimson raced in the center lane (lane four) with the Tigers and Golden Bears each two lanes to either side of it in lanes two and six, respectively. Harvard finished the sprint fifth out of nine, crossing the line in 1:22.7. The Crimson beat Princeton to the line by 0.3 seconds but did not catch the Cal eight, which finished second in a time of 1:19.5. The remaining top four finishers were all local crews representing USRowing.
This weekend's racing was a way for many of the senior members of the men's heavyweight squad to set a tone for what will be for most of them their final year competing for the Crimson. And, with the Head of the Charles—the world's largest regatta—only two weekends away, the chance to see live competition and put in some more miles will only help Harvard going forward.

It's Oktoberfest, which means it's time for outdoor music, arts-and-crafts browsing, general carousing, and of course, free (and almost free) stuff.
The 32nd Annual Oktoberfest and HONK! Festival Parade takes place in the Square today, from 12 to 5 p.m. If you're willing to navigate the sea of people who turn out for the event every year, you're bound to score some free food and drink.  But here are some other highlights to look for:
Free entertainment. The parade, which is billed as a way to "Reclaim the Streets for Horns, Bikes and Feet!", leaves Davis Square at noon and arrives at Harvard Square at 1 p.m. We hear it's "the most entertaining and unusual parade you may ever see in your entire life." Prime viewing time lasts until 2 p.m.
Free books. The Coop is celebrating Oktoberfest by giving away free books! Look for its booth, which will be located near Border Cafe, today from 12 to 5 p.m. There is a suggested $1 donation per book, and all proceeds go to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
Basically free hot air balloon rides. For a charitable donation, you can ride in a RE/MAX hot air balloon. Find it in the Cambridge Commons.
Let us know if there's anything else we should check out!

There is lots going on on campus. Parties, speakers, guitar  groups, religious gatherings, plays...how's a kid to keep track?!  Flyby and CS50 are here to help. The astute reader might have noticed a change on the  homepage: the greyed-out Q under our Quick Links has been replaced with a far more  exciting icon—a calendar. We've added a link to a calendar (created by CS50 professor David J. Malan '99) that flows in scheduled events from dozens of  campus organizations. Now, instead of flipping through many websites to  find out what is going on when, come to Flyby and click on the link.  We'll help you figure out where you want to go.
