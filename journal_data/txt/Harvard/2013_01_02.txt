After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"December 24th, 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. From here on out I shoot without a script." Mark, an amateur filmmaker and one of the main characters in "Rent," begins the musical with a reflection on the beginning of the end of the 20th century, in which New York City’s young artists struggled to find meaning in their lives despite poverty and disease. Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of "Rent" ran in the OBERON from December 6 to December 12 and included many bold staging and lighting choices. Director Anna G. Kelsey '14 had to work with the unconventional stage organization at the OBERON, and made decisions that brought nuance to an often-performed musical. However, these choices seemed to enhance the cast’s energy and the end result was a production that remained true to Jonathan Larson’s original characters.
The vocal talent of the ensemble cast was the most impressive aspect of the show. Vocal execution is essential to any staging of "Rent" because the rock opera’s ballads are its heart and soul, and a substantial number of songs involve collaboration between characters. One particularly successful vocal pairing was that of Mark (Jacob A. Brandt '14) and his friend Roger (Berklee student Jake Ohlbaum). Their "What You Own" was great not only because they have excellent voices, but because each was able to rely on the other for timing and onstage chemistry. Every scene with Mark and Roger flowed very well, and the two actors were able to give and take energy and presence from each other.
Equally impressive were the numbers that brought together the majority or entirety of the cast, most notably "Will I?" and "Seasons Of Love." Music directors Mark R. Parker '12-'13 and Kyra A. Atekwana '14 coached the ensemble pieces to precision which made both of these renditions startling and touching. This is not to say that individual cast members did not stand out in certain pieces. Though the strong harmonies and clear vocals were impressive in and of themselves, it was the solo vocals of Kimberly A. M. Onah '15 in "Seasons of Love" that made the collaborative piece truly outstanding. The notes Onah proved able to hit made her stand out from the group harmonies, which were fantastic in their own right.
Kelsey's cast gave the show everything they had, and their sustained energy carried the show from start to finish. In every aspect of the performance, the actors were incredibly well timed—the cast kept up relentless dancing and singing despite the length of the show and remained in sync for complicated routines like the dance segments in "Tango: Maureen" and "Contact." The cast’s energy in the bigger numbers was incredible, as was especially evident in "La Vie Boheme," the table-stomping, fist-pumping crown jewel of the production.
OBERON's stage was the perfect home for this production. Instead of amphitheater-like seating, the club seats the audience at round tables interspersed throughout the room, which allowed the actors to move about the audience. Kelsey succeeded in finding innovative ways to use the layout of the OBERON to her advantage. In the opening number, disgruntled tenants were able to run and twirl in the aisles while others took to the balconies to roar their discontent. In fact, Kelsey staged a fair amount of action on the balconies of the club, which gave the audience multiple perspectives from which they could view the actors. Kelsey and choreographer Sofie A. R. Seymour '15 deserve an enormous amount of credit for adapting the musical to this unconventional set-up so well.
The OBERON’s club atmosphere also came in handy in the lighting for some of the pieces. During "Christmas Bells," a light directed at the giant disco ball simulated snow. While many of the choices might have seemed out of place in a different production of "Rent," the lighting brought nuance to this version of the musical and made the production as a whole vibrant and fresh. Yasmeen E. Audi '15 played the spirited Mimi whose solo piece, "Out Tonight," was bolder and livelier as a result of the colorful pulsing lights that reflected off of the many mirrors of the disco club. In "Contact," the sexual energy radiated off of the stage as glaring red lights highlighted the writhing and grinding bodies seeking release.
Due to the director’s nuanced staging and lighting choices, the lighting additions and fragmented staging did not detract from the poignancy of Larson's original characters. It was the energy of the actors and the power of their singing that ensured that the spirit of the musical remained. Larson's lyrics and characters are still relevant today, and the enormously talented director and cast made sure that this classic could not have been anything less than excellent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 2012 regular season that began with playoff hype but ended with the Buffalo Bills posting a 6-10 record for the third time in four years, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 heads into the offseason with an organization facing more questions than answers. Although Fitzpatrick signed a seven year contract valued at more than $60 million dollars with the Bills last season, with the head coach that developed him—Chan Gailey—gone, his future with the organization is in doubt. Looking both at the franchise and the current free agency situation around the NFL, The Back Page offers a look at where Fitzpatrick could be playing next year.
On the Bills’ side of things:
In his fifth season starting ten or more games, Fitzmagic posted the second-highest completion percentage of his career and matched his career high with 24 touchdown strikes. However, he had 24 turnovers and his QBR (an advanced metric valuing quarterback performance that takes into consideration game situations and quality of opponents) was the lowest since his first year on the Bills. For his career, Fitzpatrick has never led a team to a record north of .500 and has committed 19 or more turnovers in each of the past three seasons. However, he has thrown for over 3,000 yards in three straight seasons and has been a dramatic improvement over previous Bills turnover machines Trent Edwards and J.P. Losman.
Gailey was often Fitzpatrick’s biggest supporter but was let go by the organization on Monday. Remaining is general manager Buddy Nix, who signed off on Fitzpatrick’s contract but last week said, “We need a good, young quarterback, and we’re going to do our best to get him.” While the Bills hold the eighth pick in the draft, teams with more dubious quarterback situations draft ahead of them. The first three picks in the draft go to the Chiefs, the Jaguars, and the Raiders—none of which has a convincing future at the position. Directly ahead of the Bills are the Browns and Cardinals, two more teams that could use another quarterback prospect. In a draft with weak quarterback prospects—headliners Matt Barkley, Mike Glennon, and Geno Smith struggled late in the year with inconsistent play and injuries—the Bills may opt to take another year of Fitzpatrick rather than hemorrhage picks to trade up and select a quarterback without the potential of last year’s RG3 or Andrew Luck.
Fitzpatrick’s large contract includes $24 million in guaranteed money and drafting another quarterback would be tantamount to acknowledging such a large contract was a mistake and eating the money. After splurging and giving defensive ends Kyle Williams Mario Williams $67 million in guaranteed money last year, the Bills would be strapped for cash if they took to free agency to find a high-priced veteran option like Michael Vick so the draft is likely their only option. For those reasons, although Fitzpatrick likely will not have the same rapport with the next Bills coach, the huge contract ensures the Bills likely have thrown in their lot with Fitzpatrick for 2013.
If he leaves…:
Although a trade for Fitzpatrick would be hard to pull off or justify—his contract would be a large burden for a team to take on for a starter that hasn’t yet lived up to it—Nix may decide cutting the Amish Rifle is worth the risk. Various general managers have tied their futures to young quarterbacks—Bill Polian in Indianapolis (Peyton Manning) and Bruce Allen in Washington (RG3) are two good examples—and Nix may try to save his job by taking a flier on Barkley or Smith. If Nix were fired before the draft, Fitzpatrick would be left without the general manager or coach that brought him into the fold and could be left out in the cold.
If Fitzpatrick is released, he could sign a significantly smaller contract as a starter for a team looking for a short-term fill like the Chiefs or Cardinals (a la what Chad Henne did this year for the Jaguars). He would provide an upgrade to their current situation while not forcing them to draft a quarterback in a year where the draft is stronger at other positions. The Amish Rifle could also land as a low-priced backup on teams with little depth at that position like Cincinnati (current using Bruce Gradkowski), Oakland (Terrelle Pryor), or San Diego (Charlie Whitehurst).
Future prospects:
Although Nix’s rhetoric is strong and he threatens to trade up to draft Fitzpatrick’s replacement, the Bills spent heavily last offseason and should be reluctant to make their $60 million acquisition a backup or even cut him without a sure alternative. Before tailing off at the end of the year, Fitzpatrick had thrown 15 touchdowns against only eight picks and the team was a game out of first in the AFC East through seven games. The combination of a weak draft and huge contract will likely end with Fitzmagic staying for one more season in Buffalo. If he leaves, as a 30-year old on the downswing of his career, the Amish Rifle is unlikely to get longer than a two-year contract from a team looking for a stopgap or low-priced backup who has already proved his leadership ability in the league.

Good news, Harvard foodies: a recently shuttered iconic eatery in the Square will soon have a new occupant.
Local chef Michael Scelfo plans to open his own establishment in the space on Brattle Street previously occupied by the Mediterranean restaurant Casablanca, Boston Magazine reported last week.
Casablanca, a beloved gathering place for Harvard professors and other affiliates since its founding as a bar in 1955, was put up for sale in 2011. It closed its doors for good last month.
Scelfo, currently the executive chef at Russell House Tavern, has spent four years working with the Grafton Group, which also oversees Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and Park.
 
"They are great people," Scelfo said of his Grafton Group colleagues. "And I’ve learned quite a bit from them." Yet Scelfo said he is excited to take a new step in his career, adding that opening his own restaurant will "fulfill a lifelong dream."
 Scelfo said he can report no further details of his plans at this point, but will release more information in the coming months.
When Casablanca went up for sale in 2011, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson told The Crimson she was hopeful that the vacated space would reopen its doors.
“Recently, a Boston Globe column talked about the re-opening of Bob Slate Stationer and referred to it as ‘a miracle on Brattle Street.’ We look forward to a second miracle,” Jillson said at the time.
Here's hoping Scelfo's restaurant becomes as much of a fixture in Harvard Square as Casablanca.
