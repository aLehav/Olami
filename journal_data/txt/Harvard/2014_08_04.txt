After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Palaceer Lazaro would prefer you didn't call him Ishmael. Ishmael Butler, that is, his given name and the one he doesn’t use as the more visible half of Seattle’s premier experimental hip-hop outfit, Shabazz Palaces. The enforced misdirection is emblematic of Lazaro’s style: a past-meets-present bag of quirks and high-minded hip-hop driven by a nonconformist spurning of the straightforward. Thus, the title of the duo’s newest offering is in a foreign language. “Lese Majesty,” or lèse-majesté, comes from antiquated French law and describes a punishable crime against royalty. With uncharacteristic candor in an interview with NPR, Lazaro spelled out exactly what royalty he and multi-instrumentalist Tendai “Baba” Maraire aim to “attack” with their sophomore record: your ego, or, in his words, “me-mania.” In a nutshell, “me-mania” seems to be that often-decried vice of the millennial generation—shameless self-absorption exacerbated by universal access to digital ego-enablers like social media and the blogosphere. It’s easy to write off as old-man platitude (because a former member of ’90s jazz rap trio Digable Planets complaining about the self-image of today’s youth smacks heavily of your grandfather asking why you take so many selfies at Sunday dinner), but Lazaro isn’t some disgruntled codger critiquing from past his time, and he’s boldly willing to lump the current reigning hip-hop overlords under his pejorative. “Lese Majesty,” he holds, is the answer and rebuttal to the stasis of fame-crazed rappers, fixated on materialism and forerunning personality politics ahead of their music. Coming from a guy whose moniker has a moniker, it’s simultaneously admirable and dubious, but the prominence of unadulterated musical creativity of “Majesty” puts almost all doubt to rest.
Whereas the focus of the duo’s critically acclaimed 2011 debut, “Black Up,” rested unwaveringly on Lazaro’s lyricism, in “Lese Majesty,” it is the musical production in the limelight. For its ethereal, retro-techno eminence, Lazaro’s rhymes often take a backseat, relegated to stand at the end of stylish, bouncing synth lines, or transmitted to the listener through a haze of nebular interference. Here is that pushing of boundaries that Lazaro sees missing in “me-mania” music royalty. Right off the bat in “Dawn in Luxor,” the duo serves up a reverberating, genre-defying eccentricity that seems to insinuate through negation exactly what today’s hip-hop nobility doesn’t have. And that’s before Lazaro starts blustering about “throwing cocktails at the Führer.” The album’s individual tracks are grouped sonically and thematically into seven suites, a move that by itself indicates the the creative refinement to which the group aspires. The suites are seamlessly and often surprisingly arranged, as exemplified by the masterful way that the lurching synths of “Harlem Aria” settle into the minimal spoken-word-pace of “Noetic Noiromantics.” Such meticulousness does, however, come at the expense of the discrete boundaries of the tracks—there’s no sure-fire single here. Instead, the songs ebb and flow into each other with the fluidity of smoke fingers wafting from a long stick of aural incense.
Though at times listeners may have to concentrate quite hard to hear it, “Majesty” does contain a wholesome load of Lazaro’s wordplay. As in “Black Up,” he’s intelligent and wide-thinking, but now, more so than before, he’s gleefully elusive, perhaps impenetrable, and perhaps incomprehensible. He also works on his own time. In “Dawn in Luxor,” he flatlines the word “glitter” for four bars before he offers up the pay-off: “Glitter and gold, there’ll always be a difference.” Sometimes he just seems to be showing off (in “They Came in Gold,” “Farcical, quite simply it is him / It’s black—ephilic and petalistic catastrophic hymns”); others he’s absurd (in “Solemn Swears,” “I’m very nice like Jerry Rice.... I’m coming up like Donald Duck”), and every once in a while it’s not clear if he’s even making sense (in “Ishmael,” “Between hell and high water he froze”). But Lazaro’s rhymes are the most fulfilling when the authorial intent is ambiguous. In “#CAKE” he repeats the line “Having my cake, and I’m eating cake” between day-to-day life vignettes like, “She set my mood, I push back the rope.” The song concludes with a rather long list of exotic destinations, presumably places he’s jet-setted off to.
But what’s Lazaro doing? Satirizing capitalist greed and society’s social-media-abetted have-it-all ideology? Engaging in classic hip-hop bravado couched in a repurposed cliché? Whatever the hell he wants? Throughout the album, the sense pervades that Lazaro wants to keep you guessing, or if not that, then at least listening for what phrase he’ll turn next. That’s actually the general listening experience of “Lese Majesty”—it’s enticing because it’s unfamiliar and provocative. It’s a standout album because it meets and exceeds the high standard of creativity to which Lazaro and Maraire challenge the entire genre to rise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the six years since her most recent solo album, Jenny Lewis has lost both her father and her band, Rilo Kiley. She has admitted that the events affected her deeply and even at one point prompted a breakdown; one might expect, then, that “The Voyager” should be brimming with grief, a collection of mournful acoustic tunes in the vein of 2008’s “Acid Tongue.” But Lewis has emerged from the past few years in a rainbow-patterned suit, which constitutes “The Voyager”’s album artwork, and her music puts forward the same message as her outfit. Lewis’s folksy vocals, clever writing, and upbeat instrumentation have come together magnificently to create an album equal parts emotionally affecting and irresistibly fun.
Musically, “The Voyager” is reminiscent less of Lewis’s prior solo work and more of Rilo Kiley’s strongest album, 2007’s “Under the Blacklight.” As both albums testify, Lewis operates most effectively in strong and steady rhythms and uncluttered instrumentation. From the opening piano chords of “Head Underwater,” the album has an infectious pulse; though not rhythmically complex, each song is based off a strong, solid beat. This is Lewis’s art: to turn a couple guitars, a drum set, the occasional tambourine or violin, and harmonically interesting backing vocals into something absolutely addictive. “Love U Forever,” the album’s whimsically-titled penultimate track, is perhaps her greatest accomplishment in this regard. A simple transition from the minor key of the verse to the major key of the chorus perfectly captures the youthful ebullience of the song’s title.
But what is truly remarkable about “Love U Forever,” and indeed the album as a whole, is the dissonance Lewis crafts between the instrumentation of her songs and the actual meaning of her lyrics. The narrator of “Love U Forever” is engaged, unable to pursue this newfound love. The first line of the album is “I’ve been wearing all black since the day it started”; indeed, “Head Underwater” as a whole is a perfectly disorienting juxtaposition of energetic instrumentation with lyrics about hitting rock bottom. This is where Lewis injects the sense of tragedy one might have expected the album to have. Yet she manages to keep each song fun: she carefully avoids bogging down her lively style with linguistic self-seriousness and instead writes in a clever, subtle fashion that adds complexity instead of outright gravity. Perhaps this is most obvious in “Just One of the Guys,” an amusing musical romp that addresses emotionally complex material: Lewis laments that she can’t truly be one of the guys because she can only see herself as another “lady without a baby.” In this fashion, the song addresses motherhood and fertility in a tangential fashion, and in doing so accesses the emotional repercussions of the issue without their associated gravity. Lewis has clearly mastered this sort of lyrical light touch; it is difficult to imagine any other artist addressing what she does with the same whimsicality.
This whimsy pervades nearly every song on the album until one reaches “The Voyager,” its final track. Though Lewis has impeccably struck her characteristic energetic tone in the album as a whole, the one moment when she breaks from it is just as much a success. The song is carried almost entirely by her voice and acoustic guitar, occasionally coupled with marimba and strings; the sound she creates is simultaneously simple and otherworldly, particularly when she incorporates vocal harmony. When she sings, “If you want to get to heaven, get out of this world,” she finally brings the album’s subtle tragedy into the open; in this way, though it is so different from what precedes it, the title track constitutes a perfect conclusion. Lewis is equally powerful when she exemplifies what she does best and when she breaks away from it. “The Voyager” ideally exemplifies both her mastery of her own particular style and her versatility as an artist.
