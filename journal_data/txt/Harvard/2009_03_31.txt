After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems surprising, in an economic climate in which companies like General Motors are cutting workers by the thousands, that Harvard’s recent decision to lay off several janitors and cut the hours of others has evoked such a strong response from the Cambridge City Council. The Cambridge City Council responded to the news of these layoffs by condemning Harvard and MIT and requesting that they not lay off low-wage workers.
Harvard’s endowment, however, like those of many other academic institutions, has been hit hard by the financial crisis, and it must make significant cuts in order to maintain the quality of its academics. The city council’s request that the university keep unnecessary employees while cutting back on the salaries of faculty, whose presence is more central to the educational mission of the university, is unreasonable. Harvard is first and foremost an educational institution; while providing jobs for people in the community is a worthy goal, its primary mission is education and research.
According to the most recent figures, Harvard’s endowment fell by 22 percent this year, which is forcing it to make large cuts in its budget. In recent months, the university has instituted numerous measures to tighten its budget, including a hiring freeze and a slowdown of its construction projects in Allston. It is clear from cuts such as these that Harvard needs to decrease costs across the board. As an educational institution, Harvard’s first priority is to maintain its academic standards through the recession as much as possible. This means that some workers who are not critical at the moment will need to be laid off. 
The layoffs are likely to have detrimental effects: given the current economic state, it will be much more difficult for laid-off workers to find new jobs, and those who will be unemployed as a result of the layoffs may further burden the city’s homeless shelters and food-assistance programs. Since Harvard has a stake in the community, it should be mindful of these effects when it decides on what budget cuts to make. But Harvard is still one of the largest employers in the state, and, even in spite of necessary layoffs, it will continue to provide economic benefits for Cambridge.
If the city council decides to give Harvard a “mini-stimulus package” in order to reinstate some of the workers who have already been laid off, as some have suggested, this might induce Harvard to scale back some of its layoffs. Harvard is under no obligation to keep employees it does not need, however, and it should accept such a package only if it will not work against the budget cuts Harvard is trying to make.
The city council has also suggested that Harvard make cuts in the wages of higher-paid academic staff and professors instead of laying off lower wage workers. This would not only hurt the university’s academic programs, but in many cases also would not even be possible. Many professorships are endowed, so the university cannot simply take away part of a professor’s salary and use the money to maintain another employee. The City Council’s apparent refusal to recognize this point suggests a larger misunderstanding of the way universities allocate their funds, since endowments and grants often cannot be moved from one place to another.
The city council’s request is unrealistic and, since the council is offering few suggestions that can actually be implemented, seems to be based purely on political concerns. The council needs to recognize that Harvard’s mission lies in education and research, not in job generation, and to stop wasting its time with meaningless theatrics.

“My mom friended me today.” Not words you expected to hear five years ago, or even five months ago. Recently, the 40+ crowd has begun to invade Facebook, previously the domain of young adults, with the eagerness and awe of a baby-boomer learning to use the DVR for the first time. In their wake, they leave behind wall posts endearingly perfect in their grammatical construction and signatures with their full name (just in case you missed it next to their photo thumbnail).
The new crop of profiles hasn’t met with quite as much enthusiasm from undergraduates, however—and for good reason. There are certain pieces of information that one is happy to share with one’s friends, but not with one’s parents. Unfortunately, the arrival of parents on Facebook is only the most obvious manifestation of its growing lack of privacy. Facebook, as we knew it, is dying; by expanding into a global networking site for people of all ages, it has diverged from its original purpose as an online socializing hub for students.
Of course, this is all in the (somewhat) distant, gloomy future. For the moment, parents’ and adult relatives’ forays into Facebook can seem merely awkward. When the friend request comes, what to do? If you accept, they can see everything. Pictures from parties, your relationship status (leading to fun games like, “You’re married to your female friend? That’s a joke right?”), drunk wall posts and status updates, and photos of red Solo cups are now fair game. If you reject, they will be crushed and guilt-trip you, claiming that they are “hip” and can handle it. If you put them on limited profile, chances are good that in the short term they will have no idea what limited profile is and will be quite pleased, but before long they’re sure to catch on.
Encouraging parental interaction on Facebook waives the right to privacy so that people must alter their profiles. Certain things that could have flown when it was a college-only website are no longer permissible now that Mom’s looking over your shoulder and companies and schools are researching profiles. Profiles without some degree of self-censorship are becoming increasingly rare, but some people still aren’t cottoning on; when my brother interviewed a few prospective Harvard freshmen this year, he was surprised to see that they hadn’t bothered to restrict access to their profile, allowing him full view of information that did not reflect well upon them.
As our generation ages and we become parents, how will our relationship with Facebook change? Many will deactivate their accounts or restrict their profile to a name, bland picture and work/education info. Facebook will become for us little more than a phonebook with pictures. And, with the closing of the Facebook era, we will lose memories from our student experiences. Like it or not, many important social interactions do take place on Facebook—memories are encapsulated in tagged photos confined to the low resolution of Facebook albums, groups and events keep us connected to larger organizations, and who doesn’t love a flirtatious message chain?
But we don’t have to lose these memories. Email is as effective as wall posts, Gchat is way better than Facebook chat, and Picasa is a great way to share photos that don’t lose pixels when you upload them. And all of these are more private than gone-public Facebook.  It’s not as if we have much of a choice anyway—parents and privacy may begin with the same letter, but that’s about where the similarities end.Anna E. Boch ’11, a Crimson editorial comper, is a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator in Winthrop House.

The recent op-ed called “Harvard as Big Pharma,” published on Mar. 1, outlined good reasons for Harvard’s involvement with private pharmaceutical companies. It demonstrated a vital engagement with the national conversation about the best means to ensure global access—particularly in the developing world—to the fruits of medical research performed within the academic community. This was accompanied by a call to deliver essential medicines to the developing world at a symposium held at Harvard Law School this week. Harvard should maintain momentum in its quest for new therapies and new strategies aimed at their broad dissemination especially to those in greatest need.
Harvard and its students envision a world in which global access to new medicines is determined more by human need than by economic imperative. No potentially life-saving technology invented at Harvard should go undeveloped or remain inaccessible for want of creative thinking on our part. As a recipient of government funding for research, Harvard is committed to fulfill its responsibility of public service to advance our mission by means of a vigorous and effective technology transfer program.  In heading this program at Harvard’s Office of Technology Development, I have seen OTD become a leader in crafting and, more important, implementing creative strategies to effectively address these issues.
Harvard has endorsed the sentiments of the Mar. 1 editorial in both its public statements and actualized them  in many agreements with industry. In one policy example, OTD co-authored a position paper entitled “In the Public Interest:  Points to Consider in Drafting Technology Licenses” with colleagues at several of Harvard’s peer institutions of higher education. It is an exhortation directed at the critical role that universities must play in serving the world’s most vulnerable populations. OTD also helped to develop a master agreement amongst all Massachusetts research institutions relating to the management of jointly owned intellectual property (IP) that contains specific language requiring its stewards to carefully consider its patenting and licensing strategy in order to enhance the availability of new medicines in the developing world.
Harvard’s objective to deliver socially beneficial outcomes to the public from discoveries made by its faculty is embodied in, and advanced by, OTD’s core mission. We actively foster innovation, identify appropriate industrial partners to develop new inventions made at Harvard, and negotiate license agreements that enable the translation of such inventions into new products in the hope of benefiting society.  Every relevant invention made at Harvard is an opportunity to contribute to global health and well-being.  We take very seriously our commitment to serve the public good.
In order to deliver the greatest benefit to at-risk populations in the developing world, OTD’s strategy focuses on two areas that act as force multipliers: infectious disease (the leading cause of preventable infant and child mortality in poor countries) and diagnostic technologies. A single dose of vaccine may confer upon its recipient a lifetime of immunity against a deadly infectious disease. A diagnostic test that can be adapted for use in a challenging field environment outside of the traditional “high-tech” clinical laboratory setting stands to deliver the greatest benefit in the developing world.  
For such technologies, Harvard must retain the right to grant licenses directly to NGOs and not-for-profit organizations to practice Harvard’s patent rights to develop and manufacture products for humanitarian distribution in developing countries. Contrary to what was stated in the editorial on Mar. 1, the reservation of academic research rights is a non-negotiable term of every exclusive license granted by Harvard.
Moreover, Harvard’s agreements provide incentives whereby the obligation to make royalty payments to Harvard for licensed products that are distributed on a charitable or affordable basis are either significantly reduced or completely eliminated. Harvard actually exerts leverage on the licensee by imposing strict obligations with respect to the distribution of products to those in need, where the penalty for non-performance is a loss of license rights, and the imposition of mandatory sublicensing and other march-in provisions.    
Another example of Harvard’s commitment to global health is the Technology Development Accelerator Fund.  Launched in 2006, the TDAF provides (on a competitive basis) dedicated research support to Harvard faculty in order to perform key experiments that enable early stage inventions to achieve “proof-of-concept,” thereby increasing the probability that they can be licensed to industry for commercial development. To date, the TDAF has awarded close to $3 million to support applied research being performed by Harvard scientists.
Central to its mandate, the TDAF actively seeks out and solicits proposals from the faculty that have a direct bearing upon neglected diseases endemic to the developing world. For example, as a result of TDAF funding, a faculty member at the Harvard School of Public Health has been able to advance his efforts to develop new drugs against tuberculosis, a neglected disease that remains a major threat to public health. 
Thus, Harvard has done more than merely take its cue from private industry. It has taken the lead in developing a new conceptual framework. It has spearheaded the implementation of innovative practices and agreements that serve the public interest and aims to ensure that even the world’s poorest and most disadvantaged will receive a tangible benefit from new inventions and discoveries arising from Harvard’s research enterprise—a fact of which I am, and the greater Harvard community should be, justifiably proud.

At Chimparty Pampered Primates in Jefferson County, Mo., Kayla, a three-month-old chimpanzee, sits dressed in human clothes in a baby’s crib. In the wild, she would live with her family in a pack and range over a 3,000- to 15,000-acre expanse of jungle. Here, she lives alone in a suburban bedroom, leaving only to perform tricks and entertain people.
Kayla is one of the lucky ones. Young and cute, she at least leaves the facility when rented out to birthday parties, county fairs, and nursing homes. She may even follow in the footsteps of other chimps here and be photographed for Hallmark and Walmart gift cards.
Down in the basement, the older chimps are less fortunate. Tanka, a 10-year-old male, sits in total social isolation—he is considered too dangerous to mix with other animals and too ugly to adorn any cards. In another enclosure, other unwanted chimps sit banging their hands against the floor. As guests approach, they repeatedly throw themselves against the Plexiglas windows that enclose them.
Many of these chimps were once Hollywood stars—one performed in George of the Jungle, another was in Speed Racer—and were briefly treated accordingly. Others were bred solely as moneymakers, to be hired for parties and photo shoots. But they share a common ailment: At six to eight years of age, these primates became aggressive and, as such, are no longer wanted as entertainers.
The fate of these castoff chimps is varied. Zoos won’t accept former pets, and most wildlife sanctuaries are now at capacity. (Besides, it costs $15,000 a year to care for a chimp at a sanctuary, a price Chimparty is unwilling to pay.) So the chimps either continue their subterranean existence or are sold into lives of inflicted disease in biomedical research, lives of labor in roadside menageries and exotic animal “attractions,” or lives of exile from nature in the exotic pet trade.
Across America, 15,000 primates serve human masters as exotic pets. Only 20 states prohibit the practice, and there is no federal law against it. Given that primates often live beyond 50 years of age, many of these simian pets will be resold repeatedly, journeying in airplane holds across the country to enter new and unfamiliar homes.
The dangers of this trade are manifest. Chimpanzees are reservoirs of exotic, communicable diseases, from Herpes B to monkey pox and the Marburg virus. They are also five to seven times stronger than a person of equivalent size and can turn aggressive at the slightest provocation. 
Two months ago, Travis, a 200-pound, 14-year-old male chimp, broke free from his house in Stamford, Conn., and mauled a woman to near-death. Travis’s owner, Sandy Herold, sought to slay Travis with a butcher’s knife; it took several police bullets to kill him. 
Herold was shocked. She recounted that Travis had been socialized: He sat at the dinner table, drank wine, operated the television remote control, and had appeared in television commercials for Old Navy and Coca Cola. Herold had bought Travis from Chimparty Pampered Primates, which prides itself as a supposedly reputable breeder.
Yet, as primatologists pointed out, the attack power of a frustrated wild animal should have come as no surprise. Primatologist Jane Goodall noted, “Chimpanzees evolved in the tropical forests of Africa, and that’s where they’re suited to live, roaming in groups of their own kind. A house in Connecticut was a completely alien environment for a chimp.” 
Congress is currently considering a law to end this sordid trade. The Captive Primate Safety Act, approved by the House of Representatives in the wake of Travis’s attack, is now awaiting a vote in the Senate. It would prohibit the interstate transport of primates and should be swiftly approved.
Hollywood and advertising studios can match this move by pledging to find permanent wildlife sanctuary homes for primates that grace the big screen. Circuses and party companies should promise to stop using, and abusing, animals entirely—and consumers should boycott these companies until they do so. And, finally, all states should pass prohibitions on keeping primates as pets.
Chimps belong in the real jungle, not the suburban one.

The Harvard Law School Library has established the Morris L. Cohen Fellowship in American Legal Bibliography and History, which intends to fund expenses for scholars who must travel to Harvard to access the Library’s Special Collections.Close to 40 percent of the graduate students who contact the Library hoping to consult the materials in Special Collections are not affiliated with Harvard, according to David R. Warrington, the Special Collections librarian.The department houses nearly 2,000 feet of linear manuscript, more than 200,000 rare books, and over 70,000 visual images. “The fellowship will support greater access, especially by young scholars with research budgets, to our unique materials,” said John G. Palfrey ’94, professor of law and vice dean for Library and Information Resources at HLS. According to Palfrey, the Library chose to honor Cohen, the HLS Librarian from 1971 to 1981, for his “rich legacy in research and bibliography.”“My biggest satisfaction at Harvard was handling the Rare Manuscript collection,” said Cohen. “The Rare Manuscript collection is my first love.”Cohen, whose expertise lies mainly in the field of legal research and historical bibliography, has worked as a consultant for the World Health Organization, and law schools and legal organizations worldwide.Cohen also served as Librarian and Professor of Law at Yale Law School from 1981 to 1991. He is currently a Professorial Lecturer in Law at Yale Law School.“Special Collections was my favorite area at HLS,” said Cohen. “Yale doesn’t have anywhere near as rich a collection as Harvard does.”The fellowship includes a grant of up to $3000 to cover travel, living and research expenses. While fellows are free to apply to use any of the Library’s Special Collections, applicants interested in American legal history and bibliography will be prioritized.“Particularly in these times it would be very nice to help people to come use our collections,” said Warrington.“I am very honored,” Cohen said of the fellowship. “I hope it encourages more people to use the Special Collections.”

Parents, teachers, and administrators crowded into the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School cafeteria to meet the three final candidates for Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent in a town hall meeting last night.The finalists, Mary C. Nash, Carolyn L. Turk, and Jeffrey M. Young, answered questions submitted by audience members, which covered topics including special education, standardized testing, and diversity.“We do these sessions across the country and this is by far the largest group that I have seen for a school district this size,” said Al Johnson, a consultant from the firm hired by the district to oversee the superintendent search. “That’s a real compliment to this community.”The search has been in progress since December, a month after former Superintendent Thomas D. Fowler-Finn’s early departure from the district. The application process closed in late February. From a pool of over 30 applicants, the school committee then selected semi-finalists, who were interviewed in a closed process. The finalists were publicly announced last week.Nash, the first candidate to speak, is currently one of the academic superintendents for Boston Public Schools. She noted that it is essential for central administration and individual schools to work together. “Shared decision-making is the cornerstone of the schoolhouse,” she said.On two occasions Nash said that she was not familiar with all aspects of Cambridge Public Schools and could not answer those questions.In response to a budget question, Nash said, “I’m very good with finance and budgets, but I have not seen Cambridge Public Schools’ budget at all, so I’m not prepared to answer that.”Turk, who has been the district’s deputy superintendent since 2002 and is serving as the interim superintendent, was the second candidate to speak. She highlighted her 32-year involvement with the district and her many relationships with city residents as major strengths.She also stressed that Cambridge’s diversity is one of the city’s major strengths, as well as a great challenge. “If we build a culture right from the beginning that says people are different, then it’s a norm for our students,” Turk said. “Children understand that we have a variety of people within our community.” In her closing remarks, which earned her much applause, Turk reassured the audience that she is prepared to be the leader of the district.“I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and do some serious problem solving with the school committee,” she said. “And there will be times when we don’t see eye to eye but the outcome will be the best for kids.” Young, the last speaker, is the current Newton Public Schools Superintendent. He said one of the aspects of the Cambridge community that excited him was its potential to form many partnerships with local universities and businesses, although he added that he valued “quality over quantity.”He also emphasized that he would not impose any policies without consulting the community.“It would be presumptuous for me to say we’re going to do A, B, C,” he said.  “I am not the kind of superintendent who is going to enter a district and say ‘I know better.’ How foolish. What a recipe for failure.”Heather Hoffman, a parent of an Amigos School student, said that she thought Young was the best candidate of the three.“If he means what he says then he is what I have been wishing for in a superintendent.”Chris G. Edel, a parent with a son at the Tobin School, said he thought Turk was “competent” but that he would prefer someone new.“It seems like we could use some energy and new life, especially in the special education area,” he said.The finalists will be interviewed tonight at 6 p.m. in an open meeting at CRLS. The decision will be made by the school committee and announced within the next two weeks.—Staff writer Sofia E. Groopman can be reached at segroopm@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Michelle L.

Significant belt-tightening measures are in store for Massachusetts State leaders looking to close a widening projected $6 million budget deficit for the next fiscal year in light of the economic recession, according to state lawmakers.State Representative Charles Murphy and Secretary of Administration and Finance Leslie Kirwan stressed the need for budget cuts and budgetary redistribution, particularly in the health care sector, to ease economic strain in a panel discussion at the Kennedy School of Government last night.The panel also included Kennedy School Senior Associate Dean and Lecturer in Public Policy Peter B. Zimmerman.Murphy and Kirwan, who both play large roles in determining the state budget, emphasized that the recession will get worse before it gets better.“We are in the midst of a global economic shift,” said Murphy, who is also chair of the state’s House Ways and Means Committee. “Things will bounce back, but we are a long way away from that.”Kirwan said that at the start of Governor Deval Patrick’s term, the deficit stood at $1.3 billion. She estimated that within a few fiscal years, this amount would rise to approximately $3.5 billion.The Massachusetts state budget, according to the speakers, is very reliant on capital gains tax revenue, which has decreased due to the recession.“It’s a perfect storm. We have a loss of tax revenue, and an increased need for spending,” Kirwan said. Both speakers noted that raising taxes is not the answer to the budgetary concerns, despite the increasing gap between tax revenues and spending.The Massachusetts Division of Unemployment Assistance recently released reports that unemployment has reached 7.8 percent, which is still below the national average, but represents a 4 percent increase from January.Both speakers focused on the impact of budgetary shortfalls on Massachusetts’ education system and health care system. The budget for fiscal year 2010 will almost certainly include significant cuts in health care spending, while maintaining funding for Massachusetts schools, they said.Massachusetts currently devotes 31 percent of its budget to MassHealth, the Massachusetts Medicaid system, according to Kirwan, while approximately 20 percent goes toward schools. Kirwan noted that the health care system has “significant reserves,” which they can access to cover costs.Murphy said the state would first tap into funds allocated by Obama’s national stimulus package to cover spending in the next fiscal year, only resorting to the “rainy day” fund if the recession persists.

Edward Green, the director of the Harvard AIDS Prevention Research Project and senior research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, drew attention last week when he agreed with Pope Benedict XVI’s statement that the answer to the African AIDS crisis lies in the promotion of faithful partnerships rather than increasing the availability of condoms.“I knew that if I agreed with anything the Pope said it would cause a fire-storm,” said Green. “I took the opportunity to cause an uproar and focus on the evidence.” Citing several studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2004, Green said that empirical data does not support the idea that condoms are successful in decreasing the spread of HIV.“The Pope may be right,” Green said. “The marketing and distribution of condoms won’t solve the problem. Partner fidelity has a much better chance.”“Risk compensation” or the idea that people are more likely to engage in riskier sex and have multiple partners if they use condoms at least some of the time, is cited as one reason for the failure of condoms to slow the AID epidemic in Africa.   With brand names like “Shield” and “Trust,” Green said that the condoms marketed and distributed in Africa provide a false sense of security.While Nick Danforth, a resident scholar at the Women’s Studies Research Center at Brandeis and affiliate of the Harvard AIDS Prevention Research Project, acknowledges an association between inconsistent condom use and higher HIV infection rates, he believes risk compensation is only one of several possible explanations. In addition, people who know or suspect they are HIV positive are more likely to use condoms and people that would have more partners anyway are more likely to use condoms and become infected, said Danforth.Later this week, a group of scientists including the several global AIDS experts, the United Nations, World Health Organization and World Bank will release a consensus statement stating that male circumcision and discouraging multiple and concurrent partnerships are the most important strategies for curbing the spread of HIV in Africa, though condoms distribution should be used as a secondary strategy.  Green identifies as agnostic but does advocate for the involvement of faith-based organizations in Africa both because many clinics and schools in Africa are affiliated with churches and because many religious scriptures promote faithful relationships.Green pointed to a homegrown program in Uganda to combat AIDS, which emphasized fidelity and mutual monogamy. According to Green, fewer people had more than one partner in the previous year and the prevalence of HIV has decreased.Swaziland and Botswana, the two countries that have the highest infection rates are now instituting similar programs.But a number of Green’s colleagues do not completely agree with his conclusions. “Right now condoms are the most effective means we have available for preventing the spread of HIV,” said Abdoulaye Dieng Sarr, a senior research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.  But Sarr added that AIDS workers in Africa should continue to do everything they can to slow the spread of HIV—both distributing condoms and promoting faithful partnerships.Green insisted that he is not against condom use. “I am against saying that we are doing all that we can because we have exported so many cartons of condoms,” he said.

The Economics Department has finalized its decision to cut junior seminars from next year’s curriculum after a restriction on the hiring of new visiting faculty members as a result of the financial crisis put strain on the department’s already limited teaching staff.
The department has already lost three professors this year to the Obama administration and has also been forced to reassess its curriculum to account for the elimination of new visiting professorships. 
According to Economics Department Chair James H. Stock, only the two visiting professors whose contracts were set before the economic crisis began will remain at Harvard next year. Visiting professors taught a dozen undergraduate and graduate courses this semester.
“The cost has been the elimination of the junior seminar program,” he said, describing it as a “trade-off”.
Junior seminars are non-required courses “designed to introduce students to research in a particular field of economics,” according to the course catalogue. They are the only small, undergraduate courses in Economics taught by tenured and assistant faculty members.
Stock insisted that despite the changes, the department will still “be able to provide a complete offering of all substantive fields at all levels.”
The Economics Department—which has one of the highest student-to-faculty ratios—introduced the 16-person courses three years ago as a result of a College-wide push to increase student interaction with faculty members. 
Stock said that faculty had discussed offering two junior seminars in the next term, but ultimately concluded that it would be better to convert them to open-enrollment courses. These classes will be taught on similar course topics, but will not be restricted to the 16-student limit of junior seminars.
Demand for the small-sized courses remained high this semester. Ninety-seven of the 238 junior economics concentrators entered a lottery for 48 slots, according to Jeana Lee, an undergraduate course assistant for the department.
The final decision on junior seminars was announced in yesterday’s monthly e-mail to concentrators.
The newsletter also said that sophomore tutorials—mandatory, small-sized courses which are taught by teaching assistants—will be offered in the fall as well as the spring. According to Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron, the addition of fall tutorials is intended to “give students a little more flexibility,” and is not an expansion of the program.
The newsletter concluded its announcement on junior seminars with a request for its undergraduate students: “Please complain to your local dean that the Economics Department needs more faculty!”

This afternoon, a record-low 7 percent of Harvard College applicants will receive e-mails welcoming them into the incoming freshman class. 
Out of the 29,112 students who applied this year, only 2,046 students will be offered admission, down from 7.9 percent last year. 
“I say this every year so I lack credibility even with myself, but I think it’s the best class we’ve admitted, with the exception of the class of 1967,” said Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
This year’s 6 percent increase in applicants has made admissions more  competitive than ever, he said. 
But, ninety eight more students will be offered spots today, compared to the 1,948 students offered spots a year ago. 
“Last year there was so much uncertainty without early admissions and with the new financial aid policy, we were in totally uncharted waters,” said Fitzsimmons. “This year there are fewer variables...but we still wanted to be very conservative.” 
Slightly more than half of the admitted class is male. 
A record 10.9 percent of admitted students are Latino (up over one percent from last year), 10.8 percent are African American, 17.6 percent are Asian American, and 1.3 percent of Native American. 
According to the admissions office, geographic representation and students’ academic interests remained very similar to last year.
The admitted class of 2013 comes from a record 82 countries. 
International diversity has been steadily rising over the past five to 10 years because of increased international recruiting travel and global publicity for Harvard’s middle income initiative, Fitzsimmons said. But expected budget cuts will limit international recruiting travel next year.
Seventy percent of Harvard students will receive need-based financial aid next year, with the admissions office projecting $147 million in financial aid expenditures.
“The fact that we are in the middle of an unprecedented economic downturn could produce some very interesting effects [on the yield],” said Fitzsimmons. “Sometimes people might feel it’s better to stay close to home, even if financial aid is very good.”
According to Fitzsimmons, the College’s yield, or the percentage of admitted students who enroll, has been between 76 and 78 percent in recent history. 
This year, Fitzsimmons said, the admissions office has been conservative with acceptances, covering the College in the case of up to an 81 percent yield. 
The conservative number of admitted students means that it should be another good year for wait-listed students, said Fitzsimmons. 
Last year, the admissions office offered over 200 students on the wait-list spots in the class of 2012. 
“Certainly going to the waiting list did not hurt the quality [last year],” Fitzsimmons said. “Quite a few people in the admissions office think that it is no coincidence that the Freshman Dean’s Office has said that this freshman class is the best they have ever had.”
Wait-listed students will start hearing from the admissions office as early as May 8th. 
Until then, Fitzsimmons advised students to update the admissions office with any additional accomplishments. “Any new information can be helpful,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While recent accounts of Harvard’s financial affairs seem to border on cataclysmic, some finance experts question whether the University’s investment decisions resulted from a lack of foresight as suggested by some media outlets.A recent Forbes cover story stated that Harvard’s “supremely self-confident money managers” were in a “cash-raising panic” after billions of dollars in derivatives investments went sour—forcing the University to post collateral it did not have. The dire situation, the article said, forced Harvard to pay unfavorably high interest rates to raise the necessary funds.But other finance experts said the issuances were less the result of poor decision making in the past and more a reflection of the unpredictably volatile market in which it issued its debt. David Scudder, a former vice president at Harvard Management Company who now serves as chairman of Aureus Asset Management, said that December was not an easy month to issue any bonds at all, and that 2008 was a “very exceptional year in which virtually every class around the globe, with the single exception of Treasury bonds, went down in value.”He added that while institutions could have boosted their liquidity to hedge against extreme downturns, such a move would come at the cost of long-term investment returns.“I don’t know if anybody has a particularly good answer to that trade-off,” Scudder said.With the global financial market in free fall and the University’s endowment shrinking by at least 22 percent over the course of four months, Harvard issued $1.5 billion in taxable bonds on Dec. 5 and another $1 billion in tax-exempt debt five days later, bringing the University’s total debt in bonds and commercial paper to over $6 billion, according to a Dec. 5 credit report issued by Standard & Poor’s rating services. Despite the debt increase, S&P reaffirmed Harvard’s AAA long-term rating, citing its “strong financial resources,” “balanced financial performance” in fiscal year 2008, and its “strong revenue diversity and demonstrated ability to raise funds.” The report also noted that as of Sept. 30, the University had a “sufficient” $2.8 billion in liquid assets and had arranged with external banks to provide further liquidity support.According to Dan Shore, the University’s chief financial officer, the debt was issued “to manage our risk with previously issued variable rate notes [and] to enhance our cash position and our flexibility.” The variable-rate notes had allowed lenders to recall their principal on short notice, which could potentially drain the University’s cash holdings.“We are confident that we issued our debt quite competitively given market conditions at the time,” Shore said.But the Forbes story suggested that Harvard’s liquidity position was more precarious than Shore let on, due to the endowment slump and collateral requirements on derivatives holdings. According to media reports, Harvard had a negative 5 percent cash reserve as of June 30, indicating that the University was over-leveraged in its investments. A recent Bloomberg analysis of the bond sales noted that Harvard’s debt paid out higher interest rates compared to a similar $1 billion bond issuance by Princeton five weeks later, a difference it attributed to Harvard’s derivatives “mishaps.”But Princeton controller Kenneth Molinaro said that markets may have improved slightly by January, when his university issued their bonds, and that Harvard’s issuance may have even helped other universities issue debt by opening the market.“Trailblazers are always at a little bit more risk than the settlers that follow,” said Vanderbilt associate controller Kevin R. Walker, who called criticism of Harvard’s December debt issuance unfair and said the current economic crisis is a black swan. “There was tremendous uncertainty [in the fall] with Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG, and I don’t think anybody knew what was going to happen.”John F. Flahive, a vice president at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which purchased $10 million of Harvard’s tax-exempt bonds, said that he does not think the bonds’ rates were inappropriate, nor does he think that the University’s collateral obligations forced financiers to issue debt at unfavorable rates.“[There are] a lot of things they could have used the money for in an overall capital perspective,” Flahive said. “The underwriters were in a difficult environment and they did the best they could. In hindsight, everything’s 20-20.” He also said that if rates fall dramatically, the law governing tax-exempt debt financing gives issuers one opportunity to pay off their debt and reissue the bonds at the lower rate.‘THE SUMMERS SWAP’While documentation of the $1.5 billion bond sale could not be obtained because the sale was taxable, a prospectus of the $1 billion tax-exempt offering states that $881 million was to be used to pay off previously-issued variable rate debt and commercial debt, while $99 million would be used to terminate interest rate swap agreements that had been used to hedge risk from the variable debt.According to the University’s annual financial report issued in October, “the interest rate exchange rate agreements were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes,” but were rather used to convert variable-rate borrowings to a fixed rate. The Forbes and Bloomberg stories stated that the interest rate swaps dated back to former University President Lawrence H. Summers’ tenure, when Harvard began considering its ambitious Allston campus expansion. With interest rates favorably low and little inflation on the horizon, the University decided to use the swaps to lock in the rates. But instead, interest continued to decline, wreaking havoc on the swaps, which Forbes branded “The Summers Swap.”As of October, the University would have had to pay $571 million to terminate its interest rate swap portfolio. The figure represents a stark decrease from the $330 million Harvard would have had to pay at the end of June 30, a figure  given in the annual financial report.Even though Molinaro said Princeton has never used interest rate swaps with regard to its debt portfolio because they decided “the incremental risk was not worth the modest savings” of a lower interest rate, Scudder said that such swaps are widely used by institutions seeking to reduce exposure to variable rate bonds.Shore declined to comment yesterday on the current value of the swap portfolio, and would not say whether more of the swaps had been terminated beyond the $99 million from the tax-exempt bond sale.—Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year-long stint at a European investment bank and another at Enron, Iris M. Mack signed on to be a quantitative analyst for Harvard Management Company in early 2002, hoping, she says, to find job security and distance from the risky trading and accounting practices that forced her last employer into bankruptcy in the company charged with managing Harvard’s endowment.
But only a few months later, Mack says she was fired after she raised concerns to University officials about managers’ qualifications and possibly irresponsible usage of financial instruments that could have contributed to the recent and sudden decline in Harvard’s endowment. 
In an e-mail sent May 30, 2002 to Marne Levine, chief of staff for then-Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers, Mack detailed her concerns regarding what she deemed HMC’s “frightening” usage of derivatives and statistical modeling techniques, as well as the Company’s lack of a timely and portfolio-wide risk management system, high employee turnover rate, and low level of productivity in the workplace, specifically among managers.
According to documents and e-mail records, all provided by Mack, Levine had initially assured Mack that their correspondence would remain confidential. But on July 1, HMC chief Jack R. Meyer called Mack into a meeting, in which she was presented with copies of her e-mails, according to a letter sent to Levine and Summers by Mack’s attorney.
The next day, Meyer dismissed Mack, pointing to “these baseless allegations against HMC [that you sent] to individuals outside of HMC,” the letter says. 
Meyer declined to comment for this story, and Levine could not be reached.  
Harvard spokesman John D. Longbrake says that while the University does not comment on the specifics of personnel cases, “all allegations brought to the attention of the Management Company and its board are taken seriously and investigated thoroughly in order to ensure the integrity of HMC processes.” He further points to HMC’s average annual investment return of 13.8 percent over the 10 years up through 2008 as evidence of the Company’s “strong portfolio management, personnel and risk management systems.” 
But Mack, a derivatives researcher for Enron before coming to HMC, says she was “shocked” by the mishandling and ignorance of derivatives at the HMC international equities division where she worked, led by Jeffrey B. Larson. At the time, Mack says, Larson’s group had only recently begun exploring more sophisticated financial instruments such as credit default swaps and capital structure arbitrage.
And while she says her concerns were dismissed at the time, recent market turbulence has called into question the use of some of these financial instruments, lending more credibility to Mack’s criticisms.
After years of soaring returns, the University's endowment plunged at least 22 percent in the four months starting July 1, and Harvard officials are projecting a decline of 30 percent for the full year.
“The group I was working for had no background whatsoever to be working on those,” Mack says, adding that, to her knowledge, several of her colleagues were not licensed securities traders. “Sometimes the ways they handled even basic Black-Scholes models [widely used to price stock options] were puzzling.” 
THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT
A 13-year veteran of HMC, Larson delivered 11.6 percent average annual gains in his section of the Company’s portfolio for the five years prior to his departure, blowing past the 4.1 percent benchmark for his asset class, according to the Boston Globe.
Larson left HMC in 2004 with a $500 million initial investment from Harvard to start his own hedge fund, Sowood Capital Management. But Sowood collapsed in 2007 due to heavily leveraged investments in corporate debt—making national headlines as one of the first high-profile hedge fund implosions of the subprime mortgage crisis—costing Harvard $350 million.
Mack stresses that she has nothing personal against Larson and that he was a very adept stock trader, but that he “had no background to be trading derivatives.”
Larson could not be reached by phone for comment at his Wellesley home over the past week.
According to Harvard’s annual financial statement issued in October, the University continues to use a variety of financial instruments with undisclosed risk—including options, forwards, credit default swaps, and exchange agreements—to gain exposure to various asset classes without having to actually invest in those assets.
And the instruments performed well. The net ending fair value [or net gains/losses] of these equity, fixed-income, commodity, currency, and credit instruments totaled over $600 million as of June 30, representing a gain from the $100 million in net ending fair value from the previous year.
But that was before the bottom fell out from nearly every asset class. While some of the instruments, such as credit default swaps, may have hedged against the downturn, other derivative holdings have cost the University dearly. Harvard’s investments in interest-rate swaps, one class of derivative that may be used by both HMC and the University budget office to hedge against interests rate changes on variable-rate debt, would have cost $571 million to terminate as of Oct. 2008, according to a credit rating report from financial rating company Standard and Poor’s.
For his part, Larson appears to have adopted a more conservative investing approach. Last May, he was widely reported to have plans for a new firm to manage what marketing documents obtained by Reuters billed as a less risky, “limited leverage, value driven portfolio.”
‘VINDICATED’
Ultimately, Mack says she reached an out-of-court settlement with Harvard over her firing because her lawyers felt that the University did not want to attract media attention from the dismissal, and that the case could be dragged out over a long period, making it difficult to litigate.
Jonathan J. Margolis, an employment lawyer with Boston-based Rodgers, Powers & Schwartz LLP who provided counsel for Mack, wrote in a letter to Summers and Levine dated July 24, 2002 and provided by Mack that “Harvard University wrongly and unlawfully interfered with Ms. Mack’s contractual and advantageous relations with Harvard Management Company.” He further suggested that they contact him as soon as possible to explore informal resolutions to the incident if they wished to avoid a lawsuit.
Ultimately it was Philip Hilder—the lawyer who had represented the Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins in Congressional hearings following the company’s collapse—who secured the settlement from Harvard.  
Hilder says that he remembered Mack’s case and that while he could not discuss the specifics of the settlement, it is notable that “she had the foresight to see derivatives as a problem as early as she did.”
Mack says that while the initial severance package offered to her by Harvard was scant and restrictive—Margolis’ letter to Summers and Levine says it consisted of little more than a bonus she had received before the incident—she reached a more acceptable settlement seven months later. Mack says that her settlement with Harvard forbids her to discuss the specific terms of the agreement or to distribute “Harvard’s property,” which includes the dismissal letter from Meyer.  
Now, with the economy in an unprecedented slump in part due to the widespread and unregulated use of derivative contracts, Mack says she feels “vindicated” but also sad.  
“I’m not trying to pretend I’m omniscient or anything, but a lot of people who were quantitative traders, in the back of our minds, we knew a lot of these models were just that: guestimates,” Mack says. “I have mixed feelings, on the one hand, I wasn’t crazy, I knew what I was talking about. But maybe if more and more people had spoken up, the economy wouldn’t be the way it is now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council discussed potential changes to the Council’s structure during their general meeting yesterday.In response to the Dowling Report, which was released March 2, UC members debated alternatives to its committee structure, the size of the Council, and the timing of elections.The Dowling Report, a review charged with the task of considering student governance on campus, raised several issues that would require the UC to amend its constitution in order for the changes to be implemented.The report recommended that the UC’s Finance Committee have a rotating membership, but that idea received some resistance from Council members.“I think that everyone’s in agreement about FiCom in that there needs to be institutional memory,” said Sundeep S. Iyer ’11, FiCom chair, referring to the concern that a rotating membership would detract from the committee’s ability to make consistent decisions.UC representatives also discussed the reports recommendation that the Student Affairs Committee split into three separate bodies. Daniel V. Kroop ’10, the Student Relations Committee chair, agreed with the suggestion that SAC be divided and suggested that each member of the UC be assigned to an additional committee—either SRC, the Rules Committee, or FiCom.Tamar Holoshitz ’10, SAC chair, said she thought that the Council’s advocacy goals would be better served if there were two advocacy committees.“One thing to consider is the three committees inevitably have a huge amount of overlap,” she said.The UC discussed the merits of increasing its membership to three people per district during the meeting.The discussion was only the beginning of the UC’s effort to reevaluate it’s structure in light of the Dowling Report. Discussions will take place in FiCom and SAC committee meetings this week and will continue throughout the semester.UC parliamentarian Eric N. Hysen ’11, who helped to facilitate the meeting, said he expected the process would be completed around pre-frosh weekend.—Staff writer Brittany M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the top of the 10th inning in the second game of the Harvard baseball team’s Monday doubleheader at Penn. Two outs, nobody on, senior outfielder Matt Rogers at the plate.Rather than attack the slugger or even pitch him carefully, the Quakers opt to hand Rogers a free pass—a dangerous move considering Rogers went 12-for-12 in steal attempts last season.But who could blame them? After all, Rogers had already belted two home runs in the game and knocked in five RBI over the course of the day’s twinbill.“I don’t think I’ve ever seen this in a Harvard uniform before,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh says. “I don’t think you’d see that unless you’re a San Francisco Giants fan in 2007, if you know what I mean.”The allusion to Barry Bonds—for slugging, not juicing, of course—is indicative of the sort of year that the Paoli, PA, native is having so far.After a slow start, Rogers has been on an absolute tear over the past few weeks. His slugging percentage stands at a whopping .729. He’s hit five homers and has driven in 19 runs. He leads his team in every major hitting category.But Harvard’s opponents can’t get too comfortable walking Rogers. That’s because hitting right behind him is captain Harry Douglas. The Crimson’s cleanup slugger has been putting together quite a season himself. After Rogers nailed his second home run of Monday’s game in the ninth to pull the Crimson to within one, Douglas managed to single to left field, maintaining momentum and keeping the rally going. While it may have been less flashy, the senior would go onto score the tying run, sending the game to extra innings.“He has no ego and just wants to be a contributor on the team,” Walsh says of Douglas.Douglas’s contributions, though, have often been far from quiet. He’s hit 3 home runs, knocked in 14 runs, and was named to the Ivy League honor roll last week. Together, Rogers and Douglas form a terrifying proposition for any pitcher facing the third and fourth spots in the Harvard order.What a difference a year can make. The entire squad struggled substantially in 2008, and Rogers and Douglas were no exception. In fact, the duo had the two lowest batting averages of any of the team’s regulars.Rogers was expected to build off his strong 2007 campaign and help the Crimson push for the Ivy League title. It didn’t happen.Meanwhile, after an arm injury kept him out of most of his sophomore season, Douglas announced his inclusion as an every-day player with a bang, hitting two homers—including a grand slam—in a season-opening series at then-16th-ranked Wichita State. Unfortunately, that would be as good as it would get for the South River, N.J. native. Douglas trailed off dramatically, finishing the season below the Mendoza Line with a .194 batting average.“Obviously last year was disappointing, so you look back and try to learn from it,” Rogers says.It’s a completely different story in 2009 for the two veterans. Rogers has raised his average by more than 200 points, while Douglas has raised his by over 100. Already, each player has either equaled or surpassed his 2008 mark for home runs, RBI, and hits.Until now, neither had really put together the type of season he knew he was capable of producing. But while the players have both made huge strides this year, their improvements have been the result of two very different approaches.Rogers says that he looks to stay relaxed and let the power come naturally.    “I really try not to overthink it,” he says. “I didn’t really revamp my swing or the way I play, but I just try to slow it down and work on little things, like hitting the ball the other way. Then everything else sort of falls into place.”According to Walsh, Rogers has also gotten better at prolonging at-bats, giving himself more opportunities to crush one over the fence.“He used to have trouble with offspeed pitches, but now he’s battling those off” Walsh notes. “He’s also gotten much better at fighting when he’s behind in the count. He’s figured it out, fouling off some pitches...I always felt he was on the verge of putting it together.”Rogers tries to sit back and let the pitch come to him. He then uses his quick hands and tremendous bat speed. But for Douglas, a change in mindset was necessary for his renaissance.“Last year I was passive, waiting for the perfect pitch to hit,” he says. “This year, I’m trying to really go after pitches when I feel I can drive the ball.”Combine this new aggressiveness with more at-bats and a countless number of hours spent in the batting cages, and you get a whole new threat in the middle of the Crimson lineup. “The way he’s hitting right now sets a tone for the rest of the team,” Rogers says of Douglas. “I give him a lot of the credit for the way I’ve been hitting. It’s going to rub off on the other guys and we’ll see a lot more wins out of it soon.”After his sluggish end to last season, consistency has also been a focus for Douglas. He is the only player to start every game and continues to lead by example with his work ethic.When the Crimson takes on Holy Cross in its home opener this afternoon, the Crusaders will be hoping to slow down a Harvard offense that has been producing runs almost at will. When they do, there is little doubt where they will direct their attention; the focus will be on two seniors who have had an incredible first half of the season.“If you’d have told me those guys would be in the heart of our lineup a couple years ago, I might not have predicted it, but they’re really proving themselves this year,” Walsh says.For a Crimson squad with a depleted pitching staff and a desperate need for wins, it’s a good thing they are doing just that.—Staff writer Jay M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the sudden departure of superstar junior Lauren Murphy, Harvard softball not only lost its starting first baseman, but also the team’s biggest power hitter.Though filling the shoes of such a player—who ranks first in Crimson history in career slugging percentage at .680 and helped lead the team to the Ivy League championship tournament final last season—would seem to be a tall order for any team, Harvard has already found a worthy replacement. Enter freshman Whitney Shaw.The rookie has stepped seamlessly into the role of starting first baseman, already sporting a .976 fielding percentage with 77 putouts on the season.Even more impressive have been Shaw’s statistics at bat. She leads the team in batting average at .317 and on base percentage at .474. Furthermore, with a slugging percentage of .439, the rookie is second only to co-captain Hayley Bock. Just last week she tallied her first collegiate home run against Bryant.“[Shaw’s] really stepped up into the role of first base and is doing a great job,” Bock said. “She just has so much power behind her swing. There’s just so much power that she’s really intimidating pitchers. It’s really exciting to see that in a freshman.”However, commanding an intimidating presence at the plate is no new feat for the San Francisco, Calif. native. Starting in the third grade and playing year-round in the Golden State ever since has given Shaw plenty of preparation for her first season in the Ivy League. And Shaw didn’t just play softball in high school, she excelled—garnering just about every possible accolade a prep school player could achieve. She was named Rookie of the Year her freshman season, MVP her sophomore year and finally team captain her senior spring, leading her squad to an undefeated record and NCS division title. “Coming from California, we have the ability to play year round,” Shaw said. “I really enjoyed it and when I had the opportunity to do it in college, I thought why not? I enjoyed the people around me and had a good time.”For Shaw, playing college ball at Harvard was the natural choice. The prospect of enjoying high-level academics while also contributing to an already strong softball program was too good of an opportunity to pass up. “I really love the team dynamic and how people are able to balance academics and schoolwork while playing a sport at a high level,” Shaw said. “I knew we did well in league and we always had the potential to do more.”Since she arrived in Cambridge, Shaw has certainly made clear the impact that she can have on the Crimson squad by winning a starting position early on in her rookie season. The first-year made her first collegiate start at the Miken Classic in Boca Raton, Fla. early this March and has been the consistent presence at first base ever since the Highlander Classic played over spring break. “It means a lot [to start],” Shaw said. “Coming out, one of my biggest goals was to earn that position.”Though Shaw primarily played at third in high school, the rookie was more than ready to step up to the job of first baseman when the opportunity arose. “I’ve always practicing there so I was more than ready to step up for the challenge and I knew that Coach needed me and the team needed me,” Shaw said. “I had played first base before so it wasn’t like it was completely foreign to me.”Shaw has also found her way into the top of the batting lineup. While acting primarily as a designated hitter in the first games of the season, she has since secured herself as No. 3 in the rotation with 41 appearances at bat and 10 RBI on the season. “I’ve always been a power hitter more so than a flapper,” Shaw said. “I’m definitely comfortable in one of the 3-4-5 positions.”The Crimson will certainly rely on Shaw’s versatility this season as it looks to take back the Ivy crown. The team is off to a strong start after sweeping Penn and splitting with Columbia this weekend, but it will look to Shaw to contribute to the energy and intensity needed for the rest of the season. “With the team, coming out with the same passion for every game will be key for us and always play above our competition,” Shaw said. “The Ivy games all have so much emotion in them because they all mean something.”—Staff writer Lucy D.

Softball players are known for their superstitions, and freshman pitcher Rachel Brown is no exception. Before and during each game, she makes sure to avoid stepping on the chalk lines of the infield. This ritual is just about the only concession Brown makes to forces that are beyond her control.When the rookie hurler takes the mound, everything else is up to her. And that is exactly what she craves.“I think of myself as a pressure pitcher,” Brown said. “If I need a strikeout or an out, I can buckle down and really do that. “It comes from digging deep and wanting it.”One might expect such confidence from a well-seasoned upperclassman—not a bright-eyed freshman from San Diego, Calif., especially one forced to adjust to a higher level of play as well as a new climate. Brown, however, exhibits tenacity far beyond her years.“We have total control of the game once she’s on the mound,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “If we get her just one run, she’ll hold on for the win.”In fact, there’s a lot about her that would be impressive for a veteran, let alone a rookie.The numbers are what immediately stand out. She carries a 10-1 record through nine starts, plus a save in relief. She has finished each of her starts, pitching 73.1 innings out of the team’s total 147 innings. Opposing batters have struck out against her an astounding 115 times, as opposed to only 18 walks.The accolades deserve mention next. The first week of her young career, she was named Ivy League pitcher of the week. Flash forward to present day, where she stands as reigning Ivy League rookie of the week. And she’s picked up two straight tournament MVPs along the way, the most recent one coming at the Highlander Classic over spring break.Most Valuable Player was almost an understatement. She struck out seven hitters as part of a 3-2 victory to take the championship against Radford, which had been undefeated in the tournament.That was after she helped the Crimson reach the tournament final by allowing one run on two hits in 3.1 innings of relief in a semifinal win against Eastern Michigan, resulting in her first career save.And she had given Harvard its first win in round-robin play with a complete-game four-hitter against Toledo, accumulating 12 strikeouts.Everyone knew Brown was a talented recruit, but few saw this coming.“I hadn’t heard much about her before she came in, but our first practice in September, the first five balls she threw to me, I think I almost cried,” said co-captain Hayley Bock, the team’s starting catcher. “She can throw it for strikes; she can throw it so batters chase it…she’s surpassed my expectations by far.”Capable of putting up strikeout after strikeout, Brown’s style is dominating but not overpowering. Her greatest weapon against hitters is her mind, as she constantly focuses on getting ahead in the count and keeping batters of balance. Each and every pitch is governed by the reminder to “make the balls look like strikes, and the strikes look like balls.”Her repertoire of trickery includes an outside curve, a change-up, and a riser; the glaring lack of a fastball amidst her numerous strikeouts is a testament to her intimidating presence on the mound.And what’s even scarier is that she’s still getting better.Take her first and only loss of the season, for example. It took a four-hit pitching gem from UNC Greensboro starter Hannah Angel last Tuesday to beat the Crimson ace. Though not one to make excuses, Brown pointed to fatigue as a possible reason for the loss. Ever the competitor, she could not wait for a chance to “regain her footing.”Two days later, Brown was presented with an opportunity to step up, and she took full advantage of it, striking out 12 of the 14 batters she faced in a relief appearance in Harvard’s 2-1 win over Bryant.The next contest was Brown’s Ivy League debut, a matchup with host Columbia. She admitted to feeling some pressure.“Right before the game I was pretty nervous,” Brown said. “I had butterflies in my stomach.”Unsurprisingly, the anxiety didn’t show. Brown put together a beauty of an Ancient Eight start, tallying 14 of her 21 outs by strikeout while allowing only two base-runners in a one-hitter. The league dominance continued Monday against Penn, when she had yet another strong game, surrendering one run on seven hits to reach double-digit wins for the season.As the Crimson heads into the heart of the Ivy slate, pitching will become even more integral to its success. Harvard will depend on its workhorse, its ace, to eat up innings and take control of games.She’ll be ready.—Staff writer Dennis J. Zheng can be reached at dzheng12@college.harvard.edu

…reporter. Why, life, why? First you destroy my I-banking dreams and now  I can’t even write for a local newspaper?
As of yesterday, the Boston  Globe’s City Weekly section, which covered Cambridge news for  17 years, has officially published its final issue. (Can we get a tear?  Anyone? Hello?) The section was terminated in an effort to cut costs; local Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline news will continue  to be covered on Boston.com, the Globe’s website.Cambridge news is now only covered in print by The Cambridge Chronicle (a weekly) and by us. Several blogs, though, deliver city news, including the Chronicle's Cantabrigia. We at FlyBy are actually quite amused  by the massive list of less...uhh...newsy Cambridge-based blogs for those of you who might be interested  in following a blog for Cambridge moms, or, our personal favorite, “Drinking  Liberally, Cambridge.”
Well, City Weekly may prove  to be just another casualty in the slow but certain death of print journalism. But it seems as if even Internet-based  news, with all its “convenience” and “speed” and “accessibility,”  needs gimmicks to attract readers. Apparently, if you send your picture  to the people at Cantabrigia, you get  a prize!
Ooh, ooh! Free Frisbees?! Sign  us up!

Handsome gentleman, isn't he?  Of course, FlyBy reserves judgment on all such matters.  Seniors, more on your Class Day speaker--and the debacle that accompanied his...er..."announcement" after the jump.
Dear soon-to-be-departing seniors,
So commences the e-mail sent to seniors eagerly awaiting the news this morning.
Too bad the class committee only teased curious 09-ers to visit www.harvard09.com, the class website which, much to everyone's annoyance, crashed as too many index fingers clicked the provided url.
But fear not! First Marshal Lumumba Seegars confirms that the official class speaker is in fact the esteemed Matt Lauer of The Today Show.

Rumor has it that Harvard will soon unveil the identity of this year's commencement speaker. So while Harvard officials remain tight-lipped, Flyby has put together a list of who not to cross your fingers for. Commencement would-be horrors after the jump.
5. Dick Fuld, the stubby ring-fingered, ex-CEO who ran Lehman Brothers into the ground, suffered a black-eye,  and then blamed everyone but himself.
4. Former Detroit mayor and laughable clown Kwame Kilpatrick jailed for his part in a sex-and-text scandal after his half-baked story about HAXXORS taking over his phone turned out to be, well, ostensibly that.
3. Rod Blagojevich. The already unpopular Illinois governor was caught in a federal investigation over his alleged attempts to sell a U.S. Senate seat. Apparently, that's not kosher.
2. Bernie Madoff with all your money. ha ha ha!
1. Chris Brown can Kiss Kiss his career bye bye. Forever.  Sad part about it...FlyBy would've been stoked had the Commencement Speaker been this hip-hop crooner pre-domestic violence.

FlyBy chatted with  four randomly selected students of the 2,046 admitted to the Class of 2013 today to find out a little bit more about our new frosh friends. The lucky ‘13ers we spoke to received e-mails ranging from 5:02-5:15 pm. Most were excited. Meet the fab four after the jump:
Rocky Bostick
Clarksville, Maryland, River Hill High School
Admitted to: Harvard, Princeton, Yale EA
FlyBy: Where were you when you opened your admissions e-mail?
Rocky: In the bathroom.
FlyBy: What will be the deciding factor in the school you choose to attend?
Rocky: Definitely the people, I know the academics will be equitable anywhere I go but I’m looking for the people who make it fun.
(Chyeah Harvard, we got this one…)
Margaret W. (last name withheld)
Houston, Texas Kinkaid
Admitted to: University of Texas, University of North Carolina, USC, BC
FlyBy: Were you excited when you opened your e-mail?
Margaret: I’m not a very excitable person
FlyBy: Are you doing anything special to celebrate?
Margaret: (Pause) Maybe I should ask my parents to take me somewhere nice…
FlyBy: Silence.
Daniel Zelaya
Miramar Fl, Pembroke Prines Charter High School
Admitted: Harvard, Yale, Princeton
Daniel: I totally forgot Harvard was going to email me so I opened my mail and saw it and called my mom…
FlyBy: What are you interested in doing on campus?
Daniel: I’m extremely, extremely interested in politics…my life has revolved around politics for several years. I want to go to Yale or Harvard Law School… the reason why is because I want to be president.
(He might have to get in line.)
Peter Chen
Mason, Ohio, William Mason High School
Admitted to: Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, Duke
FlyBy: What time did you receive your admissions e-mail?
Peter: 5:02 P.M
FlyBy: Nice, you just set the record. What do you want to be involved in at Harvard?
Peter: Actually after my interview with [former] Crimson business manager James Black, I became interested in looking into that.
(Snaps for the Biz Board)
FlyBy: So what’s a fun fact about you?
Peter: Um, I’m color blind? Oh, I snore.
Well, at least they are book smart.
And on that note we’d like to leave you with one reason why you should be happy you were admitted to Harvard:
Today, I opened my mail to find my Brown acceptance letter. Excited, I showed my dad who just laughed and said 'what, it's not like it's Harvard'. No one in my family has ever gone to college. My dad didn\'t even graduate from high school. FML
Congratulations Class of 2013.
