After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is considering three options for undergraduate living for the fall semester: maintaining the current low-density campus, housing 30 to 40 percent of College students, and bringing back all students, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to Harvard faculty, staff, and postdocs Monday afternoon.
No matter which scenario the University chooses, however, nearly all instruction will continue remotely, with only “rare” exceptions, Gay added.
Harvard still expects to make a decision by July, according to Gay. More than 100 University faculty and staff across 11 working groups are studying what fall semester will look like for Harvard students, administrators said during a town hall on the planning process June 3.
The first scenario, labeled “minimal density,” would look much like the second half of spring semester, with roughly 600 undergraduates returning to campus, according to a web update posted to the FAS fall planning website Monday.
Under this minimal density arrangement, only students who lack the “necessary conditions” for learning in their home environment, or require access to campus-based resources to maintain their “academic continuity,” would return to live on campus. More students could potentially return for the spring semester, as described in the University’s second proposed pathway.
The second scenario, dubbed “moderate density,” would welcome roughly 40 percent of undergraduates — between 2,000 and 2,500 students — to campus in fall 2020.
The pathway would allow one or two “natural cohorts” of students — freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors — to live in residence, as well as those who would return under the minimal density scenario.
For this scenario to be viable, Harvard must guarantee it can execute moderate-volume, high-cadence testing capacity, delivering up to 3,000 tests every two to three days that can be collected at sites across campus, according to the web update.
“This pathway presents a low risk of infection and community spread,” the update reads. “Having a larger cohort of students on campus allows Harvard to pilot COVID-adapted, campus-based practices and programming.”
The third scenario, “full density,” would bring all students back, require Harvard to conduct up to 8,000 tests every two to three days, and rely on significant off-campus housing stock.
“To adhere to the current density guidelines outlined by public health officials, this pathway requires supplemental housing beyond Harvard’s dorms and Houses, placing a large number of students (~30%) in local apartments and/or hotels,” the website description reads.
This scenario presents the “highest risk of infection and community spread” and “limited flexibility” to scale down to the other two scenarios, the website notes.
Gay wrote that all three options share a common set of assumptions: a continuation of online learning, a change to the academic calendar, and frequent on-campus testing.
“Continued remote instruction ensures that academic continuity for all students is maintained, even if travel restrictions, visa issues, or health considerations keep them away from campus,” Gay wrote. “We also recognize the difficulty of holding in-person classes while still conforming to guidance from public health authorities.”
She added that while Harvard would maintain its two-semester system, it would remove breaks during the semester to minimize travel in and out of campus during the term.
Finally, she wrote that in all scenarios, affiliates should expect to undergo frequent testing on campus and adopt changed campus norms in line with new public health practices.
“Regardless of the pathway chosen, there is a recognition that our community norms will have to adapt for our public health practices to be successful,” she wrote. “The greater Boston area remains a hot spot for the virus, and social-distancing, masking, and other public health practices will be a part of campus life for the foreseeable future.”
During the June 3 College town hall, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said administrators are working on supporting international students by adapting course schedules to mitigate time zone differences and monitoring visa restrictions. Claybaugh leads a working group dedicated to determining how to best approach another semester of online education.
Should courses continue online, some College students have said they would consider taking a leave of absence next semester. However, they said their decision was contingent upon whether the College would change its leave of absence policies, such as withholding financial aid or forcing students to take multiple semesters off.
During the town hall, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said the College will not change its current “liberal” policy, which allows students to take time off if they choose, but does not guarantee students Harvard housing upon their return.
Claybaugh said that the College will return to a standard grading system this fall, setting aside the Emergency Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory system it piloted in the spring.
Gay wrote on Monday that Harvard has already learned lessons about reducing the risks of community transmission while resuming research activities in labs, libraries, and museums.
“Regardless of the path we choose, some members of our community will return to campus this fall, and the campus they return to will not be the one they left in the spring,” Gay wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard undergraduates anticipate the format of the fall semester, international students say they will likely have to navigate shifting border restrictions and visa delays.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent a survey to international students Friday to gauge the challenges they expect to face in the fall.
The short survey first asks students to mark both their current place of residence and the country or jurisdiction where they expect to live should they be unable to return to campus.
The survey also asks whether students would wish to return to campus if Harvard continues online learning in the fall but allows a small number of individual students to return. Students could cite personal reasons, such as their living situation making it difficult to study, and academic reasons, such as their research requiring on-campus resources.
Finally, the survey asks if there are factors “outside of Harvard’s control” that students anticipate will prevent them from returning to campus this fall. The options include travel restrictions, visa issues, health issues, and other challenges.
David A. Paffenholz ’22, an international student from Germany, said he worries that if the United States maintains its ban on travel from nearly all European countries next semester, he would be unable to return to campus in the fall.
“There's a lot of students in this situation, a lot of F1 visa holders. I expect the government to hopefully realize that it’s a common problem and allow students to come in,” he said. “In Germany, if you have a student visa, you are allowed to enter the country right now. Something similar for the U.S. would be nice.”
Barbara A. Oedayrajsingh Varma ’21, a student from the Netherlands, and Justas Jasevicius ’21, a student from Lithuania, said they have similar concerns about the European travel ban.
Other students face the opposite problem: their home country has restricted travel to and from the U.S.
Noah N. Furlonge-Walker ’23, who hails from Trinidad and Tobago, said the country’s borders are currently closed to the U.S.
“There are no commercial flights running. So even if I wanted to leave now, I don't think I could,” he said.
Furlonge-Walker added he is hopeful flights will start in time for the fall semester, should undergraduates be invited to return to campus.
“They've made it very clear that if you would like to leave the country in the next couple of months, they won’t stop you from leaving,” he said. “It's just people coming in that they have more of a problem with.”
Aside from fluctuating border restrictions and flight schedules, international students said they also have to contend with visa issues. Even under normal circumstances, students have to navigate long bureaucratic processes in order to come to Cambridge.
Ran Bi ’22, who is currently living at home in China, said his F1 student visa will expire if he lives outside the U.S. for more than five months. Though he would technically exceed this 5-month period by the start of the fall semester, he said he feels confident the University will work with the federal government to be flexible about this technicality if undergraduates return to campus.
However, if the fall classes resume online, Bi said international students may be forced to exceed the five-month period out of the U.S.
“If the classes were to be online the entire year, next year, I think probably us international students would be running into some visa issues,” he said.
Fabrizio Serafini ’23, who currently lives at home in Italy, said it was imperative for international students to be back on campus in the fall, not just logistically but also emotionally.
International students can feel especially “lonely” and alienated off-campus, he explained.
“If you're American, maybe university life is different from your life at home, but it's not that different,” he said. “I live in Italy, where it’s an entirely different universe.”
Serafini said that though he believes the University is working hard on behalf of international students, some governmental policies are beyond its reach.
“There are certain things such as immigration which are totally out of their control,” he said.
Oedayrajsingh Varma, who is co-president of the Woodbridge International Society, said the organization is working on communicating international students’ concerns about the fall term to administrators.
Tuzo Mulunda ’23, an international student from Kenya, said she hopes Harvard will lobby the State Department to facilitate students’ visa renewals and loosen travel restrictions.
Earlier this month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote to Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf urging the federal government to enact “forward-thinking immigration policies.”
Bacow also appealed for a number of changes — such as waiving in-person interviews — as the government gears up to resume visa processing and work through backlogs that have accrued during the coronavirus pandemic.
The letter anticipated an Executive Order from President Donald J. Trump that would temporarily bar certain nonimmigrant categories from entering the United States, and then alter work authorization policies for students, scholars, and H1-B visa holders, according to the Harvard International Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bargaining teams for the University and its graduate student union reached a tentative one-year contract Monday, which they will now unanimously recommend to union members for ratification.
The contract — the union’s first — represents the outgrowth of a 19-month series of bargaining sessions between the two parties, punctuated by a strike in December.
Graduate student workers at the University first voted to unionize as Harvard Graduate Student Workers-United Automobile Workers in April 2018. The two sides began bargaining later that year in October.
Since then, the union and the University remained at odds over three key areas: compensation, healthcare, and — most prominently — grievance procedures for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints.
Though the tentative agreement does not fully meet each of the union’s key asks, it does present a suitable fixture for the upcoming year as both sides endure the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, according to a summary of the contract posted to HGSU-UAW’s website. The initial contract negotiations called for a three-year contract; however, given the financial strains of the pandemic, Harvard proposed shortening the agreement to a one-year contract, to take effect before the upcoming year.
HGSU-UAW members now have the chance to ratify the contract, which would take effect on July 1, and last through June 30, 2021.  If ratified, the contract would be the first in University history to provide more than 4,000 student workers at Harvard with workplace protections.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced the tentative agreement in an email to faculty members Monday evening. Garber wrote that the contract reflects the University’s commitment to providing support for its graduate student workers.
“Our students are the heart of our institution, and we have approached these negotiations with their best interests in mind,” Garber wrote.
According to the union’s summary, the University agreed to grant student workers a 2.8 percent pay raise. Though HGSU-UAW representatives had initially hoped for a larger raise, the two parties had tentatively settled on the raise by the end of May, shortly after Harvard modified the time span of the contract.
Union members also secured a minimum wage of $16 per hour for non-salaried student workers and $17 per hour for students with hourly instructional roles. Salaried teaching assistants in professional schools will receive a pay raise up to $5,520 per section per semester, according to the union’s website.
Regarding health care, the University guaranteed union members up to $575,000 in funds to cover dental costs, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses. The union also secured childcare subsidies via a new $350,000 fund.
Previously, union members expressed concern with ensuring their safety amid the coronavirus pandemic, given that many student employees will be returning to work as Harvard begins the phased reopening of its labs. As such, the contract contains provisions that guarantee student workers personal protective equipment and protect employees from retaliation for reporting unsafe working conditions.
Those provisions were the latest in a long list of provisions the two sides had accepted over the course of bargaining, including agreements over workload, holidays and vacation time, and parking and transportation.
The handling of non-discrimination and harassment procedures formed a longstanding point of contention between HGSU-UAW and the University throughout negotiations: While the union argued that a third-party arbitrator should handle discrimination or harassment complaints, Harvard maintained that members could process these requests through internal University procedures.
Despite other agreements in this area, the tentative contract does not include a third-party grievance procedure for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints. Under the agreement, students can elect to have a union representative present in “any and all stages of discrimination or harassment complaints, regardless of the method of reporting.”
The two sides agreed to guaranteed interim measures for all forms of harassment and discrimination complaints, and “protections against retaliation,” per the summary. The University also “committed to establishing new procedures and offices to address race-based discrimination and power-based harassment with the input of students and union representatives.”
“A working group will be assembled to accomplish this if the contract is ratified within 3 months of ratification,” the summary on HGSU-UAW’s website reads.
“Complaints of identity-based discrimination may not be arbitrated under the contract grievance article, but may be submitted to an internal appeals panel. While this is a start, it is insufficient beyond this one-year settlement in the context of the pandemic,” it also states.
According to Garber’s email, union representatives will have seats on the University’s existing Title IX Policy Review Committee — a body made up of faculty, students, and staff — and on two new committees to make recommendations on University policies for “addressing other forms of discrimination and misconduct that do not fall under the federal Title IX regulations.”
HGSU-UAW representatives Lacey Rosey and Jeff Hall wrote in a press release that graduate students “made history” by reaching the agreement.
“Under the current circumstances, the tentative contract is being hailed by student workers as a major achievement,” they wrote. “It provides important protections and guarantees, and lays the groundwork to achieve even greater workplace rights and protections in future contracts.”
The contract between HGSU-UAW and Harvard marks the latest development in unionization and bargaining efforts at private colleges across the nation, including Brown, Cornell, and Columbia. Members of Brown’s Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees reached their first contract with administrators just two weeks prior, a first for the Ivy League.
In a Monday press release, HGSU-UAW expressed support for other graduate workers across the country, writing that student workers’ collective bargaining rights have been placed in jeopardy by President Donald Trump’s conservative appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB is responsible for enforcing and carrying out the National Labor Relations Act, which provides labor protections for workers.
“This tentative contract agreement is a major victory not only for the Harvard Graduate Students Union (HGSU-UAW), but also for the graduate student worker movement across the country, especially in light of the Trump administration’s efforts to end the right of student workers’ to bargain under federal law,” the release reads.
In February, HGSU-UAW previously alleged the University engaged in “regressive bargaining” and hid behind the Trump-appointed NLRB.
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV wrote in an email that he believes HGSU-UAW’s tentative contract could provide other universities the “courage to move ahead” with bargaining despite “Trump NLRB hostility.”
Gould commended the University and the graduate union for coming to an agreement.
“This important step forward is what collective bargaining is about and both sides are to be commended for it,” Gould wrote. “The union has made a good start on both compensation and dispute resolution. The parties have been able to get beyond the embryonic stage in the process.”
Though the contract would provide essential protections to last through the pandemic, the provisions are only temporary securements as the union looks to “gearing up for a fight next year to win on our remaining outstanding issues,” according to the contract summary. Third-party arbitration in discrimination and harassment proceedings and further compensation guarantees remain among the key bargaining issues for next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Mather House students crafted a petition arguing that the House should no longer bear the namesake of former Harvard president and slave owner Increase Mather, who was a member of the Class of 1656.
“The fact that we still have multiple buildings named after slave owners is problematic and harmful to students living within Mather and the broader community,” the petition reads. “We want to apply pressure to help change this outdated and hurtful name.”
As of Sunday, more than 300 Harvard affiliates had signed the petition.
Nishita Sinha ’21, a Mather resident and one of the petition’s organizers, said she was inspired to start the petition after receiving an email from Mather House tutors that discussed race relations and Mather’s history.
“It got to me that a place like Mather House, which I consider to be a home, is named after someone whose ideals and actions should not be supported, especially right now or ever,” Sinha said. “We started to look into what administration had been saying in the past about it, and then we decided that a good first step was to see what students are saying.”
The new petition is not the first time students have scrutinized Mather’s name and history. In 2017, the house hosted an exhibit in its Three Column Gallery that detailed and interrogated the life of the building's namesake.
“In a time when universities are grappling with the historical legacy of the names and symbols that describe their campuses, Increase has become one of the more controversial namesakes of the undergraduate Houses and on Harvard’s campus more broadly,” the exhibit’s introduction read.
“Mather students and affiliates have spent some months investigating Increase’s life and legacy, contextualizing and seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the slave owner,” it added. “This is a first attempt to pass that knowledge along to the Mather community.”
Though the exhibit confronted Mather’s past as a slave owner, then-faculty deans Michael D. Rosengarten and Christie McDonald said there were no plans to change the name of the house.
Christian M. T. Porter ’23 said he believes the petition encourages Harvard to “go beyond being performative” when addressing its relationship with slavery.
“Harvard put up the plaque on Wadsworth House to talk about slavery, but they haven’t renamed Agassiz House, Mather House, Brattle Street, who are all named after white supremacists,” Porter said.
“It’s really important that Harvard shows they value Black students and make sure Black students feel comfortable,” he added. “One of the first ways to do that is renaming these Houses that are named after white supremacists and lifting up Harvard’s Black history, which is very rich and is not acknowledged enough.”
Alma H. Conway ’23, however, said she believes the petition places limitations upon freedom of expression.
“Petitions are usually well-intentioned, but I don’t know what changing a dorm name will accomplish. Are we going to change every name and limit freedom of expression?” Conway said.
Despite the petition receiving some criticism for “erasing Harvard’s history,” Sinha said she still believes renaming Mather is an important first step for Harvard to foster a more inclusive environment.
“We’re not trying to erase history, but honoring someone like Mather by naming a residential house after them is not exactly sending a clear message that Harvard is for inclusion,” Sinha explained.
“A lot of people have argued that changing the name to a civil rights activist or a person of color or a woman of color who typically does not get represented in these spaces could send a much clearer message about where Harvard stands right now.”
In response to the petition, Mather faculty deans L. Mahadevan and Amala K. Mahadevan sent out a House-wide email Monday to invite House affiliates to participate in a conversation about changing the house’s name.
“While changing the name of a House is a decision that goes beyond our authority, we want to listen to your views,” they wrote.
Sinha said her overall goal stretches beyond Mather: She hopes to develop a system to determine which other University buildings bear insensitive names.
“Our goal right now is to change as many names as we can and also come up with a research system for Harvard to keep researching and changing these names,” Sinha said. “Yale has recently changed one of its names, so I don’t think it is unreasonable for Harvard to change this name.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applicants to the College Class of 2025 will no longer need to submit any standardized test scores, according to a Monday note from Harvard’s admissions office.
The announcement amends guidance to Class of 2025 applicants in March informing them that there would not be a penalty for failing to submit Advanced Placement or SAT subject test scores.
Monday’s note cites the effect of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in explaining the decision to amend its standardized test policy. Although American standardized testing is no longer required, the update encourages international applicants to submit relevant national testing results from their home country.
“We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created insurmountable challenges in scheduling tests for all students, particularly those from modest economic backgrounds, and we believe this temporary change addresses these challenges,” the guidance reads.
The policy change follows other schools’ decisions to suspend standardized test requirements for applicants to the Class of 2025. All other Ivy League schools except for Princeton have amended their testing requirements to become test-optional for the 2020-2021 application cycle. Princeton still requires SAT or ACT scores, but emphasized in a letter to Class of 2025 applicants that SAT subject tests are only recommended.
The ACT and College Board previously canceled and postponed testing dates throughout April and June due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The note also addresses the possibility of an extension in the regular action cycle application deadline.
“While our regular action deadline will remain January 1 for now, we will monitor the effects of COVID-19 in the coming months and will extend our deadline if necessary,” the note states.
Harvard’s early action date will remain November 1. The note emphasizes that the College expects fewer early applicants and that, as in prior years, early applicants have no advantage in admissions.
For both the early and regular action deadline, the College will accept test scores that arrive after the usual deadline, from the November and February test dates, respectively.
Harvard’s statement also covered how potential disruption caused by the pandemic would change admissions reviews.
“Accomplishments in and out of the classroom during the high school years – including community involvement, employment, and help given to students’ families are considered as part of our process,” the note reads. “However, students who find themselves limited in the activities they can pursue due to the current coronavirus outbreak will not be disadvantaged as a result, nor will students who are only able to present pass/fail grades or other similar marks on their transcripts this spring.”
Finally, the announcement emphasized the College’s commitment to maintaining the current financial aid program.
“As was the case during the economic downturn a decade ago and in similar situations before, our revolutionary financial aid program will not be compromised in any way,” the note states.
