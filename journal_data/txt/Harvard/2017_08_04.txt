After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AGIT ÁGUEDA, Portugal—There are 58 and counting pictures of Jesus in my Avõ’s (grandmother’s) house. Headshots, sculptures, statues, playing cards, paintings of The Last Supper, rosaries, magnets—there’s even a clock with him crucified, arms bending to tell time. He is everywhere, literally.
This comes as little surprise. In a country as religious as Portugal, Jesus sits down at the dinner table along with a bottle of Porto wine, chouriҫo, and pão y queijo, frequenting the conversation as much as your neighbor’s cousin’s daughter’s boyfriend, who is of course your fifth cousin twice removed.
Given that my Avõ’s house was already dressed to the nines with religious artifacts, I shouldn’t have been surprised that, when out touring a nearby city, I would be confronted with another encounter of the religious kind.
The city presented itself at first as a reprieve from this old-style life, feigning no attachment to anything Christ-like. Águeda was all bright lights and rainbow umbrellas, American music blasting out of the town speakers and tourists with cameras the size of the Aҫores dragging down their necks. Nothing of the art-clad walls and green carpets screamed old-timey Portugal. There weren’t orange-tiled roofs, a half-bathtub guarding a statue of Saint Fatima, or even a church for miles. Natives and tourists alike were free to ingratiate themselves into this cutesy, little town, leaving cultural norms hung to dry as the guarda-chuvas (umbrellas) occluded any opportunity for them to invade this haven. Or so I thought.
As I was admiring the street and lifting one of the smaller Azorean islands to capture the scene, two older women motioned me over to a bench and grabbed me by the wrist. In any other country, alarms would be sounding off in your head at this moment. Strangers are calling you over and touching you? There must be something wrong. Nevertheless, I didn’t react. The phrase “personal boundaries” doesn’t translate into Portuguese. The closest equivalents are “Para quê?” (For what?) and “Deixa Lá” (Let it go).
Their intentions, however, were harmless—their actions unaware of the cultural boundaries leapt and hurdled. They recognized me as a foreigner, and simply wanted to chat regarding Portuguese culture—which of course consisted of religion. I was immediately quizzed on my ability to recite the prayers into my youth: Pai Nosso (Our Father) and Ave Maria (Hail Mary). Once they deemed my knowledge acceptable, they let go of my hand and showered me with praise.
I smiled, thanked them, and looked away for a second to find a familiar face, but when I turned my attention back to them, they were no longer there. The bench was now empty, allowing for a clear view from the painted wooden slabs to the store behind it—which, unsurprisingly, had a headshot of Jesus in the top corner of its window front.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Aug. 7, 2017, at 1:01 a.m.
On August 2, the New York Times published a piece entitled, “Affirmative Action Battle Has a New Focus: Asian-Americans.” The article detailed current Asian American perspectives regarding college admissions, circling topics such as the “Asian Tax,” the 140-point SAT score difference between admitted Asian-identifying and white students for entry to private colleges, and diversity.
The article pins Asian American discrimination on “preferences to other racial minorities.” It is in response to a leaked government memo from the Justice Department on an investigation on “race-based discrimination in college and university admissions” at Harvard. The memo was interpreted as an attack on affirmative action because of the supposed “discrimination” against white and Asian American students.
In an article published by the Times a day earlier, Roger Clegg, the president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, was quoted stating that, “civil rights laws were deliberately written to protect everyone from discrimination…and it is frequently the case that not only are whites discriminated against now, but…Asian-Americans are as well.”
In a call for information, the Times asked for the experiences of Asian American students who believed “race played a role in [their] admissions process” at Harvard or who believed they were “rejected from Harvard...unfairly.” The context was to gain perspective on “admissions policies...perceived as hurting white and Asian-American applicants.”
The “new focus” of the affirmative action debate on Asian Americans is not new. College admissions is a notoriously emotional subject for Asian Americans. In a country that rarely affords immigrant parents the capability of granting their children cultural capital, economic privilege, or historical pride due to consistent emasculation, erasure, and exoticization, many parents attempt to position their children into American society through education—a tangible accomplishment. Still, the Asian Tax is as quantifiable as the wage gap; holistic approaches are opaque.
However, the conflation of Asian American perspectives on college admissions and white perceptions of discrimination is fallacious. The Times, by attempting to group these two concepts together, demonstrates ignorance regarding the troubled history of Asian American achievement in the United States.
In 2011, Amy Chua published “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” where she pitted herself against the standard of white “pleasantness.” The book gained traction among many Asian Americans due, in part, to the legitimacy it placed on the community’s preexisting frustrations. In recent years, many Asian ethnoburbs have experienced white flight as a result of student achievement, such as in Johns Creek, Ga., where the proportion of white students in the local elementary school plummeted from 55% to 23% in 10 years. Anjali Enjeti, who penned an essay on the neighborhood, had white neighbors who cited a racial motivation for their movement. Statements included, “Asian parents take their kids for extra tutoring. It’s not fair for the ‘regular’ kids,” and, “My kids won’t get into a good college because of all of the Asians.” In an attempt to remedy the result of racial homogeneity in the merit-based admissions process in New York City schools—more specifically, a 73% Asian enrollment at Stuyvesant High in 2014 and similar statistics—a "holistic admissions" approach was proposed. The Research Alliance for New York City Schools projected that the main beneficiaries of the program would be "well-rounded" affluent white students.
Asian American achievement is not associated with perceived white “discrimination.” Instead, multiple white failures to adapt to Asian American achievement have resulted in changes to admissions policies or city demographics. White students believe they are discriminated against because of Asian American achievement. Asian Americans have to achieve more because white students believe they are not receiving a fair share for their effort—effort that according even to white parents is not enough to stay competitive among Asian American peers.
The social separation of “Asian” and “normal” (read: white) students is more substantiated. Asian American organizations are not advocates for white students. Nor do they sympathize with such cases. Abigail Fisher, a white student who went to the Supreme Court because she believed her University of Texas rejection was a form of racial discrimination, had a 3.59 GPA and a 1180/1600 SAT score. Neither demonstrate academic excellence. Furthermore, as a white woman, Fisher was statistically placed to benefit most from affirmative action policies.
The insertion of perceived “white discrimination” into Asian American perspectives on college admissions by people who are not Asian American is an attempt to use our struggles against racist national contexts to promote the very structures that have disempowered us.
This is not the first time such a case has occurred. This June, many celebrated the Supreme Court win of an Asian American band to keep their name The Slants as a point of reclamation over Western narratives shaming the shape of Asian eyes. The ruling, however, can also now be used to register names such as “Washington Redskins” a racial slur previously denied by the trademark office. Model minority status was granted as a counter to black activism.
We know better than anyone how complicated our perspectives can be in America’s binary. As an ambiguous entity in the black-white racial dichotomy of our country, we must be wary of our historical positions as tools of division. But we certainly cannot allow the imposition of a framework forced by non-Asian writers for a semi-coherent story to undermine the validity of our concerns.

CORRECTION: Aug. 7, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Stuyvesant High School implemented a holistic admissions process in 2014. A holistic admissions process was proposed but never implemented. Stuyvesant currently uses the Specialized High Schools Admission Test as its sole admission requirement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facebook is funding a new initiative at the Kennedy School that aims to develop better defenses against cyber attacks targeting the United States’s elections and political infrastructure.
The bipartisan “Defending Digital Democracy” project is led by Robby Mook and Matt Rhoades, campaign managers for former presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, respectively, and overseen by Eric Rosenbach, the co-director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center.
Facebook, founded in a Harvard dorm room, is providing the seed funding for the project, the tech giant’s Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced in late July.
While serving in the Department of Defense during the Obama administration, Rosenbach worked on cybersecurity issues and said “hacking of the elections and campaigns” was one of the problems he found most troubling.
“Our biggest goal is to have both parties work together to do something that will help the country and secure the democracy so that bad guys down the road don’t get the idea that they can affect the outcome of our democratic processes,” Rosenbach said of the new project.
The project will focus on information sharing and the creation of “playbooks” with cybersecurity best practices for campaign organizations and election administrators.
Rosenbach said he believes that Mook and Rhoades make “a great combination” with the potential to bring their respective networks together.
“Both of them were willing to reach across a partisan aisle and work together on this, which is something that really is unusual nowadays in D.C.,” Rosenbach said.
In a statement, Mook emphasized the increasingly pervasive nature of foreign cyber attacks in elections, including on the Clinton campaign he managed in 2016, and the consequent need to “help both parties and civic institutions that are critical to elections better secure themselves.”
“Many foreign countries, and even terrorist organizations, exploit digital technology to advance their agendas and influence public narratives abroad,” Mook added.
For Rhoades, cyber attacks present “vulnerabilities” that threaten the American democratic system and “affect people of all political stripes.” This project, he wrote, is as an opportunity to bring together different parties and ideologies, as well as experts in related domains.
Stamos and Heather Adkins, Google’s Director of Information Security and Privacy, will sit on the project’s senior advisory group, along with national security leaders. This project is co-sponsored by the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics and the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy.
“We’ll have a lot of different people who have deep and unique experiences in different worlds and hopefully we’ll come up with some creative solutions to a very difficult problem,” Rosenbach said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pokéworks, a Hawaiian-inspired seafood bowl chain, will take over the Harvard Square storefront currently leased by smoothie vendor Liquiteria this fall.
The Harvard Square Advisory Committee and Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals approved Pokéworks’ application for the Liquiteria space on the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Church St. in July, and the company received its fast food permit on July 27, according to Cambridge Day.
Poke, a raw fish salad, has been increasingly popularized outside of its home of Hawaii by fast-casual chains like Pokéworks. Pokéworks specializes in tuna, salmon, and other fish or tofu bases mixed with toppings and sauces in a rice bowl, salad bowl, or poké “burrito.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Pokéworks’ bid for a storefront in the Square was “really impressive,” quickly earning the approval of the sometimes-selective Square zoning authorities.  While the Board of Zoning Appeals has repeatedly stymied &pizza—a Washington, D.C.-based quick-serve pizza shop—in its drive for a Harvard Square location, Jillson said Pokéworks’ more differentiated offerings allowed it to speed through the permitting process.
“The Advisory Committee recommended that they move on to the BZA, so they liked what they saw and heard—and tasted, because the Pokéworks people brought some very wonderful samples and the food was delicious,” Jillson said. “I mean really, really delicious.”
The Harvard Square location will be Pokéworks’ second Massachusetts store, following a Davis Square location that opened in December 2016. The company currently has nine shops, mostly in New York City and California, and will have locations “coming soon” across the country, according to its website.
Jillson said she believes the chain will be well-received by students, citing its food options, price point, and plans to stay open late.
“We have nothing like it really,” Jillson said. “It was fun, the food was incredibly fresh, the sauces that you could put on were delicious—it was impressive.”
Danielle S.K. Stollar ’18 said she was “extremely excited” to hear the news, and said she and her and friends had been going to the chain’s Davis Square location about once a week.
“Poke is a dish that I ate a lot back home—I’m from Hawaii originally—so it was nice to have this connection back to where I grew up and to have a food available to me that I had missed a lot when moving to Boston,” Stollar said. “I really like that you sort of have freedom to be creative, to add whatever you want to the bowl that you’re making.”
Liquiteria, an New York City-based upscale juice and smoothie bar, has occupied the 1440 Mass Ave. corner storefront since the summer of 2015.
“Liquiteria was really overpriced and expensive,” Stollar said, but at Pokéworks “it feels like you get more bang for your buck.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust met with Vice President Mike Pence last week on her fourth lobbying trip to the nation’s capital in 2017.
Seated to the left of Pence in his office at the White House, Faust joined a delegation of university presidents from across the country to advocating for supporting scientific research and student aid, according to an Indiana University press release. A Harvard spokesperson said the group also discussed the importance of international students and faculty to American universities.
Faust—who pledged to intensify her lobbying efforts after Donald Trump won the presidency last November — has traveled to the nation’s capital four times since then to meet with lawmakers and higher ed advocates.
Indiana University — the flagship public institution in Pence’s home state — arranged the meeting with the vice president. Attendees included the presidents of Indiana University, MIT, Ohio State University, and Rice University, the chancellor of UCLA, and the president of the Association of American Universities, according to the Indiana University press release.
Research funding and financial aid are two long-standing foci of Harvard’s lobbying efforts. Harvard received around $600 million in federal research funding in 2016 — a level Faust and the University’s D.C.-based lobbyists are fighting to maintain. Trump’s 2018 budget proposal would slash funding from several key sources of research grants.
In a statement provided by a University spokesperson, Faust said Pence expressed support for university research.
“I appreciated the opportunity to discuss issues important to higher education with the Vice President, and to hear his support for research universities and their important contributions to science, health, innovation and economic growth,” Faust said.
But untouched at the meeting was a subject that would soon send shockwaves through the world of higher education: the Trump administration’s stance on affirmative action. “I am not aware of the topic being discussed,” Marc Lotter, Pence’s press secretary, said in an email this week.
Several days after the meeting, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was preparing to investigate universities with affirmative actions policies for racial discrimination in admissions. The Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday that its focus is narrower than originally reported: it is only examining one complaint filed in 2015 accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants.
