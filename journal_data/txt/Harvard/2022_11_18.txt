After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prominent jazz musician Esperanza E. Spalding, a professor of the practice in Harvard’s Music Department, will depart the University, she announced in an email to department affiliates this week that was obtained by The Crimson.
Spalding wrote in the email that she has communicated with Harvard over “many months” about a proposal for a “decolonial education” curriculum she would like to implement as a course or initiative, but said what she aspires “to cultivate and activate in organized learning spaces is not (yet) aligned with Harvard’s priorities.”
A five-time Grammy award winner, Spalding joined the Music Department as a part-time professor of the practice in 2017 and has taught courses on songwriting, performance, and musical activism. Harvard typically appoints professors of the practice on five-year renewable contracts.
In an attachment to her email, Spalding included a description of her proposal for an educational initiative called “Black Artist-Educators Decolonizing and Placemaking.” She wrote that she believes the program would help institutions and instructors “move beyond metaphorical commitments to decolonial education, Black and Native solidarity (respectively), and reparations.”
Under the BAEDAP model, the University would “rematriate” some of its land and properties, offering the spaces to Black and Native artists, scholars, students, and activists. In the proposal attached to her email, Spalding described Harvard’s history as “inextricably linked to Black and Native subjugation,” adding that in order to maintain her relationship with the University, she would need to be involved in redressing the school’s “historical and lingering colonial impacts.”
“I am no longer willing to endorse a cultural norm whereby artists & artist-educators passively participate-in, and benefit-from institutions born and bolstered through the justification, and/or ongoing practice of exploiting and destroying Black and Native life,” the BAEDAP proposal reads.
Spalding was unavailable to comment on her email or departure.
In an emailed statement, Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey praised Spalding’s artistry and wrote that he hopes there are “possibilities for future collaboration” between Spalding and Harvard.
“Having Esperanza Spalding at Harvard these past five years has been fantastic,” he wrote. “My admiration for her work is immense. She is a beacon in a turbulent world.”
Spalding wrote in her email that she intends to continue work on “an iteration of BAEDAP” in her hometown of Portland, Oregon.
In a 2021 interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting, Spalding said she hoped to create a “sanctuary space” for artists of color in Portland’s St. John’s neighborhood. In May and June 2021, Spalding raised $361,604 through a GoFundMe campaign to purchase a property for the space.
Though she plans to leave Harvard, Spalding wrote in her email Tuesday that she is grateful for her experiences in the Music Department.
“These past 5 years have been so fun, so generative, so challenging, so full of new sounds and stories, new friends,” she wrote. “I’m gonna miss y’all!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of this year’s Harvard-Yale football game, a marketplace has emerged for the resale of free undergraduate tickets, with some tickets going for more than $100.
Each Harvard undergraduate received one free ticket for seating in the student section of Harvard Stadium, the site of The Game for the first time since 2016. But some undergrads, who are not planning to attend, are selling the coveted tickets to students who are welcoming friends or family to the football game on Saturday.
To Rosanna Kataja ’24 — who marketed her ticket over a house email list and received an offer for $120 — the decision to sell was a matter of “simple economics.”
“Being a college student with a student budget, why not make a few bucks selling the ticket to somebody who was willing to pay for it?” said Kataja, who will be in Connecticut on the day of The Game.
While some are marketing tickets over class group chats or house email lists, other students are streamlining the process through Google spreadsheets and forms. On one Adams House spreadsheet obtained by The Crimson, sellers listed tickets priced from $100 to $500.
Daniella M. Berrospi ’24 said she sees selling her ticket as an opportunity to make money to spend on something more meaningful to her than football.
“There’s so many people that have money, and relatives, or family members, or friends coming from different states that come to see the game, and they’re willing to put down a lot of money to get a ticket,” Berrospi said. “It’s just amazing to me, and I’m like, why not take advantage of the opportunity?”
Phoebe H. Suh ’23, who sold her ticket for $65, argued that while the tickets were technically free to Harvard undergraduates, the experience of going to The Game itself gives them value.
“I’m okay with selling my ticket because I’m giving up something that I could do, so I understand that my ticket has value to me,” Suh said.
Some students are selling their tickets in the name of charity.
Mira-Rose J. Kingsbury Lee ’24 launched a sealed-bid, second-price auction for her ticket and two others donated by friends, with all proceeds going to nonprofits. She said she was surprised to receive a flurry of bids — including a top offer of $1,000.
“Ultimately, part of it is they need a ticket, and then part of it is they were looking to do some good in that process,” Kingsbury Lee said of the top bidder. “I’m really astounded by the generosity.”
Signs posted at all student ticket distribution locations ban the sale of free student tickets, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“Complimentary tickets cannot be sold, transferred, traded, or bartered for goods and services by any party,” the signs read. “Each ticket issued by Harvard Athletics is a revocable license which may be revoked for any reason at any time at the sole discretion of Harvard Athletics.”
Despite the signage, Robin M. Robinson ’22-’23 said she was unaware that student tickets could not be resold.
“I didn’t know you weren’t allowed to because there was no email about it on my house list,” Robinson said.
“I just thought it was an opportunity to make a few bucks,” she added.
Katie M. Sierra ’23, who purchased an extra ticket for $200 through a resale platform, raised the concern that resold tickets may not actually be valid for non-Harvard undergraduates.
“If you’re trying to bring a parent or non-Harvard friend to Harvard, those student tickets won’t actually work for them,” Sierra said. “I think that a lot of people are not aware of this and that there’s gonna be a lot of disappointment on game day.”
The cheapest tickets on resale platforms StubHub and Vivid Seats cost $160 and $149, respectively, as of Wednesday. These tickets are for assigned seating separate from the student sections.
A limited quantity of tickets were made available to Yale students for $25 each, but a Yale Athletics technical mishap led the purchase link to release early, leaving some students ticketless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the week leading up to the much-anticipated return of The Game to Harvard Stadium, students have reported confusion and disappointment with College restrictions on tailgating.
Only Harvard-provided food and drink will be permitted at the College-sponsored tailgate, Interim Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 announced in a Nov. 9 email to undergraduates. Alcohol distribution will be limited to three drinks per student over the age of 21, and undergraduates will not be allowed to host alternative pregame events.
Students have decried this year’s decision as detrimental to student social life and potentially harmful to student safety.
During previous iterations of The Game, House Committees have been permitted to host house-wide pregames and distribute alcohol at the official undergraduate tailgate.
“Historically HoCos have manned tables/our own tailgates because we purchased and were in charge of distributing the alcohol,” Lowell House Committee Co-Chair Austin Siebold ’23 wrote in an email.
Siebold said the College imposed this year’s restrictions without consulting House Committees.
“HoCos were not consulted on the DSO's decision to create the beer garden,” she wrote. “The DSO has been consistently raising their level of involvement in historically student owned responsibilities.”
House Committees have opted not to man tables at the College-sponsored tailgate in light of the restriction on alcohol distribution, Siebold added.
In an interview with The Crimson, DSO representative Jason R. Meier said the College’s decision-making was largely shaped by concerns over student safety.
“The reality of where we’re at, I think, really stems from an incident in spring 2018 at Yardfest where there were some significant safety issues,” Meier said. “President Drew Faust initiated what she called a ‘review committee’ to review large-scale events that were on campus and kind of reimagined how they would run for safety and security.”
Sophia C. Weng ’24, a member of Adams House Committee, said the DSO’s instructions left House Committee members confused about whether they could hold house-wide events, including steins — weekly gatherings where House Committees can provide alcohol to students.
“Some houses hold their steins on Fridays, and so for the HoCos that normally host those, we’re actually responsible for feeding the Yale students while they’re here,” Weng said. “But it’s a little unclear as to whether or not we can officially hold the Stein then.”
Gilberto Lopez-Jimenez ’25 said the DSO’s restrictions may push student organizations to throw off-campus parties, which can threaten student safety.
“Because of the restrictions that have been placed on us, a lot of people will probably end up partying in Boston and downtown or wherever the events are, and it’s going to be a little bit of a threat for everyone,” Lopez-Jimenez said. “They’re gonna be under the influence of a substance, and it’s gonna get late at night — there’s just a lot of hazards that come with that.”
Undergraduate social life does appear to have moved largely off-campus. Final clubs and other social organizations are hosting off-campus parties at Boston nightclubs the night before The Game. Tickets to the parties are selling for upwards of $30.
Dean of Students Office spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman defended the policies, asserting that they were written with student safety as a top priority.
“The team at the Dean Students Office and partners across the University have been working tirelessly to make sure that everybody has a fun and safe space to celebrate,” Goldman said. “That hasn’t changed.”

A Massachusetts Superior Court judge on Tuesday allowed a lawsuit to move forward against a Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Service case manager who is accused of negligence over a 2015 student suicide.
The lawsuit, filed in 2018, alleges Harvard and several of its employees were negligent in their duty of care to Luke Z. Tang ’18, who died by suicide in September 2015. On Nov. 2, lawyers for Harvard’s employees argued for a ruling without trial, claiming the defendants upheld their duty of care.
Judge Brent A. Tingle denied a motion for summary judgment on Tuesday in the case against CAMHS employee Melanie G. Northrop, Tang’s case manager after his initial suicide attempt in April 2015. Unless settled, Northrop’s case will go to trial.
“There are disputed issues of material fact as to whether this defendant met this standard of care, including, but not limited to continuity of care issues at the end of 2014 school year and upon Luke Tang’s return for the 2015 school year,” Tingle wrote in his decision.
Harvard, Senior Resident Dean Catherine R. Shapiro, and former Lowell Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03 are also named in the suit for negligence, but the judge has not yet issued a decision on whether their case will go to trial.
Throughout the proceedings, both sides cited Nguyen vs. MIT, a wrongful death suit following the 2009 suicide of an MIT graduate student. In 2018, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found MIT was not liable, in part because the student had not shared his suicidal ideation with university officials.
In the Nov. 2 hearings, David W. Heinlein, the Tang family’s lawyer, argued for judgment on whether Tang was owed a legal duty of care by Harvard, Shapiro, and Casey. During oral arguments, both sides agreed the employees owed Tang a duty of care after learning of his suicide attempt.
Tingle judged Tuesday that the defendants owed Tang a duty of care but said details of the nature of that duty would be released in a subsequent decision.
“Accordingly, the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment is ALLOWED only as to the issue of duty with respect to Harvard, Shapiro, and Casey,” Tingle wrote. “The Court will address in detail the nature and extent of the duty owed by these defendants in its forthcoming decision on their motion for summary judgment.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals judge Kevin C. Newsom spoke about his career and perspective on originalism at a Harvard Law School lecture held in Wasserstein Hall on Wednesday.
The event began with an introduction from Ethan C. Harper, president of the Harvard chapter of the Federalist Society, before launching into Newsom’s reflection on his clerking experience under former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter.
“My co-clerks and I would joke that he really didn’t need us around,” said Newsom, a HLS graduate. “So we were just there as entertainment.”
Newsom recalled Souter encouraging the clerks to express their own opinions and talked about continuing the tradition with his own clerks.
“I don’t want my clerks to feel like they need to channel me or mimic me because my way of communicating may not be yours,” he said. “I think it’s important that clerks find their own voice.”
During his discussion on the first-year law school curriculum, he said most of what students encounter at law school is not applicable to what they see later in their careers.
“I think it’s overloaded with common law,” he said. “What you get is torts, contracts, property — all this old dusty English common law.”
When asked about previous long and controversial concurrences, Newsom referred to a series of cases on the standing of Article III of the Constitution, which outlines the basis for plaintiffs to bring a suit to federal court.
In the 2021 case Sierra v. City of Hallandale Beach, Newsom’s 56-page concurrence argued that plaintiffs need only show violation of a legal right to bring a case. Federal courts have long held that actual injury is necessary for a lawsuit, an interpretation that Newsom wrote had “jumped the tracks.”
Newsom laid out two criteria he uses when deciding to write a concurring opinion: what “needs to be said” and what “isn’t being said.”
Throughout the lecture, Newsom talked about originalism, a legal theory that states that the Constitution should be interpreted according to how the text would have been understood at the time it was written, as well as textualism, a legal theory that the text should be interpreted as it is actually written.
Newsom said he disagrees with the notion that originalism and textualism are “completely different things.”
“Originalism is really just textualism as applied to this extraordinary thing called the Constitution, but they’re fundamentally after the same thing, which is, in fact, the meaning of the words on the page,” he said.
When discussing how to approach the Constitution’s lack of a clear stance on originalism versus textualism, Newsom said he believes the Constitution is in favor of originalism because its writers created it as a written document and included Article V, the part of the Constitution that outlines the procedure for amendments.
“Our founders sought to write down the fundamental rules of the game,” he said.
Towards the end of his talk, Newsom hinted at the nuances in interpreting the Constitution from an originalist or textualist perspective.
“There are indications that, among modes of thinking about the law, originalism has a leg up on the others,” he said.

Hundreds gathered in Emerson Hall Thursday to hear American author Elif Batuman ’99 and Harvard English professor Beth Blum in a conversation hosted by Harvard’s Mahindra Humanities Center.
During the event, which marked the first in-person session of the series “Writers Speak,” the pair spoke about Batuman’s outlook on writing and her Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel “The Idiot,” which she based on her experience as a freshman at Harvard.
Batuman kicked off the conversation by reading an excerpt from the first chapter of her latest novel “Either/Or,” a sequel to “The Idiot” published in May, before discussing her writing process with Blum.
As a young author, Batuman said creative writing meant “inventing characters” and “imaginatively projecting outside of yourself” — an idea she found counterintuitive.
“We experience everything from our own point of view, so to me, it makes a lot of sense to write from that perspective,” Batuman said. “I’ve been really happy about the auto-fiction trend, even though I agree it’s sort of an annoying word.”
When asked about the rarity of “protagonists who are fundamentally good students,” Batuman said she often wondered why she was a “compliant subject” as an undergraduate. Like Batuman, the novels’ protagonist Selin Karadağ is the daughter of Turkish immigrants and an aspiring writer.
“Now there’s so much incredible writing by immigrants and by the children of immigrants, but when I was growing up, there wasn’t that much that I was aware of,” Batuman said. “Compliance, especially for girls and for people who come from another culture, and the burden to succeed is part of what makes your life feel high stakes.”
The pair also discussed Batuman’s current role as an adjunct associate professor in the English department at Barnard College and her pedagogical approach.
“I teach undergraduates, and I am increasingly struck by the extent to which the pedagogical norms that I learned and internalized — whether explicitly or implicitly — were based on frustrating the student,” Batuman said. “I don’t think you can actually iron out all the frustration and friction from the educational process, but you can put yourself there with the person instead of creating some kind of hierarchy.”
Reflecting on her writing process, Batuman said she views writing as a challenge of determining what will excite the audience.
“I think of it as a puzzle where I can find a way to explain that to someone else where that’s going to be interesting to them, too,” Batuman said. “How do you turn it into a journey that this person is going to be excited to come on with you?”

In the lead up to the 138th iteration of the Harvard-Yale football game this Saturday, hundreds of undergraduate students rallied at a series of events inspiring school spirit hosted by the Harvard College Events Board.
The week kicked off with an outdoor celebration in the Science Center Plaza featuring fire pits, s’mores, and live music. Taig Singh ’26 said the event created “a sense of community” that would be taken into the game this weekend.
“The campfires were a great place to get warmth on this dark and cold night with our friends and community on Harvard’s campus,” Singh said.
On Tuesday evening, students gathered at the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub to decorate their own merchandise to wear and display at the game, including sweatshirts, pins, fanny packs, and posters.
“All these events — they’re really gearing us up for Saturday,” J. Garner Currie ’26 said. “This one specifically is kind of channeling our creative side to really express our hatred for Yale and our love for Harvard.”
Thursday’s “Bulldog Roast” event in Sanders Theatre began with performances by the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society, followed by the highly anticipated annual presentation on “Why Harvard is Better Than Yale” given by Andrew J. Berry, a lecturer in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department.
In the satirical lecture, Berry referred to a variety of college rankings, statistics, and biological research, joking that “the real heart of the inferiority of Yale is biological.”
“I do think that Harvard-Yale is arguably the one thing — well, that and maybe Housing Day — that creates a genuine crescendo of excitement, focus, and interest, so I think it’s great,” Berry added in an interview after the event.
Members of the College Events Board said they hoped to feature the diverse talents of the undergraduate student body throughout the week by providing opportunities for student performers to participate.
“We had a lot of fun just trying to figure out ways that we could incorporate a lot of different groups on campus, like the student groups, student performers,” CEB member Kevin Ray ’24 said. “It’s not just Harvard-Yale, but it’s also a show of Harvard pride and all the different groups that we have.”
Cathryn W. “Cate” Hazel ’23, director of Crimson Traditions, the CEB committee responsible for planning spirit week, said the most rewarding part of the annual celebrations is seeing students’ reactions.
“Everyone lends a hand for staffing, which is amazing,” Hazel said. “It’s mostly just fun because we get to see all the students so happy and excited — that’s what it’s all about.”
As Spirit Week concludes with HYsteria, an event open to both Harvard and Yale undergraduates this Friday, excitement is building among students for the return of The Game to Harvard Stadium for the first time since 2016.
“I feel like the energy will just be different,” said Jade Lozada ’25, a Crimson magazine editor. “I'm really excited to be back at Harvard.”

Taiwanese bubble tea brand Tiger Sugar has officially pounced its way into the Abbot building in Harvard Square.
The establishment welcomed customers during its soft opening on Nov. 11 and held its official grand opening the next day.
Tiger Sugar attempts to tell a “unique story” with its drinks, each infused with hand-pour syrups, or “tiger stripes,” according to the company’s website. Featured tiger-themed drinks include “Tiger Meets Mochi,” “Tiger Meets Coffee,” and “Tiger Meets Pudding.”
Since founder Ming Tsung Yang opened the original Tiger Sugar shop back in 2017 in Taichung, Taiwan, the brand has been crafting its drinks with syrups and tapioca pearls prepared in an eight-hour cooking process.
Alvin Lu, the owner of all three shops, wrote in an email that he signed the lease for the Cambridge Tiger Sugar location almost two years ago but had to delay the official opening due to the Covid-19 pandemic, increasing costs, and growing competition in the Square.
“We faced many challenges opening a bubble tea shop in Cambridge,” Lu wrote.
Despite these challenges, Lu noted that he chose the location for the new shop because of the number of tourists and the amount of foot traffic near the University.
Lu attributed roughly 75 percent of the shop’s sales so far to college students and the remaining 25 percent to tourists.
Harvard Square has been a magnet for incoming business recently, having welcomed Starbucks, Le Macaron, and the Central Rock Gym, among others. Tiger Sugar’s launch also comes after Gong Cha, a boba tea shop on Church St., opened in the Square in September.
The new location in Harvard Square will be joining its sister stores in Allston and Boston, officially marking the third Tiger Sugar shop to join the Greater Boston area.
Lu added that the grand opening of Tiger Sugar in Harvard Square “wasn’t as good as expected,” compared to grand openings at other Tiger Sugar locations.
“Our prominent supporters are college students, but we noticed fewer international students this year,” Lu wrote.
Krystal Thorp, an employee at Lovepop across the street, said she was “excited” to see a new Tiger Sugar location opening in Cambridge.
Thorp, who lives near the Tiger Sugar location in Allston, said the shop in that Boston neighborhood is “a lot smaller.”
“I’m excited that they have a big storefront here [in Cambridge],” Thorp said of Tiger Sugar. “It's worth it — it's really, really good.”

A panel of artists and scientists involved in creating an exhibit on the plant collection of Henry David Thoreau, Class of 1837, explored the intersection between art and botany as a means to inspire conversation about climate in a Harvard Museum of Natural History event on Thursday.
The exhibit “In Search of Thoreau’s Flowers: An Exploration of Change and Loss,” which opened in April, featured multimedia installations of Thoreau’s original specimens, marking locally extinct and endangered plants.
The event focused on an exhibit of plant specimens from the Harvard University Herbaria and Botanical Museum collected by Thoreau, an American naturalist, from his retreat near Walden Pond.
“Thoreau’s collection is a botanical time machine that exists in combination with his extensive notes about where and when his specimens were collected,” said University of North Carolina associate professor Leah J. Sobsey, an artist whose work features in the exhibit.
Hundreds of specimens in Thoreau’s collection have been digitized by volunteers and scientists at Harvard’s Botanical Museum. Charles C. Davis, professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard and another panelist at the event, said data gathered “across the seasons and over years” are the “gold standard” for examining how plants respond to climate and credited Thoreau for starting the data collection.
“Having this macro-evolutionary perspective and framework really helped to bring a lot of these connections into shape,” Davis said. “It connected climate change response in a new way here in New England that had a broad and important impact.”
The project’s new media designer, Robin Vuchnich, said she saw the exhibit as an opportunity to “breathe a little sign of life back into the specimens,” effectively “providing visual evidence of climate change” in a video broadcasted at the event.
More than 25 percent of species from Thoreau’s plant collections are now locally extinct, according to Vuchnich.
Panelist Emily K. Meineke, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis who supervised the scientific dimension of the exhibit, said it visually portrayed the impacts of climate change on local biodiversity.
“The idea was, ‘How do we bring beauty into the mix to crack people open and make these problem seem like something they can talk about?’” she said.
The exhibit featured wall displays of cyanotypes, an early photographic technique which creates a Prussian Blue print of plants. Locally extinct and declining species were marked in darker shades of blue to demonstrate their “severe decline,” according to Harvard OEB professor Elena M. Kramer, who moderated the event.
The panelists agreed that this process was just as much scientific as it was artistic.
“Our interdisciplinary team behind ‘In Search of Thoreau’s Flowers’ emerged from the strong belief that art and science can and should be in conversation to explore difficult issues,” Sobsey said.
Sarah Dendy, an audience member and second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Harvard OEB department, said she appreciated the more local focus of the exhibition.
“There’s some humility and authenticity for approaching a problem that’s this direct and close to home,” she said.
Dendy said she felt the most salient part of the discussion was when the creators reflected upon the varying experiences audiences had with the exhibit, especially how children did not necessarily understand its “themes of loss.”
“An element of the adult experience is to see that the kids don’t share this lost history and to realize that the changes we’re seeing will affect them, even if they don’t realize,” she said. “I found that very moving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Colombian President Iván Duque discussed Latin America’s resurgent left wing and advocated for environmental action at the Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday afternoon.
The event, moderated by Paula J. Dobriansky, a former U.S. ambassador and a Belfer Center senior fellow, drew more than 100 Harvard affiliates to the Kennedy School’s Starr Auditorium where Duque spoke and took audience questions for more than 90 minutes.
Duque, who served as Colombia’s president from 2018 to 2022, left office earlier this summer after leftist presidential candidate and longtime rival Gustavo Petro won election on a platform of combating economic inequality. Latin America’s six largest economies will all be run by left-wing leaders once Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva takes office on Jan. 1, cementing the region’s left-wing shift.
Duque, however, said he does not believe the current political arguments in the region are based on political ideology.
“For me, it is not a debate between right and left,” he said. “I think the debates that I see are between right and wrong, which is about the policies and how do you embrace the public policies and how the policies contribute to the benefits of society.”
“This is not the first time that we see a red Latin America,” Duque added.
Duque, who was elected to the presidency on a right-wing platform, said he is most worried about “demagogy decisions” that generate instability and uncertainty.
“I strongly believe that we can differentiate countries in Latin America today between two groups: those countries that are [led] by demagogues and those countries that are [led] by pedagogues,” Duque said. “The difference is that the pedagogy behind decisions is that there are a lot of unpopular decisions that have to be taken fiscally, socially, monetary — and they work.”
Duque offered praise for Lula, Brazil’s left-wing president-elect, despite their ideological differences.
“A lot of people have the expectation that Lula is going to be a radical,” he said. “At least when we look [at] what happened in the first Lula term, he was not a radical — he actually tried to appoint people that were very savvy on macroeconomic policy.”
But when asked in an interview with The Crimson after the event whether he would have preferred to work with Lula instead of outgoing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Duque replied, “I don’t have preferences,” noting his “very good relationship” with Bolsonaro.
Duque said Bolsonaro was also able to work across ideological differences, noting that the outgoing Brazilian president signed the Leticia Pact, an agreement to protect the Amazonian rainforest, with left-wing former Bolivian President Evo Morales.
“I built a lot of common policies with Jair Bolsonaro,” Duque added. “Now there’s a transition, and I just hope that Brazil remains being a strong voice for the environment in Latin America.”
Duque’s own tenure as president had been criticized by environmental activists, who protested his support for fracking, an oil extraction practice associated with environmental and health risks.
When asked about his support for fracking by a student during the Kennedy School event, Duque said he has "never been a champion of fracking" but that he wanted to emphasize science over politics while developing a fracking policy. During his administration, petroleum companies were allowed to start fracking projects as “scientific pilots” which the government could use to study the practice’s environmental impacts.
“But they have since stopped,” said Duque, referring to current Colombian President Gustavo Petro’s decision to halt fracking. “Why? Because again, politics was above science — and I don’t agree with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee hosted a conversation Wednesday with No Tech For Apartheid — a coalition of tech employees calling for companies to divest from contracts with the Israeli government.
More than 50 Harvard affiliates turned out in Boylston Hall for the event, which featured Amazon employee Bathool Syed, former Google worker Ariel Koren, and MPower Change campaign manager Lau Barrios, who criticized Google and Amazon for their involvement in Project Nimbus — a $1.2 billion contract between Google, Amazon, and the Israeli military and government.
“We kind of find it at the most basic level — that there’s no way that you can be upholding these supposed principles if you’re doing business with a state or an organization that has explicitly broken human rights,” Syed said.
Google and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.
Koren, who said she was “ousted” from Google after protesting Project Nimbus, said the company is “wiping their hands of any responsibility to regulate how the technology that they are building get used.”
Koren claims Google kept Project Nimbus under wraps to prevent workers from organizing against it.
“What these companies are most afraid of, in addition to their image being damaged, is their workers speaking out,” she said. “There’s a deeply ingrained culture of Zionist bias where folks will be called into HR just for speaking out.”
Koren said after she publicly protested Google’s involvement in Project Nimbus, she was given 17 business days to choose to relocate to São Paulo, Brazil, from her workplace in San Francisco Before Koren made a decision, her manager had already communicated to her colleagues that she had resigned, she said.
“It was just a sneaky way for them to fire me without firing me,” she said. “They just gaslit me and all of my colleagues, and then refused to admit that it was retaliation.”
“They see when you retaliate, you won’t be successful in silencing us because more people are going to come forward and speak,” she added.
In an August statement to the New York Times, Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry said the company “prohibit[s] retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy.”
“We thoroughly investigated this employee’s claim, as we do when any concerns are raised,” she said.
In response to a question from the moderator, Hossam Nasr ’21, the panelists advised students in the audience to seek out companies that “do good” rather than simply perform “lip service.”
“The only thing that you really can do is to get involved and agitate as long as you can,” Syed said. “It’s critical to have both workers that are in the company and those that are outside of the company — whether they be workers in the industry and other companies, or just members of the public and other parts of the public — to be involved.”

Cambridge will return to sourcing tap water from the city’s own water supply, less than three months after it temporarily switched water sources due to rising levels of concerning chemical pollutants, the city announced Thursday.
After samples of Cambridge tap water revealed levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances were approaching the legal limit in Massachusetts, city officials announced a temporary switch to using water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority beginning Aug. 30, which supplies tap water to Boston and Somerville.
But on Thursday, officials said that levels of the synthetic pollutants — often referred to as PFAS chemicals or “forever chemicals” — dropped from 17.1 parts per trillion to less than five parts per trillion due to new Granular Activated Carbon filters, prompting a switch back.
In the release, City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 said he was “committed to providing high-quality water” to Cambridge residents.
“My children and I continue to drink our city’s tap water with confidence,” Huang said.
PFAS chemicals are widely found in nonstick cookware, clothing, food packaging and other household products, and can take years to leave the human body once ingested. They have been linked to health risks including birth defects and certain cancers, according to the CDC.
Massachusetts regulations limit PFAS levels in drinking water to 20 parts per trillion. The EPA does not restrict PFAS chemicals in water, but has issued a health advisory recommending no more than .02 and .004 parts per trillion of the two most common PFAS chemicals to ensure safe lifetime consumption.
In a report released Thursday, the EPA announced it will propose a “National Drinking Water Standard” for two PFAS chemicals by the end of the year.
Samuel Corda, managing director of the Cambridge Water Department, said in the press release that GAC filtration proved “very effective” for removing the chemicals from water “in conjunction with other pretreatment methods.”
“More frequent GAC media replacement is now a part of our preventative maintenance practice to ensure we can remove PFAS from our drinking water,” Corda said.
The release said only two filters have been installed out of a planned six, and that the city “expects continued reductions in PFAS levels” following the installation of the last four.
Cambridge owns and operates its own water system, which supplies water to over 100,000 Cantabrigians. The city’s water moves from the Stony Brook Watershed to reservoirs at Fresh Pond and through a treatment facility before flowing into the taps of Cambridge homes.
According to the release, the city paid $1.5 million for the installation of the new GAC filters and roughly $7 million for two-and-a-half months of MRWA water.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With four seconds left on the clock, freshman guard Jared Turner rebounded the ball and slung a pass upcourt to junior forward Coleman Stucke, giving him the opportunity to overturn a one-point deficit and grab a 71-70 win for Northeastern. As the clock hit zero and the buzzer lit up, Coleman’s shot came off the backboard, hit the rim and fell harmlessly wide, sending fans in the Matthews Arena into silence and settling a tight contest in favor of the Crimson.
In a hard-fought victory, Harvard (3-1) overcame a 63-57 deficit in the last five minutes of the game to win 70-69. With 1:42 left on the clock, junior guard Sam Silverstein capped off a 16-6 Crimson run with an emphatic dunk to put Harvard into the lead. The Crimson was able to successfully shut-out Northeastern (0-3) for the remainder of the game.
Wednesday night’s win for Harvard marks a third win in four games to start off the 2022-23 season as the team aims for a return to the Ivy-League playoffs and a potential NCAA tournament bid.
“We knew this would be a tough game, we knew it would come down to the wire," senior forward Chris Ledlum said. “I’m just glad we stuck together, played the game together, and came out with a win.”
After being forced to sit out the second-half of last season with an injury, Ledlum is wasting no time. Ledlum recorded a career-high 29 points against the Huskies, shooting 12-17 from the field and 3-5 from 3-point range.
“Chris Ledlum was sensational, he carried us and put us on his back,” coach Tommy Amaker said.
Last season, injuries proved to be a persistent pain for the Crimson with Ledlum, sophomore guard Louis Lesmond, and senior guard Idan Tretout all spending significant time on the sidelines. This year all three players are back to fitness and have been a big boost for Harvard on the court.
“It was a long journey,” Ledlum reflected. “I’m just glad my teammates believed in me, they helped me. We all did it together. So we’ve just been building, working hard in practice, and I’m just looking forward to continuing to win games.”
Tretout also continued a strong start to the season with nine points and three rebounds against the Huskies. Sophomore guard Evan Nelson added nine points and two assists. Lesmond and senior guard Luka Sakota also contributed three and six points respectively.
The depth of the Crimson proved to be critical in its eventual victory.
“We talked about it at halftime that we thought the difference in the game was going to be our bench and our balance,” Amaker said.
When asked about the impact of having injured players back, coach Amaker expressed his satisfaction.
“I’m really happy, because they're seniors and coming back off of injuries and finding their way this year and not only finding their way but leading us, and it’s wonderful to see,” coach Amaker said.
Another positive for the Crimson was the performance of first-year forward Chisom Okpara who led Harvard in rebounds with 10 on the night. Okpara has been featured in all four games this season, with this game marking his first game of double-digit rebounds.
“Sometimes we need him to slow down, but I like the fact that that’s how we’re trying to coach him, not “we need you to play harder” – that’s a really good thing,” Amaker said. “He brings about a great spirit and energy, and he’s gonna do exceptionally well here at Harvard on and off the court.”
The Crimson started the game strongly, surging out to an early 13-6 lead off of a pair of Ledlum three pointers and two two-point jump shots from junior forward Justice Ajogbor. Cheered on by the home crowd, Northeastern found a rhythm and went on a 8-0 run to swing the momentum in their favor and bring the score back level at 17-17. The rest of the first-half followed a back-and-forth rythm with Northeastern briefly pulling into a 32-24 lead off back-to-back three pointers from Stucke, only to have its lead reduced to 32-30 by two unanswered Harvard two-pointers and a momentous dunk by Ledlum off a turnover to end the half.
Both teams started the second half energetically in an attempt to gain control of the game. Ledlum continued right where he left off, faking a shot from the corner, and breaking inside for a two-hand slam to tie the game at 32-32. Northeastern would not be discouraged and responded immediately with a dunk of its own from junior forward Alexander Nwagha, setting the tone for a tense second half.
As the clock ran down, the two teams exchanged blows, both staying within striking distance of a win. With 2:14 left, Ledlum made one of his few mistakes of the game, missing two-free throws after being fouled on an attempted layup. The next play led to a two-point jump shot from junior guard Jahmyl Telfort, putting Northeastern into a 69-68 lead and causing the home crowd to erupt with cheers. The joy, however, was short lived with Silverstein slamming home the dunk that would prove to be decisive just twelve seconds later.
The enthusiastic celebration from the Crimson bench at full-time showed the spirit of a team hungry for success. Despite being early in the season, the win for the Crimson feels significant in setting the tone for games to come.
“I was really happy for our kids because, in terms of how your year can go, it can depend on some of these tough, hard-fought, close games in particular on the road,” Amaker said.
The Crimson will now bring the action back to its home court with play resuming at Lavietes Pavilion against Siena College this Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s ice hockey team started a season 7-0-0, head coach Ted Donato was a forward starring for the Crimson on a team that went on to win the only national championship in program history.
However, after defeating the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Engineers, the Union College Dutchmen, and the University of New Hampshire Wildcats in its first road action of the campaign, Harvard has equaled its best season-opening stretch since the 1988-1989 season, sending the Crimson into the top ten of national rankings and raising already high expectations.
“I think the guys last year, at the end of the year, got a taste of winning the ECAC Tournament, winning the Ivy League,” Donato said. “I think guys finished the season with a taste in their mouth of success and we’re hungry to build on it, and I think we’re off to a good start.”
HARVARD 3, RPI 2 (OT)
In an evenly matched first period, both the Engineers and the Crimson traded quality chances throughout. Sophomore forward Alex Gaffney and sophomore defenseman Jack Bar each had opportunities to score early on, while senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson made an outstanding glove save on RPI forward TJ Walsh, who had surged past the Harvard defense to skate in all alone on Gibson. Gibson made another strong stop on a prime opportunity for Engineers forward Jakob Lee halfway through the period, while the line of first-year forwards Philip Tresca and Marek Hejduk and senior forward Austin Wong put pressure on RPI goaltender Jack Watson, but neither team was able to notch a goal, ending the first period knotted at 0-0.
Despite an even first period, with a narrow 10-8 Crimson advantage in shots on goal, the Engineers took control of the game with a strong second period. After killing off an early Harvard power play, RPI forward Ryan Mahshie capitalized off a Crimson turnover to record his third goal of the season and give the Engineers the 1-0 advantage. RPI continued to push after grabbing the lead, and just over a minute after Mahshie’s goal, forward John Beaton carried the puck through the neutral zone and found forward John Evans, who surged through Harvard defense and beat Gibson to put the Engineers up 2-0 after only six-and-a-half minutes of play. The Crimson had two power play opportunities in the second half of the period to chip away at the RPI lead, but the Engineers’ penalty kill and Watson shut the door, keeping Harvard’s potent power play off the board and sending RPI to the third period with a two-goal advantage.
“Even though we out-chanced and out-shot them, we gave up way too many quality chances…to expect that we can win with that kind of effort on a consistent basis,” Donato said.
Despite the Engineers’ strong play in the second frame, the Crimson came out firing to start the third in hopes of continuing their unbeaten start. Less than two minutes into the period, the line of Wong, Tresca, and Hejduk slashed the Harvard deficit to one goal after Wong knocked a loose puck past Watson after a chaotic net-front scramble. The goal was reviewed by the officials but stood after replay, putting the Crimson down by one. Harvard continued to press for the tying goal, with both Gaffney and senior defenseman Ryan Siedem taking aim at Watson but unable to secure the equalizer, while the Crimson penalty kill successfully killed off a hooking penalty on senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun, keeping Harvard in the game. With just over five minutes remaining in regulation, the Crimson took advantage of an RPI icing to tie the game. After an Engineers icing required them to keep their fourth line on the ice, Donato sent the line of Gaffney, junior forward Alex Laferriere, and sophomore forward Zakary Karpa onto the ice. Karpa won the faceoff cleanly back to Siedem, who found Gaffney at the top of the circles, and Gaffney sniped a wrist shot through a Karpa screen and past Watson, tying the game at 2-2.
“We have a number of plays that the centerman selects,” Donato said. “I'm not sure that that wasn't just a really good play by both Ryan Siedem and Alex Gaffney creating a little bit of a seam and then coming up in kind of a soft area, and then, obviously, an excellent shot.”
Both teams traded chances in the final five minutes, but both Gibson and Watson stood tall between their pipes to send the game to overtime. The extra session proved to be chaotic, as Farrell and Beaton each recorded quality chances, but Gaffney was the hero yet again, tallying the game-winning goal after two-and-a-half minutes of play. After his initial shot from the faceoff circle was denied by Watson, Gaffney collected the rebound and circled back to the middle of the ice, where his shot deflected off of an RPI defender and past Watson, completing Harvard’s comeback and securing the Crimson’s first road victory with the 3-2 win.
“Three-on-three is man-on-man so you’ve got to stay with your guy the whole time,” Gaffney said. “But, in general, there's more time and space and I think that benefits me, being able to skate a little more and I just know once you get possession you can't really give it up.”
HARVARD 5, UNION 1
The Crimson started the first period strong, generating chances both at even strength and on the power play. Tresca and senior forward and captain Baker Shore both had early opportunities to give Harvard an early lead, and Karpa and first-year forward Joe Miller had chances on an early power play, but they were denied by Dutchmen goaltender Connor Murphy. However, the Crimson grabbed the 1-0 lead midway through the period with a shorthanded goal, their fourth of the season, from junior forward Sean Farrell, who took possession after a sloppy defensive zone turnover by the Dutchmen and fired a quick shot through Murphy. Harvard carried the play for the remainder of the period, finishing the first frame with a 14-6 edge in shots on goal.
The Crimson continued to maintain the edge in play at the outset of the second period, peppering Murphy and the Union defense. Harvard’s top line extended the advantage to 2-0 just under seven minutes into the period, as sophomore forward Matthew Coronato drove around the net and fired a backhand into the crease, where the puck deflected off of Miller’s shin and past Murphy. However, the Dutchmen answered immediately, with forward Nate Hanley collecting a feed from forward Josh Nixon in the faceoff circle and firing a shot through junior goaltender Derek Mullahy, trimming the Crimson lead to 2-1. After Union’s goal, the game became far more chippy and physical, and Bar and Nixon were assessed five minute major penalties for contact to the head and hitting from behind, respectively, in addition to 10-minute misconduct penalties for each player. Harvard took advantage of the ensuing 4-on-4 opportunity, with Farrell notching his second goal of the game before Coronato lit the lamp after receiving a great pass from Thrun, giving the Crimson a 4-1 lead after two periods.
“I think it was more just the emotions running hot,” said Donato about the large penalty minute totals. “I think it was a lot of after-the-whistle stuff. There were some big hits and I think it's just a team that is playing with a lot of drive and energy in Union and we had to elevate our compete level, especially after last night. I thought we would need to be better and I think on the four-on-four our skill players took advantage.”
Despite facing a steep deficit, the Dutchmen came out strong in the third period, with Mullahy making several strong saves to maintain a three-goal lead. Union failed to capitalize on several power play opportunities, and the Dutchmen also made a goaltending change less than six minutes into the period, with Kyle Chauvette replacing Murphy in net. The teams traded chances throughout the remainder of the period, and Shore tallied his first goal of the season when he deflected a shot-pass from Farrell past Chauvette, clinching the 5-1 victory.
“Going into last night, RPI was 5-0 at home, and going into tonight, Union was 4-0 at home, so we knew it’d be a good challenge for us,” Donato said.
HARVARD 3, UNH 1
In the first period, the Crimson continued to put their early season trend of slow starts in the rearview mirror with a strong opening 20 minutes. After an evenly matched first eight minutes, Harvard grabbed some momentum with a strong penalty kill after Bar was given a two minute minor penalty for interference. Coronato and Farrell continued to be an effective penalty killing forward duo, and less than three minutes after Bar’s penalty expired, the pair produced Harvard’s first goal. After collecting a loose puck in the corner, Farrell fired a hard pass into the slot, where Coronato ripped a wrist shot through Wildcats goaltender Tyler Muszelik, giving the Crimson a 1-0 advantage. Harvard had a late power play chance to stretch their lead, but they were only able to generate three shot attempts, and the period ended with the Crimson ahead 1-0.
“I take a lot of pride in being able to play all different scenarios,” Farrell said. “Me and Coronato played a little bit together on the penalty kill last season, and this year, we’re playing even more…and I think this year it's even resulted in some offense as well because we kind of figured out the defensive side of it.”
Although Harvard jumped out to the early lead, the Crimson’s propensity to take too many penalties threatened to swing the momentum of the game in the second period. Bar was penalized for slashing just over a minute into the period, and despite failing to score while on the man-advantage, UNH continued to lay siege to Gibson, as the Wildcats recorded six shots on goal in the three minutes after Bar’s penalty expired. The continued pressure sent Harvard back to the penalty kill after Farrell was called for holding, but the Crimson kept UNH off the board, despite having one of its best penalty killers in the penalty box. Two minutes later, Harvard was again forced to play shorthanded after a bench minor penalty for two many men on the ice, but the Crimson again tightened up defensively, stymying the Wildcats on their power play and on a strong shift after their man-advantage had expired. Towards the end of the period, Harvard had its own opportunity to play a man up, and the ECAC’s best power play unit extended the Crimson lead, as Farrell made a great move to delay his shot, evade the Wildcats defender, and beat Muszelik for a 2-0 lead heading to intermission.
Harvard’s special teams units continued to dominate in the third period, as an early holding penalty on sophomore defenseman Ian Moore was killed off with no damage done. Just shy of eight minutes into the period, the Crimson’s power play clicked once again, as first-year defenseman Ryan Healey shook off a UNH penalty killer and fired a wrist shot that was deflected past Muszelik by senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun, who recorded his first goal of the campaign and staked Harvard to a 3-0 lead. The teams each recorded power play chances soon after Thrun’s goal, and while neither team scored on their man-advantage opportunities, the Wildcats ended Gibson’s shutout bid 30 seconds with just over four minutes to play as UNH captain Chase Stevenson beat Gibson after a lively rebound of a shot by forward Nick Cafarelli. The Wildcats generated scoring chances during their two-and-a-half minutes of time with an empty net, but strong saves from Gibson and a shot block by Shore shut down the UNH attack and secured the 3-1 win.
The Crimson will be back in action on Nov. 25th and Nov. 26th when they travel to Ann Arbor, M.I.to take on the No. 3 Michigan Wolverines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there was ever any doubt to how the Harvard men’s and women’s squash teams would perform coming out of the summer hiatus, it can now all be erased.
After both Crimson squads closed out historic 2021-22 seasons, culminating in team College Squash Association (CSA) national titles for both divisions, Harvard reminded the college sports community once again how comfortable it is at the top of the podium. And the world did not forget this over the few summer months: as CSA pre-season rankings rolled in, the Crimson found itself sitting at the top, with a No. 1 ranking in the men’s division, and a No. 2 ranking for the women.
Nevertheless, there was still some uncertainty as the nine men of Harvard squash took to the court Saturday for their season debut against No. 10 Rochester. After all, the Crimson (2-0, 1-0) would be stepping back into the Murr Center without former first rung player Victor Crouin. Crouin, who graduated last year, has moved on to play with the Professional Squash Association World Tour, and currently sits as world No. 10—World No. 1 is a fellow Harvard alumnus, Ali Farag ’14.
But when assessing the Crimson squash roster, it is important to remember its consistent depth. Senior co-captain Marwan Tarek, a native of Cairo, Egypt, is off to a good start in his quest to fill the void left by Crouin’s departure. Tarek played two games last year as Harvard’s number one, winning both. Now the team’s heavy-hitter, Tarek stepped seamlessly into the top position last Saturday to take down Rochester’s star, fellow Cairene Abdelrahman Lasheen, in straight sets.
The hero of ast year’s CSA title game, junior Ido Burstein, has climbed his way up from the number six rung to number two. On Saturday, Burstein was forced to five sets by a late surge from the Yellow Jackets’ Yash Fadte. However, in the last set of the day, the composed veteran managed to secure the win for Harvard, halting Fadte’s momentum to complete the 9-0 sweep for the Crimson.
It was evident from Harvard’s win over the Yellow Jackets that this year’s men’s squash roster is fully loaded with offensive weapons. Other than Burstein’s five-set thriller, the Crimson wrapped up each of its matches with a clean 3-0, making it a relatively short day for fans; Harvard was able to finish points quickly with lots of aggressive attacking.
Sophomores Tate Harms and Ayush Menon highlighted head coach Mike Way’s philosophy of strong offense creating natural defense. Both players managed to sweep their opponents while only dropping a total of six points throughout their matches.
After its strong showing against another ranked team in its season opener, the Crimson already look to be among the favorites to defend its title next spring. The strong early-season showing continued on Wednesday, asHarvard convincingly dispatched Brown in its Ivy League opener.
Burstein, slotted in first for the clash, made much shorter work of his opponent this time around. Alongside all eight of his fellow Crimson compatriots, Burstein posted a 3-0 sweep.
Harms once again treated the crowd to an offensive-defense clinic, this time playing in Harvard’s fourth position. With strong cross-court attacking that pressured his opponent, the Swiss allowed only three points while scoring 33. Harms has now dropped just nine points across his first six sets this season.
Yes, Brown is an unranked team, and the Crimson has a 32-0 record against the Bears historically, but it is difficult to hide skill in the tiny confines of the 45’ x 25’ court. If the victory seemed easy, it was because Harvard did not ease off its opponents at any point in the matches.
The women’s team (1-0, 1-0) also experienced a significant shakeup this summer after graduating senior captain Hana Moataz – now also finding success in the PSA – and strong number three and fellow CSA All-American, senior Amina Yousry, from the program.
For Tuesday’s matches, also against Brown, Harvard entered the Murr Center to showcase the team’s new roster configuration in action. Current senior Marina Stefanoni now sits at the helm for the Crimson, with sophomore Habiba Eldafrawy playing in the second slot. Both Stafanoni and Eldafrawy, along with the rest of the Crimson, dismissed their opponents handily with  3-0 wins in a season and Ivy League opening sweep.
The win was the Crimson’s 50th straight over the Bears, and its 99th consecutive match win overall, the longest active win streak in women’s college squash. The Crimson will have the opportunity to extend this streak into the triple figures as it takes on Dartmouth in two weeks.
The women’s team will be heavily favored to extend the streak. The dominance Harvard exhibited on the Murr Center courts is something that fans and analysts alike have come to expect from any program under the direction of Way, who was inducted into the Canadian Squash Hall of Fame this summer. But nonetheless, although the level of competition that this Crimson team is showing has come to be expected, there are no guarantees when it comes to sustaining a dynasty this dominant.
Perhaps, without the talents of Moataz and Yousry, Harvard will eventually miss their two departed Egyptian stars, but the Crimson certainly look capable of producing similarly successful results to last year’s historic season. The big test will come later on, when Harvard faces No. 1 Trinity College. The Crimson is historically 10-0 against the Bantams, besting them 6-3 in an exciting set of matches last January when Harvard was ranked No.1.
The small liberal arts school from Hartford, Conn. plays its first game this coming Saturday against Bowdoin, which will give the Crimson an idea of what lies in store on Jan. 15, when the two Howe Cup favorites meet for the first – but likely not only – time this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team defeated Army West Point in a resounding 41-24 victory in the first round of the NIRA National Championships this past weekend, successfully avenging its Oct. 29 loss and sending it through to the final, where the team will play Dartmouth.
The Crimson, on the hunt for its first championship since 2019, started off its campaign on a high note. A rematch in the first round provided a great opportunity to adjust and score a key win.
“Our first loss to Army was pretty hard,” said freshman Lennox Landon in a written interview. “We knew that we were the better team, so losing by two with a final kick was a difficult way to lose. Going into the semis, we really wanted to exploit the home field advantage. One practice before the game we spent 20 minutes just making up cheers that we could use during the game! We really wanted to be ruthless in our comeback and bring the energy and I think we did exactly that.”
The crowd at Mignone Field certainly energized the team. After Army got out to a quick 7-0 lead on its first possession, Harvard took control. Senior captain flyhalf Alex Pipkin grabbed a toss from sophomore flanker Sofia Hilger and ran the ball in for a try, and a conversion by sophomore fullback/wing Chloe Headland quickly tied the game. The score remained at a stalemate until around the seven minute mark, when another stellar pass from Hilger set up junior flyhalf Brogan Mior for the breakaway try. Another try and subsequent conversion, this one ran in by first-year outside back first-year outside back Cameron Fields, making the score 19-7 at the half.
The Crimson did not take its foot off the gas in the second half. Less than two minutes in, first-year center/fullback Tiahna Padhilla took the ball up the left side and ran it into the try zone. Another conversion put the Crimson’s lead at a comfortable 27-7. After the Black Knights scored a quick try to close the gap to 27-14, the home team showed off their defense, with London scooping up an errant backwards pass and running it in for the score. London spoke highly of the team’s ability to score a wide variety of tries.
“I really loved how dynamic and creative we were in this game,” she said. “As a whole, I believe this team takes pride in backing each other. No matter what happened, we were right there for each other and that allowed us to create some amazing continuity and pretty plays.”
The two teams continued to battle, but with under eight minutes to go, Fields displayed her amazing speed, outrunning everyone up the left side and scoring the try. Another conversion from Headland left the score at a comfortable 41-17. Though Army was able to get another try in the minute before closing time, it was too little too late, and the Crimson secured the victory, 41-24.
Now, the team’s attention has turned to the championship game this Saturday, Nov. 19 in another rematch, this time against Dartmouth, who handed the Crimson its first loss of the season on Oct. 15.
“Going into this weekend, we want this to be our peak game,” said London of the team’s mentality. “We're ready to leave everything on the pitch and give it our all….Our whole theme this season has been building each game. Our semi game was definitely the best so far, and we're ready to play our best game yet this Saturday!”

Just a mile across the river from the Yard, Harvard’s U-shaped colosseum towers over Allston, offering a space for eager runners, spectators, and athletes. At nearly 120 years old, the home of Harvard football also houses decades of American and Boston history.
Though most of Harvard’s facilities sit in Cambridge, Harvard Stadium can be found alongside the Harvard Business School and the University’s other athletic facilities in Allston. The historic stadium is the soaring centerpiece of the athletic complex, standing next to other celebrated venues such as the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Gordon Indoor Track, Lavietes Pavilion, and the Beren Tennis Center.
Built in 1903 from a $100,000 donation from the Class of 1879 and $75,000 from the Harvard Alumni Association, Harvard Stadium remains the nation’s oldest concrete stadium and the first architectural piece to use reinforced structural concrete. It was modeled after Greek colosseums and Roman circuses in an effort led by Lewis Jerome Johnson, Class of 1887, a civil engineering professor at Harvard at the time.
Johnson spearheaded the construction of reinforced concrete, which was incorporated following the discovery that the stadium’s original wooden seating posed a danger to attendees. The wood was not sturdy enough to hold thousands of fans, let alone withstand a potential fire, leading the Alumni Association to require firemen and trucks at every contest at the stadium to ensure safety. In 1981, the press box burned down in a fire known as “the phoenix of the press box,” costing $375,000 to repair and rebuild — nearly three times the cost it took to build the stadium decades beforehand.
Still, a larger problem was at hand: the sport of football itself. After losing hundreds of players to serious injuries and some to death, President Theodore Roosevelt, a member of Class of 1880, organized the Intercollegiate Football Conference in 1906, the predecessor of the NCAA. The conference instituted a new set of rules, requiring fields to be 40 yards wider. Harvard objected to this rule because of the size of its stadium. In turn, the committee instead ordained the forward pass – the throwing of the ball towards the defensive team’s goal line. Without Harvard Stadium, the sport of football would not be the same, as it influenced the standardization of field dimensions and the installation of the forward pass.
The stadium has continued to undergo renovations in recent years. In fact, as timeless as it is, the stadium did not have electrical lights until 2007, just a couple years after turf replaced its former grass. The Crimson practiced in the dark during the wee hours of the morning and in late evening practices for decades before this renovation project began. Harvard played its first night game against Brown on Sept. 22, 2007, beating the Bears 24-17.
Harvard Stadium will host the Crimson and Bulldogs this weekend in The Game, but the first contest ever played on its grass was actually an Ancient Eight clash of Harvard and Dartmouth on Nov. 14, 1903, nearly 120 years ago. Since then, the field has hosted a number of national and international contests, such as soccer matches in the 1984 Summer Olympics and the New England Patriots of the National Football League.
In fact, two ice hockey rinks were built inside the stadium for Harvard men’s ice hockey in December of 1904, allowing spectators to watch the games. The stadium served as the home for the hockey team until World War I.
Harvard hockey was not the only northeast team to compete in the stadium. During the fall of 1970, the Boston Patriots – now known as the New England Patriots – played their inaugural NFL season at Harvard Stadium. The Patriots contacted Harvard athletic officials about playing at the stadium while their current home, Gillette Stadium, was under construction. Harvard only agreed to allow the Patriots to use the stadium for one year on the condition the team would replace the field afterwards. The Patriots, who would later go on to win six Super Bowls while playing their home games at Gillette Stadium, were not allowed to use the varsity locker rooms, which were reserved for the Crimson. Though Harvard students only had to trek across the Charles River to watch NFL games, few were interested.
One Boston team that has yet to mark its territory in Harvard Stadium is the Boston Bruins. Part of the National Hockey League’s Original Six, the Bruins have played a major role in the history of Boston sports. In January 2023, they will host the Pittsburgh Penguins at Fenway Park for the 2023 NHL Winter Classic, one of the NHL’s premier events that is typically held at a football or baseball stadium against a nearby NHL team. The Bruins look poised to be a candidate to host the Winter Classic again in their 100th anniversary season. If awarded the 2024 NHL Winter Classic, Harvard Stadium, alongside Fenway Park, could serve as a potential option for the historic sports event.
To this day, the venue is one of only four college stadiums recognized as a Natural Historic Landmark, along with the Rose Bowl, the LA Coliseum, and the Yale Bowl. The near-colosseum in the Allston neighborhood of Boston was built to hold just over 30,000 fans, and on Saturday, it will likely hold a sellout crowd, as The Game returns to Harvard Stadium for the first time in six years. Although the schools typically alternate hosting duties, the 2020 iteration was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 135th playing of The Game was held at Fenway Park in 2018.
Fans at Harvard Stadium first witnessed a victory over Yale in 1913. This weekend, tens of thousands of students, alumni, and family members will hope to see the Crimson pick up its 62nd win in the historic rivalry. Last year, Harvard locked up its 61st in epic fashion, beating Yale 34-31 in a fourth quarter thriller in New Haven, Connecticut.
Currently, the Crimson has a 6-3 overall record and 4-2 record within the Ivy League. It defeated Ivy foe Penn 37-14 last Saturday, keeping its hopes for an Ivy League title alive and marking Harvard’s first undefeated road record since 2015.
The 138th playing of The Game is slated for a noon kickoff at Harvard Stadium this Saturday, continuing the venue’s legacy and standing as a reminder of its impact on both the sport of football and the University it represents to this day.

1968. 2005. 2018. And, after a miraculous, improbable fourth-quarter comeback that saw senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly leave his lasting mark on the Harvard history books, 2021.
These years saw some of the most legendary games in the history of Harvard-Yale, the second-oldest rivalry in college football and a matchup which requires only a two-word moniker: The Game. Saturday will mark the 138th gridiron meeting between Harvard and Yale — a rivalry whose results have been worthy of two of the most storied programs in football. Yale leads the series, 68-61-8, but since the inception of Ivy League play in 1956, the Crimson has had the edge, 37-27-1.
Time and time again, the season-ending matchup has held high stakes. In 1974, Harvard notched a 21-16 victory to earn a share of the Ivy League title with the Bulldogs. In 2014, ESPN’s College Gameday pregame show traveled to Cambridge as the Crimson took on Yale for conference supremacy — and won, 34-21. And in 2019, Harvard had the opportunity to play spoiler as the Bulldogs chased a championship, but lost in crushing fashion in double-overtime, 50-43.
This year, the stakes are as high as ever.
An Ancient Eight title is again on the line for both Harvard and Yale when they face off on Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium. If the Bulldogs (7-2, 5-1) win, at least a share of the title is theirs, regardless of the result in the concurrent matchup between Princeton (8-1, 5-1) and Penn (7-2, 4-2), which kicks off at 1 p.m. on Saturday, one hour after The Game. Harvard (6-3, 4-2), meanwhile, will need a little help — the Quakers must upset the Tigers in Princeton, N.J., for Harvard to clinch a title this year. But if both Penn and the Crimson come out victorious, all four teams would share the Ivy League championship — which would mark the first time in history that more than three teams have finished atop the conference.
After relinquishing Penn 37-14 in its most complete performance of the season, Harvard will head into The Game peaking at the right time. At Penn, senior quarterback Charlie Dean produced the finest game of his career, completing 29 of his 38 passes for 316 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions. Meanwhile, senior running back Aidan Borguet inched closer to the single-season rushing record held by Clifton Dawson ’07. After adding 117 yards on 20 carries against the Quakers, the five-foot-ten back will need 183 against Yale to secure the most proficient rushing season ever for a Crimson player. While a gargantuan task, Borguet accounted for 179 in a 28-13 win over Dartmouth on Oct. 29 and could meet the moment again.
“Everyone was just focused on what their job was,” Dean said of the win. “At the same time, we knew that we had to take care of business, and I think everyone was focused on what they needed to do, and kind of work together as a team. That was the best result we had all season.”
But as good as Harvard looks headed into the much-anticipated matchup, the Bulldogs arguably look better. Last Saturday, Yale welcomed undefeated Princeton to New Haven, Conn., and emerged with a 24-20 stunner. Its performance wasn’t perfect — junior quarterback Nolan Grooms threw for just 65 yards and completed less than half his passes — but it was good enough to thwart a Tigers team that had come into Harvard Stadium and left the Crimson looking foolish in a 37-10 win three weeks earlier.
“They’re consistent,” Dean said of the Yale defense. “They don’t make a lot of mistakes. They’re where they're supposed to be. And sometimes, watching Princeton’s offense, they capitalize a lot when defenses made mistakes. And Yale’s defense played a pretty clean game against them. That was the biggest deciding factor, that Princeton made more mistakes than Yale did.”
For Harvard to come out victorious on Saturday, it will likely need a standout performance from its star running back, especially given that it may be short-handed in its wide receiver corps. Wimberly, who had been the Ivy League’s top receiver early in the season, suffered an ankle injury in the win over Dartmouth and missed the remainder of that contest and the next week’s loss to Columbia. Then, after returning to the field in Philadelphia, he went down with an arm injury on the Crimson’s first play from scrimmage and was out for the rest of the game. If he is unable to play on Saturday, it would not only mark the end of the star receiver’s Harvard career, but also leave a gaping hole in the passing game.
Wimberly’s potential absence from Saturday’s game would require the rest of the Crimson’s offensive playmakers to step up. Last Saturday, nine different receivers caught at least one pass, and with sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch also missing the Columbia contest, a slew of different Harvard players have stepped up: first-year wide receiver Cooper Barkate and senior wide receivers Jack Bill and Joe Young. All three wideouts will be crucial against Yale, as well as junior tight end Tyler Neville, the team’s third-leading target, with 24 catches, 276 yards, and three scores. Additionally, the offensive line will be tasked with opening up holes for Borguet and protecting Dean from a strong Yale pass-rush.
“Aidan wouldn’t have [his stellar stats] without the o-line,” Dean said. “Our wide receivers wouldn’t be able to catch the ball if the o-line didn’t give me time to throw. They’re the unsung heroes of the season.”
The offensive line has allowed just eight sacks so far this season, tied for the eighth-fewest in the FCS. It will have to be stellar against a Bulldogs defensive front that has recorded 23 sacks so far, good for 15th best in the country. They are led by a two-headed monster in defensive ends Clay Patterson (5.5 sacks) and Reid Nickerson (5.0), the only duo to each have five or more sacks in the Ivy League. Nickerson was especially problematic last year against Harvard, recording two sacks and three tackles for a loss. Owing to its stout front four, Yale has been particularly solid against the run, allowing just 115.4 yards per game on average, nearly double top-ranked Princeton but good enough for 22nd in the country.
The Bulldogs’ pass defense is solid as well — 26th in Team Passing Efficiency Defense, a composite stat that takes into account a number of passing-related metrics. This is mostly due to the frequency with which opponents throw the ball against Yale; although the team ranks just 53rd best in the nation at preventing passing yards, it is very efficient when teams do take to the air, allowing the 24th fewest yards per completion, considerably better than the second-best Ivy League team, the Crimson. The Bulldogs do struggle at taking the ball away, though, as they’ve recorded just five interceptions so far this season. Their secondary will be led by defensive back Wande Owens, who’s had a remarkable season, with 58 tackles – ninth most in the Ivy League. The Cooksville, Md. native will likely be eager for redemption, having allowed Wimberly to sneak by him on last year’s game-winning catch.
“They don’t get beat deep a lot,” Dean explained. “That’s going to be a really big part of our game plan is just figuring out how we can get our shots in. Our offense operates off of explosive plays.”
If the pride of the Yale defense is preventing deep balls, its offense is grounded in conservatism. The Bulldogs run the ball frequently, racking up 226.5 yards per game on the ground, 61 yards more than their nearest Ivy League rival, Harvard, and good for ninth-best in the FCS. Their offense is built on the unique skill set of the southpaw signal-caller, who is not only the team’s leading passer – with 1,516 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 10 picks – but its top rusher as well – 115 carries for 682 yards and six scores on the ground. In fact, Grooms is so proficient on the ground that he is actually the conference’s second-leading rusher, behind only Borguet. Yale also rosters the Ivy League’s third-leading back, junior Tre Peterson, who has complemented Grooms with 650 yards and five touchdowns. The Crimson will aim to keep the Bulldogs throwing on Saturday, as their leading receiver, David Pantelis, ranks just 120th nationally with 497 yards.
“With their run-heavy offense, you have to effectively prevent them from dominating the game,” said senior defensive lineman and captain Truman Jones. “Like, if they just run the ball down the field, have ten-plus-play drives, that chews up clock, it takes up momentum, and it also keeps the ball out of our offense’s hands, so prevents us from scoring.”
The Harvard defensive line should be well-prepared to stop the run on Saturday, as although this year’s unit has been a little bit worse than the 2021 version, which allowed the fewest rushing yards of any team in the FCS, the defense has still been unkind to opposing backs. After holding Penn to just nine yards on 15 carries last week, it has yielded just 92.1 yards per game on the ground, good for the seventh-best rate in the country. Led by the consistent brilliance of junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who leads the team with five sacks, and the veteran savvy of senior linebacker Jack McGowan, defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99’s unit has been characteristically good against the run. It is also sneakily solid against the pass, ranking second in the Ivy League in Team Passing Efficiency Defense.
“Those are all guys who have had playing experience, but know they’re really stepping into a spotlight role and have been able to really hold down that second level of great communication,” said Jones of the linebacker corps, which includes McGowan and a few less experienced players like seniors Jake Brown and Solomon Egbe, as well as junior Matt Hudson. “They’re bridging the gap between playing run defense and playing pass defense and they’re doing all of this at a very high level.”
On Saturday, the Yale offense will have to take advantage of third downs, when the Crimson has struggled mightily this season. Harvard has conceded a fresh set of downs on 41.8 percent of tries, good for only 71st in the country.
“We play efficient defense on first and second downs and get into third-and-long situations,” said Jones of areas for improvement. “But a lot of times, it ends up in a conversion of some sort, whether that’s a longer run or a medium-length pass, so just being able to hold teams to three-and-outs, keep our defense off the field, and continue to get our offense the ball to get more possessions.”
If the Crimson can keep the ball in the offense’s hands, Harvard Stadium will be rocking on Saturday. With the nearly 30,000-seat colosseum hosting its first Harvard-Yale contest since 2016, tickets sold out quickly. And with the high stakes of an Ivy League championship on the line for both teams, red-clad Harvard fans and blue-shirted Yale supporters will be on the edge of their seats for the entire 60-minute duration.
But for Dean, that isn’t the focus. For the team’s many seniors who have dedicated their time and sacrificed their bodies, including some – like Wimberly – who took a semester off in order to play their final seasons of eligibility, Saturday will mark their last time playing together. The team’s 37 seniors will be celebrated in an on-field ceremony prior to kickoff.
“It’s the last chance that this group of [121] guys are going to be able to play football at the same time,” the quarterback said. “That’s the biggest thing that’s on my mind. It’s the last time I get to play with my friends, my brothers, my roommates. That’s what we’re thinking, I think, as a team, going out there and knowing that we’ve got one last shot at playing with each other and just having some fun.”
The Game will kick off at 12 p.m. on ESPNU and will be carried over the radio by WRCA at 1330 AM, 106.1 FM, and 92.9 FM-HD2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From scouting at the NFL Combine to managing the salary cap, the role of general manager is complex — managed by many only in video games. Yet for a select 32, the NFL Draft is more than clicking a button on a controller.
For Andrew Berry '09, the dream became reality when he was named general manager of the Cleveland Browns in 2020. But before there was Andrew Berry the football executive, there was Andrew Berry, a star Harvard defensive back. And before that, there was Andrew Berry the football fan.
"I grew up a huge Cowboys fan," he said. "The love for football came at an early age."
After first playing tackle football in middle school, Berry excelled alongside his twin brother, Adam, at Bel-Air High School in Maryland. Then a quarterback, Berry started gaining traction in the recruiting process during his junior year. But Harvard was never on the radar for the All-Metro team member.
"I kinda stumbled upon Harvard," Berry said. "To be honest, I had always had my heart set on playing Pac-10 football at Stanford".
Stanford's firing of Buddy Teevens, the current head coach at Dartmouth, derailed Berry's plans, as his official visit was canceled. Instead, he decided to take an official visit to Harvard. Despite not knowing much about the Ivy League, he was impressed with the players and coaches he met.
"It was the right program for me, on and off the field," Berry said.
Following his arrival on campus, Harvard head coach Tim Murphy asked Berry to switch from quarterback to cornerback, believing it was a more straightforward path for him to see the field. Berry took the request in stride and started all four years in the secondary.
"He was such a class kid, such a team guy that he made the change as what was best for the team," Murphy said.
Outside of the classroom, Berry kept himself busy, obtaining an undergraduate degree in economics and pursuing a concurrent Master's in computer science. According to Berry, his decision to pursue a Master's stemmed from taking one of Harvard's most famous courses.
"I had taken a computer science class in high school,” he said. “[CS50] rekindled my love for that."
"The kid didn't sleep," Murphy recalled of Berry's time at Harvard.
However, a career in the front office was not at the forefront of Berry's mind after his four years with the Harvard football team. The three-time All-Ivy corner had his eyes set on the NFL.
"I had aspirations to play," he said.
The Washington front office may not have seen an NFL future for Berry, as they cut him following rookie minicamp, but the Colts front office did. Tom Telesco — who is now the Chargers' GM but was the Colts' director of player personnel at the time — advised Berry to consider an entry-level position in Indianapolis' scouting department.
On Jan. 28, 2020, after stints in the front offices of the Colts, Browns, and Eagles, Berry was named executive vice president of football operations and General Manager of the Cleveland Browns. In doing so, he became the youngest general manager in NFL history at 35.
"I think the first time I heard it was the day before my press conference," Berry said of the achievement.
Berry's success in the front office and ascension to general manager came as no shock to those around him.
"Andrew quite simply is one of the most remarkable kids I have ever met, and I knew that whatever he chose for a career he would be successful," Murphy said.
It has also served as a point of inspiration for members of the Harvard football team. One such player, two-time All-Ivy first-teamer Jordan Hill '21, who now works with the Browns as a film analyst, credits Berry as a mentor and role model.
"It shows us that we can find a way to stay around this game that we love," Hill said. "I hope to be where he is someday."
Despite guiding the Browns to their first playoff appearance since 2002 in his first year at the helm, Berry has had to handle multiple challenges during his tenure, including Covid-19 and the sexual misconduct allegations against quarterback Deshaun Watson.
"I never thought that the primary problem I would be solving in 2020 was how to manage a roster in a global pandemic," Berry said. "That specific problem is not in your GM prep."
Ultimately, these challenges have shown Berry the side of being a GM that doesn't appear on the application.
"Oftentimes, people assume that being general manager is just about selecting players or working with the coaching staff," Berry said. "I think a lot of it is problem-solving and crisis management."
Berry's message to the team was simple ahead of the 138th rendition of the Harvard-Yale football game: "Play hard and beat Yale."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon first glance, junior Tyler Neville looks like your typical student-athlete: Hailing from Williamsburg, Virginia, and standing at six-foot-four and 235 pounds, Neville plays tight end for the Crimson, lives in Lowell House, and enjoys being a part of a team. Beneath the surface, however, lies an incredible personal story of strength and adversity. After years of dramatic health complications – including deafness, chest wall disorder, and cancer – Tyler Neville has transformed himself into a picture of resilience within Harvard and channeled his experiences to found the Tyler Neville Foundation.
When Neville was born without hearing, he quickly underwent surgery to place small tubes in his eardrums. As he grew up, Neville matured into a talented multi-sport athlete, playing football and basketball. But at age 14, he realized he often felt short of breath while exercising. Neville’s family consulted Dr. Eric Dobratz, who noticed a sunken area in the center of Neville’s chest — a revealing sign of Pectus Excavatum, a chest wall disorder. In August 2015, Neville underwent a Ness procedure, which placed a metal bar under his sternum and ribcage to correct the shape of his chest wall.
“Growing up was a struggle, but I didn’t know any different,” Neville said. “I worked hard to recover from whatever surgery I had so I could get back to what I liked doing.”
As Neville worked toward recovery, persisting through pain and participating in physical therapy became a normal routine. Until the metal bar was removed, Neville was prohibited from playing football but could still participate in basketball if he wore a protective vest.
About a year later, Neville felt severe discomfort in his chest. Neville’s doctor could not find any issues with the metal bar but instead noticed a small spot on one of his lungs. After performing a biopsy on an enlarged lymph node in Neville’s neck, the doctor diagnosed Neville with Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system.
“I wasn’t expecting it. I came home from school and my parents sat me down on the back porch and told me I had cancer,” Neville said. “I cried and let my parents explain it to me.”
Despite the news, Neville insisted on playing basketball later that day in an attempt to maintain normalcy, setting the tone for his attitude throughout the duration of his treatment.
“As chemotherapy wore on, my body was getting weaker and weaker,” Neville said. “It was frustrating to be limited by the effects of chemo, but I conditioned myself outside of practice to combat the inevitable decline of my stamina. I wasn’t playing my best basketball near the end, but I was just glad to be out there.”
Neville explained that his strength comes from his family, who deals with challenges “head on” and as a cohesive unit. To provide emotional support for Neville during chemotherapy, his father and brothers even shaved their heads in solidarity.
“Our family naturally teams up when we need to,” Neville said. “We are each other’s biggest fans.”
By the start of Neville’s sophomore basketball season, Neville’s cancer was in remission. Despite the chemotherapy and protective plate, Neville made the starting lineup. By the spring of that year, Neville had grown so much that the metal plate had to be removed.
Now cleared to play football, Neville achieved great success in his sporting career during his junior year. In basketball, Neville averaged 19 points and 15 rebounds a game. As a linebacker and tight end in football, Neville had 18 catches for 404 yards and five touchdowns on offense, along with 36 tackles – 19 of them solo – on defense. Neville credits his team’s coaching staff, which included his father, for elevating his football game to the next level.
“Football just came naturally,” Neville said. “Being an athlete my whole life and growing up in an athletic family, I was always super competitive in whatever I was doing.”
With Neville’s football success came numerous college offers. He ultimately chose to attend Harvard because of the coaching staff and the contributions he believed he could bring to the team.
“Football could not have worked out any better for me,” Neville said. “I’ll graduate with the best degree in the world and have a shot at the NFL.”
Neville, now free from cancer, hopes to help those who suffer from the disease.
In April 2021, Neville quarantined in the Harvard Square Hotel along with other students who tested positive for COVID-19. During his isolation, he was struck by an idea.
“It was Day 6 in the Harvard Square Hotel, and I picked up the phone and called my mom,” he recalled. “I told her I owe it to everyone who helped me achieve my blessings to give back, so I’m going to start my own foundation.”
“I started the Tyler Neville Foundation because of the interesting perspective I had on cancer,” said Neville. As a 16-year-old receiving treatment in a children’s hospital, Neville found it heartbreaking to see many young kids undergoing chemotherapy. He initially considered hosting a few sports-related events for fundraising, but those ideas quickly evolved into the foundation.
“The goal of the Tyler Neville Foundation is to help children realize there is more to their childhood than IVs and drip bags," Neville said. "We try to give kids opportunities to just be who they are: kids."
“Don’t let [cancer] define you — still be that person you were before, don’t let your ailment change who you are,” Neville said as a message to those struggling with illness. “Look at it as a hurdle, not an obstacle."
"Always keep your goals in sight and keep pushing,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 17, 2018, Harvard football took on Yale in the 135th iteration of The Game. But for the first time since 1894, The Game was played in neither Cambridge nor New Haven. Instead, it was played at historic Fenway Park, home to the Boston Red Sox since 1912. The 34,675 fans in attendance witnessed a historic performance by both squads, as the game marked the most combined points of any Harvard-Yale contest. After a gritty, physical 60-minute battle, it was the Crimson who came out on top, 45-27.
Before the game, there were mixed emotions about having the game at Fenway, given the rich history of the rivalry at Harvard Stadium, but as the day wore on, those concerns quickly whittled away.
“To be perfectly honest, I was not initially excited to lose the opportunity of a true home game here at Harvard Stadium after so many of the great games had been played here,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “Having said that, after going through the Fenway experience, it really becomes a no brainer. It was unique from the flyover to the loud, very much invested Harvard crowd. As a once in a while experience, it’s just tremendous.”
While it was a special day for the veteran head coach, it was even more powerful for some of the players, especially for Boston natives who had grown up watching the Red Sox. Safety Mike Silva ’21, then a first-year, was one player particularly affected.
“It was extremely special,” he said. “I’m a Boston-born and raised guy, on the South Shore. Having been to Fenway Park plenty of times for baseball games, seeing it and playing on it as a football field was a very special moment.”
Beyond the flyovers and fanfare, the game at Fenway was more than just a spectacle. The back-and-forth affair featured exciting drives and spectacular defense. Neither team held more than a one-touchdown lead until midway through the fourth quarter, when the Crimson found the end zone for the first of its two fourth-quarter scores to put the game away. It also featured a bizarre penalty; then-sophomore running back Devin Darringon ’21 looked to have scored a touchdown that would have given Harvard a 34-27 lead in the fourth quarter, but it was called back after it was revealed that Darrington made an obscene gesture towards a Yale defender as he ran into the end zone.
“It was such an exciting game that brought out the best in our team and our players,” Murphy said. “The hiccup by Devin Darrington that cost us a touchdown, and the team had to overcome that. But Devin had the opportunity to score again. There were some really clutch throws that Tom Stewart and a couple of our receivers made, but it was just an amazing experience.”
It was a game of memorable plays, from Darrington’s blunder to Tyler Adams ’21’s 62-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter to Darrington’s 16-yard, fourth quarter run to extend Harvard’s lead to 18 points and cap off a strong sophomore season. But the play that stood out to the winningest head coach in Ivy League history was Zach Miller ’19’s interception late in the fourth quarter to seal the victory. For Miller, who was serving as the 145th Captain of Harvard Football that season, it was the capstone on a stellar Harvard career.
“It's hard to pick a favorite play in particular, plays are like children,” Murphy said. “That being said, seeing the interception by our captain to really end the game, and the overwhelming joy that it set off on our sideline and throughout the Harvard faithful Fenway park. I’ll never forget that. As a coach, it’s never over till it's over, but that place went pretty much nuts.”
There was no guarantee that Silva, as a first-year on a veteran-led squad, would see playing time in The Game. But the safety not only got on the field, he also made a huge play, recording a pass defense on a third-down play near the start of the fourth quarter.
“My situation was crazy,” Silva said. “I did not think I was going to step on the field that game. So I was just trying to live in the moment and be excited to actually be on the field, have as much confidence as I could, and I was able to break up a big pass on the third down early in the fourth quarter.”
For many players, the most special part of that game was right after it ended, when the stands emptied to allow fans onto the hallowed grounds.
“There’s videos and pictures of us just running across the field, screaming, yelling and sprinting towards our fans,” Silva said. “That was the most insane experience ever, because there were a hundred of us in our student section. Food was getting thrown in the air and everybody was going nuts. Once we got back to the locker room, [Ben Abercrombie] was already waiting for us there, and all the alumni got in the locker room so we got to celebrate there. Even just being in the Red Sox locker room was an amazing experience, let alone celebrating the Harvard win.”
Owing to the history-making offensive performances by both teams, the drama of the game itself, and its unique setting, the 2018 contest quickly joined the annals of legendary Harvard-Yale contests. Perhaps the single most famous edition of The Game came half a century earlier, when the Crimson launched a furious comeback to manage a 29-29 tie in the 1968 matchup, but the 2018 game is sure to be remembered by future generations of Harvard football players.
“We have had so many great games,” Murphy said. “For instance, in 2005, when we beat Yale in triple overtime, the all-time leading rusher in Harvard football history, Clifton Dawson ’07, took it into the endzone. And the game in 2021, when we had to win it in the last 40 seconds of the final quarter. There are so many great memories of the Harvard-Yale game, but I think this is one for the history books on many levels.”
Because the 2020 edition of The Game was canceled by the Covid-19 pandemic, Saturday’s matchup at Harvard Stadium will mark the first clash between the two teams in Massachusetts since 2018, and the first in the Crimson’s home venue since 2016. Reflecting on the 2018 contest, Murphy noted a main takeaway that he hopes his team will bring onto the field this weekend.
“Even though we have won…16 of these in the 21st Century, there is no such thing as a favorite in this game,” he said. “You’ll think you have seen it all until you watch a Harvard-Yale game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students mark their calendars for one game a year. And for Harvard football legend Clifton Dawson ’07, the memories of the second oldest rivalry in college football still live on.
“What made [The Game] really special was the feeling of how important it was to the community. And that stays with you,” Dawson said. “Seeing the alums, having them come back, and feeling how important it was to them was always really special.”
For Dawson, the only football memory that lingers more than his Harvard-Yale highlights is his one loss in the contest.
“I remember the games that we won and lost, but I remember more so the Harvard-Yale game that we lost,” Dawson said. “I remember that vividly.”
Dawson was born in Toronto and grew up playing football in Pop Warner leagues before attending Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute, where he ran track in addition to playing football. Upon graduation, he enrolled to play football at Northwestern University. Following his freshman season, Dawson transfered to Harvard — a move he credits as being key to a smooth transition to collegiate play.
“Because I had a year of experience at Northwestern, I kind of got used to the fast pace of college, and freshman year I got to start playing and start contributing,” Dawson said.
Dawson said that during his time playing, he learned that “making and honoring commitments” was non-negotiable at Harvard and for life after. Dawson attributes much of his personal growth to playing under head coach Tim Murphy.
“My relationship with Coach Murphy was just incredible,” Dawson said. “It took on more than just a coach-player dynamic, and he in many ways became a father figure and life mentor. Coach Murphy in particular was always really good about trying to emphasize the life lessons as they were happening.”
In more ways than one, Dawson’s athletic prowess and mentality can be seen in current senior running back Aidan Borguet, who is nipping at the heels of Dawson’s single season rushing record at 1,120 rushing yards so far in the 2022 season, only 182 yards behind Dawson’s record.
“He's a legend. It's an honor just to be mentioned in a similar conversation with him,” Borguet said of Dawson. “I mean he's at the pinnacle of what you want to be.”
Ahead of the weekend and the rest of the season, Dawson advises Borguet and his teammates to simply focus on their game and appreciate the opportunity to play in the moment.

Just a few minutes before junior quarterback Luke Emge hit junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly for a 12-yard fade to the back left corner of the end zone at the Yale Bowl, Harvard football (8-2, 5-2) looked to be dead in the water, and the Bulldogs (5-5, 4-3) appeared to be well on their way to winning the 137th edition of The Game. The Crimson had taken a 27-17 lead in the third quarter, but after a few strong throws by Yale sophomore quarterback Nolan Grooms and a stalled Harvard offensive attack, the Bulldogs led by three, 34-31, with two minutes, 40 seconds remaining. The Crimson had the ball back, with what appeared to be one final chance to stun the raucous crowd that had turned up to New Haven, Connecticut, and secure head coach Tim Murphy his 20th victory over Yale.
On 1st and 10 from the Harvard 32, Emge completed a four-yard pass to senior wide receiver B.J. Watson on an out route towards the right sideline. Yale junior defensive back Dathan Hickey dragged him down for a four-yard gain. Then, on the next play, with two minutes, 14 seconds remaining in the game, first-year tight end Tyler Neville ran a deep button-hook and got open at the Crimson’s 46-yard line. Emge stepped up in the pocket and fired. Neville slipped, and the ball sailed over his head, incomplete.
NEVILLE: After I slipped and the ball sailed over my head, the captain of Yale, [senior linebacker John Dean], put his hand on my shoulder and he was like, “Yo, 88. You worked real hard all offseason, worked real hard all season, just to lose this right here for your team?” I was like, “Damn! That’s the best s**t-talking I’ve ever heard.” That got me pretty good.
The next play, Emge’s slant to senior wide receiver James Batch was broken up, with Bulldogs senior linebacker Rodney Thomas II applying a big hit to jar the ball free. That brought up fourth down, which appeared to be Harvard’s last chance. Emge threw a comebacker on the right sideline to Wimberly that was knocked out of bounds by junior defensive back Wande Owens. 
EMGE: On that fourth down, after the play Tyler had, I remember throwing a deep comeback to Kym on the sideline, and they deflected it out of bounds. I remember just jogging off the field, that realization setting over me like, “Man, that might’ve been it! We might not get another shot!” Stepping off the field on the sideline, the first thing [quarterback coach Joel Lamb ’93] said to me was, basically, “Keep your helmet on. Stay right here. We’re going to get back out there. The defense is going to get a stop.”
MURPHY: With two minutes to go, tremendous pressure on our defense to get the ball back. Everybody remembers the last 59 seconds … but what people forget is with two minutes left, one first down ends the game, and our defense did an unbelievable job getting the ball back.
Yale got the ball back with two minutes and one second remaining. A pair of runs, one by Yale junior running back Spencer Alston and one by Grooms, forced Murphy to burn his last two timeouts and left the Bulldogs with 3rd and 7 on the Harvard 33 and one minute, 52 seconds left in the game. With the Crimson blitzing, junior defensive lineman Truman Jones forced Grooms to roll out to his left and slide down behind the line of scrimmage for a critical coverage sack. 
EMGE: With each play of that next Yale drive – the first down stop, the second down stop. Third down comes, and you’re starting to think, “Maybe this is our chance. Maybe there is a chance.” And when they make that coverage sack, it starts to set in, like, “We’re going to have a shot at this, probably. We’re going to get another chance.”
Staked to a 4th and 8 with one minute, two seconds remaining, Yale head coach Tony Reno called his first timeout.
EMGE: Being on that sideline, some guys are teary-eyed, some guys just stand there in disbelief. The mindset shifts to, “Alright, get ready to get back out there and put the drive together.” So you start talking to the coaching staff, thinking about the mindset for the next drive, the game plan, what plays we like, that shift in your mindset from the uncertainty and sadness that the game might be out of reach to, “Alright, it’s time to get out there. It’s time to roll.”
WIMBERLY: I feel like a big, main point of those huddles [is to] make sure we stay composed, especially in a big game when there’s a lot of people there or a game that has a lot at stake. We’re making sure we’re staying composed on the sidelines and making sure that we have the right schemes to go down and score.
After the timeout, the teams trotted back out onto the field for a game-deciding fourth down play. Instead of trying to kick a 51-yard field goal, Reno decided to send his offense back onto the field. Grooms dropped back to pass, knowing a conversion would seal the game, and under heavy pressure from Jones, threw the ball away out of bounds.
EMGE: We got in the huddle, I’m the two-minute guy. And I was definitely nervous, but we’ve run the two-minute drill so many times in practice, we pretty much know the plays we’re going to run. It just so happened to be a one-minute drill. But I was pretty confident walking out on the field. I felt like it was destiny after that stop.
MURPHY: We realized that we were going to have to do a pretty much perfect one-minute drill without any timeouts.
On 1st and 10 from the Harvard 34, Emge lined up in shotgun. Yale rushed four men, with two deep safeties over the top. 
EMGE: The most important objective, when you’re talking about a two-minute drill for us, as an offense … is a positive first play. For us to get on that field, you’re not thinking about going 60 yards in one play. You’re thinking about putting a drive together.
Emge tossed a quick pass to Neville, who made a sliding catch over the middle at the 45, which was enough for a first down. Only four seconds came off the clock.
EMGE: The way Yale was playing the coverage, just knowing the situation, knowing we needed a touchdown, had a lot of defenders deep, trying to guard us from the deep ball. Tyler had a twelve-yard, in-breaking route, and the way the coverage bailed out, I knew we had that opening. Like Tyler said, he’s a pretty good target to throw to, a pretty big body to get the ball to.
MURPHY: It just gave us a bit of confidence. It gave us a bit of momentum, and it bought us some time.
On the ensuing 1st and 10 on the Harvard 45, Emge stuck with his first read, firing a quick out to Watson near the right sideline. The pass fell incomplete.
EMGE: Lining up, I didn’t love what I saw out there. In that situation, [you know] that you need to move the ball downfield, need to get big chunks there. [I] had my mind set pre-snap that I was just going to take a quick drop, throw it outside, maybe put it in a spot that B.J. had a chance. But really on that play, I was thinking about getting rid of the ball and resetting for the next play. In a two-minute drill, you don’t need to be five for five passing on the drive there. It doesn’t need to be pretty. You just have to have a couple plays go your way.
On second down, Wimberly lined up on the left side. Hickey gave the junior wide receiver plenty of space. After the ball was snapped, junior defensive lineman Reid Nickerson got pressure on Emge from his blinside. Emge stepped up and spotted a wide-open Wimberly, who had gotten past his defenders on a post route.
WIMBERLY: Initially, I thought they were in Cover 4, probably going to stop it. And I ran and I think they saw Luke step up. And they thought he was going to run so they stopped their feet a little bit. And he just drilled it to me, and I was wide open.
EMGE: They brought the pressure from the left side. [Sophomore offensive lineman] Alec Bank did a great job of making him read the pressure high, so I had an opportunity to climb up in the pocket and escape left. And as I started moving to my left, I just saw their [defensive backs] start to step up … thinking I was going to run. And Kym just sat down in the hole they had wide open down the middle of the field.
The ball sailed downfield towards Wimberly. After getting so much space, he was able to track it all the way out of Luke’s hand.
WIMBERLY: When I saw them let me go, … I was like, “I’m probably about to score.” So I’m like, “Luke, throw the ball, throw the ball, throw the ball!” I’m just sitting there, like “Luke, toss it!” He darted it in there, and I turned up. But it was so funny because even though it was a pretty dart-y pass, I felt like the ball was in the air for so long, I was like, “Bruh. Bruh. Bruh. Just catch the ball, catch the ball, catch the ball.”
After catching the ball, Wimberly saw nothing but green in front of him. He juked to his right, but slipped as he made the cut between two Bulldogs defenders and tumbled to the turf at the Yale 12.
MURPHY: [Emge] hit him right over the top. … Quite honestly, had it been a perfect, in stride, momentum pass, that probably would have been a touchdown right there.
WIMBERLY: I caught it, and I turned around. I made a cut, and I made a guy miss. And I was like, “Oh, I’m about to score!” And then I just slipped.
On 1st and 10 from the Harvard 12, Emge looked to pass quickly, throwing a back shoulder fade to senior wide receiver/long snapper Adam West in the back left corner of the end zone. The ball was slightly underthrown, and Owens batted it away. Then, on the next play, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein opted for more or less the same call, throwing a fade to West in the right corner. Again, thanks to swarming coverage by Hickey, the ball fell incomplete. The Crimson now faced 3rd and 10, with only two more shots at the end zone remaining.
EMGE: Adam had a one-on-one look. On top of that, you know in this situation in your head, the biggest thing you can’t do is take a sack. We have no timeouts and a sack might end the game. … For those two plays, when I saw the matchup we had on them, I just decided to give them a shot.
WIMBERLY: I definitely was nervous because I felt like we had put together such a good drive up until that point. … But I knew we still had an opportunity to win it.
With Harvard having two more shots at the end zone, Reno opted to call his second timeout.
EMGE: We lined up on third down, we had a play called, and Yale took their timeout based on what we lined up in. So you go back to the huddle, you got thirty seconds. We talk. Coach Fein is on the headset, and we decided, “Alright, we’re going to go with a different play this time, since they just saw our look.”
Reno then opted to call his third timeout.
EMGE: We get out there, we line up, we got another play called. Yale sees what we’re doing. Yale takes another timeout. Time’s starting to pass. The adrenaline’s starting to slow down a little bit. You come back to the huddle, and it’s, “Do we stick with what we had called or what do we want to do?” I give our coaches a lot of credit in that time. They talked in the headset, and they decided what to do. They put a play for us together based on what we were seeing from them.
MURPHY: The route was what we call Ringo Leo Five Switch.
On the pivotal third down, Harvard lined up with a two-receiver set, with Wimberly in motion towards the inside pre-snap. 
EMGE: I really wanted to get Kym the ball and give him a chance in the back of the end zone. They lined up in Quarters, so I was thinking, “Take my drop. If the corner bails on it, just bang the ball to [junior tight end Adam Shepherd], let him get some yards, and then get out of bounds.”
WIMBERLY: I kind of slowed down on my route a little bit, because I figured, “No way he’s throwing me the ball. I won’t be open at all. I just got grabbed by the linebacker trying to get off, and there’s a safety and a cornerback in the area that I’m working to.”
Owens’ eyes never left Emge on the play, and Wimberly was able to sneak past him. By the time he caught up with the receiver, the ball was already in the air. 
EMGE: It felt like the ball was in the air for about ten minutes, to be honest. Ball was in the air, and you’re just hoping that it comes down on the right side, comes down in the right guy’s hands.
WIMBERLY: I see the ball in the air, and I’m like, “Oh, wait, he’s actually throwing this.” So then I just sped up and tried to make a play.
EMGE: I saw Kym go up, but it was tough to see who came down with it and where they came down. And when I saw the ref put his hands in the air, signaling touchdown, I immediately sprinted towards the end zone to go celebrate.
WIMBERLY: I didn’t see the ref throw up the touchdown sign. I remember, I was just fighting with [Hickey], fighting him for the ball. The ball ended up coming out, and I’m looking at the ref like, “Yo, I scored, I scored it.” And at that point the ref’s hands had already been down. I thought they didn’t call the touchdown until everyone else came over.
MURPHY: I’ve been coaching for 40 years, and I’ve been a head coach for 36 years for three programs … there’s more a sense of relief than joy.
Two flags came out on the play, and while Harvard was celebrating, the referees conferred to discuss the penalties. After they made their decisions, they began their announcement with, “There were two fouls on the play, both against the offense.”
MURPHY: It was deja vu all over again — Princeton. It’s like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
WIMBERLY: No way they’re about to call this back. We’re going to have another part two of Princeton, and this, this, and that. I was definitely nervous at that point.
The penalties were both enforced on the ensuing kickoff. One was a penalty against the Harvard sideline for encroaching onto the field. The other was an unsportsmanlike conduct call on Shepherd, who pulled Hickey off of Wimberly after the catch.
MURPHY: Fortunately, things worked out.
EMGE: It really kind of embodies what our team is like and why we were able to stick together throughout this game. If someone was going to be on Kym in the end zone like that, not getting off, someone was going to get that guy off of Kym, and we’re going to celebrate together.
Up by two, junior kicker Jonah Lipel trotted out there to kick the extra point. He calmly knocked it straight through.
LIPEL: My first instinct was [to] run onto the field. I remember Jon Sot, our punter and holder – we both just sprinted out, going to celebrate with Kym. But then he’s like, ‘Hold on, we’ve gotta kick this extra point.’ Honestly, I didn’t think of the significance of the kick at all, I was more just pumped that Kym came down with that.
After a series of last-second laterals failed to produce a touchdown for the Bulldogs, the whistle blew, and the game was over. A horde of Harvard fans started jumping over the low walls and spilling onto the field.
NEVILLE: I remember just running onto the field, just waving [my] helmet up and down. Then, when all the students stormed the field, I took like 15 pictures with a bunch of students I’d never met before in my life … Then my family came out. I had like 15 people there, and they came out on the field. They stormed it. I saw them jumping up and down with my football teammates, and then my roommates as well, and then my brother’s on the field. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever been a part of in my life.
LIPEL: It was really special, especially for Kym, Luke, and I, because we were there in 2019, on that field, when we lost in double overtime. I remember, we were not even close to contention that year, but if Yale had won, they got a share of the Ivy, and things were going so well for us that game until it came crashing down at the end. … To have that complete 180 two years later at their field, at the same field where we got our hearts broken, it was amazing.
WIMBERLY: After the sound goes off, we win, the first person I see is Coach Murphy. And I was actually standing on the bench, watching the game. Coach Murphy’s the first person I see, and he just turns to me, I look at him, and I just jump in his arms. And I get down and I kind of pick him up and raise him in the air, like, “We did it, Coach! We did it!”
MURPHY: I’ll never forget it, because it was Kym, on many levels. Obviously, he made the big play, but he’s a very special kid. He’s had his share of adversity with injuries … Kym’s one of those kids that you want to adopt, I’ll leave it at that. Our players love him, and he’s just such an amazing, humble, great American success story.

This week, as the pre-Thanksgiving break assignments pile up and the sky fades into a daunting darkness before dinnertime, only one thing manages to pierce through the clouds of students’ burnout and exhaustion: a rowdy anticipation for the annual Harvard-Yale football game.
On H-Y eve, a strange phenomenon graces this small liberal arts school in New England: we transform into a student body with spirit, flair, and an undying interest in athletics. In effect, we become unrecognizable, channeling the most spontaneous and *gasp* fun versions of ourselves for one weekend of the year.
So, here’s an in/out list to remind everyone to make some questionable (but tasteful) choices this H-Y weekend. Have a fantastic time and #rollcrim.
In: 
The enemies-to-lovers arc
Waking up at the crack of dawn (for unhinged purposes only)
Sleeping on the floor (queue The Lumineers)
Selling your ticket to the highest bidder (rip Yale)
Getting posted on Dean Khurana’s instagram (the ultimate win)
The buddy system
Practicality (it’s 35 degrees — you can only look so presentable)
Our team’s running game (idk what this means, but a Crimson Sports editor told me to add this)
Pretending we’ve won no matter the outcome
Bringing your own toilet paper (BYOTP)
Experimenting (make of this what you will)
Hot breakfast
Out: 
Actually going to the game
Rain (I’m manifesting)
Calling Yale a safety school (cringe and pretentious, sorry)
Opening your computer at any point during the weekend
Facepaint (never looks as cool as you think it does)
Mansplaining what a touchdown is
TGMOs (tailgate make-outs)
Dehydration!!
The term “Yalies” (makes me sick)
Dangerously intoxicated alumni
Having a mascot (lame and overdone — and the new turkey mascot debut cannot convince me otherwise)
Assigned seats in the stadium
Sections
Yalies — welcome to Harvard! It’s that time of the year when bulldogs and crimsons (?) get together to tailgate and watch some mediocre football together. Let’s face it, college campuses are confusing. At last year’s game, I felt completely lost in New Haven — why was the stadium so far away? Why are all the buildings so much more hawkish than Harvard’s? Why was everyone staring at my “yuck fale” hat? All this to say that a guide to Yale would have been helpful. So, if you are a bulldog feeling a bit lost in Cambridge, read through this ultimate guide to Harvard, catered completely to you.
Food
For breakfast before the big game, the Square has a few options. Head to Tatte or Bluestone Lane for a ~bougie~ brunch (though don’t be surprised if lines are long and tables are all full, because that’s the case on a regular Saturday, let alone Harvard-Yale Saturday). If you are feeling adventurous, you can always sneak into a dining hall on campus for Saturday brunch — check out how HUDS and YUDS compare. Just in time for your visit, a brand new Starbucks just opened in the Square this week. The last one was replaced by a merch store. It’s fine (it’s not). CVS is always a good idea, and it offers unlimited snack options, 24/7. For late-night treats, try Pinocchio’s, Jefe’s, Felipe’s or Insomnia Cookies. Nothing quite like a hot slice of pepperoni pizza, an overflowing burrito, or a melty cookie to sustain your drunken stupor.
Places to Party
This is a tough one. Tasty Basty is an experience that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime. What’s Tasty Basty, you ask? Flyby’s got you covered (link to Corinne’s article). As for Finals Clubs — I wish I knew what they are going to be up to H-Y weekend. If you aren’t on their list, you can always vibe along to their thumping music as you make the humbling trek to the new Jefe’s by the Red Line.
The Shuttle
Ah, the shuttle. This one is a sore spot for a lot of Harvardians. The Harvard shuttle is run by the University to help students get from place to place, because this campus is huge and Massachusetts is cold. The shuttle has different routes, and to get to the stadium (that’s the giant, concrete, Colosseum-like building across the river), you’re going to want to get on one that says “Quad-SEC,” “Allston Loop,” or “Quad Stadium Express.” Sometimes the shuttle comes. Sometimes it doesn’t. It’s all an adventure, really. My personal suggestion is to walk places — this way, you’ll know you’ll eventually get to where you have to go. Whatever you do, don’t try to use the shuttle’s app, Passio Go.
The Quad
Harvard randomly splits undergraduates into 12 upperclassmen houses at the end of their freshman year. Three of these dorms are in a place called the Quad, which is a bit farther away from the Square. Relative to the stadium, the Quad is on the opposite end of campus. So, chances are you won’t have any reason to visit, unless you are staying with a Harvard student who lives in the Quad. In that case, again, good luck to you. The good news is that you will get to shake off the hangover and fit some extra steps in on your way to the stadium.
Why everyone is so excited the Game is happening at Harvard this year?
It’s been a while since Harvard has hosted Harvard-Yale (re: 2016!). The Game was hosted at Fenway when the stadium was being renovated (in 2018), then Covid-19 hit (2020), and then it was Yale’s turn (2021). So, Harvard students and alumni alike are super excited about this year’s game. Chances are some fun alums will be dotted around Cambridge this weekend — keep your eyes peeled for a Zuckerberg, Conan O’Brien, or Matt Damon sighting.
Hopefully, this crash course to Harvard was helpful. Use this information to get around Harvard’s campus, impress your weekend crush, or make yourself feel better about having chosen Yale — jk, that last one is impossible.

Let’s be real. You’ve been planning your outfit since the last Harvard-Yale. You’ve been prepping your Liquid IV. You’ve had the route planned. It’s pretty easy to slay the biggest game day of the year when you’re vibing at your beloved Yale Bowl — but what about when you’re wandering around Cambridge, lost and drunk out of your mind, and someone tells you to “Roll Tasty Basty”? Yeah, that’s what I thought. We’re here to help.
How do I get there?
Walk. Here at our perfect school, there’s no such thing as shuttling to the football field and waiting in hour-long car lines for The Game.
I’ve gotten a total of two hours of sleep on a random person’s floor on the sleeping arrangements I definitely planned in advance. Where can I get caffeine? 
Harvard Square has no shortage of places to get your caffeine fix: Dunkin, Peet’s, Capital One Cafe, Tatte, Flour, Darwin’s, the fridge in the back of CVS that has the Celsius. If you’re across the river by the stadium and need to refuel, there’s a Starbucks and Swiss Bakers around the corner. And if you’re really desperate, chug some Trader Joe’s cold brew concentrate.
Where is the tailgate?
Like most tailgates, it’s on the field outside the stadium. Fields don’t change no matter where you are, so don’t wear sneakers you like.
Where is the stadium?
Look right… No, your other right. The giant Colosseum-esque structure across the river is our beloved Harvard stadium — though no gladiators have died there, many an athlete has (metaphorically) passed away from deathly workouts. Being an Institution with a Storied History and Past, Harvard doesn’t disappoint with the inside of our stadiums — in fact, we’re throwing it alllll the way back to the Stone Age by having no seats entirely.
Where is the postgame??
Your beloved postgame #slice can be found in the form of a pizza square at Pinocchio’s (dubbed “Noch’s”). Does it compare to Yorkside? Pepes? Sally’s? Tbh probably maybe not. But it’ll do the trick ;)
Do all roads lead to Toads?
No… but we do have the following: Jefe’s, final clubs, Tasty Burger basement, Grendels, Mather JCR (Mather is ugly and tall just like Morse). Choose your fighter. Disclaimer: These were listed in no particular order although the JCR is superior <3
Who is your Handsome Dan?!?!
Settle down, Yalie. Harvard has Remy — an immortal orange tabby cat that will either be skipping the game and hanging outside of Lamont Library or will make an appearance on the field mid-game. There is no in-between for Remy (except maybe a Turkey???).
Are we allowed to do the Saybrook Strip when the Game is at Harvard?
I mean we can’t stop you……
