After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SOMEWHERE OVER THE PACIFIC—During the past twenty years I’ve had the strange privilege of living in ten different cities. To be fair, the first two pre-date my memory. But even so, I think it’s fair to say that I have a pretty unusual definition of what it means to be going home.
The prevailing lyrical literature on home, from Bruce Springsteen to Skylar Gray, supports the idea that home is where you grew up, or where the people you love live. If that is the case, then Naples, Italy, where my family currently lives, is home for me. Why, then, do I feel like I’m coming home as I fly back to Boston, and Harvard?
I’ve spent an unreasonable amount of time thinking about what home means for me. I know that when people ask, “where’s home for you?” they expect a single, definite answer. But my definition of home is fluid. Home, maybe, is a place that conjures up a feeling of comfort, no matter the circumstances of your arrival. But with that definition I could give you five places that I can call home, including places like my grandparents’ house—places I’ve only visited but never lived.
When I graduate, my four years in Cambridge will have been the longest amount of time I’ve ever spent in one place, and I am confident that I will be able to call yet another corner of the world home. Yet when I inevitably move, change jobs, and start a family, so too will my answer to that question—where’s home for you?—change.
But that’s OK. Because unlike a mortgage, a paycheck, or a marriage license, home isn’t a tangible entity. It doesn’t exist on a piece of paper. Whoever said home is where the heart is had it backwards. Your heart doesn’t stay at home. Your home, no matter where or why you call it so, stays in your heart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preparation for a Category 2 hurricane headed across the Atlantic, Harvard College canceled a number of outdoor activities to help keep students safe and dry during the approaching storm.
Meanwhile, many students who remain off campus worried that they would not be able to make it in time for the start of classes Wednesday.
Sunday, when Hurricane Irene is scheduled to hit Massachusetts after blasting the Atlantic coast from North Carolina northward, all outdoor events on campus will be canceled.   The canceled events include a Yard Party and glow-in-the-dark Frisbee and sidewalk chalk activities for newly arrived freshmen, a community run and walk, and Crimson Key Society campus tours.
Open houses for numerous religious groups, scheduled for Sunday morning, have been postponed.   It has not yet been decided whether indoor activities, such as the “Sex Signals” presentation which freshmen are required to attend, will be affected by the storm as well, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Crimson Key Society Freshman Week Coordinator Daniel P. Bicknell ’13.
As forecasts began to report that the storm brewing in the Atlantic would make a beeline for the East Coast, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced on Thursday that all upperclassmen were permitted to move into their Houses that day, rather than Saturday as previously planned, to facilitate settling students into their rooms before the storm.
The National Weather Service says Irene may bring “strong to damaging winds … heavy rainfall and the likelihood for coastal flooding” in Middlesex County, where Harvard is located.   Currier and Quincy dining halls opened Friday, a day early, to accommodate students who heeded Hammonds’ call to return.
All other House dining halls will open beginning with dinner on Saturday. Shuttle service will not resume until Sunday.
Several Houses extended the hours during which students could retrieve their belongings from summer storage.   In an email urging students to take advantage of the extra storage opening hours, Leverett House Building Manager Paul J. Hegarty warned, “Years ago, the basements flooded and I do not want to see your items ruined in the event we have to deal with excessive rains. … Storage is at your own risk and if your items are flooded you may not be covered in insurance.”
Yet many students in far-flung hurricane-free locations said they could not change their travel plans on brief notice and said they fear that flights back to Massachusetts might be canceled, preventing them from arriving on campus before classes start on Wednesday.
Others, like Pamela Rosario Perez ’13, are caught in areas Irene is expected to reach even before it hits Massachusetts.   Perez, who is currently in Atlantic County, New Jersey, said that she was staying in her house with her family despite calls to evacuate.
“We were planning on leaving, but then the roads, they’re completely blocked out by the traffic,” she said. “We got scared that the hurricane might find us on the way. We feel that the chances are better for us if we stay here in the house. We don’t really have any food. Now that I’m thinking about it, we should be scared.”
She added that supplies were scarce in the area as residents of the oceanfront county frantically stocked up on staples. “My aunt tried to go to a Sam’s Club, a Costco. There’s nothing. People are freaking out.”
A state of emergency is a more distant possibility in Cambridge, but in the event that evacuations do become necessary, two shelters for city residents will open at 8 p.m. on Saturday.
For Harvard students who could potentially face evacuation from Houses and dormitories, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that “Harvard has a robust emergency shelter plan, which includes facilities, trained personnel, stockpiles of food and supplies and transportation services. The plan has been successfully tested.”
He did not respond to a query about where the emergency facilities are located.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Public safety experts continued to urge residents to take precautions as the first rains of Hurricane Irene began to fall in Cambridge early Saturday afternoon.
The hurricane has been downgraded over the past two days from a Category 3 to a Category 1 storm, but high winds and unusual amounts of rain could still have destructive effects.
Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Taunton, Mass., said that Cambridge would feel the first rains Saturday afternoon while the eye of the storm passed over North Carolina.
“The northern fringes of the rain bands are already moving over southern New England,” Buttrick said. “It’s huge. It’s wider than the state of Pennsylvania. In terms of width, it’s like two Pennsylvanias side by side, so almost six to eight hundred miles wide.”
Irene is expected to move up the Atlantic Coast overnight, making landfall again on Sunday morning in Long Island. After that, Buttrick said, the storm looks likely to cross the Long Island Sound and touch down near Hartford, Connecticut on its way towards Massachusetts. At that point, Buttrick said, Irene will be a “weakening Category 1 hurricane.”
By the time the center of the storm reaches the Cambridge area on Sunday, Buttrick said, it will probably be sufficiently weak to no longer be called a hurricane.
Buttrick predicted one to three total inches of rainfall for Cambridge—not enough to cause the Charles River to flood, she said, but sufficient to overwhelm poor drainage systems in some urban areas.
Wind could also cause damage, she said, with sustained blasts of 25 to 40 miles per hour lasting throughout the day Sunday and occasional gusts as powerful as 60 miles per hour.
The city of Cambridge will open two shelters at 8 p.m. Saturday, though Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello said that evacuations are unlikely. Harvard officials have announced that the University has its own plan for facilities, food, supplies, and transportation in the event of an emergency.
Riviello said that the city has established an emergency operations center at Cambridge Police Department headquarters—a room equipped with internet, radio, and telephone access as well as backup generators.
The control room will be staffed by officials of numerous city agencies as well as representatives from city institutions, including Harvard, so that all parties can make decisions together about emergency responses even if communication shutdowns occur.
Harvard students were allowed to move into their rooms two days early in order to travel to campus before the storm clogged roads and closed airports. But many were unable to change their travel plans on short notice and now fear they will not be able to get to Harvard before classes begin on Wednesday.
Outdoor events scheduled for Sunday have been canceled.
The city of Cambridge had made plans during the summer to launch next week a new emergency alert system called Code Red, which broadcasts severe weather alerts via phone calls, text messages, and emails, Riviello said. Because of the storm, the police department introduced the new system early, making automated phone calls yesterday to 30,000 landline phone numbers which were listed in telephone directories. Police now encourage residents to register their own cell phone numbers and email addresses so that they can receive more alerts.
“We really wanted to roll it out for Irene because we know people are anxious,” Riviello said. “We’re not used to getting hurricanes here.”
Hurricanes hit New England only once every ten years, according to Buttrick. The last one that directly hit the region, she said, was the Category 1 storm Bob in 1991. No major hurricane—meaning Category 3 or higher—has hit since the “two sisters,” Carol and Edna, in 1954.

UPDATE: In repsonse to requests from health care institutions in the area, the MBTA will keep its services open until 8 a.m. tomorrow. After then, though, the planned closures will be in effect.
In case you were planning on venturing out of Harvard Square, think again. The MBTA announced that it will suspend all of its services tomorrow in anticipation of Hurricane Irene's arrival in the Boston area.
"With severe winds, heavy rain, and flooding forecast for metropolitan Boston, this decision has been made with the safety of customers and employees being the MBTA's top priority at all times," MBTA said in a press release.
According to the press release, the suspension of services will allow staff to focus on ensuring normal transit on Monday. The MBTA will also keep buses nearby to assist in any evacuations over the weekend.
