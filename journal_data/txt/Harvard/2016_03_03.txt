After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Chatroom” is back in its natural domain. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s reinvigorated interpretation of Irish playwright Edna Walsh’s 2005 play-turned-movie will run from Mar. 3 to 6 at the Loeb Experimental Theater. It follows the story of Jim, a depressed teenager who, after failing to find professional help for his mental health issues, turns to the disconnected companionship of an online chatroom. Behind the impenetrable veil of the internet, not everyone is who they appear to be.
Jamie P. Herring ’18, the director of “Chatroom,” hopes to create a narrative that reflects not only the “tricky issues of disconnectivity in the connection that social media provides,” but also the profound and neglected issue of mental health in teenagers. “Theater has always been a way to attack social issues in the safe space that theater is—to provide the therapy required by society to basically better all by dealing with the stigmatized issues, and often tragic issues, of mental health,” he says. In an age where discussions concerning mental health ebb and flow based on the temporal proximity of tragedy, Herring attempts to create a performance that transcends an artistic event and ingrains within the viewer’s mind the reality and persistence of such problems. “The intensity of the performance, the intensity of the piece, is very much like how life is,” he says.
More than a treatise on the inadequacy of society-wide responses to mental health problems in youth and the distortions of discourse in the age of the internet, “Chatroom” aims to be a show that is ripe with dark humor and sympathetic characterization. According to Ali L. Astin ’19, who plays Jim, the cast shares Herring’s seriousness of purpose. “Jamie’s understanding of the piece at hand [is that] it’s beautiful, intense and tragic to work with,” she says. “It’s definitely a journey, it’s definitely not easy, but it is important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to approve the overhaul to the General Education program proposed this fall. One significant development from the original legislation, however, is a newly adopted provision that will allow students to take as many as half of their Gen Ed requirements pass-fail. While we remain firm in our belief that a simple system of distribution requirements is superior to any iteration of the current General Education program, the introduction of a pass-fail option has its merits.
As a liberal arts institution, Harvard is dedicated to graduating well-rounded students. And in Harvard’s words, the Gen Ed program “seeks to address the challenges of living in the 21st century, and to prepare students to find worthy ways of living in it.” Allowing students to take Gen Ed courses pass-fail has the potential to facilitate this goal by giving students greater freedom to take courses of interest.
In practice, of course, this reduced pressure could manifest itself in two ways, one positive and one negative. On one hand, opportunities to explore new academic disciplines in low-stakes contexts are crucial. Students who do not feel adequately prepared for a difficult physics course, for example, could benefit from not having to worry about a letter grade. Such an approach by students would be the optimal outcome for the new pass-fail option.
However, at the meeting where the program was approved, several faculty members expressed concern that the option would weaken the rigor of the Gen Ed program. That result is a possibility if students use the reform as means of decreasing their academic obligations and avoiding full engagement with their Gen Ed requirements.
Since the program has not yet been implemented, the ultimate outcome of the pass-fail option remains to be seen. It is possible that this avenue will help students’ broaden their intellectual horizons, but it could also incentivize students to effectively bypass several Gen Ed requirements by taking them pass-fail with minimal effort.
Despite the slow-moving bureaucracy behind the Gen Ed system, the way students respond will ultimately determine the fate of this facet of the overhaul. Students must take the College’s liberal arts mission as seriously as administrators and faculty do and put effort into the Gen Ed program. No matter how the program is structured, it is destined to be a failure if students do not see it as opportunity for academic growth.

On Feb. 25, 2016, The Crimson published an Op-Ed by Harvard Business School student Sacha Yabili titled “How Harvard Abdicates Its Moral Responsibility.” In the piece, Yabili chides Harvard for “rolling out the red-carpet” for an African “dictator”— President Paul Kagame of Rwanda. Sacha is the latest addition to an organized bevy of Kagame’s critics who keep repeating similar and possibly rehearsed accusations even when truth is spoken to them or purported “evidence” of Kagame’s “crimes” is deflated by truth.
While Paul Kagame admittedly may not be the “ideal” paragon of democracy, there seems to be a well-oiled conveyor belt that sustains lies against him. This is why I consider it an act of justice and morality by Harvard to offer a platform for Kagame to tell his side of the story. At the John F. Kennedy Forum, Kagame was put on the spot over a number of repeated allegations, and he offered his point of view. He was amiable, thoughtful, and respectful in his responses.
Quoting Belgian Rwanda scholar Filip Reyntjens, Sacha Yabili talks of  “incontrovertible” facts that have emerged to corroborate Kagame’s alleged crimes. Reyntjens says Kagame is “probably the worst war criminal in office today.” Never mind that Reyntjens’ basis for such a sweeping conclusion has no incontrovertible basis and is mere conjecture, probably driven by sentiments related to his own past history. Reyntjens was a long-term senior advisor to former President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda. Habyarimana’s followers and lieutenants were accused by witnesses of plotting and executing an organized genocide that claimed over one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in one hundred days in 1994. Many have since been convicted. Where is the morality of “scholar” Reyntjens in all this?
Most commentary on Rwanda and Kagame bypasses context. Rarely do folks step on to the balcony and engage with the complexity that Rwanda is. The kind of balancing, re-negotiation of historical loyalties and restraint Kagame and his team have had to master in order to hold the country is of legion. Other countries should perhaps be learning from and not ridiculing them.
Yabili writes that in 2008, 40 Rwandan officers were prosecuted by the Spanish judge Fernando Andreu Merelles for "genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism.” It is important to note that prosecution is different from indictment. Were 40 Rwandan officers prosecuted? No. The highly publicized accusations against 40 military officials were found to be baseless by Spanish courts. In fact, Yabili, in standing for Harvard’s “veritas” (truth) academic integrity should have shared that the Spanish case was in fact an attempt by genocide sponsors to accuse the very group that put an end to it while the world watched. Something akin to giving a platform to Nazis to accuse the Jews for planning the holocaust. Was this fact difficult for Yabili to present to the world or just too inconvenient for his set narrative?  What’s going on here?
Moreover, the group that is popularly responsible for the killings in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the “Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda” (FDLR)—the same group that executed the genocide before fleeing to the DRC.
Yabili is not finished. He writes that “Kagame—de-facto leader of Rwanda since 1994—has set an adverse precedent by pushing a constitutional reform that granted himself the opportunity to stay in power until 2034.” Did Kagame hit campaign trail to mobilize for this constitutional reform? No. Debate on term limits is mostly emotive and has many faces. For example, what Yabili calls “adverse precedent,” millions of Rwandans call favorable precedent—in fact, 98.3% of Rwandans said yes to the constitutional amendment that would allow Kagame to run for another term.
In seeking to extend tenure for Kagame, Rwandans reflected on their own context and weighed the odds. They decided not to gamble their future on untested leaders — for now. Besides, what is moral about term limits when people have democratic rights to elect leaders they want? What was the context and motivation of Americans when they allowed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to stay on a bit longer? Why would it be moral for Israel or United Kingdom not to have term limits and immoral for Rwanda to act in similar way?
Why are developmental states that are trying hard to uplift the lives of their people the very ones that are most viciously attacked? Are they being punished for defying "conventional wisdom" on how African countries are supposed to behave? For example, Rwanda is one of the few countries that achieved all the MDGs and was just cited by the UN Human Development Index as having made the most progress worldwide in the last 25 years. But most important is that Rwandans believe President Kagame is a revolutionary leader with a mission that needs to be fulfilled irrespective of how long it takes. Many continue to look at him not as a career politician but a guardian of Rwanda’s transformation and dignity. Many continue to compare him with grand master Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore who reigned for 34 years. Just like it was moral for Harvard University to host Lee in 1967 and 2000, it was moral for Harvard to host Kagame in 2016.

Though little is disclosed officially, there is some anecdotal evidence that top graduates entering the tech industry can be paid up to $100k lump-sum for committing to join a firm after graduation. As our graduating classmates make their full-time employment decisions, these so-called signing bonuses are no doubt hard to resist. But we, from future Bay Area inhabitants to those entering the public service, should take care to think about the present value of our decisions.
The concept of present value is a cornerstone of financial theory and involves looking at future income backwards. The usual way we think about time and money is that if we had a dollar today, we could put it in a savings account with 1% interest and have $1.01 a year from now. But the flip side of this is that a dollar a year from now is worth 99 cents today, since we could invest those 99 cents at 1% interest to have a dollar then. We call the worth of next year’s dollar today—99 cents in this case—its present value, and the conversion rate between future money and money now, 1% here, the discount rate.
Interpreted more liberally, a discount rate measures how much less we like having something in the future than having the same thing today, and lets us move almost anything effortlessly through time. Happiness or a hundred-dollar bill next year would be great, but having half as much happiness or ninety dollars right now might be just as good to me. This mathematical time-travel is what underpins financial markets: Every investor knows that the value of a stock, bond, or exotic financial security should be roughly equal to the present value of the expected future cash flows you’ll receive for owning it.
Let’s suppose for the time being that we are looking for a job, and our only goal is to get money; in other words, we want to maximize the present value of earnings over our lifetimes. Before we continue, ask yourself the following: What is the least someone would have to pay you a year from now, for you to commit to paying them $1000 two years from now? If you would strike a deal for $800, we can guesstimate your subjective discount rate to be 25%. This is because you have effectively agreed to take out a loan for $800 next year, with the promise of paying it back with 25% interest two years from now. For those requiring payments of $900 and $950, these guesstimates are about 10% and 5% respectively.
Now, imagine we are faced with two job offers. The first would give us slightly more attractive long-term career prospects than the second (you would have better mentors or more chances to learn new skills), but otherwise, the jobs are the same. To quantify this small difference in potential growth, we will assume that taking the first job will result in an annual salary increase of 3.5% over the course of our careers, as opposed to an annual increase of 3% (roughly the average raise in 2015) by taking the second. Then, even if the second job offered a signing bonus of $10,000, $84,000, and $282,000, for subjective discount rates of 25%, 10%, and 5% respectively, the first job still would offer a higher present value of earnings.
In this scenario, half a percentage point of additional annual growth can be as attractive as a signing bonus of nearly $300,000! Of course, growth and discount rates are not constant or certain, humans don’t discount according to standard economic models, and getting money certainly isn’t the only goal in life. As such, the numbers above give the illusion of precision when there is little. However, I think they can still hint at the following: If one job can perceptibly offer us more latitude to grow, learn, and set ourselves up for a successful career in the long-term than another, nearly any signing bonus of realistic size should be close to a non-factor in our decision calculus.
Two objections commonly arise to this line of thought. The first goes like this: What if I need to trade a high-growth job for a fat signing bonus so I can help pay my parent’s bills right now? Here’s one solution: Instead of settling for a one-time bonus, you could take out a loan for your parents today, addressing the need for immediate money, and accept a sufficiently higher-growth job, which could cover the interest and potentially more.
The second objection involves joining a company just to collect its signing bonus, and leaving soon after. This is fine, as long as your career prospects afterwards would still be better than those of your other options. Signing bonuses are not bad per se; a great first job together with a big bonus is about as good as it gets.
But for all this talk about money, present value can also help us think about so much more. If our goal is to do good, the present value of the societal impact we make over our lifetimes is what should matter. For example, maybe working in a nonprofit corporate role with little direct impact, but many chances to learn about the industry and expand your network, might set you up to do more long-term good than working on the ground right out of college.
Ultimately, whether we’re on the West Coast or in nonprofit work, the idea of present value says that with the right discounting, money, doing good, and happiness years from now are fungible with money, doing good, and happiness today. As such, we should be careful not to act myopically for small victories in the here and now. Rather, we ought to prize the (appropriately discounted) future as we do the present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 3, 2016, at 6:03 p.m.
Women are crazy.
This is a common refrain heard in the media, popular culture, and everyday conversation. From song lyrics about how “bitch is crazy,” to movie and television depictions of women as clingy and jealous, to the many articles teaching men how to tell if a woman is “batshit crazy,” we as a society have thoroughly internalized the concept of labeling women as “insane.”
Using mental illness as an insult, however, is concerning. Not only does it contribute to societal expectations that prevent men and women from expressing their emotions in constructive ways, it is also incredibly inconsiderate and stigmatizing to those who do have mental illness by suggesting that they deserve to be mocked or dismissed.
Furthermore, women are not any more emotional, illogical, or “crazy” than men. Studies have shown that men and women exhibit similar emotional responses to comparable situations, and research has also shown that women tend to be better at emotion regulation than men. So why does the stereotype of crazy women persist?
The idea that women are crazy is nothing new. Hysteria was the first mental disorder attributed to women, introduced by the Egyptians in 1900 BC. It was a catch-all disorder used to explain any number of symptoms including anxiety, irritability, erotic fantasies, or even excessive vaginal lubrication. Hysteria was allegedly caused by a wandering womb—literally, a womb that moved around in a woman’s body. And although it seems laughably antiquated and unscientific now, hysteria continued to be a valid medical diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until as late as 1980.
And even today, we continue to hear women being described as hysterical. Hillary Clinton, for example, was described as “hysterical” and “shrill” in a news article about her speech in a town hall. Compare this to media descriptions of Donald Trump. When Trump raises his voice during speeches, he is not described as crazy but rather as “forceful.”
The word “hysterical” oppresses women today just as, in the past, it invalidated their emotions and vilified their sexual desires as symptoms of a mental disorder. Nowadays, if a woman expresses an emotion or opinion that is deemed excessive or inappropriate, she is immediately slammed with the label “crazy.” Your girlfriend is upset at you for not texting her back for three days? She’s acting crazy.
But what about the man who punches a hole in the wall? Is he crazy? No, he’s just under a lot of stress, okay, he had a hard day at work. The poor guy.
Why don’t we make the same excuses for women? When a woman has an emotional outburst, we don’t try to put ourselves in her shoes and understand why she’s so upset. We call her crazy. We tell her that her opinion doesn’t matter and her emotions are groundless, and we silence her. Why is that?
The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to explain their own behavior as a product of their situation, and to explain someone else’s behavior as a product of their personality. Therefore, since our society looks through the eyes of men, we are more likely to justify a man’s behavior with his situation, but more likely to explain a woman’s behavior by chalking it up to her personality. As a result, we as a society are more unforgiving toward women and don’t give them the same excuses that we give to men.
This tendency to label women as crazy inhibits the progress women can make in society. So long as women are called crazy, they cannot be taken seriously in any sphere of their lives. In the workplace, when women display assertive behavior—as Megyn Kelly did in her questioning of Donald Trump—they are belittled as overemotional or irrational. In the hospital, when women complain of pain—as the wife of this writer did—they aren’t taken seriously and receive less aggressive treatment. And in their personal lives, when women display anger or grief, they are told to “calm down,” suggesting that their complaints are somehow unjustified or excessive. Even scientific research shows evidence of this double standard: When a man expresses anger, this increases his power to influence his peers; but when a woman expresses anger, it makes everyone take her less seriously.
The stereotype of the crazy woman contributes to sexism by dismissing women’s emotions as irrational and questioning a woman’s sanity every time she expresses an emotion. However, the stereotype also contributes to the stigma of mental illness.
Mental illness is serious and prevalent, faced by approximately one in five American adults. However, people with mental illness often experience judgment, negative stereotyping, and stigma from society. Approximately three out of four people with mental illness report that they have experienced prejudice and discrimination. The harmful effects of the stigma are significant, including social exclusion and poorer quality of life.
Mental illness should never be used as an insult. But every time we describe a woman as “crazy,” we further stigmatize mental illness. When we call women crazy, we use the word to suggest that their behavior is so inappropriate and shameful, it’s as if they’re mentally ill.
Sexism and mental illness stigmatization may be separate phenomena, but in this case, they are not perpetuated separately. Both are prejudices deeply ingrained in our society, and both are extremely disempowering and harmful to the affected populations.
Calling women crazy otherizes, dismisses, and shames them. But it also otherizes, dismisses, and shames people who actually live with mental illness. In this way, the stereotype of women as “crazy” doesn’t just prevent women from achieving equality and respect. It also stigmatizes the mentally ill and prevents them from achieving equality and respect as well.

Kitchen tables are weird. Dad bought ours for Mom on Mother’s Day several years ago, and according to the salespeople, it’s made of reclaimed wood. I don’t really know what reclaimed wood is, but the table is nice enough. It’s strong—strong enough to hold food for five core family members and three regular extended ones. It’s dark brown, and according to Mom, “has great character.” I don’t really know what that means either, but I nodded when she said it. And it’s smooth—well, almost smooth.
At one end of the table, there are a series of scratches. Or, rather, nicks. I’d never admit it to Mom or Dad, so keep this between us, but I am responsible for those nicks.
The first time I nicked the table, I was learning long division. Math never really interested me, and my mind wandered as my tutor explained what a remainder was. During this mind wandering, my pen would find its way into my hand, and the tip of the pen would find its way into the soft wood of the table. A nick.
But math wasn’t the only subject that bored me. As I hand wrote a speech on Marbury v. Madison for a public speaking competition, I got writer’s block. How was a seventh grader supposed to talk about the modern implications of judicial review? Frustration led to boredom, and boredom to nicking.
I learned grammar, engaged with civics, and memorized SAT vocabulary at the kitchen table. My older brother was also there, and sometimes we’d create nicks together.
But homeschooling wasn’t entirely boring. The experience was, to my delight, intensely individualistic—by the time I was in high school, I was designing my own course of study. Rather than being bound to school hours, I was able to power through a day’s worth of work in a morning, so that I could spend nights in the dance studio. And while my traditionally-schooled counterparts complained of disruptive classmates, I reveled in the ability to engage academically, free of distractions. Please, though, keep all of this between us. I keep my less-than-common educational background a secret.
I do so because the word “homeschooled” is a lightning rod for aspiring comedians. Once people catch wind of my hidden identity, they deliver their weak, tired jokes at my expense. “Bet you had a good student-teacher ratio!” Cringe. “Did the other kids bully you?” Cringe. “Did you ever have to stay after school for detention?” Cringe.
I remember staring down at my food in Annenberg, face flushed and chest tight, as a classmate implied that I was admitted to Harvard because, “Your mom just gave you A’s.”
I remember learning not to start a sentence with “When I was in high school…” unless I wanted people to laughingly dismiss it.
I remember being told that I “socialized well, for a homeschooled kid.”
I remember excusing myself from the table at a friend’s dinner party, hoping for a brief escape from the continuous mockery.
And I remember calling my older brother, my eyes full of tears, to ask if it was going to get better.
I don’t talk about it very much anymore. No one really cares where sophomores went to high school. Most friends know, obviously, but are supportive and interested rather than critical. My professors also know, but they just get excited, picking my brain about alternative educational paths.
People are weird, too. When we get bored, we nick things. We pick up our pens and we nick into the soft spots of others. Nicking amuses us. It keeps our minds off of our own insecurities, and gives us an escape at the expense of others.
But to those of you out there with a “joke” you just need to make, have at it. I’ll cringe, yes, but twelve years of cringing has only built my character. And, like my kitchen table, I still have space for a few more nicks.

The Uber ride to East Cambridge was awkward. Having failed to check the “solo” versus “shared” option, I ended up crunched in the back of the car with two strangers (both absorbed in loud debate over the sexual merits of their boyfriends) while my roommate squeezed in next to the driver. Perched uncomfortably in the front, she gamely asked him which local college students he found most annoying.
“Well, those Harvard kids are real shits,” he grumbled, before asking us where we went to school.
Our arrival at the packed Helmand Restaurant, named for the longest river in landlocked Afghanistan, initially did little to improve our mood. We showed up 12 minutes late to our 7:30 p.m. reservation, and the maitre d’ kept us waiting for another 20. Finally, our soft-spoken and grizzled waiter materialized from the dense wall of diners and led us to our seats. Tucked away at a small table near the front of the restaurant, my roommate and I perused the simple paper menus by the light of a flickering candle and prepared ourselves for the unexpected.
Neither of us had tasted Afghan cuisine before, much less Zagat-rated food created by the brother of Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan. Of course, Mahmood Karzai wouldn’t be preparing our food himself. Karzai, who declined our request for an interview, takes a very active role in managing the restaurant. As his wife told Boston Magazine, “He gets very upset if he tastes something that he doesn’t like.”
Karzai needn’t be upset—the food was excellent. We began our meal with Kaddo, baby pumpkin pan-fried, baked, then sprinkled with sugar and served over a creamy pool of yogurt garlic sauce. As a finishing touch, the cook drizzled a thick, ground-beef gravy over the plate. The combination was heavenly—the savory notes of garlic and beef played perfectly against the saccharine pumpkin, which would have been cloyingly sweet on its own. The mixture of textures—velvety yogurt, viscous pumpkin, and granular ground beef—enticed the tongue and made it nigh impossible to stop eating, even to breathe.
For our entree, we shared Lamb Lawand, a leg of lamb sauteed with mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic, onion, yogurt, spices, and fresh cilantro, served with sauteed spinach and Challow rice (an Afghan specialty that involves both boiling and baking to produce fluffy individual grains delicately scented with cumin). Though not quite ascending to the flavorful subtlety of our appetizer, the dish was well-executed and well-plated. The steaming piles of tender lamb, drenched in tangy sauce, formed one point of a delectable triangle whose other vertices consisted of rich, verdant spinach and moist, slightly salty rice. For the best bite, combine as much lamb, spinach, and rice as your spoon can hold (spoiler: It will never be enough). 
To close out the night, my roommate and I ordered Sheerekh, homemade ice cream paired with cardamom, pistachio, dates, figs, and fresh pineapple. Though the dates were the best I’d ever tasted, the ice cream stole the show. As we lingered over each mouthful, we tried to identify the ingredient that lent this frozen treat its unusual tartness—a piquancy enhanced by the honeyed pineapple, date, and fig. Soon, however, we found ourselves distracted by the vital business of eating, eating, eating.
As our waiter delivered dessert, he momentarily withheld my spoon, quipping that I’d have to fight him for it. If he’d known how readily I would have done so, he wouldn’t have made the joke.

Its name is intense, certainly. But Alive & Kicking Lobsters isn’t an underground lobster fight club, or a lobster taekwondo studio (sorry to disappoint). In fact, it isn’t much of anything—just a simple kitchen and fish freezer, tucked between two houses on a quiet Cambridge street, with picnic tables outside and rusting lobster traps for décor. What’s the appeal?
For one, lobsters are good for more than gladiatorial entertainment. They’re also pretty tasty. I set out for Alive & Kicking on a Friday afternoon to sample one of their famous lobster sandwiches. Not rolls, like the classic New England hot-dog-bun recipe. Sandwiches, as in regular ol’ sliced bread. According to Yelp, this is a critical distinction, and one that makes the trek to residential Cambridge worthwhile.
This is impressive, as A&K is certainly off the beaten track, and also an exception to the general “Don’t eat seafood from shacks in sketchy parking lots” life rule. It’s easy to miss the first time around. I arrived around 3 p.m. after the lunch rush, and found little more than a bunch of empty picnic tables and a vaguely nautical aroma. The only other customer was the restaurant’s mascot, a stray cat whose diet of lobster scraps is probably better than 99 percent of all felines’—and Harvard students’—and had the smug attitude to prove it.
Inside, I placed my order. The menu was as bare-bones as the decor, although tragically more expensive ($16.95 for the famed lobster sandwich). I couldn’t find any explanation as to why the hell said sandwich is so superior, either.
This was a question for the experts. A&K employee Adam J. Callahan fielded a few of my queries while my sandwich was being made. He’s been working at the restaurant for “about three and a half or four years,” and naturally loved lobster rolls when he started. Not anymore, though. “I think my first two months here,” he told me, “I had one almost every day.” What followed was a major burnout. Now, he’ll only eat A&K lobster once a month.
It’s good lobster, though. “In the wintertime, it’s hard to get them locally,” he admitted. “But other than that, it’s all local stuff. We go out of Ipswich or the Cape; some guys go out of Boston. We’re friends with a bunch of fishermen, so we buy them off the boats.”
This locally sourced ethos can probably be traced back to A&K’s founder, Louis Mastrangelo. Now in his 80s, he’s currently on vacation in Florida and wasn’t reachable for an interview. Mastrangelo started the business in 1996, selling lobsters out of the back of a trailer. Once he’d moved into a permanent location—the vacant lot behind his house—business started to pick up, thanks to glowing Yelp reviews and support from the local community.
It hasn’t been all smooth sailing, though. Last year, neighbors’ complaints (apparently, not everyone enjoys waking up to the scent of 400 pounds of simmering lobster) led to a zoning inquiry, which revealed that Mastrangelo had never officially obtained permission from the City of Cambridge to operate a retail business in a residential neighborhood. Without one, the restaurant was in danger of being shut down.
A&K’s fans, though, weren’t ready to lose their beloved sandwiches just yet. A petition online to keep the restaurant open garnered over 2,000 signatures, and Mastrangelo was eventually granted a usage variance to continue operating. “It was huge,” said Callahan. “There’s people who have been coming here since it opened, buying [lobster].”
Which brings me to the long-awaited item itself. What more is there to say? It’s three ounces of lobster meat and mayonnaise on buttered toast. Food criticism meets its match in the lobster roll (sorry, sandwich), an item so relentlessly crowd-pleasing it defies all appraisals. Lobster is lobster, and unless you’re allergic to shellfish, three ounces of it is going to taste pretty damn good no matter the presentation.
Well, OK. Alive and Kicking’s take on the Boston classic is special enough to merit a little concrete praise. The lobster chunks are delicate and creamy, sandwiched between two slices of toasted scali bread (a form of Italian white found only in Boston) with little other ornamentation. The rare bad lobster rolls I’ve eaten have all tried too hard by including some unwelcome extra seasoning, like celery salt or Old Bay. A&K, on the other hand, is following the same rules as it does for its physical space—keep things simple and unadorned, and trust in the tastes of their loyal customers.
And, of course, there’s the simple hipster street cred of being unique. “I think it just goes a lot better with the lobster, to be honest,” Callahan says. “Everyone does hot dog buns.”

Ah, food, the sustenance of life. Just as it has the power to unite us around the dinner table, so too does it have the power to tear our emotions apart. Just ask the critics of Yelp, whose horrid dining experiences have resulted in reviews so emotionally wrought that therapist intervention was likely necessary.
If you can’t take the heat, I advise that you stay out of the Yelp comment section, but if you’ve found the Harvard dining experience to be too bland for your tastes, read on to discover the steamiest, spiciest, and most impassioned reviews Yelp has to offer.
B.Good
“I think the only way to get you to understand how atrocious it was without you eating it yourself would be for me to douse myself in lighter fluid and go out self-immolation style.”
-Dan C., Cambridge, MA
According to Dan C., if you came to Harvard looking to find the answers to big, life-shaping, existential questions—“What am I eating?” “How much do I actually love myself?” and “Did I really leave the dining hall for this?”—b.good is the place for you.
Café Sushi
“The bathroom was really sketchy and smelt like dirty bum, but then again, so does most of Boston.”
-Morgan F., Waltham, MA
Everything is relative. A dining experience isn’t limited to the taste buds, so I’d say the Boston-esque scent adds to the authenticity of the experience!
Charlie’s Kitchen
“Blekh to the greasy Reuben
Yeech to the stale fries,
I ingested this crap and I wondered
How come I haven't died?
Reading the stellar reviews,
I wonder at the possibility
That you all have been going
To a different Charlie's Kitchen than me.”
-Sana M., Boston, MA
A meal memorable enough to inspire poetry! Keep Charlie’s in mind when brainstorming for your next creative writing assignment.
Chutney’s
“Eating there is the worst thing I have done to myself lately.”
-Karan K., Somerville, MA
Has Karan been doing relatively well, or was the experience truly that horrid? Either circumstance seems to suggest that a meal at Chutney’s may not be a viable part of a self-care routine.
Clover
“I could save money for years, obtain a degree in agriculture, get approved for a loan, buy a plot of fertile land for a farm, purchase farm equipment, cultivate the land, plant and nourish coffee plants, hire seasonal labor, harvest the coffee beans, roast the beans, grind the beans and brew my own cup of coffee in the same amount of time Clover takes to dribble out 12oz of coffee. Their system has the equivalent flow rate of a dehydrated tapering piss.”
-Nick H., Boston, MA
In the time it took to describe this process, Nick H. could have started his own overpriced, vegetarian hot spot with a menu centered around dehydrated tapering piss.
El Jefe’s
“In a word? Dog food on a tortilla. And a soggy one at that… The meats had one flavor—unless you count sodium and chloride separately. The food assembly was on maximum IDGAF… Even the guacamole was seriously meh. In the name of the Holy Virgin in the Heavens, how do you mess up guacamole?… I want you to apologize (on video) to the city of Cambridge for crushing our dreams that a serviceable restaurant would go in the space you're now clogging with your salt tacos… Not since Cortez has someone laid waste on Mexico to this magnitude.”
-Will C., Cambridge, MA
Points to Will for references to chemistry, religion, and history. For “soggy dog food,” El Jefe’s sure does provoke thought on many different subjects.
Harvard Hotel
“Good but overpriced and pretentious.”
Lynette M., Arlington, MA
Is “going to eat at the Harvard Hotel” code for spending four years at the prestigious institution known as the College? Asking for a friend. In New Haven.
Flat Patties
“This is probably the only food substance that looks like the same before liposuction as it does after liposuction… Made me feel a little sick afterward, not because it was tainted in any way, but because of the guilt I felt afterward. Like the feeling one would get after punching a kitten, I’m guessing.”
G.S., Washington, D.C.
Masochists, this is the restaurant for you.
Hong Kong
“I prefer my sketchiness more mature and accompanied by chicken on a stick and karaoke.”
-Orly M., Somerville, MA
You and me both, Orly. But for now, I’ll settle for Kong and what Yelp reviewer Felecia C. says is Kong’s sole good purpose: “A quick third floor booty shake to ‘Sexyback’ while on your way to another Cambridge watering hole.”

It’s rare that a restaurant comes close to making its customers cry on a regular basis, and rarer still that they will eagerly pay $15 per morsel of food for the experience. Yet this happens regularly at Hojoko, a trendy Japanese restaurant nestled in an even trendier Boston hotel called The Verb, just a hop, skip, and a jump down the street from Fenway.
Hojoko’s interior is comfortably eclectic, with rock-and-roll paraphernalia, Pacman consoles, and TVs displaying both the Celtics game and “Bob’s Burgers.” The waitstaff wore t-shirts emblazoned with band logos, and the chefs chatted amiably over the bar in the back.
Our charmingly energetic waitress Ashley made a comforting amount of fuss over my fish allergy before explaining that Hojoko is a “small plates” kind of establishment. Her suggestion that we order seven plates for our group of three seemed disingenuous. With the food options ranging from $8 for a salad and extending up into the twenties for a roll of sushi, her instruction struck me as an invitation to overorder.
To Ashley’s credit, my evaluation was incorrect. “Small plates,” or tapas, as they are often labeled, seem to be more of an excuse to double prices while halving portions than a fun alternative way to enjoy a meal. Nevertheless, the food is undeniably interesting and sometimes even quite tasty.
Our sushi salad, titled “Weed” on the menu, arrived first. An eye-catching blend of colors, it was about what you would expect: good, but loaded with sea and sodium. We made our way through the miniscule plate in short order, but just as we had begun searching for something else to work on, our Wasabi Roulette arrived.
Six pieces of sushi circled a baby bottle full of pina colada, one of them stuffed with a frightening amount of wasabi. With grim eyes, we popped the first pieces into our mouths, only to breathe easy a moment later as we confirmed that none of our first selections contained the bomb. Tensions rose as we moved on to our second pieces, and a strangled “mmhmmfh” of panic indicated who had the misfortune of losing our game of roulette. My companion’s eyes streamed furiously as she bent over double, covering her mouth with her hands and struggling to catch her breath. The baby bottle helped stem the burning but did little to restore her dignity.
Our plates continued arriving just as the previous ones were cleaned off—which is to say, soon after acquiring them. The fried calf brains were curious. Our waitress told us to savor their texture, which was more reminiscent of mozzarella sticks than meat. Okonomiyaki, a pancake-like creation stuffed with bacon and drizzled with barbeque flavor, was deliciously savory but oddly out of tune with the rest of our food, and the six little strips of roasted duck breast with scallions on the side were a citrusy delight. Still hungry, we added the karaage chicken to our order, a traditional Japanese pub food that was reminiscent of the Popeyes near Kenmore Station.
Dessert is an off-menu affair, composed of cups of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. “You can get the same thing for a quarter of the price across the street,” Ashley added in a low voice. We chose to follow her advice and left to fill our cavernous bellies with cheaper fare.

UPDATED: March 4, 2016, at 7:50 p.m.
Athena Braun ’19 is an amateur chef from Philadelphia, PA. Bovey Y. Rao ’19 is a aspiring food critic from Draper, UT. FM brought these two culinary frosh together to cook, eat, and talk food. The following interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

BRAUN:
Do I call myself a chef? No.
Bovey came in and asked me how long I sweated the onions for and I was just like, “What does that mean?” I’m not technical. I cook for taste.
My mom used to cook a lot for me and my grandfather. She would cook things like arroz con avichuela, seared meats and pork chops and bistec. I wasn’t allowed to use the stove as a little kid, but I was allowed to season and knead the meat. I got into it that way. It was always something she and I would do.
A lot of the things that I’ll make will be bean based. Tomato based. I have a jar of adobo that will last me a year. We cook with that in everything. Everything with onions, everything with garlic. I don’t think I’ve ever cooked a dish that didn’t have that. Even scrambled eggs.
This plate is a pan-seared tilapia with an eggplant ragu. This is actually something that my mother would make for me when she would come home after working all day. The appeal of this dish is that it’s quick. And all of this is less than $20.
The fish is cooked in a pan with some garlic and seasoning. I rubbed in the seasoning so the flavor would permeate. I took a whole eggplant, stabbed it a few times, and then nuked it in the microwave. Then I scraped it out of the peel, seasoned it by itself and cut it up so it wouldn’t be chunky. After marinating the onions in vinegar and salt—it makes the onions a little bit sweeter—I fried the onion in the same olive oil as the garlic. I folded in the eggplant, then the sauce.
I don’t cook for aesthetics. This is the prettiest dish I have ever made and it came out really nicely. The fish didn’t break in the pan; I was so careful with that. And I topped it off with some raw red peppers because they add a little bit of color.
I enjoy cooking for other people more than for myself. If other people enjoy it, then I enjoy it. And I have more if you guys want some.
RAO:
I guess it started in sixth grade. I’d always see my mom and dad cook in the kitchen and I’d always want to help out, and they let me at one point, similar to Athena. But more than cooking, I really enjoyed eating. I think that’s a commentary a lot of people probably have.
So I really got into reading about food. I read Jonathan Gold. He’s the current Los Angeles Times [food critic]. He’s one of the people I look up to. And I read a lot of other narratives [about] food, like Michael Pollan. He wrote The Omnivore’s Dilemma.
I started writing about food this year. There have been a couple times when I have just gone by myself and had a very zen moment with the food. I was very intimate with the food. Just me and the food, nothing else. No distractions. The waiter would come by and I’d say, “No, don’t worry about it, I’m okay. I’m enjoying it.”
I put a lot of emphasis on giving myself enough time. My meals will take three hours. I look for flavors that really stand out to me, or something that invokes a really powerful memory. It’s something that can leave an impression, whether it’s presentation, or flavor, or even just the smell.
A lot of times I do like going with friends, because I think food should be a communal experience. It also lets you try more things in one sitting. If I’m by myself, I can’t just spend 50 bucks on food. They’ll ask “What do we get, Bovey?” and I’m like, “You should decide for yourself sometimes.” It’s good to have some personal preference.
I think I have a very different palate from a lot of people because I spent some of my childhood in China. This summer, I ate jellyfish and pig ears. I’m accustomed to it now. A lot of things people wouldn’t normally approach, I’m a lot more open to. I think every cuisine, every culture has [its] own specialty.
Athena’s dish today is really good. I like the addition of the salsa, actually. It gives it a real kick. It’s not something you expect from eggplant normally. The fish is very well-cooked. It’s well seasoned, at least for the eggplant mix. Maybe if she had marinated the fish, you could get a really good depth of flavor in it.
I try not to be really critical of restaurants, because I think they are a lot about the artist inside. They’re putting an effort in, so you just try and appreciate what they’ve given to you. You’re seeing a chef’s passion, their life’s work—an art form, almost. That’s important to me.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Mar. 4, 2016
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the author of The Omnivore's Dilemma. Michael Pollan authored the book.

In a second floor apartment in Central Square, music is blasting and the table is set. The small dining area is beginning to fill with people. Eleven serving boards made of tree bark lie out in the kitchen, each already allocated its portion of homemade bacon-infused butter with brown butter solids. By the second course, a puffy, flaky popover and a scoop of homemade strawberry jam will top each board.
This is Theory Kitchen, an innovative pop-up dining experience started by recent Tufts graduate Theo P. Friedman. Friedman wrote his senior thesis on the separation in traditional food sourcing between those who make food and those who eat it. Less than a year later, he is putting his research to work.
Based in New York, Theory Kitchen hosts multi-course, no menu, experimental dinners in various cities, popping up in friends’ apartments and borrowed venues to provide diners with an intimate, exciting, and novel experience.

The collection of diners at this particular pop-up, held in the apartment of Friedman’s co-chef Nick Dynan, range from Tufts students, to a childhood friend of Friedman’s, to a food blogger alerted to the event via email. The meal will be ten courses, and the price tag is $80 with an extra $45 added for the drink pairing, a small fraction of what a 10 course meal featuring ingredients of this quality would cost in a restaurant.
The food blogger tells the group that he’s working on a cookbook centered around tater tots. “No tots tonight!” Friedman calls from the kitchen with a grin, moving at a fast pace as dinner starts to come together. “You still have time to leave,” he says. Everyone laughs.
Pop-up restaurants are popular with young, adventurous chefs looking to experiment without the constraints of a traditional restaurant—they take the hip foodie cue from food trucks.
The first course of the night is served, a one-bite “snack” of daikon (a type of radish) pickled in a mostarda and wrapped up in mini taco form with Italian goat cheese and powdered soybean. Eyes widen around the table as we begin to realize what’s about to come out of Friedman’s makeshift kitchen. The courses come at an impressive pace, giving guests just enough time to carry conversations and learn about each other before being presented with yet another masterpiece.
Nothing about this meal is simple, yet somehow each dish’s flavor is so fluid and satisfying that nothing overwhelms. Course number three is a black garlic donut with a yuzu-kosho/black garlic aioli filling topped with fresh uni (the only edible part of a sea urchin) and yuzo kosho paste. “One bite!” Friedman announces, and the crowd follows suit.
The food is as creative as it is delicious. Later in the meal, Friedman and his team serve a bowl of whipped feta, ancho chili, herbs, and burnt avocado puree—but not before burning the avocado puree with a blowtorch. Theory Kitchen is no stranger to extreme cooking: Blowtorches, immersion circulators, and ISI canisters are all tried-and-true devices.
Towards the end of the meal, they serve a chicharron dulce de leche version of a rice crispy treat. It is rare to find any sort of interaction between chicharron (generally pork rind) and something as innocent as a rice crispy treat, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that the unexpected is the norm here.
Most recent college graduates aren’t spending their time drawing daily connections between food and art, but for Friedman the combination was inevitable. Both of Friedman’s parents are artists, and he says that “all of my memories are food.” Though he can’t pinpoint a moment he decided he would go into the culinary business, it seems as if he naturally arrived at this outcome. “Within a very brief period of time, I fell down an obsessive hole of cooking,” he says.
When the meal is over, Friedman and his team sit down with the guests and pour a glass of wine. They toast to the completion of the meal, their fourth and last of their weekend in Boston, and chat with diners. Despite the ambitious and exploratory nature of the meal, Friedman is casual and humble.
“I just want to meet as many people as possible, cook for as many people as possible, and learn,” says Friedman on the future of Theory Kitchen. He plans to continue pop-up dinners for at least another year, taking advantage of New York and travel-based opportunities before planning his next move.
Friedman remarks more than once while cooking the meal how much fun he’s having, later telling diners that a plus side of owning his own restaurant would be getting to do this every night. He notes the importance of “making sure the people who are cooking the food… are just as happy to be there, just as psyched to be a part of it, as the people eating the food.”
This philosophy is evident as Friedman moves around the kitchen, cooking to the beat of the music that’s shifting from hip hop and rap playlists to Justin Bieber’s “What Do You Mean?” Every meringue, scallop, and microgreen is not only cooked to inventive perfection, but also deeply connected to those preparing it.
“Food is my language,” Friedman says. He seems to be fluent.

“There’s no good or bad way to cook, only an untasty and tasty way to do it,” HUDS executive chef Akeisha K. Hayde announces as the Food Literacy Project (FLP)’s cooking class begins. I feel slightly out of place in the Northwest culinary lab as one of the only undergraduates—the other attendees range from local Cambridge community members to graduate school professors—but before I know it, I’m julienning jalapeños, pitting an avocado by stabbing it in the middle, and chopping onions without even crying.
This weekly cooking class, coordinated by Allyson R. Perez ’17, is one of many initiatives organized by the Food Literacy Project, a fellowship program that allows students to explore the food system through academics and experience. Fellows, coming from both the College and graduate schools, organize monthly events, which are chronicled in the weekly “Eater’s Digest.” These range from talks on nutrition for athletes to the university-wide “Just Food” conference to be held next month.

FLP fellows also meet “periodically with the dining hall chef and manager to discuss student feedback and suggestions for the menu,” Katelyn E. McEvoy ’17, the FLP representative of Lowell house, explains. Those weird little broccoli chicken breasts that you scarf down when you’re hungover on Sunday morning? The FLP reps might be the reason why they’re sticking around.
FLP’s goals go beyond influencing what we see in our dining halls. “We want to bring together the increasing study of food and connect that with the practice of food,” FLP project coordinator Margiana Rockney-Peterson explains.
The theme of today’s class is local seafood. The fish in question is fresh haddock, delivered by Jared Auerbach, who is the founder of Red’s Best, the start-up company that provides HUDS with its weekly fish. Red’s Best uses small community-based fishing fleets to connect buyers directly with local fisherman. That’s why HUDS menus always mysteriously say “Fish of the Day”—not even Hayde knows what she’ll be cooking until it arrives.
The more experienced chefs in my group stand over the burner with me as I try to sear fish without harming or embarrassing myself. Cori E. Boudreau, who works at Harvard Real Estate, is a regular cook who has attended many FLP events in the past. “I try to learn at least one new recipe a week, and I eat a lot of weird food, from ostrich, to wild boar, to crickets,” she says.
While the class started out in near silence, by the end we are all laughing, eating with our hands and licking our fingers without shame, which Hayde says was her aim for the day. “I said no utensils allowed because I wanted to show that cooking with your hands is like creating something fun and awesome.”
The practice of food definitely has a unifying effect, which is one of Rockney-Peterson’s objectives for FLP. “Food is something that brings everything together,” she says, “and one of my personal goals is to make these events a benefit to the wider community.”
As we chow on our restaurant-style fish tacos (easily better than Border’s) topped with pineapple salsa and avocados, Hayde declares us “gourmet chefs,” which makes me glow with pride, considering I called my mom to ask “which one the oven was” when I decided to bake cookies last year. Now that I’ve graduated from cookies, Canaday kitchen better watch out—Fish of the  Day may be coming its way soon.

“How do we possibly decide?”
Intimidated by the colorful abundance before me, I gaze up at the overloaded bookcase of board games, its rickety wooden shelves jammed with unfamiliar titles like Fauna and Smallworld Realms and Cargo Noir. The plain old Boggle and Scrabble of my youth are nowhere to be seen among these obscure piles of wannabe Battleships and aspiring Apples to Apples. Should we try Dice City first? What about Cube Quest: Clash for the Crown? Would High Noon Saloon be our best bet?
Luckily, Laura has no such trouble finding a favorite. “Giant Jenga!” she squeals, grabbing a worn container about as tall as her knee from the bottom of the bookshelf. But minutes later, as the heavy wooden blocks come tumbling down dangerously near Laura’s mug of hot chocolate, the selection no longer seems like such a terrific idea. Not to fear: We have a box of Schmovie waiting in the wings.
On a chilly Friday night in February, I meet up with my friends Laura and Cassidy at Brookline’s delightfully quirky Knight Moves Café, which has the distinction of calling itself the only board game café in New England. Packed to the gills with 750 to 1,000 board games and a couple dozen 20-somethings, you can find the cozy din of a coffeehouse and the boisterous energy of a game night squeezed between the bookcases in the narrow shop on Beacon Street.
Founder Devon Trevelyan thought up the board game café concept when he worked at Eureka Puzzles down the road. He opened Knight Moves two years ago, and he has built the store’s formidable collection ever since by reaching out to game developers, seeking out game donations from Eureka and the public, and regularly buying new games.
“Almost everybody has played a board game in their lives,” says Jonathan Miles, a manager at Knight Moves, as he discusses the charm of the place. “So the idea of going somewhere and playing a board game while also having coffee or tea or pastries is a very attractive idea to most people, but not one that they ever would have thought of on their own.”
Though Miles likes to start uninitiated clients on a game called Splendor, some customers do not require assistance picking out activities to fill their stay. On a cushioned bench against the back wall, Emerson students Audrey Stewart and Carl Levigne—newbies at Knights Moves who have already plowed through Corrupted Kingdoms and chess—hunch over a round of Rat-a-Tat Cat. “It’s a game I used to play as a kid, and I couldn’t believe they had it because I haven’t seen it anywhere,” Stewart explains. “So I just grabbed it and [said], ‘We have to play it now.’”
But if you, like me, do not have a particular game in mind as you approach the bookshelves, the staff at Knight Moves has got you covered. (Word to the wise: Do not come to the café in hopes of revisiting Hungry Hungry Hippos. Though the shop boasts hundreds of games, that one did not make the cut.) Our encyclopedic waiter Daniel Ansted approaches us at the beginning of the evening to help us make some choices.
“What level of brain activity are you looking for tonight?” he asks.
“Very little,” I assure him—I have more than enough brain activity waiting for me back at Harvard.
He quickly returns with Concepts, a sort of Pictionary in which the drawings are done for you on a board of illustrations. The contestant pulls a noun from a deck of cards—garden hose, Mary Poppins, pajamas, and Rubik’s Cube, to name a few—and places pegs on indicative illustrations until her peers figure out the secret word. The game has no discernible goal, but it keeps us entertained for a surprisingly long time.
Popping by our table every now and then, Ansted—who notes that he “got promoted from customer to employee”—needs no prompting to replenish our supply of board games or give us advice. The man is a human Amazon recommendation: “If you liked Schmovie, you’ll love Channel A,” he chimes in at one point. After he spots us eyeing the R-rated guessing game Dirty Minds on a nearby shelf, he wordlessly hands us F**ktionary, which my parents may be pleased to know we do not end up playing.
One of the cleverest aspects of Knight Moves is how easily it facilitates conversation, a quality that is sure to spill over to the new Somerville location launching this spring. If you have lots to say to your companions, you can easily chat over a game of Billionaire Banshee and a platter of hot dogs. And if you run out of things to say to your companions, look up—750 to 1,000 conversation starters are lining the walls around you.
“[Knight Moves allows] people to come and connect with one another outside of our modern-day lives. It’s outside of cell phones and electronics. It’s... old-fashioned, ‘Let’s sit here around a table and talk and drink,’” Miles comments. “It’s a lot more face time than most people get at other places.”
Indeed, in this comfortable little nook in Brookline, I feel fully engaged in my discussions with Laura and Cassidy, far away from the buzzes of laptops and the pressures of deadlines and the screeches of alarms. As we sip our glass-bottled Coca-Colas, roll our dice, and merrily gab our way through the night, I come to believe that Knight Moves Café just might have a monopoly on fun.

“We act like dicks. That’s pretty much the point.”
Derrick, my server at Dick’s Last Resort, describes his Faneuil Hall establishment pretty well. Started, Derrick thinks, in Dallas, Dick’s Last Resort (hereafter referred to as DLR) is a chain restaurant where the waitstaff is instructed to be vulgar and unpleasant. Though I’m somewhat ambivalent about the concept, requests from my editor and a promise of reimbursement from The Crimson send me on a lone journey to Quincy Market to get the DLR experience.
Having called ahead and confirmed with a slightly confused employee that there would indeed be room for one, I’m quickly shown to my seat at a long cafeteria-style table where an empty napkin dispenser, a butcher paper placemat, and a comically massive green plastic margarita glass bearing condiments mark my place setting.
DLR is between one-half and two-thirds full this Friday at 7:30 p.m. A soundtrack of anonymous (to me, at least) ’80s music blares from the ceiling. Four video monitors above the bar are evenly split between ESPN and an odd series of promotional shorts featuring Dick, the chain’s animated “ornery, politically incorrect curmudgeon” who serves as the mascot. The promotional shorts are a vulgar iteration of the sort you see on the unused scorekeeping monitors at a bowling alley. A drawing of Dick modeling underwear bears the caption “Kalvin Kline: Classy Dick.” A subsequent slide features Dick’s dog warning me that I will enjoy myself “whether [I] want to or not.”
“Put down your phone,” yells a t-shirted waitress, grabbing a phone from a little girl at the table next to me and snapping a quick selfie with it.
Beanie-clad and diamond-earringed, Derrick approaches, gives me his spiel, and lets me know that the dinner menu is on a big sandwich board by the bar.
I was a little anxious at the thought of going to a restaurant like this alone. I shouldn’t have worried. Reassuringly, the vast majority of DLR patrons don’t seem to be having much fun. Besides a group of slightly inebriated folks, who I can only assume (based on variability in age and appearance) are coworkers of some sort, hamming it up with Derrick, my neighbors (mostly families with young children) are quiet, almost taciturn.
The Maybe Coworkers table, though, absolutely loves Derrick. Almost all of its occupants are sporting tall paper hats with personalized insults scrawled across them (a DLR signature), and those that aren’t are gamely taking a tongue-lashing from Derrick, who makes kissy faces at one of the hatless men.
“Viva Viagra,” reads the hat of one of the older diners at the Maybe Coworkers table. Derrick’s other captions range from the innocuous (“I stalk boys on Instagram”) to the unapologetically dirty (“Derrick’s boner garage.”)
Derrick and a red-haired man with a huge belly filling out an extra-large DLR shirt are the star waiters. The red-haired man shouts at his tables from clear across the room while Derrick not once but twice engages in a sort of “Magic Mike” stripper pantomime for the Maybe Coworkers table.
Derrick is actually unnervingly polite to me. He takes my order for “Firecracker Salmon with Rice and Veggies” and brings over a truly gargantuan plastic glass of ice water, but besides that he mostly leaves me alone. Eventually, feeling cheated of the full DLR experience, I ask Derrick to make me a mean hat. When he does, the caption is the unbelievably docile “Macklemore’s Doppelganger.” I don’t look anything like Macklemore.
My food, when it comes, is exactly okay. The salmon is dead average (though I’m not exactly sure what made it “Firecracker Salmon” as opposed to merely “Salmon”) and the veggies (read: corn) and rice are respectively below and above average by equally small magnitudes.
“Basic white girls,” chants Derrick with accompanying claps as a group of women takes the table beside mine.
The Maybe Coworkers finish up their dinner and insist on multiple rounds of pictures with the man who has been insulting them all evening.
Ultimately, DLR’s strength is that it turns a typical insecurity of restaurant patrons on its head. At other restaurants, you’re paranoid that a nice waiter is mean about you behind your back. At DLR, you suspect that a mean waiter is, deep down, one of your pals.
“Just play along,” Viva Viagara advises the Basic White Girls on his way out. “Give as good as you get.”

Food is an essential element of life and therefore an essential element of literature. In food, writers have an anchor for the reader’s sympathy and an outlet to lead the reader to new sensations. Reflecting on this recurrent theme, professors of Harvard’s English Department shared their favorite succulent examples of food in literature:

Professor: Helen Vendler
Selection: Seamus Heaney’s “Oysters”
Excerpt: The narrator eats oysters with friends in Ireland: “Our shells clacked on the plates. / My tongue was a filling estuary, / My palate hung with starlight: / As I tasted the salty Pleiades / Orion dipped his foot into the water / Alive and violated / They lay on their beds of ice: / Bivalves: the split bulb / And philandering sigh of ocean. / Millions of them ripped and shucked and scattered.”
Thoughts: “Even so innocent an action [as that of eating]...is poisoned by the male violence of the Northern Irish ‘Troubles,’ and in the brief white space between stanzas, the oysters turn in the poet’s eyes into victims.... [The poem] shows how quickly a damaging and damaged culture can contaminate the pleasure of food.”

Professor: Gordon Teskey
Selection: John Milton’s Paradise Lost
Excerpt: Eve assembles food for an angel who drops by the Garden of Eden: “She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent / What choice to choose for delicacy best, / What order so contrived as not to mix / Tastes not well joined, inelegant, but bring / Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change.” But after the meal begins, the conversation turns away from Eve’s small-scale concerns to larger explanations: “The Sun that light imparts to all receives / From all his alimental recompense / In humid exhalations, and at ev’n [evening] / Sups with the Ocean.”
Thoughts: Teskey notes that at the end of the poem, “The angel…[explains] the entire cosmos as a system of mutual ecological dependence, each thing feeding and being fed by other things.”

Professor: James Simpson
Selection: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
Excerpt: The Green Knight arrives at King Arthur’s feast: “Amazement seized their minds / No soul had ever seen / A knight of such a kind / Entirely emerald green!” Simon Armitage translates. The Green Knight then poses a challenge to the court to hack him with an axe, and Sir Gawain accepts.
Thoughts: “The scene is a radiant mixture of extreme courtesy, terrible bad manners, and spectacular violence just inches away (truer than one might think of many meals). It’s also very funny!”

Professor: Deirdre Lynch
Selection: Jane Austen’s Emma
Excerpt: Emma’s father Mr. Woodhouse holds dinner parties he does not wish to hold: “Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth; but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.”
Thoughts: “I find quite brilliant here the compound of hospitality with abstemiousness and of this man’s benevolence with his utter inability to understand that other people’s digestive systems might be rather more robust than his own. Austen is great at sniffing out selfishness, and I think this is a wonderful indication of the novel’s exploration of the pain we do others with our officiousness.”

Professor: Leah Price
Selection: Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
Excerpt: Alice joins a tea party hosted by the batty Mad Hatter: “‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s all move one place on.’ He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.”
Thoughts: “This scene sometimes reminds me of Harvard undergraduates, who are so eager to sample Harvard’s curricular and [extracurricular] banquets that they keep moving on to new treats without having time to savor the plate in front of them.”

Whether she’s sampling 200-year-old Portuguese wine, reenacting famous historical dinners, or teaching the popular Gen Ed, US World 19: American Food, A Global History, Professor Joyce E. Chaplin spends a lot of time thinking about food. FM relates. Below, we explore our shared passion.

FM:  Is the United States unique in its attitude towards food?
JEC: It’s easy to see that European countries have national food cultures: There’s French food, there’s English food, there’s Scandinavian food, there’s Italian food…. The United States doesn’t have that…. The things that are distinctive about American food are, first of all, the abundance….
The other thing is variety. Travelers to the United States in the 19th century, the 20th century, even now, say “Oh my gosh, you can get everything to eat in New York City….”  Other national food cultures don’t have that.  So this is what we have in the United States: We’re supposed to have plenty of food, and we’re supposed to have an amazing range of selections. That’s our equivalent to having a national cuisine.
FM: How do recent trends towards locally-based, environmentally sustainable, and organic foods figure into the broader history of American cuisine?
JEC:  I think there had been worries about the purity of American food and its healthfulness as early as the early 19th century—anxiety that milk delivered to cities was tainted, that some farm produce was better for you than other farm produce. There was even vegetarianism, and, for a very small group of people in the United States, even veganism…. So these have longer histories... they’re earlier versions of these common concerns.
FM: Has your research personally affected any of your eating habits?
JEC: I think because I’m interested in the history of a lot of different kinds of food, I try a lot of things that most people would not necessarily go out of their way to eat.  I think that’s true of a lot of food historians.  You’re just curious about stuff that you read descriptions of, and wonder “Well, how on earth did that taste?”
FM: Do you have any particularly vivid memories of trying something and being surprised?
JEC: I had a Madeira wine from 1790. That was amazing. The interesting thing is, it wouldn’t have tasted like that in 1790.  It had been preserved for over 200 years.  But the flavor was astonishing and just amazing.  I had another old Madeira from 1802 that was almost as good.  If I were to think of something that was just extraordinary that I’ve consumed, it would be that.
FM: If you had to choose a favorite American dish or culinary trend, which would you choose?
JEC: I am actually involved in recreating two historic dinners, one in New York and one here in Boston: one associated with Alexander Hamilton, and another with Thomas Jefferson….
Alexander Hamilton had… more simple and standard tastes and food. Hamilton was from the tiny island of Nevis in the West Indies and grew up very, very poor, and I wanted that represented in the menu. So I think the first dish is going to be deviled eggs, because cayenne pepper is from the West Indies, and deviled eggs would be a good thing to have.  I am going to try and [adapt] a dessert for this dinner, île flottante, floating island…. You poach this very soft meringue, and you float it on a sea of custard, so it’s a little floating island.  So I would like to make this big one in the shape of the island of Nevis, where he came from….
The dinner that I’m helping with about Jefferson is with the Massachusetts Historical Society, which has a big exhibit up about Jefferson now. Jefferson had really expensive taste in food and wine, so that will involve a lot of French dishes.
FM: Do your students get to taste test your assignments?
JEC: [Harvard is] paying for the food samples. That was very nice. They gave me a small budget. It just started to seem bizarre to keep talking about food and never [try it]. I can’t serve everything we talk about, but it gives us specificity at least once a week…. I’m talking and they can taste what that would mean. It’s fun.

“Can you believe we’re about to be done with college?”
When you’re a senior like I am, people ask this a lot, and actually... Yeah, I can. Though I’ve loved many parts of college, much of my day-to-day experience on campus has felt like one of those dreams in which I’m falling endlessly, wind rushing past my ears, but I never hit the ground. In many ways, I’ve changed and grown in college, but there are also ways that college has felt recursive: dreary raining schooldays that all blend together, recurring physical injuries and depression symptoms, feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork after thinking that I’d matured and grown last term to a place where self-frustration would have abated more, and the more abrasive parts of communal living—I mind the occasional cockroach far less than I mind having to eat dinner in a room packed with 300 people I may or may not know and/or feel ready to talk to, especially when feeling depressed or anxious.
Regardless of the tonal variety of the small memories I’ve accrued on-campus, I can’t say I regret any major decision I’ve made in college—the bottoms of hills on which I started have all led me to climb to better places. Let’s talk about it.
Over my four years as an undergrad, I, Ann Christina Harvieux, have consistently written for:
Psyyyyych! I, Annie, FM columnist and waffle-eater extraordinaire, have not consistently written for any single publication throughout my undergrad career. I didn’t join The Crimson until late freshman year, and I’ve taken several hiatuses for various reasons related to my personal health. I was frightened out of the Lampoon and Advocate comps twice and decided not to go back, though there are individual writers I know and respect on each. I have never received research funding for a project. I have never taken an extra class on an impulse—I’m typically drowning in the average four. I have never travelled to another country besides Canada, on or off Harvard’s dime. I’m not part of a selective social organization. I’m not part of a music group. I am the only English major who has never been a part of student theatre. (Yes, I fact-checked this.)
What am I doing?! I’m in college! I’m in the land of milk and honey, surrounded by innumerable opportunities being tantalizingly wafted under my nose via fliers or posters or daily waves of emails or friends in the dining hall saying, “You HAVE to try this!” See the world! Cure rare diseases! Spread literacy! Have your own radio show! Learn to Bollywood dance! What I’m more likely to be found doing, though, is lying on the couch in my suite’s common room, Winthrop fourth floor, feeling woefully incapable of juggling the tiny-looking handful of tasks I’ve taken on, and speculating on whether or not I could ever possibly be enough to do something of value, at least until one of my roommates comes home to distract me.
Last summer, I was the happiest I’ve been in college—I took a publishing internship in my home state of Minnesota. I loved showing up every day and being part of a team engaged in a meaningful concrete task (putting out books), diving into each task I was assigned, and putting in effort to be fastidious, caring, and innovative about the details of a project, a stark contrast to the ambiguous achievement standards that I feel bound to at school. Every day, I was able to show up at work, eager and ready to learn. (On extra-depressed days, this meant showing up very caffeinated and being sure to swipe a good-looking book to take home.) I knew I’d made the right choice by following my love of words every time I opened one of the unpublished manuscripts on which I got to do reports, fact-checks, or grammatical edits.
My desk job changed the way I see my own learning and intelligence, for the better—how often do you hear that? If I evaluate my college experience based on how often I was engaged, flexible, and eager-to-learn, I'm proud to tell you that I’m graduating with a satisfying assortment of new abilities, work strategies, and coping mechanisms—who cares if I made it into that elite club? By dabbling in a handful of publications, I’ve tested my voice in (and learned the conventions of) several types of writing. I’m a better communicator and listener than I was freshman year, and I have many new friends to show for it. My work ethic is now a force to be reckoned with: I can get a lot done when I need to. I’ve taken initiative to seek treatment for my physical and mental health problems, returned to situations and interactions that have terrified me to try to set things right, stood up for myself to peers and teachers, and also absolutely bowed to people who I know are right when I’ve been wrong. I’m better at thinking critically. I’m better at making something substantial in the salad bar when the hot options don't appeal . I’ve also failed at a lot of things, from poorly handled interpersonal interactions to bombed pop quizzes. Learning how to self-correct from failure rather than giving in to hours of self-anger or panic has helped me more than anything I’ve done right the first time.
I can believe I’m about to be done with college, and it feels good. Twenty-one-year-old Annie is excited for the workforce, whereas 18-year-old Annie was pretty scared to leave her little lakeside town. So, yeah, I’ve grown. Have other people grown “more,” or differently, or in ways that I desired somewhere along the way? Yep, they most definitely have. However, I believe that I’ve done my best to get what I can out of my education given my personal abilities, previous life experiences, and physical and mental conditions. I truly believe I’ve taken opportunities in college to put my time, abilities, resources, and yes, my tuition money, where my mouth is, and where my values are. I’ve showed up ready to engage and learn and grow. I think I’ve earned my participation points, and I bet if you stop to think about it, you’ll decide that you have, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The infamous period of high stress characteristic of “blocking” came to a close Tuesday morning as the application deadline for freshmen seeking upperclassman Housing passed.
“If Harvard had a soap opera, it would be about blocking,” said Ibrahim M. Syed ’19. “You find out who your real friends are when you decide who you’re going to block with, because you think you’ll be friends with someone, and two days before Housing day they’ll drop you like a hot potato.”
Every year, freshmen coalesce into groups of one to eight total students, forming a blocking group. Shortly before spring break, on a day of fanfare and celebration, each blocking group is randomly assigned an upperclassman House.
Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, assistant director of Advising Programs and proctor in Apley Court, said that communication between friends often becomes strained when forming blocking groups.
“It is hard to tell someone that you like and that you care about a lot that you don’t want to live with them next year, or to get that bad news from someone,” Brooks said.
Lispeth J. Tibbits-Nutt, a proctor in Holworthy, said some students become particularly stressed about blocking because they think they are solidifying their Harvard friend group for life.
“I think people have these really romantic notions in their heads that the blocking group is all these friends they’re going to have until they’re 40,” Tibbits-Nutt said. “It’s this Friends sitcom scenario, where they’re going to be friends forever and they’re going to sit on couches and play guitar and grow old and raise their children together.”
Kruti B. Vora ’17, a peer advising fellow in Wigglesworth, said she has found that freshmen often have high expectations around finding the perfect blocking group and worry about potential separation from their friends.
“I think that it’s super important to reaffirm that blocking is not the end-all be-all,” Vora said. “At the end of the day, you all go to Harvard, you all live on the same campus. Your blockmates will be in the same House with you, but they’re not by any means your only friends around campus.”
PAFs and proctors play a large role in helping freshmen through the blocking process. All freshman entryways held a study break about blocking a few weeks ago, and will hold another one about housing next week, Vora said.
“I think that our role as PAFs is to try and normalize everything that could possibly happen within blocking and let them know that no matter what situation they end up in, it’s okay,” she added.
The Freshman Dean’s Office often provides resources to help freshmen through blocking, including the “Making a House into a Home: Drama-Free Blocking” seminar offered last month. Tibbits-Nutt said programs like this are beneficial for students who attend, but the opt-in nature could render them less effective.
“Programming is not always the solution,” Tibbits-Nutt said. “It’s the most straightforward answer, to offer more things, but you still have to get students to come. And at the end of the day, most of them are not going to.”
For Tibbits-Nutt, a better solution would be to teach students more about general interpersonal social skills.

Nobel prize-winning author Toni Morrison captivated a packed Sanders Theater with her first lecture as the 2016 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry Wednesday evening, discussing race and racism, rape, and migration through a series of personal anecdotes and literary selections. 
The filled lecture was one of six that Morrison, who has also won the Pulitzer prize, will deliver over the next month. Since 1925, the Norton Professorship has been awarded to individuals in the Arts and Humanities in recognition of their talent and wide impact. Past Norton professors have included T.S. Eliot, class of 1910, Jorge Luis Borges, and Nadine Gordimer.
Morrison, who arrived on stage to a standing ovation, has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Humanities Medal for her work. She also serves as the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. At the event, Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha introduced Morrison and called her lectures timely.
“This is a moment when we have all the topics she is writing about. All these major issues—migration, people turned into stereotypes, people deprived of their lives… all these things make her presence in the country and her presence at the College vital,” Bhabha said.
In Wednesday’s lecture, entitled “Romancing Slavery,” Morrison spoke about the power of literature to filter narratives and histories, focusing on the ways in which slavery and its history have been represented through literature.
“One of the ways the nation could accommodate the degradations of slavery was brute force, another was to romance it,” Morrison said.
Morrison also challenged the audience with thought-provoking questions on race.
“How does one move from a non-racial womb to the womb of racism?” she said.
Members of the audience praised Morrison's lecture and the topics upon which she ruminated.
“I’m excited for future lectures to say the least. I think it’s a difficult topic only Toni Morrison could approach,” Julia M. Ernst ’18 said.
In addition to Harvard affiliates and students, the audience included alumni and students from local high schools and other universities.
“I’m a really big fan of Toni Morrison,” Tessa J. Lewis, a senior at Cambridge-Rindge and Latin School, said. “Today I ran to get the tickets, which sold out in 20 minutes. She is a very inspirational writer.”
At the end of her talk, Morrison announced her intention to delve deeper into the themes of race, identity, migration, and gender in future lectures through her own work and other literary sources.
“I look not to politics or even to science,” she said. “I look to literature for guidance, and that’s what I will do.”

The investigation following a November bomb threat remains open but inactive, according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
About four months ago, police received an unconfirmed bomb threat via email and immediately evacuated students from Harvard’s Science Center and Sever, Emerson, and Thayer Halls. Officers restricted access to Harvard Yard and surrounded some areas with caution tape.
After searching all four buildings, police allowed students to re-enter the buildings in the afternoon.
The investigation has not been formally closed, Catalano wrote in an email, declining to comment further.
The incident was strikingly similar to one in December 2013, when students evacuated the same four buildings in response to an emailed bomb threat. Eldo Kim, formerly a member of the College’s Class of 2016, confessed to that threat and was later charged before entering a pretrial diversion program to avoid jail time.
The November scare also occurred a few days after terrorist attacks in Paris and Beirut, contributing to an unsettling atmosphere on campus.
Nearby universities and schools, including Cape Cod Community College and Cambridge public schools, also received unconfirmed bomb threats during that week.

Harvard Business School has raised $925 million for its capital campaign, nearing its final goal of $1 billion, according to Dean Nitin Nohria.
The school raised more than $600 million in gifts and pledges during the “quiet phase” of its campaign, which publicly launched in April 2014, and has since raised the remaining $325 million. The Business School's fundraising effort is part of a University-wide $6.5 billion campaign.
In his annual update, Nohria cited innovation in the MBA program as a priority for funding, along with raising money for endowed associate professor chairs and furthering the development of HBX—the business school’s digital learning platform.
The MBA program centers around the case method, a model for which HBS is well known, Nohria said.
“As part of our centennial in 2008 we had a big opportunity to say what the future of the MBA program should look like,” he said. “I was involved in the task force that came out of that, and we came up with this very simple framework that leadership development is about knowing, doing, and being.”
Nohria concluded that in its first 100 years, the Business School had done well fulfilling the “knowing” priority. Through the case method, he said, the school touched upon the “doing” element, since students are forced to think from the perspective of the protagonist in the case study. The real-time feedback that students receive, he added, allows them to sample the “being” aspect of the tripartite philosophy.
Moving forward, Nohria said the school hopes to focus on the second and third portions of the framework.
Over  the last five years, the Business School has experimented with FIELD—Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development— a required course for first-years designed to complement the case method.
“Now we’re beginning to add a portfolio of second-year courses,” Nohria said. “My hope is that, in steady state, about 20 percent of the curriculum will be FIELD.”
Nohria said that the FIELD method is significantly more expensive than the case method, as it sends all 900 MBA students to a foreign country. “We cannot possibly charge them the full cost of that,” he said.
The Business School also hopes to invest further in HBX, which was launched three years ago to redesign the online classroom experience,  Nohria said.

As thesis deadlines rapidly approach, Harvard seniors reflected on the intellectual challenges associated with tackling massive projects and the struggle to balance regular coursework and writing.
Megan M. Monteleone ’16, whose thesis focuses on the role culture plays in economic development for indigenous peoples in Ecuador, said her main “burden” has been managing additional classwork.
“As a Social Studies concentrator, I’m required to write a thesis, but it’s been a really enjoyable experience,” she said. “I just wish I didn’t have to put my writing on hold at times, but I have to since I have other classwork to finish.”
The thesis process can be difficult for a variety of reasons. Lisette A. Candia Diaz ’16 said she had relatively few secondary sources to complement her own research.
“I’m writing about immigration status changes within families. It was really hard finding previous academic research on my topic, because it has to do with President Obama’s executive action on immigration he initiated in 2012,” she said. “Since the topic is so recent, there has not been much research done on it, especially in terms of the family unit.”
For some, the thesis writing experience has provided an opportunity to form closer connections with advisers and peers alike.
John Y. C. Wang ’16 said he found an unexpected “new home” because of his thesis.
“I am in a suite of six people, and we all have our own singles. But four of us moved into the common room, so we can write our theses together,” he said.
Henry J. Li ’16, a joint concentrator in East Asian Studies and History and Literature, said he developed a deeper bond with his thesis adviser.
“My adviser and I have always been very close and I think we’ve gotten a lot closer during this time,” he said. “I’m glad I got to build this wonderful relationship with someone who truly cares about my writing.”
Caitlin T. Begg ’16 said her thesis experience took her to college campuses across the country.
“I ended up surveying over 1,000 students from across the country,” she said. “Fifty percent of my data comes from Harvard, but a large chunk comes from the University of Pennsylvania... the rest is from about a hundred other schools.”
After turning in her thesis on Monday, English concentrator Dianisbeth M. Acquie ’16 said, as did most others, that she was relieved to be done.
“I was so happy and excited to be finished. I’m really glad it’s over,” she said.

Harvard has confirmed four additional mumps cases among students, bringing the total number to six, according to an email Harvard University Health Services director Paul J. Barreira sent Wednesday afternoon.
According to Barreira, the affected students are currently in isolation, and HUHS, the Cambridge Public Health Department, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health are working to determine the scope of the exposure.
People who have been vaccinated for mumps are much less likely to contract the virus, though they could still become infected, Barreira wrote. He also recommended that students contact their healthcare provider to ensure they are fully immunized.
The email contained suggestions for preventing the spread of mumps, encouraging students to take preventive measures—including washing their hands frequently, covering noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing, and refraining from sharing glasses, eating utensils, and water bottles.
Barreira also included medical resources in his email, including phone numbers to call if one experiences symptoms and a link to the HUHS website containing more information about mumps.
His email follows an alert on Tuesday first notifying students of the mumps outbreak.

The vice president of the Graduate Student Council condemned Harvard's filing of an amicus brief against graduate student unionization in a proposal presented at the group's monthly meeting Wednesday.
On Monday, Harvard joined other Ivy League schools, MIT, and Stanford in filing an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board calling for the body to uphold existing rulings that define the relationship between private universities and graduate students as strictly academic.
GSC Vice President John Gee prepared the resolution, which states, “The Graduate Student Council condemns Harvard’s actions in joining this amicus brief and opposing the right of graduate student workers to unionize or not unionize by a democratic process.” 
After introducing the amicus brief, GSC President Darcy Frear read a statement from Gee, who was unable to attend the meeting. Gee’s statement made clear his opinion of the brief itself.
“It’s condescending to graduate students and faculty alike. It implies doctoral students don’t need to make a living for the six or more years of their degree,” Frear read from the statement.
His statement reiterated the Council’s position that it supports members of Harvard’s unionization effort. In November, a resolution passed 38 to 4 in support of student union organizers, but not the movement itself.
The November resolution passed because the Council advocates for a process for graduate students to decide on unionization without interference from the University, according to Gee.
“[Harvard] let us know it doesn’t think we should be able to decide this issue for ourselves, and that it shouldn’t have to respect our collective voice unless it wants to,” Frear read from Gee’s statement. “Harvard let us know it is not going to remain neutral, but will take sides between graduate students, fighting those who want a union and supporting those who don’t. I think it is vitally important that we let Harvard know that’s not acceptable.”
The brief emphasized the threat a graduate student union could pose to academic freedom, and how such a move could transform the relationship between graduate students and universities to one based on labor, not education. Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have made clear  their opposition to graduate student unionization on these grounds.
Although some students raised questions about the brief, the conversation and debate over the resolution is scheduled for the April 6 meeting because of GSC protocol.
Graduate student Erin M. Hutchinson said she thinks she will vote in favor of the resolution at the next meeting.
“It’s not about the GSC supporting unionization or not; it’s about whether Harvard should let us have a democratic choice,” Hutchinson said. “It seems pretty reasonable. It’s something I think that people can support, even in theory if they’re against unionization.”

Research into computer organizational programs could make decision-making easier despite an increasing availability of big data, according to a presentation on Wednesday from Radcliffe fellow Shivani Agarwal.
Agarwal’s lecture, “Computers and Choice,” is part of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study’s 2015-2016 Fellows’ Presentation series on research occurring at the Institute.
The lecture addressed problems consumers encounter when processing vast amounts of data because of continued growth in technology and consumer products.
“When we make choices today, one of the things we constantly face is a deluge of data, a deluge of choices, and a deluge of options, and somehow we are to make good choices in the face of all this complexity,” Agarwal said.
The goal of Agarwal’s current research is to find a way to categorize data to simplify the decision-making process.
“We want to find a way to organize items into categories based on their similarities in terms of how the users perceive them to make their choices,” she said.
Agarwal bases her research on machine learning, a type of programming that enables computers to engage in a combination of computational and statistical learning. She said machine learning is necessary to process immense amounts of data.
“Data is available at scales that no human mind can process, and therefore we need machines to organize and analyze this data,” Agarwal said.
Agarwal currently uses machine learning to analyze the choices people make to find “hidden” categories that people associate with a certain group of items. This categorization has the potential to help consumers more easily find desired items as well as identify which items they dislike.
This type of categorization has already proven successful, Agarwal said. Howard Moskowitz used this method to introduce a new type of pasta sauce in the early 1980s, “extra chunky,” that earned the Prego company $600 million in revenue.
Machine learning also has applications across many fields of study, especially the life sciences, according to Agarwal.
Agarwal said she hopes her research can have a similar impact.
“The idea is that there’s a lot of choice... we need some way to organize these choices,” she said.

High school juniors across the country will sit down Saturday to a newly designed SAT test that the College Board has said will more closely reflect the knowledge and skills it believes are most indicative of a student’s success in college. The new test comes during a time of national discussion on the accessibility, predictive ability, and consequent future of standardized testing in the college admissions process.
Despite a growing shift towards test-optional admissions policies and decisions by peer institutions to no longer require the essay portion of either the SAT or the ACT, Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid continues to affirm the role of standardized tests and their essay portions as useful measures of knowledge and ability.
THE NEW TEST
Originally adapted from the World War I Army I.Q. Test in 1926, the Scholastic Aptitude Test has since undergone several redesigns, the most recent of which happened in 2005. The new test returns to the 1600 grading scale and features restructured sections—Reading, Writing and Language, and Math—that have fewer questions overall and more time allotted for each question. The essay portion is now optional and there is no longer a penalty for wrong answers on the multiple-choice portions of the SAT test.
The content of the test has changed dramatically as well. The College Board has placed emphasis on evidence-based questions and questions “grounded in real-world contexts” via the use of historical documents that relate to broader themes of history, social science, and the sciences.
The test will incorporate what the College Board calls documents of the “Great Global Conversation,” including not only prominent documents in American history, such as the Federalist Papers and the Bill of Rights, but also speeches and texts by global leaders and thinkers, including Nelson Mandela, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Mohandas Gandhi. Excerpts of these texts will be included in the essay portion as well as in the Reading and Writing and Language sections of the new exam.
The new exam also features a reworked essay component. The optional essay portion of the test is 50 minutes long instead of 25, and it will have the same prompt for every iteration of the test. A literary passage will be provided, and the student will be asked to write an essay explaining how the author of the text constructs a persuasive argument.
The changes to the SAT address concerns that the test does not adequately reflect high school curricula and that it can be gamed with memorized answers and pre-made formulas. Alyssa B. Frank, Director of the Schawbel College Resource Center at Boston Latin School, praised the test’s content changes.
“I get the sense from the conversations that I’ve had in the field of the College Board, that it’s going to be harder to game the new SAT... because it’s supposed to be more aligned with the things students are learning in the classroom,” she said in an interview last semester. “So it’s going to be less a measure of this abstract idea of intelligence and more a measure of critical thinking as it relates to math and writing.”
The other predominant standardized test, the ACT, has also recently changed its essay. Students are now asked to present their ideas on a current world issue in relation to three alternative provided perspectives. The new version was offered starting in September.
The changes to the SAT and ACT tests come during redesigns of the Common Application as well as during talks of a new college application tool, producing anxiety among high school students and their parents, Frank said.
“The fact that students have to adapt to this at the same time they’re dealing with constant changes to the common application—that’s a lot for students to handle.”
PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY
Despite the changes to the ACT essay and the upcoming changes to the SAT exam, Harvard’s peer institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Brown, and Columbia, have dropped the SAT and ACT essay requirements from their application processes. Harvard, however, will continue to require the essay scores and will conduct its own analysis of the predictive quality of the exams their essay components in relation to students’ academic performances at the College.
In an emailed last semester, Harvard College Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said the admissions committee will monitor the correlation of the new writing exam with students’ grades at Harvard for several years to better evaluate the relationship between the new writing test and students’ written work at Harvard.
“Because the previous writing test was one of many predictors of academic performance, we hope the new test may be helpful as well,” he said. “We also believe that it is very important for Harvard to take part in this experiment given the importance we place on writing.”
Speaking of the preparation of Harvard’s admissions committee for the new exam, Fitzsimmons said, “We are already making preparations to integrate the new SAT exam into our information systems. The College Board will provide a concordance table that will enable admission officers to equate the old and new tests.”
Anna Ivey, the former Dean of Admissions at the University of Chicago Law School and the founder of an admissions consulting company, suggested that the new test may complicate the admissions process for administrators since the content and structure of the exams are so apparently different.
“If you’re actually trying to track data over time and have meaningful conclusions, that’s hard to do when you’re not comparing apples to apples,” she said.
Parke P. Muth, a former admissions dean at the University of Virginia who now runs a college consulting business, noted that in situations in which admissions officers evaluate similar applicants, test scores may be determining factors even at test-optional schools.
Test-optional admissions policies and the new standardized tests, however, do offer students valuable choices in their college application processes, according to Ivey. “The benefit is that now students have more choice—they can decide to apply in a way that plays closer to their strengths.”
However, Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Daniel M. Koretz pointed out that test-optional admissions policies can be used more to the advantage of some colleges than to students. “It will help some schools in the US News and World Report rankings since obviously the stronger students, the ones with good scores, are the ones likely to submit their scores.”
Steven R. Goodman, a former member of the Undergraduate Admissions Advisory Committee at the University of Pennsylvania, also noted that even test-optional colleges are buying the lists offered by the College Board of the top scorers for recruiting and marketing purposes.
“What an incredible coincidence that these schools are going ahead and saying they’re test-optional and then buying the lists of the top scorers,” he said.
IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS
Despite changes in the SAT’s content and the College Board’s creation of a new test prep service with the online learning company Khan Academy in an effort to be more inclusive, experts still emphasized education and accessibility disparities.
Koretz classified test prep under two broad categories, one of which is a targeted approach to help students focus on their perceived areas of difficulty and the other which “capitalizes on the specific details of the test.” Of the latter kind, Koretz said, “What that kind of test prep does is undermine the value of scores…[producing] utterly fraudulent gains on the test.”
Khan Academy’s free test prep service, advertised on the College Board’s website, is available to anyone with access to a computer and claims to help students strengthen skills and deepen understandings of content through various learning aids.
Harvard’s Office of Admissions welcomed this new program, emphasizing its accessibility to a more diverse socioeconomic audience. “The College Board’s association with Khan Academy promises to provide additional support for students from all economic backgrounds who wish to prepare in advance for the new SAT,” Fitzsimmons said.
Connecting students with resources may still be a problem, though, Ivey said.
“I think that getting them on the radar of students who aren’t aware of those resources or who don’t come from background where parents are savvy about these resources is the challenging part,” she said.
Yet others, including Muth and Koretz, maintained that, while the new resources and the new SAT are positive changes, they will do little to address equity of access to higher education.
Muth explained that the new test and the newly available resources are not likely to make much difference in a student’s performance “if you don’t go to a great school and you haven’t had a lot of guidance before tenth grade.”
“The gap between wealthy and poor students is growing and quite rapidly and that shows up on test after test after test,” Koretz said. “So providing more equitable test prep for the SAT is not going to be enough to offset all that.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor specializing in higher education policy law at Stetson University, explained that redesigning standardized testing without redesigning other educational infrastructure does little to affect social change in higher education.
“The test might actually be testing us, and the feedback we may be getting is that we need to rethink how we are social engineering around higher education,” Lake said. “If all that higher ed is really doing is validating that top percentage... we’re creating social stratification.”
While standardized tests change and prep resources endeavor to adapt, arguments for and against standardized testing remain the same. It comes down to a question of equity.
“The idea of things like the SAT was to provide something that was basically identical for anyone who took it,” said Koretz. “So it got its impetus as a way of breaking the lock of the privileged whites on elite education, so it’s ironic that the argument against it is precisely the same.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard professors said they believe the Democratic and Republican nominees are likely finalized following Super Tuesday: former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and businessman Donald J. Trump.
Clinton won the Democratic primaries in seven states, topping Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’s four states. Among Clinton’s victories was Massachusetts, which exit polls predicted would be hotly contested. On the Republican side, Trump won seven states, including Massachusetts, while losing Alaska, Texas, and Oklahoma to Senator Ted Cruz and Minnesota to Senator Marco Rubio.
Super Tuesday's results are historically a strong indicator of the eventual presidential nominee for both parties. Harvard professors agree this year’s race is unlikely to be any different. 
“Barring some extraordinary revelation or action on the part of either Clinton or Trump, their road to the nomination is much, much easier,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson said. “This has been a campaign of surprises, so there could be a bombshell tomorrow, but barring such an event, just look at the delegate count.”
Harvard Students for Hillary were “pleasantly surprised” by the results across all the states that voted on Tuesday and optimistic about the campaign, the group’s outreach captain Michael K. Kikukawa ’17 said.
“I think Super Tuesday spells well for the rest of the nomination,” he said. “I don’t want to say it’s in the bag for her yet, because I don’t think it is. It will be a fight for the next few weeks or so for both sides to amass enough delegates to say they are the nominee.”
According to Massachusetts voting results, Clinton did better in the Cambridge area compared to her overall results in the state, which Kikukawa said  could be thanks to some of the work Harvard Students for Hillary have put into Clinton’s campaign, such as canvassing and phone-banking.
Still,  Harvard Students for Bernie President He Li ’16 is still optimistic about the future of the senator’s campaign.
“[Sanders] definitely held up in the states we thought he had a good shot in. Obviously we wish he would’ve done a little better in the states he lost,” Li said.
Li said the student group will continue to phone-bank in upcoming states and may organize a canvassing trip up to Maine ahead of its caucuses.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53 said Tuesday’s results were in line with his predictions.
“I thought that Hillary Clinton had the best chance, and that the Democrats would put an end to their flirtation with Bernie Sanders,” he said.
On the Republican side, Tuesday was especially successful for Trump, who further solidified his popularity among constituents.
“Super Tuesday showed that his coalition has a deep and broad base of support,” Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, a government lecturer who teaches Government 1359: “The Road to the White House,” said.
Super Tuesday did not bode well for some undergraduate Republicans who reject Trump. Rubio, a Harvard Republican favorite, won only one state, Minnesota. Nonetheless, Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, national co-chair of Students for Rubio, said he is optimistic about the results.
“If you look at the polls going in, we outperformed in nearly every single state. I think the only state we didn’t was in Texas, and of course congratulations to Cruz on that win,” Khansarinia said.
In order to challenge Trump’s popularity, Patterson said Cruz or Rubio would have to drop out of the race.
“They really need a two person race to have a shot, but they’re both still standing,” he said.
Overall, many students and professors agreed that Tuesday was primarily a big night for Trump.
“I think Super Tuesday meant looming disaster with the nomination of Trump for the presidency,” Mansfield said. “It gives me the shivers to think of Trump as our president.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eliot House residents who were dismayed by a broken gender-neutral bathroom sign in the House on Wednesday characterized the act as sexist and offensive to students who identify as transgender.
On Wednesday evening, Kara Lessin ’16, an Eliot House resident, posted an image to Facebook of a damaged bathroom sign that had hung on one of the House’s gender-neutral bathrooms. The partially torn down sign, located opposite the Eliot dining hall, revealed the word “men” painted in black underneath.
After Lessin posted the image on Facebook, along with a message that characterized the damage to the sign as an instance of “transphobia,” several Eliot residents expressed frustration with the broken sign.
Many details about the event remain unclear; Eliot House Faculty Dean Doug Melton said he was unaware of the incident  until Wednesday night. 
In an email sent  to Eliot residents, Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail O’Keefe wrote administrators “are investigating, and can't possibly know the motivation for the vandalism.”
“[T]his kind of vandalism and behavior will not be tolerated,” she added.
Over House email lists, Eliot undergraduates criticized what they called vandalism, arguing that students of all genders should feel comfortable in the gender-neutral bathrooms.
“There are so many students who don’t feel comfortable in gendered bathrooms, who either don’t feel comfortable themselves or with what other people might think,” Lessin said.
Olivia Campbell ’17, an Eliot House resident, said she was disappointed that the sign had been broken because the bathrooms were free for everyone to use.
“It just seems really rude and disrespectful, especially since we live in a community where everyone is really sensitive about how other people define their gender,” Campbell said.
Powell Eddins ’16 said the bathrooms promoted gender inclusivity on campus, particularly for students who do not feel comfortable in single-gender spaces.
“Gender-neutral bathrooms should not be forced upon anybody but I don’t believe single-gender bathrooms should be forced upon anyone either,” Eddins said.
By Wednesday evening, the broken sign was covered with a makeshift page that read “Gender Neutral (for everyone)” in colorful text.
Harvard’s 12 Houses have increasingly designated gender-neutral bathrooms in recent years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former students and colleagues remembered Philip A. Kuhn ’54, once  director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies and professor of History and East Asian Languages, for his contributions to Chinese studies and mentorship of graduate students.
Kuhn passed away earlier this month at the age of 82.
After teaching at the University of Chicago for 15 years, Professor Kuhn came to Harvard in 1978 to fill a teaching post for modern Chinese History after John K. Fairbank ’29, founder of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard, retired. Kuhn served as the Director of the Fairbank Center for six years from 1980 to 1986 and previously chaired the East Asian Languages and Civilizations department.
Current professors and former students remembered Kuhn specifically for his pioneering work in the field of Chinese history studies.
“He moved Chinese history at Harvard in fascinating new directions,” said Michael A. Szonyi, current director of the Fairbank Center.
Szonyi pointed to Kuhn’s leading role in using the historical archives of China, which were not widely available to foreign scholars until the 1970s and 1980s.  Kuhn formed friendships with Chinese scholars, thus introducing “a whole generation... to the Chinese intellectual world through Philip,” Szonyi said.
William C. Kirby, former director of the Fairbank Center and student of Kuhn, said Kuhn’s graciousness towards Chinese delegations in the 1980s also helped with Harvard-China relations.
Matthew W. Mosca, a former graduate student of Kuhn's and current assistant professor at the University of Washington, said Kuhn’s scholarship was especially well-crafted.
“He took intimate amount of pain and care with his published research,” Mosca said.
One of Kuhn’s books, “Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768,” was widely-read in mainland China when a translation became available in 1999.
“His work really hasn’t aged in life. I think people will continue to read it for many decades to come,” Mosca said.
To students and colleagues who read his work, Kuhn was an exemplary scholar who openly shared research experience and mentored graduate students.
“I still remember reading ‘Rebellion and Its Enemies,’ his book on China, when I was an undergrad student,” Szonyi said.
Prasenjit Duara, a former graduate student of  Kuhn's  and professor emeritus of history and East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Chicago, said Kuhn was a generous mentor and described the extra time he spent teaching Chinese even during the summer.
“I will remember him first and foremost as a mentor who really helped me understand what it was to become a professional historian in every sense of the word,” Duara said. “I will remember him as a person of professional and moral integrity.”
Kuhn’s personal character also left a lasting impact. Both Szonyi and Kirby attested to Kuhn’s “wicked” and “extraordinary” sense of  humor and his affinity for word puns.
Friends and family will host a memorial service for Kuhn on April 8 in Memorial Church, Szonyi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into its first race of the spring, the Sharpe Trophy Team Race in Providence, R.I. on Saturday, the Harvard sailing team looks to build off its No. 6 ranking in the co-ed division of Sailing World’s College Rankings last fall and set the tone for the new semester.
Transitioning to team racing events for the early portion of the season, the Crimson must begin to become more of a unit.
While the subtleties of the sport do not alter an extreme amount from season to season, team racing requires a shift in a squad’s mindset compared to what it was in the fall. Individual racers must think more in terms of group tactics and dynamics than they had previously.
“We’re taking the same attitude, but [we] have been applying it differently because team racing is more complicated than fleet racing,” junior crew Zoe Kessler said. “It’s the same skills, but in a quicker, more advanced setting…. [It’s] much more about strategy and working together with the other boats on your team.”
In recent years, Harvard has been led by its youth.  But looking at the composition of this year’s squad, most of the Crimson’s contributors have been sailing for the team for quite some time. As a result, heading into the team component of the season, the amount of time the group has practiced and raced together should only help its cohesion and fluidity of movement on the water.
“When I got here as a freshman, most of the team was really young,” junior skipper Juan Carlos Perdomo said. “Most of the starters were sophomores or juniors, and I think that group has developed a lot since then…. We all have a lot of experience and have spent a lot of time sailing together, so I think that we can try to do better at nationals than we have ever done in the past.”
The Crimson will likely be led by the stalwarts of previous seasons, spearheaded by a deep class of seniors in Andrew Mollerus, Jacob Bradt, Marek Zaleski, and Sydney Karnovsky. Having been integral members of the squad for three and a half years, this group will look to polish off their respective Harvard careers with strong performances throughout the spring.
“I’m excited to see what the seniors do,” Kessler said. “I would say that we have quite a few exceptional seniors, and [this] being their last semester, I’m sure they’ll be extremely motivated to do great. At the same time, [we’ll see] how the juniors develop, knowing next year they’ll be the oldest ones—the top leaders.”
Although the older team members have the edge in experience, Harvard’s rookies and walk-ons are not to be forgotten.  Freshmen Nicholas DiGiovanni, Christine Gosioco, Nicholas Karnovsky, Andrew Puopolo, Alejandra Resendiz, and Jackson Wagner all posted promising results in the fall in their first action for the Crimson.
From top to bottom, the squad appears primed to set out on the right path.
“I think that there’s a lot of promise in the freshmen this year,” Perdomo said. “Not only the recruited freshman that have had a lot of sailing experience beforehand, but also the new walk-ons, especially in terms of crews. So I definitely see them performing well and making an impact their first year on the team.”
The unseasonably warm weather in Cambridge this winter has only helped the group, as it was able to get in practice sessions on the water weeks earlier than in years past. Additionally, the lack of ice floes on the Charles in March can only bode well for the sailors headed into the season, as their preparation, especially that of the younger members of the team, will be much more comprehensive.
“Thankfully the river has thawed out earlier this year because last year and the year before we didn’t even get to practice until after spring break in Boston,” Perdomo said. “If we did, it was very limited practice. So we’re excited to get back to regular practice schedules and get more time on the water.”
While the extra sessions early in the season serve as invaluable aid, the team believes that the racing experience it has gotten through national competitions and their qualifiers over the past year will provide even more of a boost in terms of performance.
“Having done pretty well at singlehanded nationals—and last year we qualified for fleet racing nationals—now that we’re starting team racing, I think that the experience we had at the qualifiers and at the events themselves provided valuable lessons that we’ll use this semester,” Perdomo said. “So I think we’ll learn off our mistakes and experiences from years past.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its Friday loss to Yale, the Harvard men’s basketball team clinched something it hadn’t in half a decade—a losing record and a likely ticket home for the postseason. A team that has alternatingly under- and overachieved fittingly enters the final weekend with a decent shot at finishing the season fourth in the conference: exactly where it was predicted preseason.
In the ensuing power vacuum, the Crimson—winners of five straight league titles—has watched its better-dressed, poorly educated cousins fill the void. To be clear, the Princeton and Yale programs would bristle at any notion they are Harvard’s little brothers; Yale has taken out the Crimson in four of the past seven meetings, while Princeton was within a couple games of sharing the first three of those rings. Yet, while neither has dropped out of the league’s top half since 2011, they haven’t capitalized on their chances to take the throne.
This year has been a vastly different story. Entering the season’s final weekend, the statistics detailing what the Tigers and Bulldogs have done are nothing short of absurd. Since January 1, their only losses are to each other. The duo is 19-0 against the rest of the league, outscoring opponents by 15 points a game. The rest of the league has combined for one 20-point win against Ivy opposition: Yale and Princeton have seven.
This level of dominance is almost unprecedented in the Ancient Eight. If the season ended now, both would be among the best 10 league champions (by point differential) since 1970.
And if the season ended today, both should be going dancing.
Yes, there are still games to be played. On Friday, Yale travels to Columbia—a nifty 9-0 against the non-YP parts of the League, but the Lions are like Marco Rubio when it matters most: sweaty, flailing, and falling vastly short of expectations. Princeton comes to Lavietes that same night, but with Harvard starting point guard Tommy McCarthy’s status in doubt, it’s hard to see an upset there.
Cross those barriers—as well as Princeton-Penn next Wednesday—and we will most likely arrive at a one-game playoff between two teams among the nation’s top 50, per KenPom. Since 2012, how many of those have been left out of the tournament? Only about 10 percent. Some statistical models that project the NCAA tournament have both teams in the fold, with the playoff loser hovering around the last at-large spot.
Of course, Princeton and Yale have to deal with this tricky issue of committee bias. It’s been systematically documented how the committee’s primary methods of evaluation (top-50 wins, RPI, etc.) favor teams from bigger conferences. Take Princeton. Since the second week of December, the Tigers have three losses—all to top-60 KenPom teams. The commonality: all those losses came on the road or at a neutral site.
This isn’t a surprising trend: over the past five years, Harvard has played nonconference games on the road against Colorado, Memphis, Kansas, Providence, Virginia, and UConn. Think any of those teams—all of whom, save Virginia, won by 12 or less—would come to Lavietes, where Harvard at one point won 63 of 69 straight games?
With the growth of statistics, we’ve come up with better ways to measure talent. We can tell you honestly that this a road win over Valparaiso is more impressive this year than a home one over Syracuse. We can look at a team like 2014 Kentucky, which had 10 losses entering the tournament, and note that the difference between it and first-seeded Wichita State was more like the difference between a two and a four seed than a one and an eight.
Not that everyone has realized this. ESPN’s personal walking, talking Joseph A. Bank mascot, Joe Lunardi, has Yale as a 13th seed in his tournament prediction. Providence, ranked behind both the Tigers and the Bulldogs in KenPom’s rankings, is a 10. St. Bonaventure, second in line to enter Lunardi’s bracket if someone drops, is a full 15 spots behind Princeton and nearly 20 behind Yale.
There’s a complicated upside to the inequity: it drastically raises the stakes for the season’s final stretch run. Yale’s senior class, headlined by Justin Sears, Nick Victor, and Brandon Sherrod—is looking to end a 54-year conference title drought. Bulldogs coach James Jones is the longest-tenured NCAA Division I coach not to make the Big Dance, and if he can’t do it this year—with Harvard down, Penn’s ascent nascent, and Sears and Sherrod giving him the league’s best frontcourt—when will he?
Down in Princeton, the story is fairly similar. Juniors Henry Caruso, Steven Cook, and Spencer Weisz were seniors in high school when Ian Hummer and the rest of the 2013 Tiger team crumbled down the stretch. Princeton hasn’t played meaningful games in March since. Yet, freshman Devin Cannady gives them the most dynamic bench weapon in the league, and the Rockets might be proud of how ruthlessly efficient this team is.
In just over a week, one team will see its dreams shattered. This leaves me conflicted: I’d like nothing better than to see both get their hopes crushed, but when the tournament starts, I will find it hard to argue they shouldn’t both be there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball’s Rhianna Rich earned the honor of Ivy League Rookie of the Week, as well as The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week, for her outstanding performance at the JU Green and Gold Classic last weekend.  With a batting average of .563 and four RBIs over a four-game stretch, the freshman infielder helped the Crimson to a 3-1 record to start off its spring season. Along with Rich’s success, three other Harvard athletes had impressive performances this week:
AnnMarie Healy, Women’s Basketball
This senior forward helped the Crimson (14-11, 9-3 Ivy) to back-to-back victories over Yale and Brown this week by scores of 65-63 and 92-79, respectively.  In addition to putting 21 points on the board—her 24th time scoring in double-digits this season—against the Bulldogs, Healy clinched the victory, sinking the game-winner off her own rebound at the buzzer.
Shilpa Tummala, Women’s Basketball
Further demonstrating strong senior leadership on the team, Shilpa Tummala also helped Harvard secure victories over Yale and Brown this week.  Tummala scored a career-high 24 points against the Bears to go along with 12 assists—her fourth double-double this season.
Riding a six-game winning streak, Tumalla and the rest of the Crimson squad will look to extend the run into this weekend, where Harvard will play its last two games of the season against Princeton and Penn, who both sit 10-1 in conference play.
Devin Dwyer, Men’s Lacrosse
Senior attackman Devin Dwyer capped off his second consecutive seven-point game with an overtime game-winner on Saturday, lifting Harvard (3-0) to a 10-9 victory against UMass.  Dwyer’s final score—his fifth of the game—came just 10 seconds into overtime and was assisted by sophomore Morgan Cheek.  The Garden City, N.Y., native will look to help the Crimson maintain its perfect record in its upcoming matchup against Duke this Saturday.

As Harvard students, we’re expected to have a very sophisticated taste in literature. Unfortunately, Expos doesn’t give us much in terms of quality reading, unless watching Mean Girls to procrastinate counts as educational. To convince your family and friends that you’re actually learning at this premier academic institution, (or just to impress strangers with your intellect), here are some books that you’ll enjoy reading and can talk about in front of your grandparents—sorry, that means 50 Shades is out.
Leo Tolstoy’s Anna KareninaLove, sex, and drama—such is life as a college student, although these characters don't spend all of their disposable income on beer and burritos. Combine it with poignant, heart-wrenching portrayals of adultery and, of course, more sex, and you've got yourself a winner. What more could you want in an 800-something page epic?
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s This Side of ParadiseAnd you thought I was going to list Gatsby. Having more than one Fitzgerald novel under your belt will be sure to impress those esteemed people you network with. Better yet, This Side of Paradise is about the sad life of a Princeton student. Clearly, Harvard has more fun. Of course, everything is relative.
Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to ArmsAnything by Hemingway is quick to read, thanks to his no-frills style. Add some cynicism rivaling that even even the most sleep-deprived thesising senior, some war-stricken characters, and a doomed love, and you’ve got a novel that’s sure to spark intense conversation at any cocktail party.
Greg Mankiw’s Principles of Economics, 9th ed.A classic for the ages, not to mention all of the information a Harvard student needs to apply for a job on Wall Street. It isn’t love, sex, or drama, but it’s supply and demand graphs (and more), which are pretty hot in their own right.
So there you have it. Read these five books (or just display them prominently while out in public) and no one will question your intelligence ever again.
