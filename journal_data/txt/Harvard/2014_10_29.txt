After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we were roommates in college, Sarah used to wake earlier than I did, and I remembered many mornings squinting sleepy-eyed at her while she dressed, sun from the dorm room window tracing the curve of her waist with diffused light. I used to watch the girls I brought back for the night like this too, but sunshine never quite cloaked them right, their movements too jerky, their faces angled with embarrassment. The window in the motel room wasn’t directly behind Sarah, but still the light from the open bathroom door drew an orange outline around her elbow as she gathered up her hair and said, “Let’s go.”
Highway, again. Lake Michigan passed without a word. Illinois startled us with its abruptness, the exits falling back to low numbers. The radio stations Sarah put on spiraled into static every half hour, and sometime between the end of one song and the beginning of another, I fell asleep. When I awoke, my head was fuzzy and my mouth dry. I reached for the water bottle in the cup holder only to startle at its lighter than expected weight.
“I drank it all,” Sarah said.
I pressed my tongue against the roof of my mouth, trying to gather moisture. I had no conception of how far we’d driven since I’d fallen—the outside to me looked the same as Indiana, the same as Ohio and Pennsylvania, green and bright. I swallowed and cleared my throat at the same time Sarah said, “Rachel,” then stopped, the beginnings of a rising cadence in her voice.
“Sorry, I was just clearing my throat.”
She nodded and glanced at the side mirror.
“What did you want to say?”
She nodded again. And again. She took a hand off the steering wheel to smooth hair behind her ear and kept it there, pinky across her dimple, index finger behind her ear. “I wanted to ask,” she said, “if you remembered that time we almost went to France.”
Isaac had been four then, and it was the first vacation Sarah and Jake would’ve taken since his birth. They’d been planning for months, explaining to Isaac the situation daily, trying to wean him off their attention, her attention. The day had come and they’d dropped him off at Sarah’s father’s house—they’d given him my contact information just in case. It’d only be for five days, they’d reminded Isaac and his grandfather, and later Sarah told me that when they’d driven off, Isaac’s face had been blank as his grandfather squatted down, trying to encourage him to wave goodbye. He wouldn’t. Then Sarah had turned around in her seat and smiled at Jake, taken his hand.
They never made it to France. Sarah’s father had called in a panic after they arrived at the airport, a high wail behind his words. Isaac was inconsolable, he’d told them. Uncontrollable. He was screaming and wouldn’t stop. He was breaking things. Please come back.
“For a long time after that,” Sarah was saying now, shifting her hand so it moved back and forth across her neck, “I kept a photo of the entrance to Sainte-Chapelle in a book beside my bed. Sometimes I’d take it out and look at it, pretending I was reading.”
“Did you want to go that badly?” The edges to my question sounded brittle, even to me. “You told me afterward that you should’ve known better.”
She waved a hand. “It was fine. I’ll go to Paris someday.” The last word breathlessly, like a stone had dropped, small and heavy, into her stomach.
“I looked at that photo for so long and so often,” she continued after a loud inhale. “It was a picture of the steps up to the cathedral specifically, grooved by hundreds of years of feet.”
The armrest caved under my fingers, the tendons in my wrist standing white against skin. I ran my tongue around my teeth, dry like an apple picked too soon.
Sarah was saying, “I kept thinking about the millions—the billions of repeated actions it must’ve taken for the stone to wear smooth like that. The steps slanted down on both sides like a bowl. I thought, just keep rubbing and rubbing and even stone, something like that, can get worn into a depression. You know?”
The highway forked here into a path for cars only and a path for cars and trucks. Sarah merged into the former, and my thigh pressed into the door as we veered left. The leather sucked off my skin, a wet sound that intersected with the threads of static and half-sung lyrics still playing. I could feel Sarah like a smell. The car, the outside grew unimportant—the white lines inside which we stayed, the metal frame that hurtled our lives at 70 mph, the distance that separated her mother and us and Jake—my whole body and mind were so attuned to Sarah’s emotions I could no longer distinguish them from my own. It was my breath that gave way, my pulse clapping loud in my ears, my shoulders that folded like paper too often used when Sarah said, “I’m so relieved, Rachel, that he’s dead.”

Earlier this year, Barneys New York unveiled "Brothers, Sisters, Sons & Daughters," its Spring 2014 campaign, which featured relatively well-known names like Ines Rau and Valentijn de Hingh, alongside a smattering of newcomers. The 17 models shot for the campaign looked in large part as you'd expect for a high-end fashion campaign: slender, elegant, beautifully clothed creatures draped languorously against fences or over furniture. But the men and women of "Brothers, Sisters, Sons & Daughters" differ in one small way from your typical model—they are all transgender.
In reality, the fashion world has played unwitting host to a number of transgender models over the years, beginning in the 1960s with April Ashley, a British woman who enjoyed a fruitful modeling career, appearing in illustrious publications like Vogue before tabloids revealed that she had been born a man. Others followed in her footsteps: Caroline "Tula" Cossey, Lauren Foster, and, more recently in 2003, Barbara Diop—all of whom were featured in Vogue before being outed, invariably leading to the decline of their careers in the face of backlash from the media and the public.
Consequently, transgender models have been understandably hesitant to reveal their birth sex: Philippines-born model Geena Rocero spent 12 years as a successful female model before coming out as transgender in April of this year. Is her willingness to come forward, alongside the growing popularity of models like Ines Rau, Isis King, and Lea T, a sign that progress is being made? Sure—but maybe not in the way we'd like. To understand why these women’s movement into the public eye is not necessarily an encouraging sign, we must first turn to a similar but separate phenomenon that has been advancing parallel to that of transgender modeling: the rise of the androgynous model.
Unlike Rau, King, and Lea T, the men and women at the forefront of the androgyny movement do not undergo surgery to reassign their sex and are, for the most part, cisgender—they simply pose (with startling convincingness) as the opposite sex and model clothing designed for that sex. For example, in 2012 Casey Legler became the first woman contracted to model only menswear, while Stav Strashko appears on the women's board at his agency, One Management. These models book shows for enormously high-profile brands: female model Saskia de Brauw, for instance, is a runway regular for the Givenchy menswear shows, while the model formerly known as Andrej Pejic worked as an androgynous male model but walked regularly for the Jean Paul Gaultier womenswear shows. Indeed, the fashion industry has embraced these cross-dressing models and thinks itself terribly edgy for doing so, with Pejic's reputation growing so quickly in fall 2011 that, according to New York Magazine, agencies scrambled to fill the sudden demand for slender, pretty boys who could squeeze into women's clothes.
Despite enormous popularity, Pejic retreated from the spotlight after several years but returned early this year—as Andreja, having undergone sex reassignment surgery to begin living as a woman. In an interview with the New York Times this September, she recalled, "There are agents that would tell me: 'Don't ever do it. Don't transition. You'll lose everything.'" Pejic's words at first seem to make little sense; after all, nothing has changed in terms of her appearance. She passes without question for a woman, as she did before the surgery, possessed of the same long blonde hair, full lips, and delicate bone structure that she has had since her runway debut.
But the context has changed. She is no longer an androgynous model, and audiences no longer feel that the beautiful, feminine person they see before them is an oddity, a curiosity, a man in a dress. At the end of the day, it is this fascination with the “odd” that sits at the heart of the prevalence of androgynous models on the runway: they symbolize edginess, rebellion, a little bit of freakishness. It is cool, and more importantly, profitable, to use androgynous models, and this economically driven mindset serves in many ways as a foreshadowing of what lies in store as androgynous models become normalized by their move into the mainstream and transgender models fill the niche they once occupied.
"Everyone wanted to meet me in those days [after my outing], darling, because, you see, I was the freak," said April Ashley in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald in 2005. For all the advances in the 50 years since Ashley's prime in how transgender models are received by the industry, that much, it seems, has not changed. The popularity of androgyny has not opened the door to transgender acceptance; rather, it has paved the way for transgender commercialization by creating a market for the “odd.” It is 2014, and transgender models are no more than this fall’s latest trend: new toys to be objectified, fetishized, ogled with incredulity that these men and women would have the audacity to bare their transgender bodies for all the world to see.

An image of armored police officers during the August riots in Ferguson, Missouri, sets the story of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club's production of “Mother Courage and Her Children," which runs from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 at Farkas Hall. The play’s promotional poster gives a small glimpse of the conflict that underlies the plot: smoke-filled darkness is pierced by the flashlight of a police officer’s assault rifle, illuminating the few dozen other officers around him.
Written by Bertolt Brecht in 1939, just as Hitler was invading Poland, the play tells the story of Mother Courage, a mother who tries to keep her business alive and her family together during the Thirty Years’ War. Director Alistair A. Debling ’16 initially planned to stage the play to evoke the setting of Wall Street, but in light of recent events (Ukraine, the Middle East, and Ferguson), it’s taken a different turn.“There’s a line in the play, ‘The world is dying,’” Debling says. “That kind of feeling that everything’s falling apart and heading towards catastrophe is particularly present [today].”
The production will be unique in that Debling composed a score for the play. The play is not a musical, but simply features original music. “The characters might sing songs that they remember from childhood…but the plot isn’t being advanced by the music,” co-producer Sarah K. Rosenburg ’16 says. “None of the music is scored…so every production will have a different score, and Alistair has composed new melodies [for the show].”
The music also gives the play a more modern atmosphere. “[There will be] some live music and guitar stuff, and a lot of synthesized music, so it’s a pretty modern sound. There are actually some club beats involved from time to time, so it’s really fun,” Rosenburg says.
The casting of the production is also unconventional. The actress playing Mother Courage is not a student at Harvard or any other college. Margaret A. Nyland is an attorney turned full-time actress from Charleston, South Carolina. Like Mother Courage, she’s also a mother of three. She says that her age, more than being a mother, has helped her in her role. “To be this tough, or at times this cynical, or this strong—some of that just requires some years to really portray.”
The production’s unconventional elements have made for a rewarding experience for those involved. “So many moving parts have come together, and it’s really interesting to watch how they have interacted with each other in interesting ways,” Rosenburg says. “Pulling everything together has been a really fun experience.”

“Think about yourself and think about the ideal romantic relationship, the ideal friendships that you have,” director Cole V. Edick ’17 says of “Dogfight.” This production, which will run from Oct. 31 to Nov. 8 at the Loeb Experimental Theater, centers around U.S. Marine Corps officers on the eve of their deployment to Vietnam in 1963, their brother-like bond, and the girls who begin to threaten that close friendship.
“They’re really pumped to be getting out to war—being U.S. marines, being brothers,” producer Julius G. Bright Ross ’17 says. “It’s kind of an ominous foreshadowing of what’s to come.”
In Marine Corps tradition, before the “three Bs”—officers Eddie Birdlace (Derek P. Speedy ’18), Bernstein (Geoffrey G. Binney III ’17), and Boland (Christian Potterton)—ship out, they throw a party called The Dogfight. “The whole premise is they put in 70 bucks each and try to bring the ugliest date to the party,” Ross says. “And the guy who brings the ugliest date wins the whole pot of money.”
While this aspect of the plot may seem superficial, the show does delve into weightier topics including war, brotherhood, and true love. “I heard a different show described as a ‘feel-everything’ musical, and I think ‘Dogfight’ really is that,” music director Isaac L. Alter ’16  says of the production. “There are really fun, high-energy moments; there are some really heart-wrenching moments, and I think the music has all of those [elements].”
“Dogfight” is not your traditional Broadway or even off-Broadway-style-production. The play is as contemporary as it gets, Edick says. He notes, for example, that in “First Date / Last Night”—a duet between leading lady Rose Fenny (Taylor K. Phillips ’15) and Eddie—the two talk about their relationship rather than pour out their feelings through song. “It’s not very singsong-y, and people don’t go out and sing a ballad,” Edick says.
The music has been challenging the cast to reach new heights, according to Alter. “It’s cool when you hear a cast member sing a song—when they finally get the notes—but it’s even cooler when you get it to the point where you’ve created something that’s like knock-your-socks-off good,” Alter says. “Also [viewers] should know that there are no actual dogs fighting in the show. Don’t worry, it’s not what it sounds like.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first email I received about Ebola came several weeks ago from a friend. She lives in the Midwest and has not traveled since her first child was born over 10 years ago. The next email arrived after two American doctors were evacuated from Liberia to obtain treatment in the U.S. “Dr. Lisa, why won't Americans give the cure for Ebola to Africans?” it asked. I’ve since received an abundance of email with questions about Ebola asking about everything from simple symptoms to conspiracy theories. All this confirmed my suspicion the health messaging about Ebola has somehow gone terribly wrong—and I’d like to set things straight.
First, Thomas Duncan, the first person to test positive for Ebola in the United States, most likely died because he was diagnosed late—not any conspiracy. Those Americans who have survived were diagnosed much earlier than Duncan was. We will likely never know, as some have suggested, if his race contributed to this late diagnosis. What I know for sure is that when Duncan arrived at a Dallas emergency room, Ebola had never been diagnosed in a U.S. health care institution. Healthcare providers are not infallible, and diagnosing rare and unusual conditions like Ebola requires great communication between a patient and healthcare provider. Without this the diagnosis can be nearly impossible .
Second, there is no cure for Ebola stashed away, as some of the conspiratorially-minded have suggested. The doctors who were evacuated to the U.S. and treated survived, not because the U.S. has a cure, but because the disease was caught early and treated with  standard medical equipment and care.
My initial concern, instead, about evacuating American doctors when Africans are dying by the thousands was related to the global optics. What message would we send the world by evacuating Americans amidst such a crisis? Despite the tragedy unfolding in West Africa, for days, the media focused almost exclusively on the two Americans. We didn’t hear much about Africans who survived Ebola infection.
Third, Ebola is only transmitted through bodily fluids. Despite this fact, much skepticism and disbelief remain—some have implemented unprecedented and extraordinary measures to prevent Ebola infection. Earlier this month, school administrators closed schools due to fears of Ebola transmission and a woman reportedly chose to fly in a homemade hazmat suit to avoid Ebola infection. One of my acquaintances phoned and told me he was cancelling his travel because he didn't want to fly until the Ebola epidemic is controlled. These actions, which are unfounded and unnecessary, only incite further hysteria about Ebola transmission.
To contract the virus, a person must somehow touch the bodily fluids of a person infected with Ebola and then transfer the virus to some part of the body where it can gain entry through a cut or membrane. But this can only happen if a person has been exposed to someone symptomatic with Ebola, which is obviously not the case for nearly all Americans.
But also concerning in the American people’s reaction to the virus has been the kneejerk response of politicians and pundits to fault the CDC for healthcare lapses at independent healthcare institutions. The CDC has no authority over medical institutions or over state and local health officials. The CDC produces public health guidelines and policies but by law has no authority to enforce these guidelines and policies at state and local levels. The CDC must first be invited into a state to lead a public health investigation.
At times, health crises may brew for weeks before a state decides to invite CDC experts to weigh in on the public health issue. Given this, the accusations about the CDC’s failure to prevent the infections in Dallas are unfair. As awareness increases about the CDC’s true power, a conversation has begun about the need to expand it limits of authority. In the meantime, the CDC continues to provide a wealth of information and guidance about Ebola. If there were ever a time to defer to the wisdom and science from the nation's premier public health institution, it's now.
Health messaging about Ebola can be confusing. Its mysterious, the symptoms are common and the mortality is in West Africa is frighteningly high. This combination can understandably lead to anxiety and fear. However, I hope we can all pause, take a collective, national sigh, and continue to rely on the facts. Yes, Ebola can be scary but it is by no means among our greatest national infectious diseases health threats. Carry on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A cadre of juniors and seniors rigorously preparing for on-campus interviews with a handful of select finance and consulting firms has become as ingrained at Harvard as Primal Scream or Annenberg hot breakfast. But beginning next month, organized on-campus recruiting will expand its scope to students who seek careers in public service. What has become a valuable asset for companies like Bain Capital and McKinsey & Company to tap into Harvard student talent may now similarly serve organizations like Ashoka, Pencils of Promise, and the Tobin Project.
It is exciting to see the Institute of Politics, the Center for Public Interest Careers, and the Office of Career Services team up to provide this opportunity for students. Given the large number of graduating seniors interested in pursuing public service careers, any sort of structural help is welcomed. This program will especially help in cases where students choose to join the private sector because they do not feel as though the process towards joining public service organizations is easily accessible. It is troubling that the fields that both require new talent the most and have a large pool of interested students often fail to hire graduates because of logistical barriers.
The new initiative will emulate consulting and finance recruiting in several key ways. Seniors will have to submit a letter indicating their “commitment to public service,” a resume, and a list of their top five participating organizations as part of the application for the event. This mix of availability and prestige will hopefully, as Amy Howell, director of the IOP's Office of Career and Internship Services said, make Harvard “the first place that” public services organizations look to hire.
The IOP, CPIC, and OCS also deserve special praise, as this may be the first initiative of its kind in the nation. Especially as Harvard's peer institutions are considering further integrating public service with the actual academic requirements of their universities, the public service recruitment initiative strikes a proper balance between showing an increased dedication to public service without mandating that students participate. Programs like this one may help reverse a trend of underemployment of Harvard students in the public service sector.
There are 20 participating organizations this year, and it would be fantastic to see this recruitment process expand both in the number of employers and recruitment fairs on campus with similar purposes in the coming years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, a 19-year-old sophomore at Rutgers University named Caitlyn Kovacs was taken from a fraternity party to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead due to alcohol poisoning. I knew Caitlyn—at least enough for her story to be constantly in the back of my mind. For the few weeks since her death, I’ve recalled the scattered encounters I’ve had with her: our grade school English class, my trips to the local Rita’s where she worked during the summer, her warm smile and wave when she passed my locker, 203D, to get to hers, 217D.
I’ve stopped myself from writing about Caitlyn for a few weeks, and I do so now at the risk of memorializing her as a victim rather than as a girl with whom I shared these memories, a girl more meaningful than the cause of her death. But as much as Caitlyn should be remembered as an animal-lover who spent her weekends finding homes for stray cats or as a budding social entrepreneur poised to start a pet adoption agency after college, she should also be remembered as a girl who fell prey to a perverted frat-party culture that dominates collegiate social life.
For brothers and guests alike, heavy drinking is pivotal to the fraternity experience. 79% of college students, according to a survey sponsored by the Century Council, identify drinking as a central part of fraternity social life. Those who choose to join fraternities, apparently do so with this characterization of fraternity life in mind: 88% of Greek-involved students identify drinking as central to fraternity social life. Perhaps most tellingly, a study conducted by professors from Virginia Tech reveals that students who attend fraternity parties consume alcohol significantly more heavily than those who drink elsewhere. Service, brotherhood, and any other positives with which fraternities furnish the world often pale in comparison to what statistics show dominates the frat ethos: alcohol. Lots of it. Served to people they don’t know. In red solo cups that they keep drinking from because this is a frat party and everyone is going hard.
It is unwise to ignore the million other venues other than the beer-caked halls of America’s frat houses where students can and do binge drink. But it is equally unwise to claim tragedies like Caitlyn’s could have happened anywhere. The image of the beer-bellied frat-boy in a crassly captioned tank and neon wayfarers, chugging his 10th drink to the chorus of some combination of animal sounds and expletives—regardless of the truth behind it—characterizes frat-party culture to the literally uninitiated. The effect of this is an expectation among partygoers to engage in this contrived culture of the frat party, to accept the drink Mr. Crassly Captioned Tank just handed you even though he doesn’t know you, to party to drink instead of drinking to party.
Whereas Harvard’s social scene is not dominated by frat parties, final clubs provide all the fratty elements that contribute to this culture, disguised under the pretense of sophistication: Invitees are generally girls who members do not know, many of whom are younger and less versed in alcohol consumption; the open bar is indeed very open; parties happen in clubhouses on property not owned by the University.
If we are to continue to live in a collegiate social scene ideologically centered around the frat—or in the case of Harvard, the final club—party, then fraternities need to bear responsibility for creating an environment for their events that prevents unsafe drinking. Much of this can be done institutionally: greater alumni and university involvement, serious responses to incidents by universities and fraternity administrators, stricter alcohol service. But the most effective way to foster safe and smart social life comes down to a decision that can only be made by brothers themselves: Do they want to be remembered for what the name “fraternity” promises—brotherhood, solidarity, community—or do they want to be remembered for sanctioning tragedies like what happened to the girl down the road who went to the frat party?

Harvard Square, 130 years ago—cobblestones growing out of pavement, horse-drawn carriages instead of taxis lined up on Mass. Ave., metal flasks in place of Starbucks cups. The din of iPhone conversations and the recitations of tour guides recounting the origins of Widener Library for the thousandth time are muted. They are replaced by a single voice, belonging to a middle-aged man selling fruit.
His name is John Lovett, but “the bright boys of Harvard,” as he calls students, dub him John the Orange Man. He has blue eyes and graying auburn hair, parted in the center and curled at the ends, complemented by a thick, white beard. He is short and round-shouldered, and wears a tall beaver hat with a crimson sash; on game days, he dons his jersey. Students pass him rushing from dorm to class, and he calls to each invariably, “Hello, frin’.”
John the Orange Man began selling fruit in Harvard Square in 1858, about a decade after he immigrated to Cambridge to escape the Irish potato famine. He worked in the Square until his death following an operation in 1906, and during that period, saw the erection of 26 university buildings, and made the acquaintance of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Theodore Roosevelt. In 1891, the Boston Daily Globe dubbed him “the most popular man at Harvard.”
Contemporary essayist Roger Malstacks wrote, “He is much better known among Harvard men than President Eliot.”
To his almost exclusively wealthy student-contemporaries, John was part-servant, part-friend. Students asked John to deliver fruit directly to their Matthews and Holworthy dorm rooms, and appreciated that he handed out goodies even when they didn’t have ready cash. Imitating John’s Irish brogue in song became a regular pastime, and Harvard men called the vendor “Paddy” and “St. Patrick.” Yet students also invited John to smoke pipes in those dorm rooms, and often brought him to dinners at upscale Cambridge restaurants and hotels—more than once, they intervened to get him out of legal jams. John is a Harvard icon, but he is also a figure who reflects the complicated nature of turn-of-the-century class hierarchy.
County Kerry to Cambridge
John Lovett was born in County Kerry, Ireland, in 1833, one of 12 children in a family of middle-class farmers. Biographers would later imagine Lovett’s upbringing with the romance of an Irish pastoral; a Harvard Illustrated Magazine piece written shortly after the vendor’s death describes his early home as a “straw-thatched stone house… the typical Irish homestead.” Novelist Henry Fielding, who published “History of John the Orange Man,” claims that “the beautiful scenery” of John’s birthplace “is something beyond description.”
With the onset of the potato famine in 1845, though, John’s family fell on hard times, and several of the older children left Ireland for the United States. John eventually followed to join his mother and older brother in Cambridge, carrying—the romantic lore continues—nothing but a red trunk full of potatoes and oatmeal.
At the foot of the Charles River Bridge, John, informed that he would have to pay a penny-fare, feared that he would have to return home. Luckily, a local teamster came to his assistance, paid the fare, and drove him into Harvard Square.
John worked odd jobs in the Square for around a decade, renting a room in a house on Brattle Street. On one fateful day in 1858, John went to see “the bright boys of Harvard” play baseball at Soldier’s Field.
John watched from the sidelines until a senior player, wiping sweat from his brow, spotted the observer and shouted “Hi, there, Paddy bring us some water!”—perhaps John’s vibrant hair suggested his national origin to the student. John promised he would fetch some, and returned, 20 minutes later, with Irish sweet-water, a traditional blend of water, molasses, and vinegar. According to the obituary, John won over the students’ hearts with his tasty drink and his “many thanks to you, friends.”
The Most Popular Man at Harvard
When John spoke about the difficulty of finding work in the Square, a student recommended that he try selling fruit to Harvard students. Soon, he became a fixture in the Square. In the days before dining halls provided a constant supply of apples and bananas, students appreciated that that they “never had to go fruitless to bed, for need of the ready cash to purchase.” John claimed that trusting students to pay him back later never put him in debt. He was everyone’s “frin.”
Besides providing treats free of charge, John also earned a reputation for his enthusiastic support of collegiate sports. It became a tradition never to bet on a game unless John attended—though John only ever bet on the Crimson, a practice that proved even more financially risky than selling fruit on loan. Like any good Harvard fan, John’s sideline-support consisted mostly of insulting Yalies.
Malhstack’s essay—along with several contemporary articles—describes a famous exchange between John and a tourist who asked the vendor what “veritas” meant. According to legend, John replied, “I’m not sure, frin,’ but I guess it means ‘To hell with Yale.’”
Such humorous but somewhat patronizing tales delight in John’s outsider-status and supposed ignorance of Harvard etiquette. Yet at the same time, students often used their own wealth and influence to obtain a privileged place for John in the Cambridge community. The class of 1881 gave John a wheeled cart so that he could sell his fruit inside the Yard. When the Yard Cop—the HUPD of the 19th-century—protested that both vehicles and the sale of goods were prohibited in the Yard, students signed a petition for John to be granted special permission. The petition succeeded, and John became the only vendor ever to cart his business between Widener and Memorial Hall.
By 1891, John, who had been born with a stumped leg, found it increasingly difficult to push the cart through the Yard or anywhere else. The graduating class that year presented him with a new cart that could be wheeled by a donkey. John dressed the donkey in a crimson blanket and named it “Radcliffe,” because, John reportedly quipped, she was the only one of her sex admitted to the college proper.
John soon became a regular guest at the Longfellow’s house for dinner. Having worked on campus for decades at a time when most students were legacies, he earned renown for teasing young men about their fathers’ collegiate exploits.
Insider, Outsider
Intervening on John’s behalf meant more than needling campus police—students often challenged Cambridge authorities who treated John as an inferior on account of his background. By the 1890s, however, John had made his way into the middle-class with the purchase of a home on Beaver Street. When the vendor joined Harvard students for a post-game dinner at a local hotel, Fielding writes, a waiter “mistook him for an ordinary workman and was about to forcibly eject him.” It took one of the better-known athletes to protest to the waiter on John’s behalf; the student was one of Harvard’s greatest boxers and the waiter, Fielding claims, must have been grateful to “escape intact.”
But if students condescended to John because of his background, this did not prevent them from regarding him as one of their own. A few years before death, an anonymous Harvard alum interviewed John and recounted the vendor’s life story in “The Story of John the Orange Man, Written by One of His Friends.” According to the book, John was constantly occupied in “mingling with the men of various sets and cliques” and therefore found himself privy to the gossip and petty rivalries of the student body. When asked to comment on another student though, John reportedly never said anything besides “’Aw, he’s a good fellah, frin.’”
According to the author of the history, John knew “many of the dark deeds committed within the college walls.”
If students treated John with a mostly benevolent paternalism, the outside world sometimes regarded the Irish immigrant with downright contempt. John appeared in a play called “Brown at Harvard” at the Princess Theater in New York, to add realism to a collegiate setting. A contemporary critic snobbishly wrote: “This was in such excessive taste that even one’s sense of humor was dismayed. The poor old chap, blinking in the footlights, toothless and smiling, was… pathetic, with the pathos of sheer ineptitude, and it seemed a pity.”
John passed away later that year in Massachusetts General Hospital. His death was followed by an outpouring of loving obituaries written by former students and Cambridge locals.
The Legacy
After John’s death, some suggested that a Harvard Square character nicknamed Mugsey, who had once worked for John and then opened his own business selling popcorn and candy, take his mentor’s place as mascot. The idea never caught on, though, and today, Harvard’s official mascot is the other John— the school’s first donor, John Harvard. He has red hair but no beard; he wears a Pilgrim’s hat and does not sell oranges.
John’s anonymous student biographer concludes his story with a prediction:
“He has served us faithfully, and will continue to do so as long as he is able to push the handcart; and when at last he is too old and feeble to attend to his business, he will come occasionally to the yard and sit in the sun on the steps of Mathews Hall, and his name will be enrolled on the records of the University as John Lovett, Emeritus.”
Sections
“They’re writing about you?” one friend asks incredulously as she pulls up a chair. “Yeah, about how much of a burden I am on my friends,” Michael J. Landry ’15-’16 answers sarcastically.
I quickly realize my list of relatively serious questions probably aren’t going to go over too well.
I’m sitting across from Landry, who is confined to a wheelchair, in Lowell Dining Hall. Though I had been expecting to hold a private interview, his friends stick around at our table, and they add their own commentary throughout.
Landry has Landry’s ascending paralysis, also known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a disorder that attacks the peripheral nervous system. “I’m like Lou Gehrig,” he says jokingly of the coincidental name match. Though his nerves still do not function properly in much of his body, Landry is expected to make a full recovery, after which the disorder will likely not affect him at all.
It all began last year on September 17th. “It started in the morning when I woke up,” Landry tells me. “I was unstable on my feet, and kept dropping stuff.” He went to class, where he had trouble taking notes, and by the end of his second class that day, his friends had to pack up his bag for him.
“I went to UHS, and I told them that I was going to be paralyzed,” he continues. But he was told that a doctor couldn’t see him for another hour, so he could stay and wait, or just come back later. “I thought well, I might not be able to walk in an hour, so I’ll just sit.” But when he called his dad, who is a physician, his dad demanded that the doctor see Landry immediately. It became obvious that something was very wrong, and Landry was sent to Massachusetts General Hospital. By that night, he couldn’t sit up. “If my dad hadn’t called, I would’ve died,” he notes casually.
Landry spent the next ten and a half months in the hospital, switching at one point to Columbia Presbyterian in New York. For two weeks near the beginning of his hospitalization, he could only move his eyes and eyelids. He was on a ventilator for about two months, until just before Thanksgiving.
Back at school as a junior, Landry’s life seems to be just like most other college students’—with a couple of logistical differences. Harvard, he notes, has been pretty accommodating. He receives extra time on exams because his hands still do not work very well, and takes two graduate-level physics classes in order to leave time for physical therapy. Landry does his rehabilitation, which includes basic leg exercises and walking, every day with his uncle, whose contract for work expired around the time Landry got sick and so took time off to help rather than renewing his contract or finding new work.
Harvard, however, and Lowell House especially, is not very wheelchair accessible. Though his blockmates live in Lowell, all are inaccessible, and so he can’t visit them day-to-day. “If I wanted a place that was very accessible they said I could go to Currier,” he explains, adding jokingly, “I would rather kill myself.” Landry had been in Cabot as a sophomore before he transferred to Lowell. “I’m never going back to that,” he added.
Landry notes that Harvard staff have been pretty supportive, such as one of the Lowell dining staff who gets him his food every day. “People in general are helpful,” he says, adding, “some people take it too far and I decline their help and they do it anyway.” He explains how once, in the Yard, he struggled make it up a hill. When he was about to coast downhill—which is the easy part—a man asked if he needed help. Landry declined, but, he says, the man “pushed me along slower than I would’ve been going and then decided to tell me his life story.”
I ask if he ever gets annoyed when his friends complain about relatively unimportant things. “No,” he answers, “though I do really enjoy making them feel bad about it. I say, ‘At least you're not in a wheelchair.’”
His friends seem to have taken the same darkly humorous approach to his condition. When Landry tells one friend walking by that he’s being profiled by The Crimson, the friend responds, “What do you do? You just sit in a chair all day.”
Larson C. Ishii ’15, one of Landry’s friends sitting at our table, explains that he wants Landry to run for Undergraduate Council president, and Landry says he’s willing to do it as long as Ishii runs his campaign and does all the work.  They tell me some of their ideas for campaign posters: “The new FDR for the new U.C.” (as there is some thought that FDR had the same syndrome); “I’m not running for U.C. president, I’m rolling”; and “If you don’t vote for me, you’re a bad person,” alongside a photo of Landry in a wheelchair.
Part of Landry’s UC presidential platform, they explain, would be to improve medical care on campus. Another friend chimes in from the end of the table and suggests a poster of Landry with the caption: “UHS did this to me.”
In an attempt to return to a more serious note, I ask Landry if he thinks that this experience in a wheelchair has changed his perspective at all. “Do you think I’ve developed a new perspective on life?” he asks Ishii, who answers, “I think you’ve returned to your old perspective.” “What, that everything sucks?” Landry says.
Landry notes one benefit of his paralysis. He had made a bet with Ishii before he became sick that if Landry participated in “No Shave November,” Ishii would do the Tasty Burger challenge, which involves eating three colossal All-The-Way Dogs in under an hour. When he became paralyzed, Landry was unable to shave, he explains, and so he “took this as an opportunity” to grow a beard. Now, Landry adds, Ishii has to fulfill his part of the deal. “I agreed to it without knowing that he would be paralyzed,” Ishii grumbles. “If it weren’t for the paralysis he never would have done it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 28, 2014, at 8:19 p.m.
Cherry A. Murray will leave her position as dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the end of 2014, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote in an email early Tuesday afternoon.
Murray has served as dean since July 2009 and is the second school dean this year to announce her impending departure, following the news earlier this month that David T. Ellwood ’75 will resign as dean of the Kennedy School of Government at the end of the academic year.
Murray said in an interview after the announcement Tuesday that she made up her mind to resign at the beginning of the term, in part to help ease the transition of whomever would succeed her in leading the School’s $450 million capital campaign and expansion into Allston.
“It was not an easy decision, and I just decided I really have to do it now, mostly because…it's the very beginning of the campaign, a new dean could come in, the School would not even have a hiccup,” she said.
In a letter addressed to colleagues earlier in the day, Murray wrote that her father’s recent death prompted a reevaluation of the rest of her career.
“I began to assess how I wish to spend that time and concluded that I want to be less involved in day-to-day administration and more focused on accomplishing a few big things for which I have a real passion,” she wrote.
According to a press release that SEAS circulated today, Murray will return to serve on the School’s faculty following her resignation and “continue her advocacy for policies that advance technology and innovation nationally and internationally.”
Murray said that, while she will return to teaching after the new year, she may decide to “take a little breather” and not teach full-time immediately.
Smith will appoint an interim dean in the coming weeks and begin a formal search for Murray’s successor later in the academic year, according to FAS officials.
Whoever her successor turns out to be, Murray said he or she should be “an excellent fundraiser.” She added that the new dean should also be “someone who's interested in education and somebody who is going to move a large part of the School into a new facility," as two-thirds of SEAS faculty prepares to move to Allston.
SEAS professors praised Murray on Tuesday afternoon after receiving the news of her departure, saying that she had ably spearheaded the school’s quick expansion during her tenure and positioned it well for continued growth.
Under Murray’s tenure, the number of undergraduate concentrators in engineering and applied sciences more than doubled, while enrollment in SEAS classes tripled. The size of the school’s faculty has grown at a faster clip than any of FAS’s other divisions in recent years.
During her time as dean, Murray has also worked to reduce gender imbalance within SEAS student and its faculty bodies. Women represent about one-third of SEAS undergraduate concentrators, according to FAS statistics, while female professors make up 16 percent of the school’s ladder faculty.
Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said that though Murray’s announcement surprised him, he understood “her reasons for moving on.”
“Major decisions about the place of engineering at Harvard have been made under her leadership,” Lewis added. “We’ve been very fortunate to have such an outstanding scientist lead us through this period of rapid change.”
According to Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur, Murray’s leadership has been integral to the school’s current path.
“I’m full of admiration, but at the same time, I’m sad that she’s stepping down because she clearly has kept the school on a fantastic trajectory over these past five years," he said.
Murray said in the interview that she hoped her legacy would be one of “a focus on liberal-arts based engineering education” at the School, adding that she was most proud of her emphasis on students and their learning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College administrators will begin accepting nominations next Monday to fill undergraduate positions on the student-faculty Honor Council that will adjudicate academic integrity cases starting next fall.
The Honor Council, which will roll out with the implementation of the College’s first honor code next year, will usher in major changes to how the College addresses instances of alleged academic dishonesty. Currently, the Administrative Board, which has no student members, hears all cheating cases.
According to Interim Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger, everyone with a Harvard PIN will be able to nominate sophomores and juniors from Nov. 3 to Nov. 21. Administrators will ask undergraduates nominated through this process to apply for a position on the council by the end of the semester.
A group consisting of representatives from the Dean of the College’s office, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and the Academic Integrity Committee will review all applications for the positions. The College will interview candidates at the end of January and name chosen students by February.
Administrators will eventually solicit nominations for potential Honor Council members from the freshman class, but that process will begin in the spring semester.
“We’re really excited to see this multi-year effort get to this stage,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview on Tuesday.
While administrators have not yet decided exactly how many students will sit on the council, Dean of Undergraduate Jay M. Harris, who chairs the Academic Integrity Committee, said there may be about 15. No matter the number, half the council will be made up of students; the other half will be a mix of faculty members and administrators.
Khurana said that the College hopes to recruit a “broad” range of students from a variety of academic and personal backgrounds. An online position description lists “discretion, sensitivity, [and] empathy,” among others, as desired qualities in Honor Council candidates. Harris added that an ideal Honor Council member would also be “committed to the academic mission of the College.”
Reiterating comments by various administrators that serving on the Honor Council will be a “major commitment,” Flehinger said in an interview Tuesday that the students chosen to serve would undergo “intensive” training, including weekly seminars from March to June and more training in mid-August.
“We want to make sure this works the first time,” Flehinger said, adding that the training would include practice run-throughs of Honor Council meetings. During the school year, members of the council will be responsible for attending and preparing for monthly meetings, according to Flehinger, as well as going through additional training.
Alongside efforts to recruit potential members of the Honor Council, administrators will also solicit nominations for students to serve as peer advisors to other students who go before the council next year.
While administrators have laid out how they intend to select members of the honor council, the College has not yet recommended how frequently students would be required to sign a statement affirming their commitment to the honor code, another proposed rule that still needs to be approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Administrators hope to gain Faculty approval of this provision by the end of the academic year, according to Harris, but he added that the failure to secure final approval by that date would not “derail” next fall’s implementation of the rest of the honor code, which includes the Honor Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 29, 2014, at 10:40 p.m.
Students, workers, and local politicians convened for a roundtable discussion Tuesday evening to discuss workplace hazards at the Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites and call on University President Drew G. Faust to help the hotel’s employees in their efforts to unionize.
The roundtable was the latest step of a campaign organized by the Student Labor Action Movement and UNITE HERE! Local 26, a Massachusetts-based union that represents Harvard’s dining hall employees. The campaign has featured numerous protests and rallies, initiated after a majority of workers at the hotel signed a petition in March 2013 to launch the process of deciding whether to join Local 26.
The workers said they hope that Hilton, the parent company of DoubleTree, will be more receptive to their preferred means of unionization if Harvard pressures the company. The hotel is not operated by the University but is located in a Harvard-owned building.
Approximately 50 attendees gathered in the Phillips Brooks House to listen to several DoubleTree workers describe their working conditions. Union representatives, two Boston city councilors, and Boston City Councilor at Large Michelle Wu also joined the conversation.
“When I hear [about DoubleTree working conditions], I am absolutely furious,” Cambridge City Councillor E. Denise Simmons said to applause from the audience. “The University has enough money to run several small companies, or several small countries, and for them to allow mistreatment to happen and pretend they have clean hands is outrageous.”
One former housekeeper, Vilma Ayala, said that DoubleTree managers overworked her to the point of injury while she was pregnant, offering her no sympathy or reduced work during her pregnancy. With her arm around her four-year-old daughter Mayli, she asked the Harvard community to support the workers.
“Today, it’s really, really difficult for me to do anything–I can’t go back to work because I’m in so much pain,” Ayala said, her eyes filling with tears. “I can’t even pay rent, I can hardly pay to feed my children.”
The event comes as a part of a shift in SLAM’s tactics this semester, which includes emphasizing employee injuries at the DoubleTree and calling on Faust to meet personally with workers. SLAM and Local 26 representatives said that Bureau of Labor statistics indicate that in 2012, DoubleTree workers had an incidence rate of injury and illness that was 74.5 percent higher than that of other institutions in the leisure and hospitality industry in Massachusetts.
“I really just think that it’s appalling that Harvard profits and makes millions of dollars off the backs of these workers,” said SLAM member Nina R. Wagner ’18. “I think a part of that is that these workers are perceived as invisible, their work is not valued, their work is not regarded as dangerous.”
Earlier in the day, SLAM members demonstrated in Harvard Yard with 28 five-foot long black and white images of beds coupled with 28 signs with quotes from DoubleTree housekeepers on experiences of pain and injuries.
“A lot of people still aren’t aware of this issue,” said SLAM member Charity E. Barros ’18, who flyered outside the Science Center and helped spread information about worker treatment on Tuesday afternoon. “They’re pretty shocked by how much Harvard makes off [of owning the hotel property] and how badly the workers are treated there.”
Because Harvard does not directly employ the workers at the DoubleTree, the University continues to maintain that it is not a party to the unionization process, according to Associate Vice President for Public Affairs Kevin Casey.
“Harvard encouraged the parties to undertake a fair election process—secret ballot or card check—but has not expressed a preference as to which ballot process should be followed, so long as the parties agree to a process,” Casey said in a statement.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 29, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the municipality for which Michelle Wu is a city councilor. In fact, she is a Boston city councilor at large.

Several dozen Harvard College students are preparing to put pen to paper as participants in November’s National Novel Writing Month, an annual campaign that encourages writers to craft an entire novel in a single month.
Kathryn J. Gundersen ’17, event chair of the Harvard College Writers’ Workshop, said that the challenge has attracted about 20 to 30 undergraduates from a variety of concentrations.
The organization held an introductory meeting for participants last week, inviting them to weekly, two-hour writing sessions that will offer an opportunity to work on and discuss drafts. In mid-November, the workshop will also host its staple “writers’ all-nighter” in Lowell House Bell Tower for “NaNoWriMo” participants and non-participants alike.
“Our main goal is to provide a support network for people participating, because writing can be lonely sometimes,” Gundersen said. “It’s always easier to do ‘NaNoWriMo’ when you have other people around you doing it, too.”
Harvard College Writers’ Workshop Treasurer Eric J. Juarez ’17, a two-year “NaNoWriMo” veteran, emphasized the importance of planning in advance and maintaining a regular schedule in order to succeed.
Having completed the challenge in high school, Siobhan S. B. McDonough ’17 said she plans to participate for the first time at Harvard this year, calling the monthlong project an opportunity to “finally develop all those creative ideas you have.”
With the daunting task of composing a 50,000-word novel in 30 days, students credit the explicit deadline for pushing them to allot hours to personal writing amid the demands of other commitments.
“You’ll find that it’s such a fun and rewarding experience, and it’s worth the time that you put in, because a lot of us really have always dreamed of writing a novel but just haven’t been able to find the time,” Gundersen said. “And now you’ve got a time, you’ve got a deadline, you’ve got a word goal count, and there’s no better time like today.”

When student and graduate leaders of Harvard’s unrecognized social clubs convened for a routine meeting with College administrators earlier this month, past experience suggested that they would hear general information about University policies and laws.
When new Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana opened the meeting with questions directly aimed at Harvard’s social scene and inclusivity, however, several attendees said the gathering turned out to be a more than hour-long discussion that touched on gender and diversity issues and prompted some pushback from the social club leaders in attendance.
The Oct. 6 meeting, coordinated by the Office of Student Life, was not a new event. At least annually, administrators request to meet with leaders of the College’s various unrecognized social organizations, including final clubs, to discuss campus resources and expectations, according to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.
But this fall’s gathering was something of a departure. Rather than focusing on policy, three student attendees said, Khurana chose to engage with the social clubs in a probing way their members have not seen from administrators at such a meeting in recent years.
Information about October’s meeting offers a rare glimpse at how administrators work with leaders of social organizations that Harvard does not publicly recognize. These regular meetings are not mandatory, and not all clubs choose to attend, but club leaders generally try to keep up something of a relationship with administrators, according to three club affiliates, including Fox Club graduate board president Douglas W. Sears ’69, a longtime participant in the final club graduate network who did not attend the meeting in October but previously led the Interclub Council.
Administrators, for their part, do not completely ignore the clubs despite their unrecognized status. “We can't just remain blind to them and pretend as though they're not there,” Lassonde said.
Since he assumed the deanship this summer, Khurana has publicly emphasized the importance of consulting students and engaging them in campus issues, including the ones discussed at this Oct. 6 meeting. In his capacity as a House master, he told The Crimson in 2011 that he was “always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity.” Many, but not all, unrecognized social clubs on campus are single-sex.
Between 30 and 40 affiliates of final clubs and other unrecognized social organizations, including the Seneca and the Hasty Pudding Club, attended the meeting at the Student Organization Center at Hilles. They were joined by several College administrators, including Khurana, Lassonde, and Emelyn A. dela Peña, assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Harvard University Police Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley and representatives from the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response were also present, according to Lassonde.
Although he acknowledged that he spoke at the meeting in an interview Tuesday, Khurana declined to comment on the substance of the conversation on the grounds that it was private. The meeting was not open to the public; according to three club members who attended, Khurana jokingly referenced the fact that Crimson reporters were not in the room.
According to attendees, Khurana led a provocative discussion that challenged students to consider the role that final clubs and other unrecognized social groups play in Harvard’s social scene and at the College more broadly.
“He was really asking them to think about their own communities and what their values are and the degree to which they align or don't align with the mission of the College,” Lassonde said.
Khurana asked students about social life at Harvard and how it could be improved, according to Anne F. Wenk ’15, the president of the Seneca, an all-female social organization that the College does not recognize. Wenk, who attended the meeting, said students brought up the gendered nature of off-campus social space and the perceived lack of alternatives provided by the College, in addition to other concerns about freshman social life.
A second theme of the discussion involved concerns about diversity in club membership, a topic that prompted pushback from some students, according to Lassonde. “I think he made them feel uncomfortable, but they also responded in a way that I thought was really healthy,” he said. “I expected them to get defensive, and some of them were, as you would expect, but others were really trying to explain themselves and what they're trying to accomplish.”
Not all attendees, though, thought the meeting was productive. One club member, who attended the meeting and was granted anonymity by The Crimson because of the meeting’s private nature, said “everybody got defensive right off the bat.”
Khurana concluded the meeting, according to this club member, by offering to continue the dialogue through future conversations with individual members and giving them his email address. Wenk added that Khurana emphasized that the onus was on the students to impact the College’s social scene significantly.
“His overall message, I think, was, ‘You guys are leaders and you are leaders on this campus, and you guys can make the change you want to see,’” Wenk said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists expressed mixed opinions about the success of ongoing protests in Hong Kong at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday evening.
Moderated by Anthony J. Saich, director of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, the IOP forum brought together a Harvard professor, a lawyer based in Hong Kong, and a senior at the College originally from Hong Kong to analyze the ambitions behind recent student demonstrations as well as the Chinese government’s stance on the city-state’s sovereignty.
Saich said he hoped the forum would further conversation on the issue of Hong Kong electoral reform after a decline in coverage of the protests. “We’re now two months into the demonstrations, and as a result, it’s fallen off the front page of the newspapers,” Saich said.
Panelist C. M. Chan, a lawyer currently enrolled in the Kennedy School of Government’s international Mason Fellowship master’s degree program, offered a legal perspective on the Hong Kong question. He noted that, by law, the people of Hong Kong are granted universal suffrage.  “It’s actually written very clearly in the constitution,” Chan said.
To bring in personal insight into motives of student protesters, Saich turned to panelist Heather L. Pickerell ’15, founder of the international movement “Wear Yellow for Hong Kong” and a Crimson editorial editor. Originally from Hong Kong, Pickerell said that many people her age did not have an opinion on democracy in Hong Kong until this year. According to Pickerell, the movement was an outpouring of frustration building up among the Hong Kongese.
“Hong Kong is the most unequal society in the world when it comes to socioeconomics,” Pickerell said.  “These are longstanding issues, and I think they finally have come to a helm now.”
The panelists and moderator recognized the difficulty of democracy in Hong Kong’s electoral system while, they said, Beijing remains unwilling to concede on the prospect of reform.
“I think [the demonstrations] will have very little impact in Beijing,” Saich said. Pickerell agreed that it is unlikely that China will change its stance. She did, however, express optimism about the younger generation’s political voice in the more distant future.
After the discussion, a member of the audience asked about the protests in light of the 2047 expiration date for China’s agreement to grant autonomy to Hong Kong for fifty years.  The panelists, however, did not express too much concern about this potential political obstacle.  “I don’t think Hong Kong falls off a political cliff in 2047,” said panelist William C. Kirby, a Harvard professor of China Studies.
Xiaodi Chen, a Chinese instructor for the Harvard Language Program, said she felt the event was informative, but added that she felt more uncertain about Hong Kong’s future after the forum.
“I think I’m a little more pessimistic now,” Chen said. “We don’t know what will happen to Hong Kong, even in 20 or 30 years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Physics phenomena are simpler and more elegant than people think, Juan M. Maldacena, professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Advanced Study, told a packed Pfizer Lecture Hall Tuesday night.
“Today, I’m going to tell you the story of ‘Beauty and The Beast,'” the former Harvard professor said, likening the elegant “Beauty” to the forces of nature and the mysterious “Beast” to the Higgs Boson particle.
In his talk, entitled “The Symmetry and Simplicity of the Laws of Physics and the Higgs Boson,” Maldacena touched upon the interactions between different forces—electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational—and subatomic particles.
“At each point in space, the electric field pushes a charged particle,” he said. “Magnetic fields act on only moving charges. Now, that’s probably what you heard in high school.”
To explain the interaction of the Higgs Boson with these forces, Maldacena likened the movement of particles in force fields to the flow of currency, used to purchase different goods in different countries.
In addition to discussing the particle itself, Maldacena gave an overview of the Large Hadron Collider, the accelerator used to isolate subatomic particles. “It’s very tricky to do this experiment, and sometimes I’m asked, ‘What is this useful for?’” he said. “It helps us understand how the world behaves at short distances.”
Cumrun Vafa, a Physics professor specializing in string theory, said that the lecture allowed students who are not physics concentrators to gain exposure to different subjects.
“[Students] should not feel alienated in terms of this abstraction,” Vafa said. “These subjects are not too far from our conception.”
Jarrod R. Wetzel-Brown ’17 also said that he appreciated the lecture’s accessibility.
“As a person who has never been acclimated to string theory or anything like that, it was wonderful to hear about the Large Hadron Collider and the other topics,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 66-year-old homeless woman was found dead in Harvard Square early Tuesday morning, the Cambridge Police Department reported later in the day.
Cambridge Police located the woman at 6:15 a.m. on a bench outside 1426 Mass. Ave., near CVS, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. The department did not release the woman’s name.
Officials determined that the woman died suddenly and that there was no trauma to her body, according to Warnick. As of Tuesday evening, they had not determined a cause of death.
A member of the homeless community who knew the deceased said the woman, who usually keeps to herself, had been panhandling in Harvard Square for a couple of years. The source, who asked not to be named, added she must have been dead for a couple of hours since the body was stiff when CPD found it this morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pausing from Ivy League play for the final time this season, the Harvard men’s soccer team returned to the win column Tuesday night with a 2-0 victory over Stony Brook.
“It was just a good team win,” junior defenseman Philip Fleischman said. “Overall, we’re excited that we executed what we set out to do, and it [gives us] great momentum going into Dartmouth this weekend.”
After being held out of the team’s previous two contests, Fleischman returned to action against the Sea Wolves (4-11-1, 2-3-0 America East) and proved to be the difference-maker.
Entering the game as a substitute, the junior scored twice in just 32 minutes of action to earn Harvard its first win in two weeks.
The junior struck first for the Crimson (9-4-1, 2-1-1 Ivy) with less than four minutes to play in the first half as a result of an intercepted pass at midfield by sophomore Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu.
Carrying the ball upfield by himself, Wheeler-Omiunu made his way through several defenders before having the play broken up at the 18-yard line.
However, the sophomore stayed with the play, regaining control of the ball, moving to his right, and then sending a back-heel pass to senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi inside the box.
With his first touch, Kobayashi channeled his inner Wheeler-Omiunu, sending a back-heel pass of his own to freshman Nate Devine. The rookie then flicked the ball onward to Fleischman, who was left standing all alone in front of the keeper.
After the ball had made its way to four different players on just four touches, Fleischman finished the job, finessing the ball into the right side of the net to put Harvard ahead.
“It’s great,” said Fleischman, referring to the goal. “It’s just me doing what I’m supposed to do. We built the ball up all the way from the back to the front, and I just had the last touch on it.”
At the start of the second half, Fleischman was back on the sideline. But just moments after coming on as a substitute in the 63rd minute, Fleischman provided the Crimson with some insurance—once again serving as the beneficiary of some strong Harvard passing.
Launching the attack, senior defender Tyler Evans cleared the ball out of his own end and into the vicinity of junior attackers Matt Sheeleigh and Jake Freeman.
Seeing an opportunity, Sheeleigh bumped the lone Stony Brook defender in the area to take him out of the play, thus creating an open lane for Freeman.
With no one left to defend, Stony Brook goalkeeper Jason Orban vacated his net to charge at Freeman. In response, the junior found Fleischman making a run into the box, and the defenseman used his left foot to bang the ball into the empty net.
“[Fleischman] was fantastic,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “He is very consistent. He comes every day and works his tail off regardless of the situation. He’s somebody that we have missed because he has done very well.”
On the other side of the ball, making his first start since freshman year, junior goalkeeper Joe Festa stood tall in net to earn the clean sheet for the Crimson. Giving starter Evan Mendez his first break of the season, Festa made four saves, including a diving stop in the final minute.
“I thought [Festa] was very good,” Lehrer said. “His communication was good and [his] handling was good. You know he’s going to be a little bit nervous coming into his first game, but he performed very well.”
In six career starts for Harvard, Festa has now compiled 27 saves to go along with a 1.21 GAA. However, the win against Stony Brook is just the first of the goalkeeper’s collegiate career.
The Crimson came into the game looking to get back on track after its nine-game unbeaten streak was snapped Saturday against Princeton.
Harvard had rattled off eight straight wins following three losses to open the season before a tie with Brown and the loss to the Tigers knocked the team out of first place in the Ivy League. The Crimson is now tied for second in the conference with Princeton. Dartmouth, which now leads the league, will host Harvard on Saturday in a pivotal league matchup.
With just one home game remaining, the Crimson has now improved to 7-0 at Soldiers Field and 8-0 at home overall. The last time Harvard finished the season unbeaten at home was in 2008, when the Crimson finished 12-6 and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament.­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 69 minutes of play, Harvard field hockey outshot, outran, and statistically outperformed the 11th-ranked Boston College squad. But ultimately it was the play of the first minute that determined the outcome of the match.
The Eagles captured a 1-0 victory over the Crimson with a goal 39 seconds into the game, marking Harvard’s third consecutive 1-0 defeat.
“Games like this are good for showing us how strong the team actually is,” co-captain Caitlin Rea said. “It shows us that attitude [plays] such an influence on the game.”
In the last minute of the game, Harvard (8-8, 2-3 Ivy) had a chance to provide a fitting response to Boston College’s (13-5) early goal.
After a flubbed pass from Eagles goalkeeper Leah Settipane, senior Harvard forward Noel Painter briefly found herself with a one-on-one opportunity. But Settipane blocked both Painter’s shot and junior Elizabeth Jacobson’s was not able to score on the follow up to preserve the victory.
The Crimson offense pelted the Boston College defense with shots throughout the game, tallying five shots in the first half and six in the second. Over the entire 70 minutes, the Eagles recorded only four.
“[We focused on] staying spread out and passing—getting the ball and passing it,” Painter said. “[BC has] really good defense and ball control, so we just needed to pass around them.”
Boston College scored on its first possession of the game. After starting with the ball, Harvard gave away possession to Eagles midfielder Emily McCoy, who found teammate Kelcie Hromisin at the top of the box.
“[The goal] gave us the energy to push forward,” Rea said. “I think BC expected us to be weak, and that goal…gave us the ammunition to show that we weren’t.”
After conceding the early score, Harvard responded with attacking intensity. A penalty corner in the third minute fell to sophomore forward Marissa Balleza, who fired an attempt on frame.
Eight minutes later, it was Balleza again who forced Settipane into an acrobatic save with a hard shot on the ground.
“After the first [40] seconds, they were on their heels for the first half and the rest of the second half,” senior forward Noel Painter said. “They weren’t expecting us to come out this hard...I think we played a good game overall.”
The Crimson found success on its counterattack throughout the match. Even when Harvard didn’t get a shot off, the team sprung vertical attacks that caused the Eagles defense to backpedal.
“We’ve been working the whole season on making the field big, just creating space to play the game,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “I think that key worked really well.”
The Crimson were once again aggressive on offense in the second half. Three minutes in, senior forward Catriona McDonald ran on goal and pelted a shot on target. However, once again Settipane was up to the task, parrying the shot away.
Balleza alone outshot the Eagles. She led Harvard with five shots, three of which found the target. In comparison, Boston College managed to produce two shots on goal.
Although the Eagles had scored 18 goals over the past four games, the Crimson limited the visitors’ opportunities after the defense’s initial breakdown.
“We realized that we [needed] to step up on our marks more,” Rea said, referring to the early goal. “We minimized mistakes after that because we were pretty angry about it. Someone scoring an easy goal on you gives you ammunition to step up in front of your mark and keep your control.”
In contrast to Harvard’s recent losses, Boston College came into the match with a four-game winning streak that included wins over nationally-ranked Louisville, California, and Virginia. The Eagles were the first top-25 opponent that the Crimson played this season.
“We played very well,” van Herwaarden said. “We really competed. We played our game of hockey, and I was very happy to see how we were able to compete with a top team in the nation at the moment.”

Good morning, Harvard, and happy Wednesday! We know many of you read Harvard Today in lecture instead of paying attention (we’re flattered), so today we thought we’d provide some educational information so that you’re not missing out too much. I know, you’re welcome. Here’s presenting: (selected excerpts) about today in history!
1787 – Mozart's opera Don Giovanni receives its first performance in Prague. Shoutout to everyone in Humanities 10a!
1863 – Eighteen countries meet in Geneva and agree to form the International Red Cross.
1921 – The Harvard football team loses to Centre College in Kentucky (which at the time enrolled 264 students total), ending a 25 game winning streak. The Associated Press called this the greatest sports upset of the first half of the 20th century. Brutal. We want a rematch.
1929 – The New York Stock Exchange crashes on Black Tuesday, ending the Roaring 20s and beginning the Great Depression.
1960 – Cassius Clay (aka Muhammad Ali) wins his first professional fight. He was 18.
2012 – Hurricane Sandy hits the east coast of the United States, killing close to 300 people and  leaving nearly $70 billion in damages.
2013 – Turkey opens a sea railway tunnel connecting Europe and Asia across the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul. So. Cool.
...and that’s just the start. For whatever reason, October 29 has been a pretty happening day every year. Take some time to read more about it yourself for the rest of class! Or maybe afterwards, we’re not going anywhere.
