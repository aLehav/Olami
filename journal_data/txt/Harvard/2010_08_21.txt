After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this letter to colleagues, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith discloses that Professor Marc D. Hauser has been found "solely responsible" by an investigating committee for eight separate instaces of scientific misconduct in his lab. Though Smith does not specify sanctions taken against Hauser, he outlines possible punishments and academic repercussions of the finding.
Dear faculty colleagues,
No dean wants to see a member of the faculty found responsible for scientific misconduct, for such misconduct strikes at the core of our academic values. Thus, it is with great sadness that I confirm that Professor Marc Hauser was found solely responsible, after a thorough investigation by a faculty investigating committee, for eight instances of scientific misconduct under FAS standards. The investigation was governed by our long-standing policies on professional conduct and shaped by the regulations of federal funding agencies. After careful review of the investigating committee’s confidential report and opportunities for Professor Hauser to respond, I accepted the committee’s findings and immediately moved to fulfill our obligations to the funding agencies and scientific community and to impose appropriate sanctions.
Harvard, like every major research institution, takes a finding of scientific misconduct extremely seriously and imposes consequential sanctions on individuals found to have committed scientific misconduct. Rigid adherence to the scientific method and scrupulous attention to the integrity of research results are values we expect in every one of our faculty, students, and staff.
In brief, when allegations of scientific misconduct arise, the FAS Standing Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC) is charged with beginning a process of inquiry into the allegations. The inquiry phase is followed by an investigation phase that is conducted by an impartial committee of qualified, tenured faculty (the investigating committee), provided that the dean, advised by the CPC, believes the allegations warrant further investigation. The work of the investigating committee as well as its final report are considered confidential to protect both the individuals who made the allegations and those who assisted in the investigation. Our investigative process will not succeed if individuals do not have complete confidence that their identities can be protected throughout the process and after the findings are reported to the appropriate agencies. Furthermore, when the allegations concern research involving federal funding, funding agency regulations govern our processes during the investigation and our obligations after our investigation is complete. (For example, federal regulations impose an ongoing obligation to protect the identities of those who provided assistance to the investigation.) When the investigation phase is complete, the investigating committee produces a confidential report describing their activity and their findings. The response of the accused to this report and the report itself are considered by the dean, who then decides whether to accept the findings, and in the case of a finding of misconduct, determine the sanctions that are appropriate. This entire and extensive process was followed in the current case.
Since some of the research in the current case was supported by federal funds, the investigating committee’s report and other supplemental material were submitted to the federal offices responsible for their own review, in accordance with federal regulations and FAS procedures. Our usual practice is not to publicly comment on such cases, one reason being to ensure the integrity of the government’s review processes.
A key obligation in a scientific misconduct case is to correct any affected publications, and our confidentiality policies do not conflict with this obligation. In this case, after accepting the findings of the committee, I immediately moved to have the record corrected for those papers that were called into question by the investigation. The committee’s report indicated that three publications needed to be corrected or retracted, and this is now a matter of public record. To date, the paper, “Rule learning by cotton-top tamarins,” Cognition 86, B15-B22 (2002) has been retracted because the data produced in the published experiments did not support the published findings; and a correction was published to the paper, “Rhesus monkeys correctly read the goal-relevant gestures of a human agent,” Proceedings of the Royal Society B 274, 1913-1918 (2007). The authors continue to work with the editors of the third publication, “The perception of rational, goal-directed action in nonhuman primates,” Science 317, 1402-1405 (2007). As we reported to one of these editors, the investigating committee found problems with respect to the three publications mentioned previously, and five other studies that either did not result in publications or where the problems were corrected prior to publication. While different issues were detected for the studies reviewed, overall, the experiments reported were designed and conducted, but there were problems involving data acquisition, data analysis, data retention, and the reporting of research methodologies and results.
Beyond these responsibilities to the funding agencies and the scientific community, Harvard considers confidential the specific sanctions applied to anyone found responsible for scientific misconduct. However, to enlighten those unfamiliar with the available sanctions, options in findings of scientific misconduct include involuntary leave, the imposition of additional oversight on a faculty member’s research lab, and appropriately severe restrictions on a faculty member’s ability to apply for research grants, to admit graduate students, and to supervise undergraduate research. To ensure compliance with the imposed sanctions, those within Harvard with oversight of the affected activities are informed of the sanctions that fall within their administrative responsibilities.
As should be clear from this letter, I have a deeply rooted faith in our process and the shared values upon which it is founded. Nonetheless, it is healthy to review periodically our long-standing practices. Consequently, I will form a faculty committee this fall to reaffirm or recommend changes to the communication and confidentiality practices associated with the conclusion of cases involving allegations of professional misconduct. To be clear, I will ask the committee to consider our policies covering all professional misconduct cases and not comment solely on the current scientific misconduct case.
In summary, Harvard has completed its investigation of the several allegations in the current case and does not anticipate making any additional findings, statements, or corrections to the scientific record with respect to those allegations. This does not mean, however, that others outside Harvard have completed their reviews. In particular, Harvard continues to cooperate with all federal inquiries into this matter by the PHS Office of Research Integrity, the NSF Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts.
Respectfully yours,
Michael D. Smith
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A  proposal to relocate Western Avenue's McDonald’s 75 feet from its current Harvard-owned location in the Brighton Mills shopping center has raised neighborhood concerns about the street’s long-term development.
“For quite some time now, there has been an agreement between the city, Harvard, and resident that in order to turn Western Ave. into a thriving Main Street district you need to build multi-story structures,” said Allston resident Harry E. Mattison. “The proposed one-story McDonald’s, however, completely contradicts the type of development and construction Harvard and the city have been preaching for years.”
Along with Harvard and McDonald’s, the Community Builders -- the firm in charge of developing the new Charlesview residence on land currently owned by Harvard, including the parcel occupied by Brighton Mills -- filed an amendment with the Boston Redevelopment Authority on July 29 to move the McDonald’s at 360 Western Avenue east and closer to the street to accommodate the extension of Telford Street.
The proposal extends Telford Street, which currently connects Western Avenue and Soldiers Field Road, across Western Avenue and through the future site of the Charlesview residence, making the residence complex more accessible, according BRA spokesperson Jessica Shumaker. Shumaker notes that an elongated Telford Street would create a route for automobiles and pedestrians to access the future Charlesview complex and the Charles River.
Residents worried at a BRA meeting last week that the proposed one-story building would detract from Western Avenue’s potential to become the bustling “Main Street” promised by Harvard and city officials.
“I like a Big Mac as much as everybody else,” said Allston resident Tim McHale at the meeting. “But does it [McDonald’s new design] really look like our community plan [for Western Avenue]?”
McDonald’s long-term lease guarantees the corporation’s property rights to its Western Avenue location, according to Shumaker.  Both company and Harvard officials said the new location's design has been devised in consideration with the long-term plans for development of a “Main Street” environment on Western Avenue.
Through a community wide planning process, Harvard joined together with neighborhood residents, city officials and planners to draft the BRA’s proposal in 2005 to include improved public transportation, better access to Charles River, and a commercial "Main Street" on Western Avenue. Since the University halted construction on the Allston Science Complex last December, Harvard officials have maintained that the University’s commitment to the 2005 framework as a guide for Harvard’s expansion into Allston.
“McDonald’s, a fixture on Western Avenue since 1983, has been working with Harvard University and the BRA to redesign the restaurant... to create a pedestrian friendly neighborhood and a distinct streetscape on Western Avenue,” wrote McDonald’s spokesman Glen Gracia in an e-mailed statement.
Gracia noted that McDonald’s added extra entrances, an exterior dining patio and bike racks to better fit the University’s and BRA’s vision for Western Avenue.
Through a land swap deal with the University, the Charlesview Board of Directors plans to move residents out of the current Charlesview residence complex, comprised of 213 aging low-income housing units located across from the University's Allston Science Complex construction site, to a yet-to-be constructed neighborhood approximately half mile away.
“The proposal will bring Charlesview residents closer to the day when they will enjoy new and improved housing,” added University spokesperson Lauren Marshall in an e-mailed statement, noting that relocating McDonald’s is a preparatory step in the process of building the new Charlesview residence.
A second community meeting will be held on Thursday, September 7 at 6:30 at the Honan Allston-Brighton Library.
