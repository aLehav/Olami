After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “You Had Your Soul With You,” The National reminisces over lost love. The song, the first single off of the band’s eighth album, “I Am Easy to Find,” differentiates itself from the sound of the band’s previous album, “Sleep Well Beast,” through its more upbeat instrumentals. In spite of their departures, The National maintains characteristically forlorn tones, established through earlier hits such as “I Need My Girl,” “Bloodbuzz Ohio,” and “Fake Empire,” on this melancholy single.
“You Had Your Soul With You” wants to be happy. The song begins with staccato guitars and a syncopated drum beat, setting up what sounds like an upbeat indie rock song. However, around the 15 second-mark, the instrumentation changes to a sober mix of instruments. While the drums remain energetic throughout the song (evoking Philip Selway in Radiohead’s “Reckoner”), the verse represents a drastic shift from the hyper introduction.
While the verse creates a dichotomy, the chorus brings the two tones of the song together seamlessly, creating a textured backing for singer Matt Berninger’s vocals, which typically set the mood for The National’s songs. On the band’s newest single, this is not the case. In “Bloodbuzz Ohio,” for example, Berninger’s powerful, steady singing characterizes the song, while in “You Had Your Soul With You,” his vocals seem somewhat monotone, especially in a chorus with staccato, choppy guitar. Only with the aid of back-up vocalist Gail Ann Dorsey, a singer best known for her session work with David Bowie, do the vocals of the song gain a significant semblance of emotion. In fact, the two lines that Dorsey sings alone are the most powerful of the song (“I have owed it to my heart, every word I've said/You have no idea how hard I died when you left.”)
The National became popular over the last 15 or so years because of their experimental take on indie rock. With its unpredictable guitar parts, “You Had Your Soul With You” is no exception in this regard. The song’s only drawback is the occasional uncharacteristically monotone quality of Berninger’s vocals. Dorsey’s excellent vocal work, however, remedies this issue and manages to capture the emotion of the lyrics with her voice. This single will excite fans of The National’s past work. While it represents a slight shift in musical tone from their previous album, it demonstrates that the band stays true to form.

On “House of Glass,” the second single from the upcoming album “Social Cues,” Cage the Elephant is paranoid, anxious, and, most of all, fed up. Cage the Elephant singer Matt Schultz opens the band’s new single by muttering a series of dark lyrics (“Fall straight through the floor and let the time just run me over”) over distorted bass and guitar. Guitarist Brad Schultz reflects the paranoia of the song’s lyrics with increasingly erratic riffs. His distorted guitar soars above the rest of the rhythm section while the singer screams “The house is glass,” before a violent drumbeat kicks in and he elaborates on the anxiety associated with criticism (“It's an illusion, this admiration”). While the verse of the song paints a picture of rising paranoia, the chorus is a full-blown outburst.
The ominous lyrical themes signal the band’s feelings to its listeners, and the instrumentation and violent production of the song allow it to poignantly portray the distress that these lyrics discuss. They occasionally come across as melodramatic (“Joke's on you, the needle prick”), but the lyrics feel most significant when Schultz employs repetition on the phrases “The house is glass,” “It’s an illusion,” and “My isolation.” The instrumentation and production of the song make these phrases stick in the listener’s mind, conveying the band’s feelings about their fame and their reaction to criticism.
“House of Glass” may surprise fans of Cage the Elephant’s earlier work, as the band steps away from the sound used in its first four albums. While Cage the Elephant previously held close its classic rock, blues, and indie influences, “House of Glass” utilizes a more experimental, angry sound. They are not alone in their shift from a more traditional indie rock sound to a distorted one. After over a decade with the Strokes, singer Julian Casablancas moved in a similar direction with his new band, The Voidz. “House of Glass” resembles in some ways The Voidz’s 2014 track, “Where No Eagles Fly.”
Overall, in “House of Glass,” Cage the Elephant utilizes distorted, heavy instrumentation to convey a sense of paranoia, anxiety, and anger. The track represents a shift away from the more indie rock-focused sound of their previous albums, but it presents its message in a poignant, interesting way.

Kehlani’s mixtape “While We Wait,” released in late February, is dressed with a yearning for love like many an R&B album, yet harnesses Kehlani’s distinctive brand as both a romantic and a player. In “While We Wait,” Kehlani creates a profound emotional experience, invoking large-scale romantic sentiments through a simple and candid lens.
The R&B icon’s latest mixtape exemplifies both the genre and her artistic development, recreating the highlights of past albums and mixtapes “SweetSexySavage,” “You Should Be Here,” and “Cloud 19.” Compared to her last album, “SweetSexySavage,” it is much shorter at nine songs and similarly has a cohesive feel, while the tone and message of songs from “Feels” to “Nunya” to “RPG” vary greatly. “RPG” speaks to the heavier themes of expectation and disappointment while “Nunya” makes it clear to Kehlani’s ex that who she’s with is none of their business. She leaves behind some of her stylistic idiosyncrasies, such as the whirring that opens “Keep On” or the monologue and phone-ringer-tone “Intro” pieces of previous mixtapes, but nonetheless creates something that elicits nostalgia and bitterness as it uplifts. Kehlani does not refrain from other, well-incorporated modes of unconventionality, like the xylophone opening of “Love Language” or the hollow, flat, and unplaceable instrumental harmony of “Butterfly.” She departs from the at-times pop, at-times acoustic feel of “You Should Be Here” to make something more beautifully R&B. While too many musical flourishes overwhelmed past tracks, Kehlani’s highly feminine and youthful voice accentuates the best in this album.
“Nights Like This,” which features Ty Dolla $ign and reached 67 on the Billboard Top 100, is the track most exemplary of Kehlani’s style and content. Like other songs in the album, the title alludes to the relatable reminiscing packed into the lyric, “On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us.” “Feels” and “Too Deep” do the same — the simple sentiments they dwell upon are fully disclosed in their titles. This simplicity does not impede them from being the perfect ruminative listens for those deep in their “feels” or with flings that are becoming “too deep.” Kehlani has a laudable ability to make what would otherwise be cheesy real, human, and beautiful. The word “feels” isn’t a cop-out, just like Mariah Carey’s “Emotions” — sometimes people just feel feels, and they’re loaded. A male rapper offers the track’s alternative romantic voice (although in “Nights Like This,” Kehlani sings about a woman) in “Nunya” featuring Dom Kennedy, “RPG” featuring 6lack, and “Footsteps” featuring Musiq Soulchild. “RPG” and “Footsteps” are highlights of the mixtape. In “Nunya,” the tone of Kennedy’s rap cuts too sharply against Kehlani’s voice, while in “Nights Like This,” Ty Dolla $ign is at once refreshing and complementary.
It is striking how successfully Kehlani employs repetition in her tracks, each composed largely of repeated choruses. “Footsteps,” opens with the sound of sloshing water, synths, and the later addition of a lissome beat. The repetition of the lyric “And when I walked away,” with its drawn-out notes and an echoing background melody, enhances a sentimental, somewhat mournful feeling. She draws upon the earlier sound of water to create a metaphor for the water that slips through her ex-lover’s fingers and drowns them as it washes away the footprints she leaves. Songs like “Too Deep,” in which the chorus is the line “too deep” repeated six times, work, but playing the song twice consecutively is tiring.
Kehlani hypes herself up in “Morning Glory,” which opens with a crescendo like the start of day, shrugs off toxicity in “Nunya,” and indulges love despite all the apprehension that may be linked to it in the soft-spoken, vocals-dominated “Butterfly.” The emotional experience that “While We Wait” provides is empowering.

At the start of filming Season One of “Kim’s Convenience,” Paul Sun-Hyung Lee took the entire cast out to dinner and the movies.
“He sat us all down and he said, ‘If we work really hard, and we care about each other, we can have this for a long time,’” Andrew Phung, who plays Kimchee on the show, said.
The immense pressure that came with being the first Canadian TV show with an all-Asian lead cast was not lost on the cast of “Kim’s Convenience.” Nor on the cast of “Fresh Off the Boat,” for being the first U.S. network television show about an Asian-American family since 1994.
Cast members from both shows — Lee and Phung, along with their “Kim’s Convenience” castmates Andrea Bang and Simu Liu and “Fresh Off the Boat”’s Hudson Yang — spoke at a panel at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on March 25. The panel, titled “Reimagine ‘Asian’: Defying Stereotypes and Celebrating Identity in Media and Popular Culture,” was organized by Woojin Kim and jointly co-sponsored by the Office of Student Affairs, the Pan-Asian Coalition for Education at HGSE, the Harvard Asia Center, and the Harvard Pan-Asian Graduate Student Alliance.
Based on the 2011 play by Ins Choi, “Kim’s Convenience” chronicles a Korean-Canadian family who runs a convenience store in Toronto.
“What Ins wanted to create was real people,” Lee, who plays Appa on the show, said in an interview with The Crimson. “He wrote the play as a love letter to his parents. And when I first read the play, it was like a love letter to my parents. We continue to strive for that.”
Following a landmark year for heightened Asian representation in film and television, the actors acknowledged that both sitcoms carry a special weight in the media landscape.
“This is definitely a lasting movement,” Yang said. “Immediately after ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ became such a huge success, people who are high up saw that this is a huge market.”
Liu cited Jessica Gao’s ABC pilot and Kevin Kwan’s CBS pilot as examples of a new era of Asian-led content.
“We’re in a moment right now where, for the first time, we’re impossible to ignore,” he said. “We’ve established to Hollywood, to a show business that predominantly cares about profits, that we are profitable.”
Kim, who organized the event, highlighted the exposure of previously niche “Asian-famous” stars to mainstream audiences, citing John Cho, Constance Wu, and Randall Park as examples.
“All these people are coming to the forefront,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. “And they’re Asian, but it’s not just Asian people who know them.”
Notably, the actors suggested that Asian-led productions are not only profitable, but also artistically meritorious in their own right.
“It also helped that these productions were excellent to begin with,” Lee said. “‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ if it was not a good movie, wouldn't have done as nearly as well.”
Lee further emphasized that the goal of the show was to achieve realism through archetypes, instead of relying on stereotyping.
“We always get the whole, ‘Do you play the stereotypes?’ And I always argue, it's not a stereotype. We're playing archetypes,” Lee said. “Because with stereotypes, it’s one common trait, and it ends there… But we’re an archetype. You’re starting from that point, and you’re building up these three dimensional real characters.”
Achieving multi-dimensionality, for Liu, entailed overcoming racially-coded feelings of emasculation.
“As an Asian male, it extends to more than the career aspect,” Liu, who plays Jung on the show, said. “‘You can’t be athletic, you can’t be desirable, sexy, and attractive.’ These are all stereotypes that are put on us from Western media. And it’s impossible for us, each Asian person growing up, not to at least internalize that to some degree.”
By contrast, Bang discussed consciously eschewing over-sexualized roles as an Asian woman.
“The fact that I look the way I am immediately puts something on a character,” Bang said at the panel. “Even if it had nothing to do with being Asian, the minute that a character is being sexualized, being an Asian woman immediately makes it feel like, as an Asian woman, you’re being sexualized.”
Both in the panel discussion and interview, the actors underscored the importance of being attentive to blind spots within the Asian community, namely mental health, internalized racism, and South Asian identities.
“I think it's very important for our community to have these dialogues about how inclusive we are and how broad that label of ‘Asian’ is, and you know, what isn't included?” Liu said, who cited “Master of None” and “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” as personal favorite shows. “How can we be allies to each other, even when we might not necessarily look exactly alike.”
Liu identified Subtle Asian Traits, the Facebook group, as a potential platform for fostering dialogue among Asian millennials.
“I think the conversation starts among ourselves to say, ‘Listen, there are problematic things with our culture, one being the complete neglect or anything to do with mental health,’” he said. “Two, that our parents are actually extremely racist towards certain demographics and ethnicities. We need to be cognizant of that as well. And to able to talk about these things, we separate ourselves from our parents’ generation.”
In addressing Asian identity and diaspora, the panel also took on an added gravitas in light of Harvard’s ongoing lawsuit alleging race-based discrimination against Asian-American applicants, according to Kim.
“In light of the press that Harvard has been getting, considering its affirmative action trial…and the lower personality indexes of Asians that reports have been circulating, I think it’s important for Asians to come together to say, ‘Hey, we’re actually more than just what's on a piece of paper or a number,’” Kim said.
“I feel as if there's been a lot of like having to deflect negative publicity, as opposed to having positive publicity,” he added.
Liu also referenced the accusations of Asian-American applicants receiving lower “personal” ratings, citing a need to actively combat the model minority myth.
“It’s about owning the space that you're in,” Liu said. “That’s something that I feel like we as Asian people traditionally are not very good at. We're always taught to not cause a ruckus…We come into a room, we try to figure out who’s in charge, and we read it, and try not to make too much of a fuss.”
“What I'm saying is, sometimes, you’ve got to make a fuss,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I will never forget a moment in my Ethical Reasoning lecture sophomore spring when my professor asked the class if they thought African-American descendents of slaves should receive reparations. The class sat still and silent for a moment. You may wonder what I was thinking.
I glanced over at the only other black person in the room, thankfully a friend of mine, and decided to keep my hand down. Our professor was the type to hold a dialogue when a student made a comment, asking follow up questions. In section, this may be expected, but in a lecture even with a smaller-sized class, this felt like a defense. And what I was not going to do was be one of the token black people in the predominantly white classroom that was defending the people’s right for reparations. I had already been in many a room with this type of demographic at Harvard where issues dealing with underrepresented minorities were brought up, so I knew what that looked like, felt like, and was not ready for the required emotional labor at that time.
The standstill was broken when a white male student raised his hand and answered the question with a question. With a serious tone of voice, he asked the professor if he thought affirmative action could be considered reparations.
I was taken aback.
The professor, the poor man, must have then realized he had inadvertently touched on a tense subject. His conciliatory response was that some people may consider affirmative action as a form of reparations. He quickly moved on to the next subject.
Now, you may think my story is wild. But, ask almost any black student on this campus and I guarantee you, they will have a personal account to share. Many of them are more direct, biting, and outrageous than mine. My story doesn’t even end there, but for the purposes of this piece, you get the point. This moment was eye-opening for me.
In theory, I knew black students were accused of taking the spots of our white and even Asian-American counterparts in top universities because of so-called “affirmative action.” However, even though I attended a public high school in Texas, no one had ever questioned my college admissions success, at least to my face, that I had heard of. Maybe they were thinking it — I don’t know — and I never cared. I knew how hard I had worked and I recognized the miraculous grace of God on my life. Yet, witnessing that student raise his hand and boldly ask that question without regard for his fellow classmates of color was a wake-up call. Some of the students I share this campus with really consider me an affirmative action admit that filled a diversity quota.
So, when The Crimson broke the news last fall that Harvard favors those who fund it in the admissions process, I cackled. Though amusing, the news didn’t surprise me: I thought back to that moment from sophomore spring, and the irony was so clear. My response to the news story was only one out of a sea of people who looked like me and had experienced something similar.
Earlier this month when we learned about the college admissions fraud scandal, I was again unsurprised. This time though, the reactions saddened me. There were expressions of amusement, shock, anger, and justification. Some shed light on the more accepted inequities in the college admissions system. Others expanded on how wealth and power covertly operate within society’s fallacious meritocracies throughout the entire lifespan of the privileged. But, no one asked why we care so much?
Why do these stories matter enough to elicit such a response?
Surely, the public reveal of criminal or even ethically questionable, but accepted, methods of gaining college admission prove the realities of rampant inequality that many of us experience in our daily lives, try to speak out against, and raise awareness about. Nevertheless, it also says something about us that we look to these stories to secure our wavering sense of belonging in our environment.
I get it, and I don’t say this to silence us. Continue to speak. Post. Feel. But rather than allowing the question of our belonging to haunt us and allowing these stories to validate our existence here, why not turn the question on its head? Instead of asking if we, as black or underrepresented minority students, belong at Harvard, ask: Who does Harvard belong to? This question may open up even more complexities as we consider an answer, but it also shifts the focus. Is Harvard worthy of us? This bastion of education and excellence that was built for the privileged, many of who rose to power by oppressing others?
Harvard belongs to us, and we must refuse to let the actions, words, or structures that we encounter shake our resolve. We must continue to press forward, to uproot the dark foundation, and lay the groundwork for equality and justice. We, who were shut out not even 200 years ago. We, who have been. We, who grow in number. We, who are to come in a future that I pray will be more fair to us. We have just as much of a right as anyone.
Many of us struggle with imposter syndrome for different reasons. Sadly, the real deception — that we are the frauds — is something we have internalized. Yet, if anything, the recent news has shown us who the real impostors are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard first-year’s first Student Activities Fair is definitely one for the books. I clearly remember the enthusiastic shouting of upperclassmen begging me to comp their club, the shadows cast by countless posters touting impressive accomplishments of organizations, and the sagging bag of free promotional swag weighing down my shoulder as I navigated through the maze of new and exciting opportunities. College is the best time to explore something new, and I remember being eager to branch out of my comfort zone. I later learned that there is one caveat to Harvard’s thriving and inclusive extracurricular scene: To explore something new, you must already be good at it.
My first year was the first time I learned about what a comp is. Through rejection after rejection, I learned that acceptance rates don’t stop at college admissions; in fact, it is only amplified within Harvard’s walls through selective vetting processes and intense rounds of interviews that determine entry to many student organizations on campus. The same clubs that would ask nuanced questions about case interviews or hold auditions that span multiple hours of one’s day would also publicize their recruitment with a friendly slogan of “no experience necessary!” As someone with no experience, I quickly learned the irony of the statement.
To clarify, I am not simply whining about these organizations because I did not get into them. Since then, I have been lucky enough to find a community of support and inclusion in various organizations and have learned how to utilize the strengths I have and grow in areas of improvement.
Rather, I am critical of the fact that my first year — along with that of many others — was defined by unnecessary stress from comparing myself to my peers. Extracurriculars shifted from an exciting prospect of new experiences to yet another competitive indicator of “success” that divided those who came from privileged backgrounds and those who, like me, never had the opportunity to learn the inherent skills that enabled one to pass the initial screening for student clubs. Clubs that seek the best of the best will inevitably have a selection criteria for its members, and that’s fine. But how true is the “no experience necessary” clause, in that case?
Furthermore, exclusivity in student organizations has come to define Harvard’s social scene. Many of our clubs have a vetting process based on social compatibility or fit with the organization, such as the Hasty Pudding. Others require an application or an interview, such as the Harvard College Consulting Group or the Crimson Key Society. Although a process of selection is understandable to an extent, some clubs are notorious for their rigorous and mysterious standards for entry, and the allure for joining becomes increasingly attributed to prestige. That’s exactly what we need in a campus full of students already plagued with imposter syndrome and insecurity about their experiences compared to others.
In my eyes, comps actually have great potential. They pose an opportunity to teach students about valuable skills that may serve them not just in the organization but within the workplace and their personal lives as well. Comps also allow the student to gauge the social and functional dynamic of a club so that both current and prospective members can determine whether the organization is a good fit.
But none of this requires any aspect of unnecessary exclusivity. If more clubs adopted a completion-based comp — one focused more on educating and supporting prospective members rather than handpicking those already with ample experience — then perhaps our campus culture would adopt an environment more conducive to personal growth rather than the toxic atmosphere of competitiveness, insecurity, and stress we have today.
The College’s Committee on Student Life has recognized this problem and has generated conversation about a potential “audit” over comp processes for student organizations. I’m personally not sure how effective this may be or whether introducing a new factor of potential bias might make things even worse. However, it is a step in the right direction. At the very least, it recognizes that there is a serious problem outside of the classroom.
As students of this institution, we are all capable of learning something new despite how we may feel otherwise. We came to Harvard to grow as thinkers, creatives, and scholars, and college truly is the best time to explore something new. If the organizations run by our peers systematically prevent us from doing so, then it’s time we make opportunities more accessible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 19th century, Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz commissioned several daguerreotypes of slaves in his search to prove a scientific theory of white supremacy. These photographs, believed to be some of the oldest photos of American slaves in existence, were rediscovered in 1976 and today are housed in the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
Last week, Tamara K. Lanier filed a landmark suit against Harvard in Middlesex Superior Court alleging that the University unlawfully possesses and profits from these photos. According to the complaint, the photos depict Lanier’s great-great-great grandfather, Renty, and his daughter, Delia. In her suit, Lanier asks that Harvard give her the photographs and the profits made from them, as well as pay punitive damages.
Harvard’s continued possession of and profit from these images is unethical and illegitimate. If a fair and evaluative due process concludes that the University is legally liable, we would support Harvard offering at minimum the dollar amount it has made from the possession and licensing of these photographs as well as returning them to their rightful owner.
These photographs are part of a long history of Harvard and its peer institutions using the social sciences to help create the systems of thought underpinning racial supremacy and oppression — systems that have in turn produced a lasting legacy of suffering, generational trauma, and abiding ignorance. In light of that history, Harvard should take this opportunity to think critically about how its scholarship has yielded intellectual systems that perpetuate oppression and how it can address this role.
In failing to adequately engage with Lanier’s 2011 letter to then-University President Drew G. Faust regarding the photos and documentation of her ancestry, the University missed an opportunity to seriously grapple with deeply-troubling aspects of its institutional legacy before legal action was taken. Given the wealth of artifacts in Harvard’s possession, Lanier’s request may not be the last of its kind. As such, Harvard should use this opportunity to develop a standard protocol for proactively responding to these requests. Such a protocol will need to determine and acknowledge rightful ownership as well as envisage a method for ethically returning artifacts and offering compensation to affected families.
But Harvard cannot stop there. On a deeper, more systemic level, the University must do the hard work of taking a critical approach to its possession, use, and continued acquisition of intellectual property and cultural artifacts. After all, these artifacts aren’t merely things of the past. The methodologies and canons that allowed for the theft of this cultural and intellectual property live on in our University and its departments of human inquiry.
We have previously argued that one way to begin this work is to develop an Ethnic Studies department on par with those found at comparable institutions. But given that Harvard has dragged its feet on this issue for almost half a century, we also encourage Harvard to develop other institutionally-embedded and meaningful forums for discussion of ethical research methods and more socially conscious ways of engaging with and creating knowledge.
While we recognize that Harvard has begun to do so, not least at a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study conference Lanier herself attended in 2017, we worry that Harvard has not done so in a sufficiently self-reflective manner. The very images in question, for example, were used as materials for this conference. The University should recognize that this was insensitive, and it must be more thoughtful about how it presents and conducts these discussions in future.
It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Today we call upon Harvard to offer both: to return an unethically captured photograph and to step with clear purpose into an urgent dialogue about how its research has and continues to perpetuate deep inequality and intellectual injustice.

This spring break, we asked our writers to keep in touch with a postcard. Thankfully, no postage was necessary: we recieved four digital dispatches from cities across (and just outside) the country. Spring break forever!
The summer before my senior year of high school, after three years of riding the school bus, I finally got a beat-up Ford Taurus. While driving myself to school for the first time, I realized I didn’t know how get there. I relied on Google Maps to navigate, and my friends made fun of my hopeless sense of direction.
This spring break, my navigation skills were once again put to the test. A high school friend flew from our small-town suburb to Boston, and I had to direct us from the airport to campus. Luckily, this time around, I knew the route: Silver Line Bus, South Station, Red Line, Harvard Square. This was the first of many navigation tasks.
I used my internal map of campus to lead her through a day in my life at Harvard. At our first stop, Widener Library, I found myself explaining its origins, repeating stories I’d overheard from passing tour guides: “When Harry Elkins Widener from the Class of 1907 passed away in the Titanic…” Next, I took her to Smith Center, where I made her touch the wall covered in plants to prove to her it was real. We then observed glass flowers in the Natural History Museum — plants that weren’t real.
As I temporarily assumed the role of Harvard tour guide, I realized the extent of my campus knowledge, and not just in a geographic sense. As a freshman from an underrepresented area in Georgia, I sometimes felt like an outsider; as though everyone knew more than I did about my college. But this break, I realized that I knew how to get to and from Boston, I knew the best place for ramen, and I knew which buildings were nice on both the outside and the inside. For the first time, I felt like an insider. It was a jarring shift in perspective.
To my friend, of course, I wasn’t different from any of the other students who roamed campus and claimed ownership of the space. I was just another one of them: a student traipsing around campus without any help from Google Maps.

I’ve never really believed in “you had to be there” moments. Coming from a family of avid, gesticulating Jewish storytellers, I’m opposed to an expression that signals insularity. In my family, we adhere to the belief that almost all experiences are describable with a just-right phrase or well-timed gesture.
Before I left for college, this belief was an unwavering foundation of my relationship with my mother. If there was something I didn’t outright tell her (a rarity), we lived in a silent awareness that she probably already knew. Living in the same home allowed for this sort of symbiosis.
So, when I first came home from college over Thanksgiving last November, I was struck by my inability to successfully communicate my experiences to her. I would start off a story excitedly, trying to detail a new friend or describe every element of a bad day, only to catch myself grasping for words or caught in a sea of Harvard jargon. At first, I resisted this new inability to share. Our regular kitchen table lunches continued on far past their usual half-hour expiration. Still, I found there were some things, however important, that I was suddenly reluctant to tell her. Instead of settling themselves through sharing, certain stories seemed to become tainted in the act of telling.
When I arrived home for spring break last week, I began that futile cycle again. A few days into break, over our usual Chinese take-out order, my mom reminded me that, on the night before leaving for college, I had admitted an acute fear that I would arrive home again to find that our shared world had changed.
“It doesn’t feel that way,” I told her, when she referenced the earlier conversation. “It feels continuous.”
And it does: the smells, the neighbors who never age, the sound of sports radio at 7 p.m. Before going to college, I worried that I’d have to lose that world to gain a new one. But now it seems that leaving home is not a zero sum game; it’s an opportunity to add new worlds to the ones that already exist. Admittedly, some of these worlds do, in fact, gain outsized significance from experiencing them yourself, from having “been there.”
My initial mistake in trying to explain college to my mother, I realize, was in attempting to describe in full my own new world, instead of elucidating elements of the one we shared. In this egg roll induced epiphany, I realized that my mother, the person I feel closest to in the world, had, for my whole life, carried many worlds with her that would garner only puzzled expressions from me. This, perhaps, is the reason we leave home — to find worlds for ourselves that you really do have to be there to experience.

This spring break, we asked our writers to keep in touch with a postcard. Thankfully, no postage was necessary: we recieved four digital dispatches from cities across (and just outside) the country. Spring break forever!
For most of their marriage, my parents have lived in Iowa City, Iowa. They love every bit of its crunchy-granola yet Midwestern vibe, but this winter, Iowa City endured record-breaking cold temperatures. After 36 years, this was the final straw: they were finally ready to migrate South. This Spring Break, we took a trip to find a new, warmer home. There were two requirements: The city must have good food and warmer weather. As a Yelp Elite member, I was tasked with finding the restaurants, so we set out on a culinary tour of the South.
***
"This looks like Greece!" my dad observed of St. Augustine, Fla.
"I thought you said Spain. It looks like Spain,” my mom countered.
"Oh. Ok, yeah, but there's a gyro place!"
St. Augustine was nice, but a bit touristy for my parents' taste: They didn't love the abundance of "someone from St. Augustine loves me!" stores. The saving grace was a great Polish diner. My mom, who was born in Poland, loved the borsch at Gaufre's and Goods.
My mom decided that Savannah, Ga., was “livable.”
I ran into someone from Iowa on the street in Savannah. I guess it’s just that kind of place. At Kayak Kafe I didn’t check the Yelp photos thoroughly enough, so I ordered the wrong dish. But my parents ate hearty salads: tomatoes, shrimp, fancy cheese. For dessert, we got ice cream,but we had to stand in line for half an hour. Coming from Iowa, home to more cows than people, this seemed egregious.
In Columbia, S.C., I didn’t even “check-in” at any restaurants on Yelp. Instead, I got a haircut that lasted maybe four minutes but cost $30, and I saw Beto O’Rourke speak about reconstruction and the history of the South. My parents will not be moving here.
Charlotte, N.C., has a brewery scene so vibrant it almost made my parents consider moving there. However, my parents weren’t expecting Charlotte to be so big. They want to live somewhere they don’t have to drive much, and this didn’t seem possible in Charlotte.
I fell asleep in the car ride to Chapel Hill, N.C., and if someone woke me up saying “we’re back in Iowa City!” I would have believed them. My mom and I enjoyed Indian food at Vimala’s Curryblossom Cafe, but my dad, a picky eater, didn’t find any food he liked in Chapel Hill.
I had assumed my parents would end up in Savannah — which catered to everyone’s palates — but my mom just texted me that Wilmington, N.C.a is at the top of their list. I guess all they needed was a city without me?

When we enter the Mather House Woodturning Studio on a Friday evening, Jack B. Smith ’19 accosts us with a small slab of Hawthorn wood.
“Smell it!” he insists.
Smith has been a regular at this studio since his freshman year. Hidden in the basement of Mather, the studio provides a space for students to practice the art of woodturning. Here, budding woodturners use hand tools and a lathe, a machine that rotates wood, to carve round items such as bowls, cups, tool handles, and candlesticks.
The wood that Smith holds came straight from the limb of a Hawthorn tree in the Adams House courtyard, which snapped after a snow storm.
“Whenever trees come down around campus, I try to be the first one there,” Smith says. “People text me when they hear chainsaws.”
A few minutes later, Smith’s mentor, Alan Hark, enters the studio and admires Smith’s prize. “That’s a big thing in the community,” he says. “Salvaging wood.”
Hark is a master woodturner. He has been teaching his craft in the Mather basement for the past 15 years, and working with wood for almost 50, having begun his career as a logger in Vermont. He continues to live there, commuting to Cambridge each weekend to teach.
Decades ago, Hark became ill and was unable to continue logging, transitioning into health care advocacy instead. Seeking a hobby that would allow him to continue with his passion for working with wood, he began woodturning in the early 1980s.
When he started turning, he says, there was no “real formal instruction” available. Using the only book available on the market at the time and a trial-and-error process, Hark refined his craft over the subsequent decades.
“What I found was that the ‘centering’ effect of turning was beneficial to my emotional and intellectual balancing, thus offering a greater sense of wellbeing,” he says.
He eventually retired from his advocacy job in 1998 and began pursuing woodturning professionally.
Hark ended up in Boston because, as he says, “there was a lady that I was pursuing” who lived a couple blocks away from Harvard’s campus. For several years, he maintained a high-end gallery trade up and down the East Coast and produced custom work for collectors and museums.
He performed woodturning demonstrations in the Porter Square store Rockler Woodworking and Hardware to drum up some attention for the craft. These demonstrations eventually led to a job teaching woodturning through the Cambridge Center for Adult Education at Rockler, where Hark continues to teach on weekends.
In the spring of 2003, one of Hark’s adult education students, Aaron S. Allen, a Mather resident tutor, approached Hark after class and asked him if he would be interested in teaching a class at Harvard. After Hark agreed, he and Allen conducted what Hark calls a “midnight raid” of the Radcliffe Quadrangle, where they recovered an old, unused lathe sitting in a basement.
That lathe, an addition to Hark’s own, was the first lathe of the Harvard woodturning program.
Hark’s first formal classes at Harvard began in the spring of 2004. Since then, the program has seen the tenure of three University presidents.
“There's one other person that's been here at the house longer than me, and that's Miguel [Casillas, Mather’s Building Manager],” Hark says.
Hark currently teaches a beginner woodturning course on Friday afternoons, followed by courses for experienced turners on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons. The program is open to all Harvard affiliates.
Smith attends beginner classes as an instructor and returner courses as Hark’s student. “There's nobody with decades of experience teaching the traditional craft,” he says. “Having access to his knowledge is really singular.”
Smith began turning wood in high school by looking at Instagram posts and watching YouTube videos. Arriving at Harvard with “minimal experience,” he read an old Crimson article about the woodshop in Mather’s basement and went down to meet Hark as a freshman.
“He and I hit it off, and we've been close friends ever since,” he says. Now, before the Friday night returner classes, Smith and Hark usually catch up over dinner together in Mather dining hall.
Last year, when Smith was working at Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, he found out that a favorite ornamental Japanese cherry tree was coming down outside of the Center for the Environment. Wasting no time, he retrieved a three-foot-tall chunk of wood from the wreckage before rushing to a meeting at the office.
“I ended up rolling in with this piece of tree, which caught their attention,” Smith says.
A few months later, when former University President Drew G. Faust announced her resignation, the Office for Sustainability commissioned Smith to turn a bowl in her honor. Smith decided to use the wood from that tree.
Smith stained the outside of the bowl black, carving designs that resembled a traditional antebellum egg and dart crown molding pattern — a nod to Faust’s expertise in antebellum history.
“She thought it was great. She loved it,” Smith says proudly. “Now, if the office has other commissions, they know where to find us.”
Despite the general lack of familiarity with woodturning, Smith notes its increasing popularity among those in his generation.
“There's been a resurgence in woodturning and traditional woodcarving in the last decade,” Smith says. “People our age will get into it and then meet someone like Alan.”
The opportunity to share the artform with younger generations and foster a greater appreciation for woodturning is what brings Hark down from Vermont every weekend.
“A lot of people in the woodturning movement, during the early years of the century, were mostly old guys,” Hark says. “I saw this as a good opportunity to start bringing young people into a familiarity with woodturning, which now has become the big push with the American Association of Woodturners.”
During class, Hark walks from student to student, giving pointers and sharpening their tools as needed. Smith stays in the corner, working on turning a bowl made of yellow birch wood that Hark has brought from Vermont. Mather House residents en route to basement laundry rooms peer into the studio, curious about the buzzing sound of the turning lathes.
“Best kept secret of Harvard Arts,” Smith says.

In early March, Harvard released the Pulse Survey, a 10-question, anonymous questionnaire on inclusion and belonging. The survey seeks to provide a platform for every member of the University community to voice their opinions on campus culture and how to improve it. The last item requests, “Please suggest one or two concrete actions that you believe would improve the climate for all members of the Harvard community.”
The Pulse Survey is not the first Harvard-centric site to use anonymity to its advantage. In the past year, three anonymous online platforms have taken up this imperative to create digital communities: the Facebook groups “Overheard at Harvard” and “Harvard Confessions,” and the Yik Yak doppelganger Yard.chat.
“Most of the reason why I created Overhead was because there was not really a sense of overall Harvard community,” says Elynna Y. Chang ’21, founder, administrator, and co-moderator of “Overheard at Harvard.” Since the group’s creation in September 2018, its 3,807 members have posted hundreds of quotes heard around campus.
The most visible online social spaces for Harvard students are class year Facebook groups and the group “Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens” according to Chang. Even though the barriers to admission into the meme group are low, Chang explains its persistent exclusivity: “You must think of something funny and relatable to everyone, and then you must put it into meme format so that everyone understands.” In contrast, Overheard’s anonymous quote-sharing format facilitates the relatively quick and painless transcription of funny quips or bizarre remarks. The person posting also isn’t assumed to have submitted their own words, which relieves some pressure to produce likeable content.
The most popular posts generate floods of reactions and comments, most of which tag friends who could find the content relatable. One of Overheard’s most popular posts has over 260 reactions and 75 comments, and reads, “‘They found out that international students are twice as likely to be put in the quad.’ ‘Well, they’re already used to being overseas.’” Other content reflects the campus zeitgeist, whether it be midterms or housing assignments, as well as timeless themes like the difficulties of dating and the perils of problem sets.
Last semester, Chang started up a new Facebook page, “Harvard Confessions.” People message the page with their confessions, and moderators then number and post the nameless confessions publicly. While Chang says Overheard attracts more widely accepted “relatable” content, Harvard Confessions’ complete anonymity encourages people to post “things that everyone's feeling [but] that they're just afraid to say,” says Chang. Posts on the page contain everything from gushing compliments to searing complaints to sexual innuendos. Many confessions mention specific individuals. Other posts are more comedic. “I better be confession 100,” reads confession #101.
While the page’s anonymity allows Harvard students to more freely express their thoughts, moderators have to draw ethical lines and intervene when posts cross them. Initially, members could post directly to all other members of the group without any sort of vetting process. However, one day Chang checked her phone and found a post about overhearing a student describe “in very graphic detail how they would like kill their TF.”
She immediately deleted the post and wrote a long post in the group. “I was just like, please do not post anything that's related to violence or anything like that,” she says.
Since then, all posts to Overheard have required moderator approval. Chang and a team of seven administrators and moderators eliminate vulgar or targeted content, which they classify at their discretion. They filter out posts that mention anyone by name or include violence, sexual content, homophobia, and sexism.
Moderation doesn’t prevent controversial content and debate. Beyond garnering solidarity around shared secrets, Harvard Confessions once hosted an impassioned anonymous debate about “selling out.” Confession #108 admits to taking a job at Goldman Sachs, saying that they were “shunned from orgs, public service programs, and called a snake.” The student claimed that their job allowed their family to afford medical care for their father. Confession #131 responded to #108, blaming Goldman Sachs and similar companies for contributing to the situations of “families like yours [who] have to endure financial instability for lifesaving drugs.”
Later, Confession #135 comes to #108’s defense, condemning #131’s comment as “bizarrely inconsiderate.”
This sort of debate is aligned with Yard.chat’s stated purpose to “air opinions.” As stated in the website’s FAQ, it aims to address a problem with the University’s climate: “Harvard is a place where it is difficult to be vulnerable or controversial.” The site embraces anonymity as a useful tool, suggesting that “people are more willing to post their opinions when their reputations will remain intact, even if a majority disagree.” However, Yard.chat community members maintain the power not only to express opinions but also to censor posts: 10 downvotes on a post equals an automatic deletion.
Yard.chat’s moderator anticipates the “unsavory effects of anonymity” in the website’s FAQ, maintaining the final say over the platform's content. One frequently asked question reads: “Is this a free speech platform? Nope. Ultimately, I will determine what is good and what is bad.”
The moderator of Yard.chat declined to speak on the record for this story.
While Yard.chat intends primarily to spark silenced dialogue on campus, the site’s most popular post reads “Upvote for John from Annenberg” — a relatable, community-oriented celebration of a well-known freshmen dining hall staff member.

A different post critiquing Harvard’s Primal Scream ritual sparked reactions. It reads, “Primal scream be like: 🧑🏼👩🏼🧑🏼👩🏼🧑🏼👩🏼🧑🏼🧑🏼🧑🏾🧑🏼👩,” claiming a lack of racial diversity among the event’s participants. While it received 44 upvotes, there were only 4 replies and no dissenting opinions.
More explicit opinions also also appear in the feed. For instance, one user writes, “Harvard undoubtedly discriminates against Asian Americans in admissions. Affirmative action is bullshit.” The post received 9 upvotes but failed to generate a single reply.
Moderators’ and users’ perception of the freeing effects of anonymity reveals the perceived constricting quality of in-person dialogue, perhaps specifically at Harvard, or more broadly. The cloak of anonymity has a clear appeal. With 158 Harvard confessions, over 140 Yard.chat posts, and hundreds of Overheard at Harvard quotes, Harvard’s anonymous online platforms continue to humor procrastinating campus dwellers, whether or not they effectively build the community or foster the dialogue that students seek.

For Christian Siriano, a fashion designer and member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, making headlines is nothing new. Siriano won Season 4 of Project Runway, a fashion reality TV show, and, since then, has launched his own label. Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, and Michelle Obama, among dozens of other celebrities, have worn his clothes on the red carpet. On Monday, chatted with The Crimson about returning to Project Runway as a mentor, his inspirations, and gender inclusivity in fashion. Siriano will speak at the evening keynote panel for Harvard’s first gender equity summit on Apr. 2. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: What is your favorite thing about working in fashion?
CS: I love the idea of transformation. I always have thought that was really interesting. I think it’s a really beautiful, cool thing to see that people transform their whole life. It’s this idea of wearing one thing to another that can transform your whole world. I think it’s really interesting. And that can mean a lot of different things, but I think it’s an exciting part of why I like doing it still.
FM: Speaking of transformations, you celebrated your brand’s ten year anniversary last year. If you could go back in time ten years and give yourself a piece of advice, what’s one thing you would tell yourself?
CS: I would probably tell myself that the business is really hard. Fashion can be really tough and kind of unforgiving sometimes. But I think I’d tell myself to remember all the great moments, to try to focus on those and not focus so much on the things that didn’t work out.
FM: You’re providing workroom feedback to the contestants of Project Runway this season. How did it feel to take on the role of mentor this time around?
CS: It’s been cool! It’s nice — there’s a younger generation of designers, and I’m happy that I can help inspire them. I hope I guide them, as also being a designer in the business. Hopefully, that’s helpful for them. I think that certain challenges that they might have, I have a little more experience dealing with in real life. I think that that can only help them.
FM: On that note, what’s something that you’d like to see in this new generation of designers?
CS: I want to see everything! I want to see creativity and taking risks. That’s kind of the whole thing you can do in this business — taking as many risks as possible is kind of the only thing you can do. And it’s such an important thing to be yourself. Go for it. Just try everything and explore your imagination.
FM: What kind of things do you think about when you’re doing your own creative work and taking your own risks? What inspires you while you’re designing?
CS: I mean, everything inspires me. I think it’s one of those things where I just kind of let my imagination run wild. If a place or a trip or something inspires me, I think about a dream fantasy world of what it might be like, if it’s like Morocco, even if I have never been. I kind of create a fantasy world around it. So I think that’s why my collections always feel like that.
FM: Your work made headlines at the Academy Awards this year when Billy Porter wore one of your gowns. Could you tell us a bit more about what you think about the importance of size and gender inclusivity in fashion?
CS: There’s a million things. Obviously, I think that we’re in a business that celebrates people, and celebrates all the different kinds of people that are in it. At the end of the day, I think that designers, we’re here to service all those different types of people. So I don’t know, I’ve never really thought it about it so much where I was like, “Oh, why wouldn’t we dress this person or why would we dress that person?” Especially in sizes. I think sizes have always been important. I think it’s very important to make sure that women who are size zero or two have something, but also who are size twenty can have something. I think that range is just something that everybody should be thinking about.
I think with Billy, it was really just that he wanted to be himself on that red carpet, and I think that being himself was wearing a fabulous gown. We didn’t think so much about how it would change people’s minds and perception of the world, but we’re really proud that it did, because I think a young generation could look at that and be like, “Oh, I can wear whatever I want to wear because people like Billy did!” So I think that’s a pretty cool thing.
FM: You’ll be speaking on a panel for the gender equity summit at Harvard next week. Can you talk a bit about how you got involved with the panel, and how you think about gender when you’re designing?
CS: I was so happy to be asked to be a part of it, and I’m so glad that Laverne [Cox] and Nicolette [Mason] are going to be on the panel as well, because I’m good friends with both of them. I think what’s so interesting is for me now, it’s becoming that I just don’t think about [gender] that way. I kind of think that clothes are just clothes, and you can be anyone and wear them. I think that’s the new rule of the new world — it’s not really mens- and womenswear, it’s kind of like if you want to wear a dress, you should be able to wear a dress, and who really cares? That’s the funny thing about clothes — we’re just putting on clothes and going out for our day. It’s not so serious. That’s what I think about a lot. People should just dress how they want to feel.
FM: How would you describe your work and your personal style?
CS: I want people to feel empowered by what they’re wearing, so I think the clothes are very emotional. I’d like them to feel very elegant and romantic, and I definitely like them to feel powerful without being anything. Sometimes they can be the simplest suits, clean and modern, and have a presence so when you walk into a room wearing something from our collection, people can really feel it. I really like that the clothes give emotion.

This spring break, we asked our writers to keep in touch with a postcard. Thankfully, no postage was necessary: we recieved four digital dispatches from cities across (and just outside) the country. Spring break forever!
Presidential candidate Andrew Yang got married in Puerto Rico. And, according to his campaign website, he wants to make it an American state.
In September 2017, Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean Island. The Category 4 storm killed 2,975 people and cost the territory’s government $43 billion. As the Puerto Rican government has worked to rebuild its cities, the United States has threatened to cut aid to the region. Yang, the entrepreneur-turned-Democratic-candidate, called this response “deeply immoral.”
When my friends asked me if I wanted to join them on their spring break trip to San Juan, I wasn’t aware of the island’s history. I wasn’t aware the region became a U.S. territory in 1898 — but because it isn’t recognized as a state, it isn’t able to file for bankruptcy.
I said yes because I wanted a break from the Cambridge cold and a date with a book on the beach. When I arrived, I found a city brimming with color and a population filled with pride. There was color on every street. Plazas, churches, castles, and restaurants were all covered with vibrant blocks of paint. But the more I explored San Juan, the more I noticed the frustrations lying beneath the vibrant surface.
On our second day, we ordered an Uber to take us to old San Juan. Ernesto, a stocky man with a kind face and hoarse voice, picked us up. Soon after we sat down, he offered to take us on a tour of the city at no extra cost. He spent the next half hour twisting his six-seater through narrow cobblestone roads, passing along recommendations and praising the spirit of his people.
But the next day, we encountered the younger generation’s more skeptical perspective. Our second cab driver was a twenty-two-year-old man with a high-pitched voice. When I asked him how he likes his home, he explained that he was frustrated at the government for failing to make the most of the country’s potential. “Puerto Rico could be a Disneyland,” he said. “It could be a playground for the world.”
Several referenda have made it clear that the people of Puerto Rico desire recognition as a state. In 2017, 97 percent of an admittedly small 23 percent voter turnout expressed this at the polls. If my time in San Juan is anything to go by, Andrew Yang might just be onto something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael H. Brown ’83 and Lesley F. Rosenthal ’86 have been elected the next president and vice chair of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, the University announced Thursday.
Brown and Rosenthal have both served on the Board of Overseers since 2014. They will succeed current Overseer president Susan L. Carney ’73 and Vice Chair Gwill E. York ’79.
The Board of Overseers’ responsibilities include advising top Harvard administrators, providing input on decisions about the direction of the University, and approving certain actions by the University’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation. The Board, comprised of alumni who serve six-year terms on the board, are elected by fellow alumni via mail-in ballot each spring. Brown and Rosenthal will serve in their respective leadership roles for the final year of their terms.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow praised Brown and Rosenthal in a press release for their work as Overseers and said he is “delighted” to continue working with them in their new leadership roles.
“Our Board of Overseers plays a vital role in assuring Harvard’s constant commitment to the ideals of truth, excellence, and opportunity,” Bacow said. “Michael Brown and Lesley Rosenthal embody the leadership and dedication that our Overseers bring to the work of the governing boards, and I’m both grateful to them for their service and delighted at the prospect of working even more closely with them next year.”
As an Overseer, Brown chaired the board’s standing committee on social sciences and has served on a number of the board’s committees including the executive, institutional policy, schools, College, and continuing education groups. He has also served on the visiting committees for the Government and Sociology departments.
Brown — the founder of the education nonprofit City Year — worked as a legislative assistant for Leon E. Panetta during his time in the House of Representatives. He also served as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer while he was a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston prior to transitioning to nonprofit work.
Brown said in the press release that he is “honored” by his appointment.
“Harvard has played a transformational role in my life, and I am forever grateful,” Brown said. “It’s a privilege to serve this remarkable University, with Lesley Rosenthal and our dedicated fellow Overseers, under President Bacow’s inspired leadership, and alongside the members of the Corporation, administration, faculty, students, and alumni, to support Harvard’s vital mission to advance scholarship, learning, and leadership development.”
Rosenthal — who serves as the chief operating officer and corporate secretary of the Juilliard School — previously served as executive vice president, general counsel, and secretary over 13 years at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
In her role as an Overseer, Rosenthal chairs the standing committee on humanities and arts in addition to serving on the board’s executive committee; committees on finance, administration, and management; and the governing board’s joint inspection committee. She also is a member of the visiting committees for the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Graduate School of Design, and the Department of the History of Art and Architecture.
“It has been exciting to see the University’s progress during my years on the board, including in critical areas such as the arts and humanities as well as inclusion and belonging,” Rosenthal said. “I’m grateful to work alongside Michael Brown and my other terrific colleagues to serve Harvard and help refine and advance its priorities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen Harvard College juniors have been selected as members of the first cohort of the Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows Program, a collaborative initiative between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Harvard Business School that seeks to bridge technology and entrepreneurship through courses, workshops, and seminars.
Through the program, 10 to 15 juniors from any academic concentration will have the opportunity to enroll in up to two Business School MBA electives, participate in expert-led case discussions, and attend the Business School Startup Bootcamp to learn about developing and scaling a startup company.
The program’s launch was facilitated by a $10 million gift from Thomas S. Roberts and his wife Kristen through their family foundation in celebration of Roberts’s 30th and 35th Business School reunions.
Roberts said the idea for creating a program focused on providing undergraduates with tools to explore the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship had been a point of discussion between himself, his wife, and administrators at SEAS and the Business School for some time.
“We thought that the creation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Allston — essentially right next to the Business School — created just an incredible opportunity for supporting greater integration between the Business School and Harvard undergrads,” he said.
Roberts added that this increased integration could bring significant benefits for not only the Harvard community but also the greater Boston area, if fellows were to establish new local businesses.
Computer Science Professor Hanspeter Pfister, who co-chairs the program along with Business Administration Professor Thomas R. Eisenmann ’79, said the idea for the program arose out of his observation that many undergraduates were unsure how to translate their ideas for technology ventures into viable business models.
“I very frequently have students in my office that have very cool ideas for either startups or for technology projects that they would like to push forward,” Pfister said. “Very often, I notice that there is an interest in the technology and maybe even some technology background, but there is a lack of understanding of the business side of those endeavors.”
Eisenmann said this disconnect presented a unique opportunity to strengthen ties between HBS and the College. Historically, undergraduates are only able to enroll in Business School MBA courses with the written permission of the dean of the MBA program, leaving many Business Schools faculty without ways — but with a “real appetite” — to share what they teach with the “amazing group of students across the river.”
“Now, for the very first time, there’s this real collaboration between [SEAS, the Business School, and the College] where we have this opportunity for College students to be part of the Business School program,” Pfister said. “I think that’s very exciting and kind of historic.”
As part of the Technology Innovation Program, fellows will be able to enroll in select Business School MBA courses that pertain to technology, innovation, or entrepreneurship without having to first receive approval from the dean of the MBA program, according to Eisenmann. They will also be able to take HBS’s online Credential of Readiness program — a 10- to 12-week course on business fundamentals that normally costs $2,250 — free of charge.
Eisenmann said another distinctive component of the Technology Innovation Program is the opportunity for fellows to participate in the Business School Startup Bootcamp, a week-long immersion program in which first-year Business School MBA candidates learn key skills required for early-stage entrepreneurs such as team assembly and finance management.
During the bootcamp, fellows can form their own or join existing small teams to brainstorm ideas for new ventures, develop them through various exercises and workshops, and present them at the end of the week to a panel of experts comprised of venture capitalists and seasoned entrepreneurs.
Pfister said the first cohort of fellows was selected using a number of criteria, including a record of academic excellence at Harvard and a demonstrated passion for leadership and problem-solving. The inaugural class of 14 fellows, who were notified in February of their selection, boasts diverse interests, startup experiences, and concentrations, which range from Mechanical Engineering to Government to History and Science.
Kemi E. Akenzua ’20, a fellow studying History and Science, wrote in an emailthat the first few months of the program have already been very educational.
“We had a case study workshop with Tom Eisenmann, a design thinking workshop with [SEAS Computer Science Professor] Krzysztof Gajos, and met with the inaugural MS/MBA students,” she wrote.
SEAS and the Business School have recently partnered to launch the MS/MBA joint degree program, which confers an MBA from the Business School and a Master of Science in Engineering Sciences from SEAS. The inaugural class of 29 students began their studies in August 2018.
Several fellows said the program appealed to their personal interests in the intersection of technology and business, which they have honed through internship experiences and courses taken at Harvard.
Vicky Xu ’20, a fellow studying Applied Math and a Crimson design editor, said she has always been curious about how technology and cities interact, especially with regards to urbanization and increased demands for more efficiency.
For Akenzua, the program’s novelty presents both challenges and opportunities to influence its growth.
“We’re very excited to be here and to be a part of the inaugural class but there’s no Q guide to look through or alums to consult — we’re really charting our own path, which is exciting but also unprecedented,” she wrote.
Sean H. Murphy ’20, a fellow studying Statistics, said one of his main goals in participating in the program is to create an “intergenerational relationship” between the inaugural group of fellows and subsequent cohorts.
“I’m very excited about being able to meet people — not just at the Business School but also the fellows. I think it’s a good opportunity to try to develop a community that I can go back to and consult, possibly partner up with after Harvard,” Murphy said.
The application to join the next cohort of Technology Innovation Fellows, which is open to current College sophomores, is due April 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students from Harvard Law School’s Pipeline Parity Project and other law students across the country continued their campaign this week against mandatory arbitration clauses — provisions of employment contracts that require employees to settle disputes through a private arbiter rather than bringing their concerns to the courts.
Following the group’s success in lobbying law firms like Kirkland & Ellis and Sidley Austin to drop their mandatory arbitration policies in December 2018, the student organization turned their efforts to firms DLA Piper and Venable with site visits in Boston and Washington, D.C. this week.
The Pipline Parity Project also sent an open letter Tuesday to the National Association for Law Placement — an organization providing advice and information to those looking to work in the legal profession — calling on them to publicly disclose whether law firms use mandatory arbitration clauses.
“We are law students who are deeply concerned that many law firms require their employees to sign forced arbitration agreements with non-disclosure provisions as a condition of employment,” the letter reads. “We hope that NALP will use its influence to collect and disseminate this information, which is critical to us as we make important decisions about our futures.”
Sejal Singh, a Law School student and one of the open letter’s authors, said recruiting procedures for some law firms make students susceptible to signing arbitration clauses when firms do not disclose them early in the hiring process.
“Students are hired for a private sector job, in particular, very far in advance. Once you accept your offer you cannot just go back and find another job if you find out six months later that your employer is going to force you to sign away your right to sue if your rights are violated,” Singh said. “So, of course, we are very concerned about it.”
NALP did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday, but did acknowledge the open letter on their Twitter account Tuesday, tweeting that they will consider these requests during their upcoming 2020 data collection cycle.
“Our Board of Directors already has this question on their radar and will discuss at their April meeting,” the tweet reads.
Members of the Pipeline Parity Project travelled to DLA Piper’s Boston office Tuesday to hand out leaflets, while law students from Georgetown’s law school visited Venable’s offices in the nation’s capital.
“We had some kind of flyers with information about what these firms are doing and made sure that folks who are going into the offices know about this policy,” Kurt D. Walters, a Pipeline Parity Project member, said.
Walters said some employees at DLA Piper’s office were surprised after reading the materials.
“Basically, the reaction is, ‘why would this company do this?’ And it's a very good question. And I don't think that DLA Piper has a very good answer for why they do this,” Walters said.
Both Venable and DLA Piper did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.
Walters said the Pipieline Parity Project will not end its efforts until they’ve eliminated the agreements at major firms.
“The law students who are looking toward their future careers care about whether they have recourse in an unsafe work environment, and whether their employers are going to create a safe work environment, and this is not going to go away for DLA Piper until they do the right thing,” Walters said.

The Faculty Council voted to endorse a proposal to retain “shopping week” until at least 2022 at its biweekly meeting Wednesday.
The Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s highest governing body — first heard the proposal at its previous meeting, alongside the final report of an ad hoc committee tasked with recommending changes to shopping week, a Harvard scheduling quirk in which students can sample classes during the first week of the semester before enrolling.
The committee publicly released its report Wednesday on its website, outlining what they viewed as key benefits of the current system as well as changes that could eliminate the drawbacks of that system.
In the report, committee members wrote that the largest problem posed by the current system is “uncertainty around course enrollments.” They recommended using “sophisticated algorithms” to try to predict course registration, using enrollment data from past years.
“We recommend that these algorithms be created and deployed as soon as possible,” the report reads.
The report also suggests that a new, more permanent committee be formed to consider course registration more broadly.
Committee Chair Bernhard Nickel and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said in an interview Monday that, though their committee was originally formed to consider whether to scrap shopping week altogether, members later concluded that the problems that faculty and students face with course registration do not stem from shopping week alone.
Faculty and graduate students had previously criticized shopping week for creating job insecurity for teaching fellows and preventing professors from beginning instruction during the first week of classes.
“What this committee has found… is that it is not a binary question,” Claybaugh said. “There's not a simple yes, no.”
The final report details several issues unrelated to shopping week that plague the current registration system, like the uncoordinated timing of course lotteries.
Claybaugh and Nickel cited the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences' upcoming move to Allston, this year's new class schedule, and ongoing graduate student union negotiations as potential sources of uncertainty for professors and reasons the committee decided to keep shopping week in its current form until at least 2022.
Claybaugh said the committee’s work over the next three years would “happen in the background” and that rather than impose a large-scale “disruption” to the current system, they would instead try smaller interventions before making major changes.
“At the end of three years, the committee will say, either, we think that we have brought variability within manageable limits,” she said. “Or they will say things are not fine, in which case, we will think about some kind of pre-term planning or some kind of something.”
Claybaugh said the committee views the issues associated with shopping week — such as graduate students not receiving paychecks until weeks after the semester begins — as pressing.
“I think there is an urgency,” she said.
The Council voted to form the course registration committee in September 2018, after informal debate over the merits and drawbacks of shopping week arose at an earlier meeting of the full faculty.
Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 — who serves on the Education Policy Committee which helped formulate the proposal — praised the administration’s receptiveness to students’ input throughout the process. More than 400 students voiced their opinions on shopping week through multiple town halls and an online forum, according to Claybaugh.
“For me personally and those that I’ve worked with on the UC, we’re very pleased with the legislation,” Palaniappan said. “It’s really heartening to see students’ activism turn into positive policy outcomes from our perspective.”
Faculty Council member David L. Howell said in an interview Wednesday that the group approved the proposal with little debate. The Faculty Council’s vote is purely advisory, however; the full faculty will consider the legislation at its meeting next week and then decide on its ultimate fate in a May vote.
The Council also voted to approve two other proposals at its meeting Wednesday, according to Howell — one to create a masters of science and masters of business administration dual degree program and another to implement a new “quantitative reasoning with data” requirement for undergraduates.
The dual degree program, run by Harvard Business School, would focus on providing a life sciences curriculum to Business School students interested in working in fields like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Under the quantitative reasoning proposal, students could use courses that involve working with data across different disciplines to fulfill the requirement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bazzi and Kiiara will headline this year’s Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor music festival, the College Events Board announced Wednesday night.
Student groups Extra Extra and Maybe There's Life will open for Bazzi and Kiiara at the festival on April 7 in Tercentenary Theater. The students artists were chosen after they competed in CEB's annual Battle for Yardfest and were selected by event attendees.
Bazzi, a Michigan native, is known for songs like “Mine” and “Beautiful,” both of which peaked on the Billboard Hot 100. In April 2018, he released his debut album “Cosmic,” which has been listed on several international charts. Kiiara hails from Illinois and is known for songs like her 2015 debut single “Gold” and “Heavy,” on which she collaborated with Linkin Park.
Lil’ Yachty and Wale drew hundreds of crowds of undergraduate students to Tercentenary Theatre for last year’s Yardfest. Recent headliners include DJ Tiesto, DJ Steve Aoki, and Jessie J.
“We are very excited about Battle for Yardfest, as our Arts and Entertainment Committee (A&E), led by Raven Richard '20, has put together a fantastic show of talented student performers,” College Events Board Co-president Alex Gibbons wrote in an email to The Crimson. “A&E holds auditions in February that are open to the campus and selects student groups to perform at BFY based on these auditions.”
Held at Sanders Theatre Wednesday night, Battle for Yardfest featured student performances that competed for the chance to open for this year’s Yardfest headliners. Performers included Edna Mode, Luke Martinez, Maybe There’s Life, Dan Hasegawa, The Sh*t, Eat Your Feelings, 21 Colorful Crimson, Extra Extra, and Avanti ft. Eddie and Anya. The event’s MC was British stand-up comedian Chris James.
After polling the crowd of students at Battle for Yardfest, the winners were revealed to be Extra Extra and Maybe There’s Life.
Following the arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate the night of Yardfest last year and more than 17 students being transported by ambulance due to intoxication, the University reviewed its safety policies and moved this year’s concert to Sunday afternoon, a shift from previous years when it was held on Friday evening. Last year's arrest sparked allegations of police brutality and prompted some students to call on the University to change its policies.
Students will no longer be allowed to bring guests to the event this year. They will also not be allowed to re-enter the concert venue if they leave. The recommendations come from a special committee appointed by former University President Drew G. Faust in the wake of the arrest.

With most of the sports world focused on college basketball at this time of year for its annual on-court dramatics, the Harvard men’s hockey team will be looking for some March Madness of its own. On Friday, the No. 13/14 Crimson will square off with No. 4 Massachusetts in Manchester, N.H., in the Northeast Regional Semifinal of the NCAA Tournament.
Harvard (19-10-3, 13-7-2 ECAC), a four-seed in the 16-team bracket, returns to the big dance after missing out last season. Friday will mark the Crimson’s fourth Tournament appearance in the past five campaigns.
Meanwhile, the Minutemen (28-9-0, 18-6-0 Hockey East) enter the matinee matchup as a regional one-seed and will provide stiff competition for Harvard. UMass has enjoyed a stellar season under third-year coach Greg Carvel, who has resurrected the program from a decade-long rut in just a few short years, and returns to NCAAs for the first time since 2007.
“We start the season with the goal of winning the National Championship,” said Crimson junior defenseman Adam Fox. “It starts with getting to the Tournament, so it’s obviously nice to be going back.”
Friday promises to be a high-octane clash between two offensively gifted teams, each powered by an All-American defenseman and a lethal powerplay. If the Crimson fells the mighty Minutemen, it will advance to Saturday’s Regional Final and take on either Clarkson or Notre Dame, the two-versus-three matchup in the Northeast.
For both squads, Friday’s tilt is the first step in the road to Buffalo, N.Y., the site of the 2019 Frozen Four. But in some sense, each program has different stakes attached to this year’s NCAA Tournament. Harvard seeks another chance at the Frozen Four after bowing out to Minnesota Duluth in 2017’s national semifinal. UMass, on the other hand, is in search of its first-ever Frozen Four appearance.
“[The NCAA Tournament] is something that you could take for granted, having been there twice in my first two years,” said Harvard co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “But especially after last year, it made us seniors really want to get back there, being the leadership core on the team…. It’s all real now.”
A long and grueling season has brought Friday’s foes to the same place. But the Crimson and the Minutemen have experienced different roads to Manchester.
Coach Carvel’s group kicked off its schedule with wins in 12 of its first 13 outings, including a weekend split with then-No. 1 Ohio St. and a home-and-home sweep of then-No. 4/3 Providence. A hot start out of the gate saw UMass crack the top-20 rankings before the first month of the season had concluded. The team never looked back, making the top three its usual dwelling spot. A loss to Boston College in the Hockey East semifinal round was a small blip in an otherwise extraordinary campaign, as the Minutemen managed to clinch a top seed in the NCAA Tournament anyway.
“Obviously, they’ve had a tremendous regular season, Hockey East champs,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 of UMass. “[They’re] one of the top powerplays in the country, one of the top offenses in the country. They pose a lot of challenges for us, but we’re excited. It’s a whole new season.”
Success for coach Donato’s squad was not as immediate. The Crimson opened the season without a victory through four contests for the first time in its 111-year history. Team defense emerged as an early problem, with the group allowing seven, five, and four goals in its first three bouts.
The team finally began to find its identity and build consistency by mid-November, splitting a weekend series with ranked Arizona St. before pocketing a crucial triumph over Cornell, another Tournament team and a storied rival of the Harvard program, at Madison Square Garden.
The Crimson had firmly reentered the national conversation by mid-January, taking down then-No. 6 Quinnipiac and proceeding to build a four-game win streak heading into the Beanpot Tournament. While Boston’s hockey classic did not go Harvard’s way — the team settled for a third-place finish — an impressive seven-game home win streak guided the Crimson to its fifth straight appearance in Lake Placid for the ECAC Semifinals. Harvard’s conference playoff run ended there, but the team’s resume, spattered with high-profile wins, earned it an at-large bid to the big dance.
“We didn’t have the best start, and like all teams, we hit some bumps along the road,” said Crimson freshman center Jack Drury said. “We’ve gotten better and better throughout the year, and I think that’s a testament to our leadership and our coaching staff and the players we have on our team.”
Neither team would have enjoyed the success it did this season without the talent and leadership of its star defenseman. It is not only arguable, but quite commonly held, that the participating programs in Friday afternoon’s Northeast Regional battle possess the two most talented blue-liners in college hockey.
UMass boasts sophomore Cale Makar (15­–31—46), the frontrunner for this year’s Hobey Baker Award. The Calgary, Alta., native is perhaps the single greatest factor in the Minutemen’s turnaround from their dismal past, taking over games on a nightly basis.
Currently, Makar is the NCAA’s highest NHL draft pick, having been selected in the first round, fourth overall, by the Colorado Avalanche in 2017. And his blue-chip talent is fully on display: ahead of Friday, the sophomore ranks sixth in the nation in points and fourth in plus-minus (+29).
On the other end of the ice, the Crimson also wields a dynamic threat on the back end. Fox (9–39—48) has been a source of firepower for Harvard since his freshman season, with 116 points (22–94—116) to his name through just three seasons. On account of his expert vision and poise with the puck, the Jericho, N.Y., product paces the college ranks in outright assists, assists per game (1.22), points per game (1.50), powerplay points per game (0.72), and powerplay assists per game (0.59).
As his numbers suggest, Fox, a third-round NHL selection in his own right, commands the powerplay unlike any other player in college hockey. The two-time CCM/AHCA First Team All-American became the first rearguard since Wisconsin’s Justin Schultz in 2011-2012 to eclipse 100 career points as a junior. Moreover, he is two points shy of being the first Division-I blue-liner to register 50 in a season since the Badgers’ Brendan Smith did so in 2009-2010.
Thanks in large part to a six-point weekend against Dartmouth in the recent ECAC quarterfinals, Fox now holds the Crimson program record for most points by a defenseman in a single season, surpassing Hobey Baker winner Mark Fusco ’83 in the process.
In short, college hockey fans are in for a treat on Friday, as the two most dominant defensemen in 2018-2019 go head-to-head in the national tournament.
“Whether you’re a Makar guy or a Fox guy, I think you enjoy the fact that the two most dynamic offensive defensemen in college hockey this year…are facing off against each other,” coach Donato said.
Despite due focus on Makar and Fox in anticipation of Friday’s tilt, both teams have even more to offer. Two Minutemen forwards have notched over 40 points: senior Jacob Pritchard (16–29—45) and sophomore Mitchell Chaffee (17–24—41) sit among the top-20 scorers in the league. San Jose Sharks prospect John Leonard follows close behind with 36 (13–23—36).
On defense, freshman Marc Del Gaizo (12–14—26) rounds out the top pairing with Makar. Due primarily to this number-one duo, UMass is tied for first in the country in goals from its blue line (38).
Harvard, in fact, is next on that list, getting 31 goals from its back end in five fewer games than the Minutemen have played. Sophomore Reilly Walsh (12–19—31) and freshman Jack Rathbone (7–15—22) add to the Crimson’s cohort of offensive-minded defensemen. Apparently, receiving an offensive boost from the blue line goes a long way for overall team scoring, as both of Friday’s opponents rank in the top 10 in goals per game nationwide. UMass sits third in average scoring (3.76), while Harvard trails by just four spots (3.31).
An injection of talented freshmen, as well as the development of multiple returning skaters, has fueled the Crimson’s forward corps this season. Zerter-Gossage (18–6—24) is the team’s goal-scoring leader, setting the tone on the ice with crucial turning-point goals. The team’s nominal top line of sophomore Henry Bowlby (5–8—13) and rookies Drury (9–15—24) and Casey Dornbach (7–22—29) have combined to be the team’s most consistently effective trio.
“Our freshmen have been integral to our success,” coach Donato said. “We have a forward group that’s pretty young, but I think that they’ve made great strides throughout the year.”
Sophomore Jack Badini (8–12—20) and freshman Baker Shore (2–11—13) fill out Harvard’s young core at the center-ice position, and juniors Frédéric Grégoire (6–9—15) and Nathan Krusko (3–7—10) have each contributed at vital points in the season.
“One of our strengths has really just been our depth up front,” Zerter-Gossage noted. “Once we get into our game, we’ve got a bit of a wave-after-wave style. And then our defense leads the charge, too, offensively.”
Both the Crimson and the Minutemen are exceptional on the powerplay. Harvard’s 28.8 percent execution rate leads the nation, while UMass is just a tenth of a percent back of first place at 28.7 percent effective. Fox and Makar are instrumental quarterbacks on the man advantage, and their respective special-teams units will make for another marquee clash on Friday afternoon.
“When we play our way, we prove that we can beat any team in the country, and we’ve done that this year,” said junior defenseman John Marino, who has experienced the last three seasons on the Harvard blue line right alongside Fox. “We’re a dangerous team coming into this tournament, and I don’t think…anyone wants to play us.”
In many ways, the Minutemen squad that the Crimson will face in the Regional Semifinals is a reflection of Harvard’s own style. Goaltending is yet another area of similarity between the teams, with both making late-season changes in net that make Friday’s matchup between the pipes a bit of an enigma.
While UMass sophomore Matt Murray (20-5-0, 2.11 GAA, .919 SV%) started the majority of games during the regular season, freshman Filip Lindberg (8-3-0, 1.67 GAA, .932 SV%) appears to have pried away the starting spot at the most crucial time of the campaign. Lindberg replaced Murray in the Minutemen’s first conference quarterfinal game two weeks ago and started his team’s next two games. But a shutout loss to the Eagles in the squad’s most recent game has potentially reopened the battle for the starting spot.
As for Harvard’s crease, last weekend senior Michael Lackey (14-7-3, 2.31 GAA, .918 SV%) made his return from a knee injury. His first taste of game action since mid-February did not go as planned, though. Lackey ceded three goals — the last of which was a low-threat chance — before junior Cameron Gornet (5-3-0, 2.56 GAA, .915 SV%) was sent in to replace him.
Given Gornet’s solid play in Lackey’s month-long absence, allowing the Crimson to remain in contention for the at-large NCAA Tournament bid it eventually received, it would come as no surprise for coach Donato to give the junior the nod on Friday.
“As much as I’m sensitive to the fact that somebody’s a senior…or somebody’s coming back from injury, I think we owe it to the group to play whomever we think gives us the best chance to win, and that’s at any position,” said coach Donato mid-week. “That being said, we’ll continue to evaluate. I don’t think we didn’t win against Clarkson [last weekend] because of our goaltending.”
Ultimately, two high-powered offensive squads are set to face off in a showcase of elite defensemen, top-tier powerplay units, and some of the finest collegiate hockey the state of Massachusetts has to offer. One team will keep its season — and national title chances — alive, while the other will say goodbye to a promising campaign. The beauty of the NCAA Tournament is that when the puck drops at 3:00 p.m. on Friday, either team can advance from the do-or-die game.
“Once you make the Tournament, it’s kind of a fresh start from there,” Fox said. “We’re not just going to bow down because they’re the one-seed and we’re the four-seed…. You have to just win four games, and it starts with this first one for us.”

We ranked the Housing Day videos, now we’re here to tell you which houses had the best Housing Day t-shirts!
1) Dunster
Dunster reps a dark blue shirt with the Canada Goose logo but redesigned as “Canada Moose.” This look hits all the right notes: The pun is simple; the reference makes sense; the colors are on point. The most impressive part? Dunster somehow managed to take one of the bougiest brands and make it even more exclusive. Totally on brand.
2) Pforzheimer
It seems like multiple houses looked to fashion for inspiration. Pfoho’s black shirt features the Patagonia logo but redesigned to feature the house’s outline and the word “Pforzheimer.” The logo is distinctive and the reference is nice too: Polar bears and cold weather gear go hand in hand.
3) Kirkland
Kirkland went with a summer camp logo with a boar’s head in a blue circle surrounded by leaves and the words “Camp Kirkland.” It’s cartoony and whimsical, which is a little unusual but makes for a unique aesthetic. A good design and points for going against the trend.
4) Cabot
Another house, another clothing brand design. Cabot’s “Supreme” redesign is an all-white shirt with a red rectangle in the middle and the words “Semper Cor.” It’s plain and simple but the style it references is too so the look is fine. It’s a good design choice but feels like it is missing just a little something to put it over others.
5) Mather
What would college be without references to cheap beer? Mather redesigned the Miller High Life logo as “Mather House Life.” The logo works well and the colors pop. All in all a fun reference and appropriate to college life.
6) Adams
This black shirt features a little acorn logo made up of the words “Go Nuts.” The simple look makes the red and gold that is synonymous with Adams stand out and the simple graphic of Adams’s tower on the back is very cute. As for the slogan itself, it’s a cute logo and pun and does the job well enough.
7) Quincy 
Quincy’s all-red shirt features a little penguin with sunglasses and the words “Some of y’all didn’t get Quincy... and it shows.” Twitter memes are fleeting and while the joke is amusing now, I’m concerned about the survivability of this design. It’s a nice enough reference, however, and the penguin logo is unreasonably cute if nothing else.
8) Eliot
Eliot’s shield is the only thing on the front of their blue shirt. It’s a pretty bold move to assume your house shield can speak for itself, but Eliot manages to pull it off. It’s a simple design but good enough. When it comes to these shirts, sometimes less is more.
9) Currier
Similar to others, Currier went the luxury route and echoes an exclusive brand. Their black shirt features the white Chanel double-C logo with the word “Currier” below it. The connection here, however, is less clear. Did they choose Chanel only for the C?
10) Leverett
Lev’s shirt has nothing but the word “Leverett” on the front but with a pair of rabbit ears replacing the letter V. The bunny ears are a cute touch, but they’re not enough to make the shirt stand out. A nice concept, but they could have done better on the execution.
11) Lowell
This design doesn’t really hit any of the right notes. The front of the shirt features the Lowell house shield and name while the back has a teacup graphic and the phrase “We’re steep competition.” The combo in the front is a little boring, the pun is not great, and there’s no mention of the renovations which seems like a missed opportunity.
12) Winthrop
All-white shirt with a tiny lion logo and the words Winthrop Housing Day 2019 in the corner. Plain color. Plain font. Plain logo. So much empty space. So much wasted potential.
