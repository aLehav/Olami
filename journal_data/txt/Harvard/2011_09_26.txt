After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ingrid T. Monson is the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music and an eminent jazz scholar. She has been an integral force in the Office of the Arts at Harvard’s “40 Years of Jazz at Harvard” celebration this year, welcoming jazz men Benny Golson, Roy Haynes, Brian Lynch, and Wynton Marsalis—among others—to perform and speak with students. Monson recently spoke to Harvard about how she fell in love with the groove of jazz—and made it her lifelong work.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your first experience with jazz?
Ingrid T. Monson: I became interested in jazz because I was a trumpet player. I was 12, 13, 14, 15 [years old] and I started to realize that the trumpet got to do a lot more in jazz than it did in classical music. I noticed that in classical music you were often sitting there in the orchestra counting bars. Meanwhile, if you listen to records by Miles Davis or Lee Morgan, the trumpet was doing all of these spectacular things. I think between hearing Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, I was really taken by the sound [of jazz], and I wanted to learn how people did it.
THC: You collaborate with artists in Africa, specifically with Malian balafonist Neba Solo. How did you come about him?
ITM: My training is as an ethnomusicologist, and I was always interested in not only popular music and jazz but also [in] the international connections. If you like jazz or you like African-American music, it is not hard to like music from Mali. I started to take some lessons on the balafon with Neba Solo. I had such a fabulous experience with him that the next time I was on sabbatical, I wrote a grant to go back to Mali. You start to realize that there are dozens and dozens of amazing musicians in the world who never get heard at an international level. I like to say that Neba Solo is the best musician you’ve never heard of.
THC: What is it like being a white female working with “black” music?
ITM: I consider it a privilege and an honor to have been selected to do this job, and with it comes a responsibility. One lifelong area of inquiry for me is what would an ethical white relationship to black music looks like. Where the history is so full of missteps, of economic exploitation, of people being patronizing, you want to have a dialogue with yourself and with the people around you. What does it mean when the music spreads beyond its community of origin? I feel a strong responsibility to try to get people to engage in [these] difficult questions, and that includes asking myself those same questions.
THC: Could you explain your idea of “perceptual agency?”
ITM: It comes from my experiences as a musician and the idea that from sound itself, you learn things that are not words but have to do with a kind of embodied knowledge. With perceptual agency, for example, in my classes, I’ll put on a jazz piece and I’ll say, “Let’s just listen to the bass line right now.” And I’ll have them really focus in on just the bass line. I might play the same piece again and say, “Now we’re going to listen to the ride cymbal, and listen very carefully to what Philly Joe Jones is doing with his touch.” When you focus on that one particular stream of the music, that becomes the foreground, and the rest becomes the background. You can get different perceptual experiences of the same music. Part of the fun of learning to hear the intricacies in the music is shifting your attention around.
THC: What is your best experience with your work?
ITM: I always enjoy interacting with musicians themselves and hearing their point of view. I think it is really important that we bring as many artists to the Harvard campus as possible. [This way,] students can interact with people who are out there working in the real world music or art business, see how they think and how thoughtfully they approach each of the projects they do, and get a chance to see really professional-level performance. I also just enjoy talking with our students. I feel that with Harvard students, everyone has something incredibly special about them. I always like to have part of my class open up to discussion because I find what students have to say in response to the materials infinitely interesting and very often something that leads me in a new direction.
THC: If you could be a part of any jazz band, which would it be and what would play besides the trumpet?
ITM: I would like to play bass for Aretha Franklin. Or backup singing for her. There is nothing finer than Aretha Franklin. I think that her music is amazing. Or to be able to play James Jamerson-like bass lines with the Temptations. If I could play the trumpet, I’d like to try my hand at playing an Art Blakey’s band from 1958 that had Bobby Timmons in it and Lee Morgan and Wayne Shorter, playing all these classic and incredibly swingy numbers.

Last Friday evening, Northwest Labs pulsed with activity. Loud music could be heard from Oxford Street and rain-drenched students and members of the public hurried toward the building. Awaiting them inside was The Lab @ Harvard’s Annual Fall Exhibition, a works-in-progress display of a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences curricular program that combines art, science, and design.
The Lab @ Harvard—founded by Engineering Professor David A. Edwards, who is now its Faculty Director—is both an academic program and a forum for innovation. Now in its third year, the program collaborated last spring with students who developed projects in Engineering Sciences 20: “How to Create Things & Have Them Matter.” Through the Lab @ Harvard program, students were given the opportunity to continue developing their projects from this course over the summer in Cape Town and at a weeklong summit in Paris.
The Fall Exhibition features 11 projects under the theme of “The Future of Water,” the premier of a short film by South African artist William Kentridge called “The Refusal of Time, Prologue–Anti-Mercator,” and a panel discussion on experiential education at Harvard with Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry Murray, Pellegrino University Professor Peter Galison, and Susan M. Dackerman, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints for the Harvard Art Museums.
Of the 11 interactive installations, Harvard undergraduates developed seven, while students in Paris developed two and students from Saudi Arabia developed another two. Though the Lab’s theme was “The Future of Water,” creativity was encouraged throughout the design process, and as a result many of the projects evolved in vastly different directions. Projects ranged from a hand-held water purification system that could be used in flood or tsunami disaster relief to a website called ArtLede, which features art made in response to current events.
Suelin Chen, the Director of The Lab @ Harvard said, “This is an opportunity to think of an idea and do it even if your idea flops, even if it implodes. It is about opening your mind a little more.” As a teaching fellow for Engineering Sciences 20, Chen aided the students in developing their ideas, some of which were featured in the evening’s display. “It is amazing to see the students come into the class and learn to trust themselves. They have come so far,” she said.
The four-person Harvard team behind a project entitled “Cable&Grain” took advantage of this fluid creative process. Veda Eswarappa ’12, Anugraha M. Raman ’12, Will C. Burke ’13, and Gary D. Carlson ’13 originally began a project to create an anti-desertification mat. Realizing their idea was not economically feasible, they later decided to create cellphone docking stations out of South African woodcarvings. They partnered with community art organizations in Cape Town to generate products that combine modern technology with traditional art.
The wide range of projects posed a challenge for Exhibition Designer Brandon Bird, who was charged with creating a cohesive experience. “The only way to do a project like this is for me to not have a concept and let the students guide it,” Bird said. “If I approached it with my own aesthetic it would fail.” This student collaboration resulted in a vibrant aesthetic experience for Friday evening’s visitors. The normally bare basement floor of Northwest Labs was transformed: the walls were lined with interactive installations around a central movie-screening center while drink stations were clustered in the corners and a DJ played music from the back. The low lighting combined with the thrum of the music created a modern, club-like ambiance fitting for the innovative artistic display of the installations. One student project titled “UseLESS”— a dissolvable plastic bag embedded with seeds—was displayed on a light table. Nearby, a bed of flowers was placed next to a bin full of plastic bags, representing an eco-friendly vision of UseLESS dissolvable bags. “In the end, we wanted to show people [a] glimpse into the future,” Bird said.
Edwards views the act of exhibiting as a crucial part of any creative process—even a scientific one. “We are constantly making hypotheses and curating those hypotheses for a particular audience ... In creative moments, [the] distinctions between artists, scientists, and designers disappear,” he said. “It is very exciting for creators of all kinds to find themselves in a situation where those barriers don’t exist.” He continued that The Lab’s exhibition was an opportunity for students to engage in dialogue with their peers and, in doing so, understand their own project development more deeply.
The future of The Lab @ Harvard is full of possibility. This is the first year that The Lab is formally a part of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Edwards sees the potential for even more unconventional exhibitions in 2012, when the theme will be “Virtual Worlds.” “It [must] remain a fun place for creators. Creators need to thrive, and great ideas need to come out,” he said, smiling as he suggested cafés or trees as next year’s potential venues.

Bloomsday is an odd sort of holiday. Every June 16, people around the world gather to commemorate the single day—June 16, 1904—described in James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” The celebrations begin in Dublin, where participants trace the wanderings of the novel’s protagonist, Leopold Bloom, through the city.  They continue with pub crawls in Buenos Aires, dramatic reenactments in New Zealand, and a sweeping potpourri of festivities in New York: Bloomsday on Broadway, Radio Bloomsday, and A Rap Tribute to James Joyce.
Such gleeful celebration strikes me as peculiar for a book whose goal was, according to Joyce, “to keep the critics busy for 300 years.” Dense, intricate, and populated with obscure and wide-ranging references, the nearly 1,000-page tome is hardly Harry Potter.
Yet key to understanding this day’s popularity is the centrality of the organized readings of “Ulysses” throughout the day. Some groups attempt to barrel through the entire novel; others take turns reading aloud excerpts or chapters, dialogues or scenes.
For those die-hard Ulysses re-readers, such marathon readings are a chance to meet and mingle with other Joyce enthusiasts through the novelty of reading aloud. And for those who never managed to finish (or start) the book, they offer a kind of porthole into a rich but overwhelming literary landscape.
The stream-of-consciousness narrative that characterizes Ulysses becomes more manageable when spoken as opposed to read. Textual ambiguity—who’s speaking to whom, for instance—becomes more clear when the dialogue is voiced.
This particular oral tradition is only as old as the first Bloomsday, celebrated in Dublin in 1954. Yet the celebrations—as well as the novel itself—can be contextualized in a broader historical framework. They are continuations of an ancient conversation, adapting a literary current defined in large part by its emphasis on the spoken word: the Homeric oral tradition.
For centuries, Homeric scholarship carried on a lively debate over who exactly the author of “The Iliad” and “The Odyssey” was—the blind poet of legend, a scattered array of authors, or something else entirely. More recently, these arguments have subsided in favor of the theory that these epic poems have an oral origin, and that what we read today is only one version of a loose, constantly evolving verbal script.
The epithets that appear again and again in “The Odyssey,” sometimes almost irritatingly repetitive to the contemporary ear, suggest this mode of composition. Descriptions like ‘swift-footed Achilles,’ ‘grey-eyed Athena,’ and ‘great-hearted Odysseus’ formed an inventory of phrases of varying syllables, any of which a bard could call upon to complete a line within the strict demands of metrical form.
The result, then, was the sort of dynamism impossible to equal on the page, a story with a stable plot and consistent ingredients that was, nevertheless, slightly different each time it was told. For a largely illiterate audience, these recitations combined the comfort of repetition with the intrigue of the new—change in structure, originality within a framework.
Epic poems like “The Odyssey” ultimately became so popular that they were immortalized in papyrus, creating a literary tradition that never fully stopped mingling with its older, oral cousin. Joyce’s “Ulysses” stands at the other end of that literary tradition. It began not in the mouths of bards but in the pen of its lone author.
In writing “Ulysses” Joyce explicitly recalled Homer’s epic, most obviously in the title but also in the formal ordering of the chapters and the thematic framework of the (mock) heroic quest. Confronted with an audience that could not only listen, but also read, Joyce conceived of his work as a maximalist modernist project, wrestling with how far he could push the limits of language to reflect, and assign meaning to, reality. Central to this task was the attempt to capture and catalogue the sounds of everyday activity, transforming noise into symphony by writing it down.
The Bloomsday readings reverse this trajectory. “Ulysses” becomes a mere blueprint for the participants, a kind of schematic guide. From it comes a new oral tradition, a collection of voices and an expanding scope of interpretation, as readers reassume the role of bards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On August 26th, I was waiting out the last few days of summer when a friend’s parents offered to take the pair of us to a concert at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMoCA) in rural North Adams, MA. Since the audience was mostly middle-aged parents, I expected something that I would consider “traditional”—and, to some extent, that’s what I got.
The headlining group was Roomful of Teeth, a handful of classically trained young singers who had come to the MassMoCA to take part in an unconventional new project. They sang mostly folk music from various traditions, including a few of their own original compositions. They caught my attention by performing old folk music in the style of a modern a capella group, but what made me slide to the very front of my seat for a better look was the moment halfway through the concert when Roomful of Teeth invited Merrill Garbus from the experimental band tUnE-yArDs to perform her own music with them. Applying classical training to singing styles from around the world is one thing, but bringing an indie artist with no classical training to perform with them was another level of hybrid between old and new.
Only a few weeks later, I found myself at another concert, this time in Sanders Theatre. When extra tickets were passed along to me only days before the show, I was excited to see Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum perform solo, but I didn’t expect anything more. Once at the show, however, I was surprised to find that a classical string quartet would be opening for Mangum.
As it turns out, the concert was put together by a New York based musical organization called “Wordless Music.” According to their mission statement, the group is “devoted to the idea that the sound worlds of classical and contemporary instrumental music—in genres such as indie rock and electronica—share more in common than conventional thinking might suggest.” But Wordless Music does not stop there. It goes further, asserting that “the various boundaries and genre distinctions segregating music today—popular and classical; uptown and downtown; high art and low—are artificial constructions in need of dismantling.” In need of dismantling? Despite entirely different instruments, target audiences, methods of training, and sounds, all music should be lumped together in a single category?
Striving to break down boundaries and broaden musical horizons seems a noble cause—but also a little romantic, to say the least. At this particular concert, the audience repeatedly clapped between the movements of the first piece while the musicians shifted uneasily in their seats. The woman beside me had a not-so-silent temper tantrum as the second of the two pieces stretched far beyond the five minute template of a pop song. Her fits of laughter and loud whispers to her boyfriend not only cut through the power of the music but also served as a harsh reminder of why we separate the classics from pop concerts. Some complex works of art demand a more serious attitude than others.
Despite these few awkward moments, putting the two types of performers on the same stage was more than just provocative; it encouraged a kind of thoughtful comparison. Although modern music often demands a choice between two sharply defined camps—the ultra modern and synthesized or the completely traditional—the four artists I saw prove that the old and the new have more to say to one another than the diehard separatists ever imagined. This is not to say that the blend was seamless. But in art, a too-smooth blend often comes across as dull and uninspired, and I can confidently say that neither term comes anywhere close to describing Roomful of Teeth or the Wordless Music series.

This year,  Mariachi Véritas de Harvard, Harvard’s student mariachi band, is traveling for the first time to San José, California for “¡VivaFest!”—an annual Mexican heritage and mariachi festival now in its 20th year. The celebration, which runs from Sep. 18-29, presents a wonderful opportunity for Mariachi Véritas to learn and teach: members will participate in workshops led by renowned mariachi players and serve as college mentors to younger mariachi musicians.
Mariachi Véritas will devote the first two days of the festival to technical and stylistic training by attending full-day workshops run by Mariachi Cobre, a traditional 12-piece Mexican Mariachi band that performs daily in the Mexico Pavilion at the Epcot theme park.
Beyond their personal musical training, Mariachi Véritas is focused on mentoring the younger generations of student mariachi. Together with musicians from the University of Texas-Pan American, they are participating in panel discussions that advise high schoolers on how to continue their mariachi training in college—and how the art form can help them get there. “We are promoting this idea of higher education—we are promoting this idea of falling in love with music,” says trumpet-player and Mariachi Véritas  president George W. Zuo ’13.
The festival concludes its celebration with two final Sunday performances: an outdoor student showcase of participating mariachi bands and traditional Mexican dance groups followed by an evening performance of professional mariachi. Mariachi Véritas has been honored to play in both—a testament to their virtuosity. Not only will they present a half hour of their repertoire in the student showcase, but they are among the students selected to open the evening show with three specially-commissioned works by Mariachi Cobre.
Mariachi Véritas attributes their inclusion in the festival in part to their diverse student body. “It all started when a Harvard alum who is in charge of running this organization came to us and said ‘This year the theme is going to be diversity, and you have pretty much the most diverse mariachi in the world,’” says Zuo. He notes that both Asian musicians and women are rare amongst most mariachi bands—yet Mariachi Véritas’s membership includes many of both. The group is also diverse musically. “About half the members have known mariachi music since they were children [and] have grown up playing it—the other half are coming from all over the place and still find a way to connect with [the music],” says Julian Moll-Rocek ’12, a senior who played classical and rock music before joining the group.
Mariachi Véritas views their diversity as a strength. “It is something we definitely take pride in, we are breaking boundaries,” says Zuo. Yet this diversity also creates some challenges for the group. Diego Rentería ’11-’12, who has been playing mariachi music since middle school, says it is sometimes difficult for the members of Mariachi Véritas to grasp the cultural connotations of the music they play—a kind of inexperience that he says may cause other mariachi groups to have lower expectations for them. Nonetheless, he remains confident that the group has worked to overcome such obstacles: “If there is this perception like ‘You guys aren’t actual musicians,’ we [just say] ‘No, we have our music ready and we are here to play like you guys,’” he says.
“¡VivaFest!” is expected to help Mariachi Véritas overcome some of their cultural disadvantage. “We will be able to learn the more intangible elements of the music,” says Anthony Liu ’14, who is the treasurer of Mariachi Véritas. The guidance at “¡VivaFest!” is especially valuable because Mariachi Véritas is not directed by a professional faculty member. “We always really value [times] when we can actually work with people who are professionals,” says Maggie Geoga ’12, who plays violin and occasionally sings for Mariachi Véritas. The band also values the opportunity to learn and perform in the American Southwest, where mariachi is often at the heart of the local culture. “Hopefully this [festival] can be the start of some sort of greater connection between Boston area schools and mariachi musicians throughout the U.S.,” says Rentería.
Like all student-run college organizations, Mariachi Véritas faces a constantly shifting membership. “This coming year four of us will graduate ... [as leaders of the band] we need to have inspired and invested younger members to keep the band going,” says Moll-Rocek. Looking forward, Mariachi Véritas attributes the importance of tours and festivals like “¡VivaFest!” in creating the unity that will allow for the band’s certain longevity at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve picked the wrong time to be walking across the Yard. It’s 1 p.m.,  and students leaving class are clogging up all the walkways. I rush past  one girl who is in the process of disentangling her headphones, and  slide around a pair of men who are walking side by side but in silence,  as one sends a text message on his phone. I spot someone I recognize and  wave, but his headphones are in and his head is down.
The sight of the detached and plugged-in is all too common on Cambridge  streets. First introduced by the Walkman and universalized by the MP3  player, portable music-playing devices have shifted the function of  music for a new generation. A corresponding backlash has occurred  against digital music, as music aesthetes have sought older listening  media for higher sound quality and perceived authenticity. With most  music players of the past now easily accessible, well-defined camps of  listeners have emerged based on disagreements about the merits of each  system and, by extension, about the purpose of music itself.
REVINYLIZATION
After passing many more tuned-in men and women in Harvard Square, I head  down JFK St. to meet Planet Records owner John Damroth. Planet Records  is packed with CDs, vinyl records, and concert DVDs, and jazz  reverberates throughout the store. The Harvard Square Planet Records  opened in 1997 as a second branch that would sell only CDs in an attempt  to capitalize on the new industry. When the original Kenmore Square  store burned down, Damroth was forced to move all of his vinyl to his  new location.
Carrying records was a major drawback in the early 2000s. “In 2005, we  were lucky to sell a couple of records a week,” Damroth says. “Records  took up too much space, and if they weren’t being sold, there was no  room to put new ones out.” It seemed like vinyl would stifle itself  under its own weight. But much to Damrothe’s delight, record sales  recovered about three years ago, to the point where they now make up a  third of Planet Record’s total sales.
Damroth isn’t surprised by vinyl’s revitalization. “It’s a different  listening experience, where you’re much more connected to the artist,”  he says. For Damroth, listening to vinyl is a physical project. “You put  on side one, and then you have to flip it over for side two. You have  to actually touch it. You can look at the artwork, which is no small  thing.” Since a record requires much more effort that a CD, the process  has a way of making the listener more engaged in the music. He flips on  Run-DMC’s eponymous debut, released on LP in 1984, and immediately  starts nodding his head and singing along.
Record appreciation has created its own self-contained community at  Audio Lab in The Garage. Most customers wander in and out, examining the  frontline speaker equipment. A couple of men stay sitting in chairs,  neither customers nor employees, but self-professed music lovers and  friends of store manager Mike Volpe. Together, they reminisce about the  fabled jazz musicians they’ve seen in concert over the years. Charles  Ryan, a Medford resident who describes music as his “church,” has spun  many memories out of the vibrations of a record. “Two or three people  would come over, sit on the floor, and just listen to an album,” he  recalls. “Music was the central thing. Now, there are so many gadgets  that take over people’s attention.”
The sound quality of vinyl also played a large factor in sparking  Volpe’s and Ryan’s enthusiasm. “Analog has more detail and warmth. It’s  more musical,” says Volpe. Although he admits that digital music from  quality speakers can compete with its analog counterpart, he still feels  that something about digital sound is off.
“The fact that young people are going back to turntables is an  indication that something is missing from the digital world,” says Ryan.  “There has to be something that’s reaching inside on a personal level.”  I exit the store, leaving them to continue an extensive conversation  about Billie Holliday, Bill Evans, and Paul McCartney’s guitar player.
SOCIAL LISTENING
At the Audio Preservation Studio on Garden St., Dave Ackerman and his  fellow sound engineers are in the process of trying to salvage rare and  fragile recordings and convert them to digital for Harvard students and  faculty. The studio’s equipment collection is nonpartisan in the  technology war: turntables sit next to cassettes, CD players,  eight-track reels, and computers. Ackerman is well-equipped to explain  the sound quality differences between the various music players, and he  is quick to repudiate the idea that vinyl has an inherently better  sound. “Digital recordings are a very good approximation to the  original,” he says. “Most people would be hard pressed to notice a  difference.”
Ackerman explains that the bad reputation that digital music gets for  its sound quality comes from a rushed shift to CD in the 1990s. Record  labels, in an effort to jump ahead of the curve, remastered old  recordings as quickly as they could. They often simply transferred the  original master tracks to the CDs, not realizing that the resulting  sound would be different. “The masters were tweaked to be as good as  possible for a record. The CD doesn’t have the same physical  characteristics,” says Ackerman. Early digital converters were  especially poor, but Ackerman says that digital sound has mostly caught  up with analog. While analog tapes wear out over time, the digital  copies that the studio makes preserve historical recordings for future  music enthusiasts.
But although he finds the sound quality argument less compelling than  the denizens of Audio Lab, Ackerman still sees a unique value in vinyl.  He, like Ryan and Volpe, would listen to music on vinyl as an activity  in itself, which Ackerman believes fosters an enhanced social skill he  calls “active listening.” “When you train yourself to pay attention on  that level, it’s a different form of consciousness,” he speculates.  “When people aren’t trained to do that, their social patterns and  behaviors become more self-centered and a lot less engaged in the world  around them.”
As I exit the studio, I suddenly feel a deep distaste for the headphones  in my pocket. Each sighting of a pair of earbuds makes me more and more  uncomfortable. Is appreciation for music diminishing because of how  easily it can be procured? Could I possibly be contributing to the  decline of social interaction?
DEMOCRATIZING SOUNDS
Talking to Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’15 is reassuring. Grozen-Smith, a  singer for The Harvard Callbacks, is engaged and inspired by music just  as much as the vinyl generation. He is a headphone wearer, but is  clearly passionate about what he is listening to and treats music as a  relaxant as well as a topic of conversation. He prizes his iPod and its  enormous capacity, which allows him to survey new music effortlessly. “I  have some music on my iPod, like musicals, that I’ve never listened to  before,” says Grozen-Smith. “But it’s not really hurting me. I don’t  have to hold a record. If I ever change my musical taste, it’s easy.”
Grozen-Smith rejects the values of music that vinyl supporters cherish.  He is puzzled by the idea of buying expensive headphones: Skullcandy  gets the job done. He doesn’t listen to complete albums, but cycles  through artists every couple of weeks. He listens to music while doing  homework, traveling, and working out. And when I ask him about the  negative social effects that worried me, he sweeps them aside. “I’m not  going to stop and talk to someone randomly on the street,” he says.  “Music helps me focus and shut out distractions. I listen to music to  enhance everything else I’m doing.”
Alec V. Guzov ’13 shares many of Grozen-Smith’s sentiments. Guzov is a  pianist, violinist, and guitarist who DJs for Harvard Radio Broadcasting  (WHRB) and mixes and samples for fun. His range of talents is boosted  by his easy access to a variety of musical influences. Moreover, his  computer allows him to mix easily and wherever he wants. “The MP3  democratizes sound,” he says. “Before, DJs had to lug around crates of  records. Now more people can have access to music.” Although Guzov is  more of an audiophile than Grozen-Smith, he is not put off by digital  sound. “As processing power improves, the difference becomes negligible.  Overall, the benefits of digital are a lot greater than anything you’d  lose from it.”
From this standpoint, the MP3 allows greater exploration and increases  the pubic musical vocabulary. The availability of music online has  created new listeners to thousands of artists across genres among every  generations People can still choose to listen to full albums on their  iPods, or they can assemble smorgasbords of favorites and avoid the  filler so common on pop albums.
45S AND FRIENDS
One explanation of these diverging viewpoints is simply a generational  divide. For the people who grew up with vinyl, part of the ideal music  is a certain physicality. That, and the crackle in the record evokes an  easy nostalgia. Meanwhile, the children of the digital era view vinyl as  bulky and archaic; they wonder why anyone wouldn’t use a system that  requires no more than a push of a button. Is it then the case that vinyl  supporters are motivated more by nostalgia than substantive differences  in taste? If so, digital music will only increase its dominance until  it, too, is outmoded. 50 years from now, a small set of crabby old  people will be reminiscing about the good old days of first generation  iPods.
Dan C. Cole ’14 doesn’t fit into this generational theory. A WHRB DJ,  Cole is as much of a turntable enthusiast as some of the hangers-on who  grew up with the technology in its heyday. I’m in Cole’s dorm room,  where he is lugging around a crate filled to the brim with full-length  albums and 45s. A turntable, connected to a Bose speaker, sits near his  doorway. He begins rummaging through his albums and finds a 45 he wants  to show to me. “If you look closely, you can see an engraved message in  the center of the vinyl,” he tells me excitedly, holding it up in the  light. “You can’t get this kind of thing with a CD or MP3 player.” He  places the record carefully onto his turntable and guides the needle on  with a pop.
Cole, though a member of Generation Y, collects records and appreciates  the tangible aspect of vinyl. He backs Ackerman’s active listening  theory, and, like Damroth and Ryan, views vinyl as promoting music as a  bonding experience. “Headphones are a less communal way of listening to  music,” he says. “If you can get a few people in a room listening to an  album, there’s an energy there that doesn’t exist when you’re listening  alone.”
Students like Cole are an important source of support for Planet Records  and other record stores that have managed to stay afloat. While many  teenagers embraced taking music as a daily supplement, Cole’s community  believes in a connoisseurship approach.
NO MIDDLE GROUND
Rare are the hybrids: people who fully embrace both the proactive,  tangible aspects of the vinyl and the accessibility of the MP3. The CD  seems a logical choice for those stuck in between. The form looks and  acts like a record, but is far more durable and easy to carry around.  Professor of History Peter E. Gordon is an connoisseur of classical  music who appreciates the CD’s versatility. He listens to music in his  office, where a turntable would be impractical; on the other hand, he  feels the MP3 can compromise the artistic intentions of the composer.  “My iPhone seems to have a mind of its own for multi-movement pieces,”  he says as we listen to the tiptoeing cello and piano of Beethoven’s  Cello Sonata in F Major. “CDs do a better job of preserving the  integrity of musical pieces.”
Gordon is a exception. The CD, a revolutionary piece of technology only  15 years ago, is quietly slipping into obscurity. To some, it is the  worst, not the best, of both worlds. It reaches neither the intimate,  tactile experience you get with a record nor the capacity and  convenience of an MP3 player.
Does that mean there is no middle ground? The last authority that I turn  to is Damon Krukowski. An expos teacher and indie rocker of bands  Galaxie 500 and Damon and Naomi, Krukowski is in the unique position of  having released records during the peak of all three listening media.  When Galaxy 500 released its first record in 1988, it was engineered  exclusively for vinyl. The switch to the CD necessitated a new outlook  on process of making a record – there were less points of orientation to  work with, and the increased volume range changed the way they  approached mixing. Now, Krukowski often listens to his band’s mixes on  MP3 and headphones before releasing them, to get a sense of how it will  sound to a large population of his listeners.
“Things were made for different formats,” he says. “It’s a great  experience to go back to the original formats. But there’ s lot of  hip-hop, pop, and dance which was made for the MP3, and should not be  heard on the LP.”
MUDDY AND FINE
The debate between the merits of vinyl and digital will rage on.  Different music was made for different time periods, and different music  players were made for different sorts of people. There will always be  music lovers for as long as modern culture exists, and they will  appreciate music in different manners and with different pieces of  equipment. “It’s all about how music fits into your life,” says  Grozen-Smith. Walking back from the Barker Center, I throw in my  headphones and listen the insistent acoustic strumming that introduces  Crosby, Stills and Nash’s Suite: Judy Blue Eyes. The bass is very hard  to hear, and the harmonies are muddy, but the music sounds just fine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Esan, a language of Nigeria, slam poet and musician Iyeoka Ivie Okoawo’s name means, “I want to be respected.” Okoawo demanded just that as she stepped into the middle of a small circle of red velvet couches at Wellesley College’s Multifaith Center. “I intend to create a new and beautiful world in me,” she had the audience repeat over and over, and once they had assumed a trance-like state, Okoawo picked up her African drum and began performing her mix of jazz music, poetry, and Nigerian proverb-songs.
From the start, her performance centered on exploring her Nigerian roots and sharing her personal connection to the Esan language with her audience. “I definitely have to admit [that finding my roots] is one of the biggest motivations for me right now because my family, they’re in Nigeria … it’s definitely a beacon for me.” True to her word, Okoawo is trying to learn Esan, one of her many endeavors that manifests itself in her primarily autobiographical work. These descriptive stories of her life allow Okoawo to convey her cultural heritage effectively.
Okoawo first discovered her love of poetry as an undergraduate at Northeastern University. Though her first career was as a pharmacist at Boston Medical Center, Okoawo continued performing after leaving Northeastern and eventually changed professions. “I’ve been [poetry] slamming competitively for 10 years, so I have this amazing body of work that … is grounded in my culture,” she says. “I’ve always been in search for ways of integrating [it] into my art so I can share more with people [who] don’t know much about the Esan culture.”
It was this ideal of cultural sharing through the arts that first drew Ji Hyang Padma, the director of spirituality and education programs at Wellesley College, to invite Okoawo to perform at the Multi-Faith Chapel. “I coordinate our ‘Art, Soul, and Spirituality’ series, which is a way of creating community through the transformative power of the arts,” she says. “When I saw Iyeoka for the first time … I felt a deep intimacy just through hearing her poetry and through hearing her song. You feel like you’re already a part of her life.”  Okoawo’s work is more about the sharing of personal stories and similarities across cultures than it is about one person’s journey. “I really feel like she created the small village in Nigeria right here,” says Yoobin Seo, a senior at Wellesley College. “ I think she was trying to wake all of us up.”
Okoawo has started a program called Lyrics for Literacy which, much like her performance at Wellesley, will allow her to share parts of her culture in return for a taste of her history and the history of those around her. “It’s an exchange program I’m creating where I get to learn my language and I can go to communities that still need some of those [English] literacy supplements,” she said. Okoawo’s inspiration for this educational project stems from the same material that influences her writing—books. Speaking of one of such books, Okoawo says, “There’s over a thousand proverbs for me to look at and laugh at and choose from and figure out how I can invest those words and those wisdoms into my art. This is what it [has] come into, this Lyrics for Literacy project.”
Sharing with and learning about different people and cultures is of paramount importance to Okoawo. “Every person that you meet at any point could play a role in your life that could change the dynamics of everything,” she says. “In all the moments of your life … the struggle and the joy, there’s always people.”

When art collectors spend thousands of dollars on a new piece, they generally like to know what they are buying. This is not the case in the Institute of Contemporary Art’s (ICA) latest fundraiser “75 Artists for 75 Years,” a collection of works donated in honor of the museum’s 75th anniversary. Each is on display and available for purchase at a cost of $3,000—but only through a blind drawing. Purchasers won’t know which work they will be bringing home until the exhibit closes on November 7.
This unconventional fundraiser is only one part of the festivities organized by ICA to commemorate its 75th birthday. Other components include a multimedia mural piece on the Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall crafted by the artist Swoon; an upcoming nine-screen video series about China created by Isaac Julien; and a cross-disciplinary exhibition entitled “Dance/Draw.” These exhibits, coupled with the unique fundraiser, reflect the ICA’s commitment to being on the cutting edge of contemporary art.
From its beginning, the ICA has sought out unconventional and underappreciated works. It opened in 1936 under the name “The Boston Museum of Modern Art” and acted as an eccentric offshoot of the already well established Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1939, it exhibited the first survey of painter Paul Gauguin’s work; shortly afterwards, in 1941, it showed paintings by Frida Kahlo. By the time the museum had been renamed the Institute of Contemporary Art in 1948, it had become a recognizable institution in the art world. In 1951, it displayed work by a young Lucian Michael Freud, followed by a 1966 performance piece by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, entitled “Exploding Public Inevitable.” Other renowned artists whose works have made an appearance include Edvard Munch, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Gehry, and Damien Ortega.
As a visitor assistant at the ICA for five years, Christina Tedesco has watched the museum undergo many changes. Most significant is the 2006 opening of the museum’s new waterfront building, designed by the award-winning architectural team Diller Scofidio + Renfro. The ICA’s sleek and spacious new waterfront home was conceived by the architects to integrate the museum with the outside world. A large mural space in the entryway is designed to be seen by paying visitors and the general public alike. ICA associate director of marketing, media relations and digital communications Colette Randall explains how the museum reflects changes in the art world itself. “Another development within contemporary art has been a move towards more labor-intensive modes of production, as well as a reconsideration of the traditional categories that have separated decorative art and craft from fine art,” she writes in an email. “We see this in the work of Charles LeDray and Josiah McElheny, both artists whose work has been presented at the ICA.”
Given the museum’s innovative past, it’s not surprising that the “75 for 75” benefit pushes the envelope of art sales. “It’s not common for a museum to have a [random] benefit drawing as an exhibit,” concedes Tedesco, “but since we’re a contemporary art institute, there’s a little more leeway.” The 75 works span a vast range of media: Julian Opie’s “Verity Walking” is an acrylic hologram that changes as you pass it by, Rodney McMillan’s contribution is a latex construction, and Carol Bove’s untitled sculpture consists of a walnut suspended by golden chains. One buyer will walk away with Jenny Holzer’s piece “Detainees,” which is made from a copy of a federal document on which all of the words have been blacked out except a chilling sentence about torture. “One of the unique aspects of contemporary art is that it places everyone—audiences, curators, and museum staff—in a shared conversation about new art and what it means,” writes Randall.
Like many visitors who stopped by the exhibit’s debut on a Thursday afternoon, Jude Gartland was unaware of the ongoing fundraiser. “It’s certainly an interesting concept,” says Gartland, adding that, while he was pleased with many of the pieces, he thinks buyers might be put off by the blind nature of the drawing. According to Gregory Lewis, associate professor of Economics at Harvard, “[Blind drawings are] an incredibly inefficient way to allocate resources.” He explains that they allocate the art to individuals based on chance, not who values it most. The fundraiser brings up the question of what art buyers value more, the artwork itself or the intangible benefits associated with owning a piece of ‘high art.’ “There are people who buy art because they love looking at it and want to own it,” writes Linda Poras, a professional art appraiser with years of experience, in an email, “and there are others who look at art as an investment.”
In the midst of an economic downturn, many museums have felt the effects of decreased consumer spending. The ICA reports it has maintained steady attendance numbers. Yet, Poras adds, “With more art museums than ever and non-profits competing for the same grant monies, it is more important than it has ever been to look to alternative revenue mechanisms.” Creative ideas like “75 for 75” may be what it takes for the ICA to remain at the forefront of the contemporary art world for another 75 years.

Last Wednesday, Troy Davis was killed by lethal injection in a maximum-security prison in Georgia. Davis was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer in 1989. The case drew international attention because all but two of the non-police witnesses in the case later retracted their testimonies, and there existed barely any physical evidence; the murder weapon was never found. Throughout this case, Davis has become a martyr in candlelight vigils in cities across the United States and right here in Harvard Square, while the real victim, Officer Mark MacPhail, has been largely forgotten. We regret that our legal system has created such confusion and, in a larger sense, lost the trust and faith of the American people in its handling of this particular case.
Affidavits collected by Amnesty International paint a picture of a group of witnesses bullied, intimidated, and harassed by the Georgia state police into pinpointing Davis as the murderer. “The truth is that Troy never confessed to me or talked to me about the shooting of the police officer. I made up the confession from information I had heard on T.V. and from other inmates about the crimes,” said witness Kevin McQueen. “I told them I didn’t know anything about who shot the officer, but they kept questioning me. I was real young at that time and here they were questioning me about the murder of a police officer like I was in trouble or something,” said Monty Holmes. Besides former witnesses, proponents of staying Davis’s execution included former jurors and even former presidents.
While hundreds of others people are sentenced to death each year in the United States, this case drew attention because of the flimsiness of the evidence against Davis. It is as likely as not that, last week, America executed yet another innocent man. Regardless of Davis’s innocence or guilt, however, the fact that doubt and unease will always cloud our memory of the case is an indictment of a legal system that purports to protect the unalienable rights of man, which include the right to life. That Troy Davis isn’t even the first man put to death in the United   States who may not even be guilty of the crime for which he was convicted—the name Cameron Todd Willingham should come to mind—only amplifies that indictment. If there is ever any doubt about the innocence of a person, it should go without saying that he or she should not be executed. However, it is clear that the justice system in certain states, such as Georgia, cannot be trusted to obey this maxim. Our courts are far from perfect, but the lack of faith in the American legal system that inevitably results from the execution of a dubiously guilty man whose guilt remains unproven is, in our view, the real tragedy here.
In the end, the outcry against the case, in this country at least, represented the larger struggles with racism against African-Americans still inherent in the American court system. As cited by a Pew Charitable Trust report, one in 12 black males between the ages of 18 and 64 are in prison, while one in 86 white males in the same range is. Around one in three black males can expect to be incarcerated at some point in their lives. The disparity between the rates of incarceration of men of different races, no matter what other structural or social factors are thrown into the mix, points to systemic injustice. Troy Davis may have received an unfair punishment, but, on top of everything else, these everyday indignities now demand our attention. The Harvard College Black Men’s Forum has issued an open letter in response to Davis’s execution, and we echo its call for justice.

The Harvard College Democrats and Republicans have not been living up to their potential, due to rules that harm both the parties they love and the student body they serve. Instead of serving as forums where the country’s future has a say in their party’s future, these groups toil away for parties that demand service from college students and give nothing in return. These policies deny us the voice we can and should have instead of empowering us.
The Harvard College Democrats and Republicans need to think hard about how to serve their parties best—by either toeing the enforced party line or by creating a party that better represents them. No one benefits from a lack of discourse in our country—particularly college students who have such little say in our nation’s affairs as it is. These groups can be powerful and influential to the benefit of all—but only if they want to be.
These groups need to start from scratch and throw out their old charters. The rules and regulations of each prevent anything resembling a conversation with the parties from ever happening. In both groups’ constitutions, they accept their party’s platform by default and shirk from endorsing a candidate until the party faithful has made its official decision. They commit valuable resources to a mission they have no part in deciding. It sends the wrong message about how politics should work in our country. Surely even the most party-line members of the Dems and the Harvard Republican Club have gripes about particular party policies. Rules that enforce blind acceptance of party policy silence the opinions of those who make up these groups. Granted, there may be a desire to be an umbrella organization that welcomes all party members and offends no one, but this is done at the cost of losing many redeeming qualities that attract individuals in the first place
This hinders the ability of these groups to do anything substantial on campus.  At a school where 80 percent of students voted for Obama, the Dems should be far and away the largest organization. Instead, a small core has alienated most self-identified Democrats.
Let’s face it: Most of the campus is unhappy with both parties. These groups cannot act on informative criticism of their parties, and so they silence and alienate some of the brightest and most opinionated students who could share their ideas. If these groups really wanted to work in the best interests of their parties, they would promote healthy criticism rather than run from it. The Dems and the HRC could attract more members if they tried to challenge the parties instead of falling in line. They could be innovative forums about college students’ particular visions of politics—instead people turn away from them because it’s nothing but the same old.
It gets no better come election time. The window of opportunity to influence the direction of the party is during primary season, but these groups slam that door shut by refusing to endorse a primary candidate. By the time they ramp up volunteer recruitment, knock on doors, and make phone calls, the moment for them to make their mark on the race has already passed.
The campaigning is not the problem—the problem is that the Dems and the HRC have no say in how their resources should be used. They lose clout when they sit out of the part of the election cycle where their resources could have a long-lasting impact.
If there were a concerted effort among college political groups to share what really matters to them during the primaries, politicians would bend over backwards to get their approval. Wouldn’t it be great if those candidates reflected the particular positions of the college kids who will spend cold hours knocking on doors for them?
The Harvard College Republican Club has been around since 1888, the oldest such group in the nation. Politicos would listen to them if they said something worthwhile. Some Democratic Senate candidates would love the endorsement of the Harvard Dems—if they had an endorsement to give. It’s sad that we, the country’s future, cannot influence the country’s political future.
The most frustrating part of this is that there is a clear answer to these problems. We could have groups that pressure the party establishment to hear us out. Young Democrats and Republicans should be a part of the discussion—not agents of the establishment. It’s not fair to the members of these groups, and it perpetuates a party system that doesn’t represent an important part of the electorate. The Dems and the HRC have the power to influence the nation’s politics; they just have to be courageous enough to use it.

In 1912, the adamantly socialist Eugene V. Debs won over 900,000 votes for president.  William Howard Taft, the sitting president and lone conservative on the ticket, captured just over 3,400,000. Imagine, for a moment, an America where a vocal socialist wins over one-quarter as many votes as the conservative, let alone a sitting president.  And I’m not talking about the kind of  “socialist” Newt Gingrich sees when watching President Obama on T.V.  Debs was in and out of jail, co-founded the International Workers of the World, and was arrested during the Pullman Strike of 1894.  That is a socialist.  And for every four people that voted for a Republican in 1912, one voted for Debs.
Today, 100 years later, a full 40 percent of Americans self-describe as conservative, while 35 percent identify as moderate, and a measly 21 percent call themselves liberal.  As for socialists, they may never top one percent again. Despite what right-wing pundits would have Americans believe, there is no American “left” anymore—just the remnants of what used to be called the center. The causes of this seismic change in America’s ideological landscape are innumerable, and the shift probably owes more to the increased material prosperity of the average American citizen than any other single factor. Yet it seems that our country is on a runaway train about to plunge off the rightward edge of the map.  This shift has been accelerated and intensified by folks like Rush Limbaugh and Fox News, who have harnessed the social and cultural conservatism of many Americans and blended them into a form of so-called “economic conservatism” better described as anti-tax orthodoxy.
Our nation’s race to the right has harmful ramifications that go beyond just making liberals wistful. In 2007, levels of income inequality reached their highest point since 1928, with the top one percent of households bringing in 23.5 percent of the nation’s income.  We all know what happened in 1929—and 2008.  There is no denying it: Economies are healthier when income distribution is more equal.  And the view, espoused by everyone from Speaker John A. Boehner, down to my 84-year-old government-subsidized great-aunt, that we need to keep taxes low on the rich, just isn’t remedying the problem.
Probably the most surprising and unnerving thing about America’s rightward plunge is that it seems to have no stopping point.  As the Republican Party moves right, the Democratic Party adjusts to encompass the people who used to make up the center.  And then the Republicans move further right.  Case-in-point: healthcare.  People used to think that Nixon was conservative. He did, after all, pioneer the now-infamous Southern Strategy, capturing the South for the Republicans with racially charged tactics.  Yet in 1974, Nixon proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Act, which included both an employer insurance mandate and a Medicare-style program available to everyone.  And the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 opposed the measure because it was too conservative!
Fast-forward twenty years, to 1994. At that time, a group of Republican senators including Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT) and Charles E. “Chuck”
Grassley (R-IA) introduced a bill containing the individual health insurance mandate as the conservative response to Clinton’s (and Nixon’s) employer mandate.  It was too conservative for Democrats at the time, but eventually, a new generation of Democrats, including President Obama, came around to it.  But by that time, the conservatives, many of them the same as those that had concocted the individual mandate, deemed that it was an affront to liberty.
How does the Republican party continue its triumphant march to the right, while the Democrats are constantly making compromise after compromise, with rarely a victory worth mentioning?  Part of it is the deft disbursal of misinformation by the Right. Republicans are talented at messaging, and, in a democracy, that’s more than half the battle. Another is the fact that social and economic conservatism have been bound together skillfully by the right.  Somehow, our political system dictates that if you oppose abortion and gay marriage, you also oppose increasing taxes on the rich. It was not always so, and that is part of what allowed FDR to win sweeping support in places like Louisiana where government programs were once tremendously popular.  If the rightward plunge of America is to stop, liberal politicians need to get better at bringing their economic ideas to the people.  As long as my 84-year-old government-subsidized great-aunt thinks that extending the Bush Tax Cuts is in her best interest, the Democratic message machine is broken.

The number of writers who repurpose other writers’ words and call it legitimate original artwork (not to mention the number of advocates for such a practice) is—very disconcertingly—on the rise.
Kenneth Goldsmith, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, is a vocal advocate of the practice. Goldsmith has just written a book called “Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age,” published this month by Columbia University Press, in which he argues that taking the writing of other writers and re-appropriating it is not only an acceptable practice but a praiseworthy technique that deserves to play a critical role in contemporary writing.
I couldn’t disagree more.
Goldsmith teaches a class at UPenn called “Uncreative Writing” in which, in Goldsmith’s (presumably not plagiarized) words: “students are penalized for showing any shred of originality and creativity. Instead they are rewarded for plagiarism, identity theft, repurposing papers, patchwriting, sampling, plundering, and stealing. Not surprisingly, they thrive…We retype documents and transcribe audio clips. We make small changes to Wikipedia pages (changing an “a” to “an” or inserting an extra space between words)…Each semester, for their final paper, I have them purchase a term paper from an online paper mill and sign their name to it, surely the most forbidden action in all of academia. Students then must get up and present the paper to the class as if they wrote it themselves, defending it from attacks by the other students. What paper did they choose? Is it possible to defend something you didn’t write? Something, perhaps, you don’t agree with? Convince us.”
Goldsmith seems to believe that students thrive in his class because the practice of “uncreative writing” is particularly well suited to today’s technology-saturated world, a world in which an incredible and unprecedented amount of text has become easily accessible.
Based on Goldsmith’s description of his class, I would argue that his students thrive not because “uncreative writing” is a revolutionary approach to literature that is particularly well suited to contemporary society but rather because the assignments sound, well, easy. Copying a document word for word? That’s typing, not writing. Changing a single “a” to “an” on a Wikipedia page? If the following word starts with a consonant, that could be a test of how eagle-eyed and grammatically obsessive Wikipedia reader-editors are, but it is certainly not a writing assignment. The final paper is the most “difficult” assignment described by Goldsmith by virtue of the fact that the students must be prepared to (verbally) defend the argument of a paper that they did not write. But, again, this is not writing. It’s the kind of exercise a debate team might take part in. Yes, of course it’s possible to defend something you didn’t write and don’t agree with. School debate teams defend political issues they disagree with, a task that often involves citing and supporting text written by others (e.g., legislation). Goldsmith’s requirement that students must sign their names to the paper they have purchased certainly exemplifies his opposition to academia’s stance on plagiarism and what constitutes plagiarism, but it hardly proves that claiming another person’s intellectual property is acceptable.
Of course—and this seems almost unnecessary to have to say—just because the Internet provides you with the ability to purchase an academic paper written by someone else does not mean that you should. More importantly, however, doing so doesn’t make you a writer.
Goldsmith is hardly the only advocate of so-called “uncreative writing.” Literary critic and Stanford professor Marjorie Perloff has gone so far as to call such poetry “unoriginal genius,” a subject she explores in a book published last year called “Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century.” The book explores the role of poets in today’s world of “hyper-information.” Perloff refers to this world as one in which, as Walter Benjamin predicted over 70 years ago, everyone is potentially an author. Perloff uses this as a jumping off point through which to explore what she views as the positive development of unoriginal writing.
Benjamin’s prediction was right: Today, with the help of technology, everyone is potentially an author. Today, also thanks to technology, potential authors have access to an unprecedented amount of published writing as well. Reading and learning from the works of other writers is a valuable activity for any writer or aspiring writer, and it is wonderful that modern technology allows for such easy access to texts. But the only thing that makes a person a writer is writing, using one’s own words. Retyping a chapter of, say, “Moby-Dick,” and adding an adjective or two or inserting a few spaces in between words to “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” is not just plagiarism. It’s offensive. Any self-respecting literary scholar, writer, or aspiring writer should know better.

Seventy-five years worth of candle wax, incense smoke, and general wear and tear left quite a mark on the Society of St. John the Evangelist monastery in Cambridge. But after an 18-month, $11 million renovation and restoration of its chapel, guesthouse, and monastery buildings, the society’s monks are ready to welcome guests and worshippers again.
Originally built during the Great Depression, the Episcopal monastery just steps from the Kennedy School on Memorial Drive is currently home to nine monks. The guesthouse hosts visitors who come for spiritual retreat, including Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates.’
As part of the restoration, a specialist carefully cleaned each of the chapel’s stained glass windows—depicting the lives of monastic saints—with a solution of ammonia and water.
“We’re seeing colors we’ve never seen before,” said Brother Kevin Hackett, a resident monk and director of communications at the monastery.
Contractors installed new wiring and plumbing and reinsulated the complex for temperature and sound. Guest rooms were refurbished and outfitted with energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, and a handicap-accessible was bathroom added. The renovation also repaired leaks in the chapel tower, roof, and walls, and replaced the bell that calls the brothers to prayer five times a day.
Little known to Harvard undergraduates, the monastery was built between 1924 and 1936 on land donated to the society by Boston heiress Isabella Stewart Gardener. The buildings were designed by a well-known collegiate and ecclesiastical architect, Ralph Adams Cram, who also designed the campuses of Princeton and Rice Universities, as well as Princeton Chapel and many churches throughout New England. The romanesque Society of St. John the Evangelist (SSJE) chapel, dedicated to St. John and St. Mary and built with granite taken from New England quarries, is considered a departure from Cram’s usual neogothic style, according to Hackett.
As he put finishing touches on the chapel floor Thursday, laborer foreman Brian Pike remarked on how this project has been different from a typical construction job.
“We’re a commercial contractor, so we don’t get to see a lot of the real old stuff,” said Pike. “It’s interesting, it’s dirty, but it’s definitely rewarding if you’re into the old architecture.”
The guesthouse welcomed its first post-renovation visitors on September 13, and chapel services are now running on a regular five-a-day schedule. The brothers have moved back in, after being split between the society’s second home, Emery House in West Newbury, and temporary housing in Cambridge.
“As with any kind of renewal or construction project, it took much more time than we had imagined,” said Hackett. “The sense of displacement underscored for us how central the monastery was—particularly the chapel—to our sense of corporate identity and what we do.”
Though SSJE was founded in 1866 in Cowley, England, the brothers are very much engaged in modern-day culture. They maintain an extensive website, with a collection of over 500 sermons and a daily mailing list called “Brother, Give Us a Word.”
Hackett himself dresses as only a 21st century monk could—long black robes, simple glasses, hair cut short and an iPhone in hand.
And what sort of applications does a monk have on his phone? “I have Skype, I have Yahoo, I have the Weather Channel and I have Epicurious because I like to cook,” Hackett said.
Still, guestrooms at the monastery are plain and devoid of technology—apart from new, energy-efficient lighting and air conditioners. “One of the ways in which we are endeavoring to offer a kind of 21st century monastic hospitality is to offer a sense of being quiet and unconnected, so that the deepest part of ourselves can be reconnected with God,” said
Hackett.
Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer, acting Pusey Minister at Memorial Church, described the renovation as a symbol of the society’s commitment to providing a refuge for the public. Meyer first encountered the SSJE brothers when he was in seminary, 32 years ago, and credits them with providing him both spiritual direction and space to retreat.
“The rooms are nice, but what they represent is even nicer,” Meyer said. “They represent that the brothers have rededicated themselves to providing Christians from all over the country a space where they can be quiet, discern, heal, and grow.”

The results of the Undergraduate Council general election were released on Friday, revealing a promising increase in female representation.
Ninety-nine students ran for a total of 51 open positions. Many of the races proved competitive—in the Ivy Yard, 42 candidates competed for 3 spots.
The Council welcomed 19 female members, increasing female representation to 37 percent from 25 percent last year.
“Female underrepresentation has been a bit of a problem,” said UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “That is a lot of improvement for one year.”
Among freshman members of the UC, female representation jumped from 8 percent to 25 percent.
Quincy Representative Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 was the only freshman female on the UC last year. She said the UC adopted several initiatives aimed at encouraging more female representation on the Council, including workshops and office hours sharing effective campaign techniques.
Zhu said she felt female candidates last year tended to be less aggressive in their campaign strategies.
“I remember seeing a bunch of guys going door to door while most of the girls would just slip notes under the door,” she said. “So while half the candidates were male and half were female, this did not spill over to the results.”
This year too, despite a considerable proportion of females running, the winners were disproportionately male.
“In my yard, more girls ran than guys,” said C.C. Gong ’15, Oak Yard representative and one of three freshman females elected to the UC. “So I don’t think it is an issue of who is running.”
New Ivy Yard representative Salena Cui ’15 agreed. “Quite a few girls were campaigning,” she said. “People just tend to vote for male candidates more.”
The new members said they did not think that an imbalanced gender ratio would affect their experience or the effectiveness of the UC.
“Girls and guys look from different perspectives and bring different ideas to the table,” Cui said. “But in general, everyone has an idea about what changes they hope to see at Harvard and I do not think this will differ much between guys and girls.”
Zhu, who is also a Crimson photographer, said she does not think gender affected her performance on the Council last year. “I think it is important to encourage girls to run and take the risk,” she said. “But in the end, a quality candidate is a quality candidate.”

Despite the tentative agreement reached with Securitas on Thursday, contract negotiations are not over for the union representing campus security guards. This week, representatives will begin negotiations with the University regarding Tuition Assistance Program benefits, which the tentatively-approved contract stipulates Securitas will provide—if Harvard agrees to pay for it.
The Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is a University-wide program which allows eligible employees and retirees an opportunity to take undergraduate or graduate courses for at most 25% of the cost—and sometimes for as little as $40. Currently, security guards are not eligible for the program because they are not direct employees of Harvard, but rather contractors working for Securitas.
Leaders within SEIU Local 615, the union that represents security workers and custodians on campus, said that it is unfair that security guards do not get the same benefits as University employees.
“We believe there should be one Harvard, not first and second class citizens,” said director of higher education for Local 615 Wayne M. Langley. “Our workers are essentially employed by Harvard. They should all have the same benefit packages.”
Langley said that union negotiators will bring up the issue of TAP benefits at contract negotiations for custodial workers this Thursday, adding that they would like TAP benefits for all contracted workers, not just security guards.
“It’s a convenient fiction that there are these other employers who have no connection to Harvard,” Langley said. “We say follow the money—it leads back to Harvard.”
While contractors do not enjoy access to the TAP program, they are able to participate in Harvard’s Bridge Program, a University-wide program which provides inexpensive or free access to preparatory courses that teach topics such as English as a second language.
But many security guards said the TAP program represents a chance to improve their job prospects in the future.
“Being able to take classes would make a difference to a lot of us,” said one security guard, who wished to remain anonymous in order to protect his relationship with his employer. “It means that we might be able to move past being just a guard one day.”
Another guard says that it feels like a sign of disrespect that the University provides TAP benefits to some workers and not others.
“We’re just as important as any of the other workers at Harvard,” said another security guard, who wished to remain anonymous in order to protect his relationship with his employer. “Why don’t we deserve what other workers get? It’s just not right.”
Still, Langley said that he is not going into negotiations expecting a battle with the University on this issue.
“We expect Harvard to provide it and until they tell us they’re not going to provide it, then we really don’t have a disagreement,” Langley said. “I’m hoping we will all see eye to eye.”
The University declined to comment for this article.

Harvard scientists have developed a biomaterial with even less friction than Teflon, one of the smoothest materials ever developed.
The new material, called SLIPS—Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces—may have applications ranging from fuel transportation to bacterial prevention to medical equipment.
Tak-Sing Wong, a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who led the project, drew inspiration for the new material from a carnivorous plant that lures prey into its cupped leaves that are too slippery to escape from.
Wong’s new material, described in a study published in Nature last week, derives its frictionless features from the structural orientation of the carnivorous pitcher plant’s leaf surface.
“Our surface pretty much consists of two components: One is a rough and porous surface, and the second component is the liquid, which is infiltrated within this porous solid,” Wong said. “So this liquid is actually a little bit above the porous solid.”
The surface layer of liquid embedded in new material is so smooth that it repels many other substances, including oil.
This repelling property will make SLIPS a prime candidate for coating the insides of oil pipelines, which will greatly reduce pipe resistance and make energy transport more efficient, according to Wong.
There are numerous other possible applications for SLIPS, including preventing the formation of ice in refrigerator coils and repelling blood on medical tubing.
Wong compared the repellent process of SLIPS to hydroplaning.
“After raining, the road has a very thin layer of water on top of it. And under the tire now you see a very thin layer of water, which starts to loosen the gripping, or loses the friction, such that the car will start hydroplaning on the surface,” he said.
In addition, SLIPS are extremely durable due to their self-healing nature.
According to Wong, when an object impacts a liquid, an indent is made on the liquid surface. But once the object is removed, the fluid nature of the water allows it to refill the space that was occupied, in effect “self-healing.” Because SLIPS are coated in liquid, they react similarly, he said.
“The versatility of SLIPS, their robustness and unique ability to self-heal makes it possible to design these surfaces for use almost anywhere, even under extreme temperature and pressure conditions,” said materials science professor Joanna Aizenberg, who oversaw the project. “It potentially opens up applications in harsh environments, such as polar or deep sea exploration, where no satisfactory solutions exist at present.”

Approximately 400 politicians, activists, and citizens from across the political spectrum convened this weekend at Harvard Law School to discuss the contentious possibility of holding a second constitutional convention.
The two-day “Conference on the Constitutional Convention”—hosted jointly by the Tea Party Patriots, Fix Congress First!, and HLS—consisted of a series of speeches and panels exploring the legal and political repercussions of holding an Article V Convention, as well as discussions of both liberal and conservative perspectives on the issue.
Article V of the United States Constitution provides that a convention to amend the Constitution may be held if two-thirds of state legislatures consent to it. Due to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary support, a constitutional convention has never been assembled under Article V.
Mark Meckler, co-chair of the conference and the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, commented on recent media concerns that the Tea Party was “descending” on Harvard, saying that conference attendees should embrace rather than denounce differing political opinions.
“These are the differences and the debates that made our country great,” he said. “[Some of the Founding Fathers] disliked each other, sometimes intensely. They debated intensely, and they still came to consensus.”
Meckler’s sentiment was echoed by his co-chair Lawrence Lessig, a Law School professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. “We are American citizens, and we have a duty to pass to our children a republic as inspiring as the one our forefathers passed to us,” he said in his opening statement.
Those who attended the conference were united by a sense of mutual dissatisfaction with the current political climate. When one speaker asked the audience how many thought the system was broken, nearly every hand in the room went up.
“I am here out of desperation,” said Cenk K. Uygur, host of online news show The Young Turks, which airs on YouTube. “I don’t see an alternative to a system that is fundamentally broken.”
Richard D. Parker, a Law School professor, expressed similar disappointment in the presence of a “governmental academic media complex” in the United States—the result of which is the exclusion of regular Americans from political decision-making.
“The mass of Americans have come to loathe the governing class as much as the governing class loathes them, and that gives us [the non-governing class] power,” Parker said.
But not all attendees agreed that a constitutional convention was the answer.
Proponents see a constitutional convention called by the states as the only way to circumvent Congressional and Supreme Court decisions—notably in the areas of campaign financing and freedom of speech.
“The Framers knew there might be times when Congress is not capable of the proposing the amendments that the country needs,” Lessig said.
But even among the supporters of a convention, views differ on the underlying problems that necessitate constitutional reform.
John Samples of the Cato Institute expressed his belief that the intended power balance of federalism has been lost in contemporary government.
Uygur said he feared that the needs of citizens have become irrelevant in the political process.
And Christopher Blazejewski, a Rhode Island state representative, expressed his concern that present-day issues are so vastly different from those imagined by the Constitution’s authors that the document is simply out-of-date.
Opponents of the initiative expressed concerns that a runaway convention would lead delegates to deviate from an assigned agenda, resulting in radical and unprecedented changes to the Constitution.
“The timing is not appropriate for this type of experimentation. America is like a ship in the middle of a storm,” said Alexandra Filindra, a political scientist from William Paterson University, echoing the opinion held by many that the status quo might be less risky than a new approach.
As the weekend’s activities came to a close, panelists reflected on the uncertain future of a constitutional convention.
“One thing I really learned is how hard it’s going to be to bridge the gap between the willing participant, those who show up, and the general public,” Lessig said.
Meckler seemed even more undecided about the initiative’s future, saying he was “neither for nor against” the idea. “For me, the point [of the conference] was to get people in a room together to discuss these things,” he said.

Innovation was the mantra at School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ semesterly All-Hands meeting on Friday afternoon.
“Our aim [is] integrating innovation and entrepreneurship into all that we do,” said SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, outlining SEAS’ efforts to foster creativity and entrepreneurship.
New facilities, including the iLab in Allston and renovated design space in Maxwell Dworkin, will provide more opportunities for student-initiated projects and design-based courses, Murray said.
And programs such as the I3 Competition, College Entrepreneurship Forum, and HackHarvard—and courses like ES 20: How to Create Things and Have them Matter and CS 179: Design of Usable Interactive Systems—are pushing students to embrace their own ideas.
Murray also noted the creation of new academic programs, including concentrations in electrical and mechanical engineering, a secondary field called Innovation for the Social Good, and a Ph.D. program in Bioengineering in conjunction with Harvard Medical School.
Additionally, the school is looking to strengthen relationships with industry to provide students with more diverse internship opportunities, she said.
And as SEAS plans for new construction and looks to increase the number of faculty and course offerings, Murray pointed to industry as a potential source of funding.
“We are looking at a future where federal funding is not going to be increasing,” she said.
Citing the SEAS budget for fiscal year 2012, which was submitted in June 2011 and includes approximately $104 million in expenses and $95 million of income, Murray said that the school is fully prepared to dip into its reserves to help fund the difference. She added that the capital campaign will be another critical source of financial support.
“[We’re] focused on bringing administration to the school,” she said. “Staff needs to be at critical mass.”
A newly organized administrative team composed of Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal, Associate Dean for Development Linda Fates, and an Executive Dean for Administration still to be hired, will help facilitate many of these changes. They also hope to develop joint student projects with engineering universities across the globe—a goal Murray has already discussed with deans of engineering institutions in India, China, and Brazil.
Murray’s ambitious vision for the future of SEAS reflects a rapidly growing interest in engineering and the applied sciences at Harvard. Enrollment in fall undergraduate SEAS courses has increased by more than 500 students since last fall, to around 1,900 students.
“Our progress has been remarkable, if you look at the students voting with their feet,” Murray said.
Murray holds the All-Hands meeting twice a year to update staff and students on SEAS’ upcoming challenges and goals.

President of Chile Sebastián Piñera defended his administration’s attitude towards the protest movement in Chile at a forum held at the Institute of Politics on Friday, charging that he and his administration have been receptive to demonstrators’ demands. Piñera also stressed Chile’s need to continue advancing the country’s economic status.
A large crowd of protestors gathered outside of the IOP on Friday during Piñera’s speech, chanting “La Gente unida jamas sera vencida!” which is Spanish for “The people united shall never be defeated.”
The demonstration comes amidst a recent spree of protests against the Piñera government over the past four months. A mass demonstration in Chile’s capital city of Santiago last Thursday included tens of thousands of protestors marching through the streets.
Piñera is deeply unpopular among students and teachers, who have been protesting the government’s education policies as well as the funding disparities between private and public schools, which some have referred to as “educational apartheid.”
Holding an approval rating of 27 percent, Piñera holds the lowest rating of any Chilean president since 1990, when dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet was still in power. The disapproval rating for the current administration’s education policy is even lower at 19 percent.
Critics of the Piñera administration have charged that the government has sought to suppress protests, effectively stomping on students’ and teachers’ freedom of assembly.
“We have never repressed the right to gather or protest. That is a constitutional right,” Piñera said on Friday.
Piñera also pointed to steps his administration has taken to improve the education system in Chile, recently promising a $4 billion dollar increase in education funding.
“Our government is dedicated to quality, access, funding, and equality in education. [We are] undertaking the educational reform that should have been undertaken many years ago by former government [administrations],” Piñera said. “We’ll do that because, while we were not a part of the problem, we want to be part of the solution.”
One of the protestors’ key complaints is that income disparities prevent poor students from affording a university-level education.
But Piñera shot back at calls for university education to be free and government-subsidized for everyone.
“At the university level, we think that education should be free only for those people who really need it. We don’t think it is feasible or fair to advance the education of the rich,” Piñera said.
Striking a different tone, Piñera also pointed to his administration’s economic accomplishments since he assumed office in 2010.
The International Monetary Fund projects that Chile’s total growth in GDP will be 6.5 percent by the end of 2011, even as the U.S. and Europe continue to suffer from the global recession.
But the President is also cautious about the road ahead for his country, citing that Chile is still considered part of the developing world. “We are still only half way in our mission to transform Chile,” Piñera said. “Some people thing we have reached the summit, but ... we must continue to work over the next decade.”
As he finished his remarks, Piñera paused to impart some advice to students in the audience.
“You are in the best parts of your lives,” he said. “So try to share your idealism and optimism with people who are older than you, like me.”

A search committee­­ formed by University President Drew G. Faust has begun its search for a new Pusey Minister at Harvard’s Memorial Church.
“I am committed to finding a minister who will lead a vibrant congregation and carry on the church’s rich tradition of preaching and pastoral work, while also engaging in a robust way the diverse religious communities across Harvard,” said Faust, who serves as the chair of the committee, in a statement.
The position of Pusey Minister has been vacant since the death of longtime Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes in February.
The committee, which includes professors, Harvard chaplains, and a diverse representation of other groups across the Harvard community, held its first meeting in May and reconvened in September.
The group plans to meet on a regular basis, but has not set a deadline to select a new minister, said Islamic Studies Professor Ali S. Asani ’77.
Asani said the committee is currently evaluating the candidates that have been nominated for the position through an open nomination process.
While the group is still in the early stages of the search, committee members expressed enthusiasm at the task at hand.
“The president has appointed a very thoughtful committee to work hard at what is a significant task,” said University Marshal and committee member Jackie A. O’Neill, who handles important visiting guests and functions at the University. “We all know that Peter Gomes was an iconic member of our community. We’re working hard to find someone [to follow him].”
Memorial Church followers say that Gomes will indubitably be a tough act to follow. Gomes became a prominent face on campus and garnered international recognition during his nearly 35 years as the church’s Pusey Minister.
“While attendance at some college churches has dwindled, it has not at all at Memorial Church,” said Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr. this March. “Part of the reason for this is the eloquence of Peter’s preaching and his welcoming attitude.”
Reverend Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer has served as the church’s acting minister since March. Meyer rejoined the clergy in December of 2010 as the associate minister for administration under Gomes. He had previously served as associate minister from 1997 to 1999.

Undergraduate Council Vice President Bonnie Cao '12 will serve as First Class Marshal, the Harvard Alumni Association announced Monday evening.
Cao, a Pforzheimer House resident and Government concentrator, will be joined by Lange P. Luntao '12 of Kirkland House as Second Class Marshal.
Cao and Luntao are charged with working with the rest of the Senior Class Committee to represent the Class of 2012 in the HAA, plan Senior Week activities, and select the Class Day speaker.
The class marshals were picked from a group of 63 seniors, which was narrowed down to a field of 16 before the final eight were chosen.
Nearly 1,000 seniors participated in the final round of voting, according to an email from HAA coordinator for student outreach Clint Ficula, and about a half an hour before polls closed, he said that only two votes separated the candidates for first and second class marshal.
The other six class marshals are Oluwadamilola “Dammy” Akinfenwa '12 of Cabot House, Matthew J. DaSilva '12 of Adams House, Annie E. DeAngelo '12 of Pforzheimer House, Athena Louise M. Lao '12 of Cabot House, Sanjay P. Misra '12 of Adams House, and Barthalomew "B.A." Sillah '12 of Eliot House.

Harvard University’s home page was hacked Monday morning by a group calling themselves the “Syrian Electronic Army.”
The hackers, sympathizers with the Syrian regime, replaced photos on the page with an image of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad with the tagline “Syrian Electronic Army Were Here.”
“The University’s homepage was compromised by an outside party this morning,” University spokesperson John D. Longbrake confirmed in a statement. “We took down the site for several hours in order to restore it. The attack appears to have been the work of a sophisticated individual or group.”
The hackers describe themselves as “a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria,” on their website.
In a Youtube video linked from its website, the group showed images of the University's hacked website.
“The site has been breached to spread our message even if illegally,” the hackers wrote in their video.
The video threatened America for its support of anti-regime protests in Syria.
“Do you support the war on Syria? If you are you, as well as the following Syria’s population of 23 million people. This means 23 million mobile bomb. Imagine what we could do.”
Protests against al-Assad’s one-party rule have wracked Syria for months, and international human rights organization have condemned the Syrian regime for its widespread use of violence in attempting to suppress the protests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It felt like déjà vu.
Against Holy Cross last week, Harvard scored 14 points in the first 16 minutes. The offense looked unstoppable. The Crimson and the Crusaders looked about as well-matched as two right shoes. But after that second score, the wheels fell off, and Harvard only managed to tack on eight more points the rest of the way.
So naturally, when the Crimson scored 14 unanswered points in 17 minutes on Friday night to again take a commanding early lead, I felt like I was living Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s recurring nightmare.
But then I realized that things had changed. This wasn’t the same ragtag bunch that had taken Fitton Field last week. This was a team—and a damn good one.
Sure, there were some mistakes on Harvard’s part. The offensive line was porous at times and committed too many penalties. And for much of the middle two quarters, the offense looked as stagnant as it had last weekend in Worcester. Colton Chapple had a grand total of 16 passing yards in the third quarter (though a lot of that had to do with the rain).
But ultimately I think Murphy captured it best when during the post-game press conference, he nodded the entire time. And when Chapple answered questions, Murphy had trouble hiding his smile and looked like a doting father.
There had to have been a lot of smiling and nodding from the Harvard football faithful against Brown. Because on Friday night, so many great story lines emerged.
The first has become clichéd in the sport of football (it happened a few miles down I-95 in Foxboro a decade ago, in case you forgot). The veteran starter gets hurt. The largely untested backup is thrust into the limelight. And he steps in brilliantly.
This same story line emerged once more against Brown, when Chapple filled in beautifully for the injured Collier Winters. Other than one pick off a tipped ball, the junior played fairly flawlessly, especially given the horrific throwing conditions. Even if he sees no more action in 2011, the Georgia native has proved himself capable and ready of taking the reins next season.
But Chapple’s most impressive skill? He knew exactly how to use his receivers, especially Cameron Brate–just lob it up near him and let the 6’5 beast do his thing.
Last weekend, when the sophomore tight end made a few big catches, we asked, “Who is this kid?”
Now we know. And after his one-handed, highlight-reel, leave-your-mouth-wide-open catch in the second quarter, so does everyone else. Brate has emerged as the go-to guy on a talented receiving corps.
But while the offense shined—and it did—it was the Harvard defense that owned the night.
After last week’s gaffes, its vaunted secondary solved all of its problems, and then some. Senior defensive back Matthew Hanson did a pretty convincing Darrelle Revis impersonation, limiting Brown’s best receiver to a whopping 19 receiving yards. Only one Bears pass all night went for more than 20 yards.
The rest of the Harvard ‘D’ didn’t look too shabby, either. Junior linebacker Joshua Boyd picked up right where the injured Blaise Deal left off with a big, 11-tackle performance. Junior linebacker Bobby Schneider did it all—a sack, a pick, and seven tackles.
And the defensive line? Hard to handle. Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero was scrambling and hurried and flustered all night long. One of the game’s great plays came when sophomore defensive tackle Jake Boy drilled the Brown quarterback mid-throw, leading to an interception.
And of course, senior defensive lineman Josue Ortiz looked pretty good, too. He harassed Newhall-Caballero for three quarters, hunting him down, stalking him, until he finally broke through in the fourth with a resounding, lightning-quick, 10-yard sack that you could feel from the press box. The man goes after quarterbacks with the same ferocity that freshmen attack sundae bars.
And as for Brown? Well, the Bears did a spot-on impression of last week’s Harvard team, committing critical blunders left and right. The score actually overstated the difference between the two squads. If senior defensive back Dan Minamide hadn’t caught an errant pass in the end zone and Newhall-Caballero didn’t bungle it at the one-yard line, it would’ve been a different ball game—maybe even a different outcome.
Brown coach Phil Estes knew it. When asked why his team lost despite comparable statistics, he barked, “Are you serious? Come on. Turnovers.”
The man looked about as happy as the cruise director of the Lusitania.
But it wasn’t just that Brown lost the game. Harvard won it in really every aspect. The Crimson couldn’t have been much more technically sound. And a host of players—some even coming in as replacements—proved themselves to be superstars in the making.
Murphy had it right. There’s a lot to smile about.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colton Chapple did not know that he was definitely playing until right before kickoff of Friday night’s Ivy home opener against Brown.
The junior quarterback hadn’t officially heard the status of senior Collier Winters, who had suffered a hamstring injury at the end of the Crimson’s loss at Holy Cross a week earlier.
But with the oft-injured Winters listed as a game-time decision, Chapple knew he had to be prepared.
By the end of the game Saturday night, it was the Bears defense that proved insufficiently ready, as Chapple threw for 207 yards and two touchdowns to lead Harvard to a 24-7 win and prevent his team from losing two consecutive games for the first time since 2006.
“Being a backup, you’ve always got to be ready, because you never know when you’re going to go in,” Chapple said. “Unfortunately, Collier went down, and I had to step up.”
Last season, the Georgia native appeared in nine contests, but completed just 47 percent of his passes and threw three interceptions to go with three touchdowns.
But under the lights Friday at the Stadium, the junior was much more efficient, completing 58 percent of his throws—including 9-of-13 to start—despite being plagued by multiple rain-induced drops.
Chapple’s only interception went right through his intended receiver’s hands, and he threw two picture-perfect touchdowns. On the first, the junior placed a touch pass over two defenders to sophomore tight end Cameron Brate, putting the ball where only Brate could catch it—which the sophomore did, with a fancy one-handed grab as he steamrolled towards the end zone. On the second, Chapple released an accurate deep ball to senior wide receiver Adam Chrissis, hitting the senior in stride along the right sideline for a 56-yard score midway through the third quarter.
“No one loves to play the game of football more than Collier,” Chapple said. “You see that intensity—that’s why he gets hurt all the time, he plays so hard ... Collier’s a great leader. You can’t replace Collier.”
But should Winters need to miss time again, the junior proved that his squad can be confident not just in his ability to manage a game, but also to win.
SCALING TO NEW HEIGHTS
Chapple’s job was made easier by a breakout performance from junior running back Treavor Scales, who exploded against the Bears after managing just 68 yards against the Crusaders.
Playing behind a young but improving offensive line, Scales continued to find holes and pickup big gains all night. The junior started the game’s scoring with a one-yard touchdown run 9:48 into the first quarter, and finished the period with 54 yards on eight carries. He had eclipsed the century-mark just eight carries later—his fourth career hundred-yard game—and finished with 129 yards rushing overall.
Just as Chapple proved himself an able backup for Winters, Scales established himself as a capable full-time back, a role he moved into following the departure of 2010 Ivy League co-Player of the Year Gino Gordon ’11.
“Treav, along with the offensive line, did a great job tonight,” Chapple said. “They opened up some holes for him, Treavor ran the ball extremely hard, and that opened up the play-action passing game and got the defense back on their heels.”
TURNING THE TIDE
If someone was playing Ivy League fantasy football this week and owned the Harvard defense, he or she would have been quite pleased with the unit’s performance against Brown. The Crimson applied pressure to Bears QB Kyle Newhall-Caballero all evening, forcing rushed throws and picking up 10 QB hits and five tackles for loss.
“The guys up front did a great job,” captain Alex Gedeon said. “We didn’t blitz all that much tonight ... but guys came in, stepped up and got pressure.”
That pressure inevitably led to turnovers, as Harvard forced two interceptions and recovered three costly fumbles on the night.
Brown running back Marc Kachmar lost the ball twice, once as Brown was driving towards midfield early in the second quarter and later at the one-yard line when the Bears were on the verge of tying up the game.
“[The turnovers] took away all the momentum we had in the second half,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “We just squandered too many opportunities ... it’s something we’ve got to fix.”
Junior defensive end John Lyon forced a Newhall-Caballero fumble as the Bears were attempting to get back the contest midway through the fourth quarter, leading to a Crimson field goal. On Brown’s next drive, sophomore end Jake Boy hit Newhall-Caballero while he was in the process of throwing, and junior linebacker Bobby Schneider grabbed the ball out of the air for the interception to all but seal the deal for the Crimson.
It was Newhall-Caballero’s second pick of the game. His first was snagged by senior safety Dan Minamide in the Harvard end zone on a third-and-goal early in the second quarter.
“Our kids just played so hard, and if you play that hard, you can force some turnovers, and you have the chance to be in every single game,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I’m really proud of our kids.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s soccer team’s preseason made it clear that Harvard coach Ray Leone had some kinks to work out.
Working with a roster featuring nine incoming freshmen and six returning sophomores, Leone has tried various lineups and position changes in order to find the perfect balance of experience and youth.
Though the squad entered league play with a 3-4 record and riding a three-game losing streak, none of that mattered when the Crimson took on defending Ivy champion Penn on Friday at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, where Leone’s maneuvering paid off.
It looks as if the squad’s recent string of losses had, in fact, revealed many weaknesses that were able to be addressed during the week leading up to the much-anticipated league opener.
DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS
In Harvard’s first four contests—three of which were one-goal wins—the Crimson offense out-scored its opponents, 7-5.
But in the subsequent three games, Harvard’s offense slowed down and could not rely on its defense to pull through.
BU, Hofstra, and Rhode Island out-scored the Crimson by a cumulative score of 11-6.
What became clear, especially after Hofstra’s 5-4 win over Harvard, was that the back line needed to do a better job of closing spaces and tackling aggressively.
Against the Quakers, the Crimson did just that. When the visiting team controlled possession in the middle of the field, Harvard found ways of stripping the ball and going for the quick counterattack.
The Crimson’s defenders were precise in their tackling and successfully held the Penn offense at bay. In the air, the Quakers had no luck; Harvard’s back line was not afraid to head the ball forward or direct exact passes to its players on the wings. Co-captain Melanie Baskind praised her defense and called Friday night’s effort “the [defensive] performance of the season by far.”
Penn could only muster four shots on goal and nine shots in total, giving Crimson rookie goalkeepers Bethany Kanten and Cheta Emba a relatively easy night. Despite playing the first league game in their young careers, the freshmen rose to the occasion and commanded the defense throughout the match.
Quaker fans may point to the absence of injured sophomore Kerry Scalora as a major reason for Penn’s listless attack. Given the home team’s strong defensive showing, it would have been doubtful that the Quaker playmaker could have changed the outcome of the game. On the season, Scalora has only one goal from 28 shots, a low rate of efficiency that would not have fared well against the strong back line the Crimson exhibited on Friday.
OFFENSE WINS GAMES
With the defense doing its part, the home offense knew that the team’s fate would lie on its feet.
The Crimson attack bombarded Penn with 16 shots, forcing Quaker goalkeeper Sarah Banks to deal with eight shots on goal—two of which eluded her.
The successful pair came from Baskind, who was precise in her finishing Friday night. The co-captain leads the team with four goals, four assists, and 12 points on the season.
“The team was flying tonight, and [Baskind] just ended up on the end of these [opportunities],” Leone said. “She’s world-class.”
While Penn got off to a sluggish start, from the beginning there was a palpable confidence when Harvard possessed the ball. Despite the wet conditions, the Crimson found ways to send dangerous passes to its forwards, and the midfield forced the Quakers to scramble all over the field in search of the ball.
“The preparation throughout the week was good, but the play was even better tonight,” Leone said. “I thought we were playing slowly until tonight. We weren’t moving the ball like we need to move it, and today we really moved the ball.”
The fast-paced and technical style Harvard has developed this season may be due to the Crimson finally finding cohesion in its lineup.
Thanks to Leon’s preseason shuffling, each and every player is familiar with her teammate.
Not only did Leone play all of his players, but he also tested their capabilities by placing them in unfamiliar roles. A defender one game would play offense the next.
After the testing of so many variables, one might suggest that the 17 players who played on Friday were the ones who had found their niche on the field. But Leone warned that the shuffling is not over yet.
“People are always trying to move into that starting lineup or rotation, and there’s a lot of season left,” Leone said. “Things happen, and you should never be that comfortable thinking, ‘That’s it, I’m in.’ But this was a team performance, and I was excited about how we prepared.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two hours of action on Saturday evening, the Ivy League opener between Harvard women’s volleyball (7-4, 0-1 Ivy) and Dartmouth (9-3, 1-0) had yet to be decided. Knotted at two sets apiece, the Crimson carried momentum into the decisive fifth set after winning the fourth game, 25-15.
That momentum dissipated quickly, as Harvard missed two serves within the first five points and had a close call overturned at three-all. Despite falling further behind, the Crimson gave hope to the Malkin Athletic Center crowd as it pulled within one at 10-9. The Big Green’s offensive attack quelled the comeback, as it edged the home team, 15-10, to seal the victory.
“Coming into it, we were super pumped; [it’s the] Ivy League opener,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We matched up really well against Dartmouth, and I think we did well preparing for it.”
Despite the high energy, Harvard needed to call a quick timeout after falling behind, 10-5, in the opening game. Dartmouth extended its lead to 16-8 before the Crimson went on a tear, going on an 11-2 run. Junior Beth Kinsella gave Harvard the 19-18 lead on an emphatic kill assisted by Wu.
Digging in its heels, the visiting team’s defense stopped the barrage. Followed up by a pair of kills from front-line duo Alex Schoenberger and Elisa Scudder, the Big Green went on to win the first game, 25-22.
“Every single point really matters,” Wu said. “Once they got onto our run and got in their groove, we have to find someway to stop them because volleyball is such a game of momentum.”
The Crimson regained its footing in the second set, stringing together three consecutive kills within the first five points, but several Harvard service errors allowed a Dartmouth comeback. Following a 13-13 tie, neither team opened up a lead of more than two points. With a kill from sophomore Teresa Skelly, the Crimson edged out the Big Green, 25-23, knotting the match at one apiece.
The third set proved to be more of the same, with both teams struggling to create a comfortable lead.
Wu and Dartmouth co-captain Amber Bryant battled throughout the match, leading their respective teams in digs. Wu totaled 30 digs compared to Amber’s 26.
“They have a little bit of a new defense system going on, and next time we see them, we just have to run a faster pace,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.
While Harvard opened a lead of 20-15 in the third, the Big Green clawed its way back to sneak out a 26-24 win.
Down by a set, the Crimson had to regroup.
“At that point, you’ve got nothing to lose,” Wu said. “It’s our house, it’s our game. We have to defend our court.”
In the fourth set, Harvard built a lead and ran with it. With the help of its outside hitters, freshman Kristen Casey and junior Taylor Docter, the Crimson opened things up. Following an 8-8 tie, Harvard stormed on a 17-7 run and took the fourth, 25-15.
Casey and Docter were two of three Crimson players who finished the match with double-figure hit counts. Casey led the pack with 17 kills, while Docter and Skelley chipped in 14 kills apiece.
In the fifth and final set, the home team couldn’t carry over its momentum.
“We can’t make any mistakes at all,” Weiss said. “It comes down to a few [points], and they earned theirs. You’ve got to earn them all the time. We’ve had quite a few game fives, and you just can’t hesitate.”
Opening with two service errors in the first five points, Harvard hesitated to finish off Dartmouth. The Big Green led from the start of the tiebreaker, and closed out the match with a 15-10 victory.
“We were just hoping that they would make mistakes and that’s how we would earn our points,” Wu said. “We weren’t going out guns firing, trying to earn our own points. And in the end, that’s what it comes down to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team (5-4, 1-0 Ivy) pummeled New Hampshire (2-7-1, 0-0 America East) in a 4-1 win Sunday afternoon at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
It was a true team effort, with four different players scoring each of the Crimson’s goals.
Harvard freshman Erika Garcia, junior Catherine Coppinger, who is also a Crimson sports editor, sophomore Elizabeth Weisman, and rookie Meg Cascells-Hamby each contributed a goal to light up the scoreboard and bolster the home team to victory.
“One of the things we have been focusing on the whole year is playing as a team,” sophomore midfielder Kristina Garrido said. “I think we really showed that [Sunday]—27 [players]-strong.”
Harvard had clear control in the first half of play, tallying 14 shots while its opponent logged a mere three.
The Crimson passed around the Wildcats with ease to give rise to several chances on goal.
With 8:55 already played, junior midfielder Aisha Price slotted the ball to Garcia who knocked it in from just inside the six-yard box.
New Hampshire tried to counter Harvard’s offensive force, but the Crimson’s defense prematurely shut down all Wildcat attempts in Harvard territory, leaving Crimson goalie Bethany Kanten with an uneventful half.
“That was one of the things we focused on going into the game,” Garrido said. “[Harvard coach Ray Leone] said defense first, and then we can go into the attack.”
And attack the squad did.
After its first goal, the Crimson continued to possess the ball and kept applying the pressure on the visiting team.
Harvard worked the ball up both wings and had several crosses in the 18-yard box.
“We were getting everybody involved in our attack, and that was a good thing,” Leone said. “[It] seemed like a lot of people were touching the ball in every attack.”
New Hampshire’s Megan Ledwith had one good look on goal with 6:15 remaining.
But her attempt from the top of the 18-yard box went wide left, and Harvard quickly resumed its potent offensive attack.
With less than a minute left in the half, the Wildcats fouled junior forward Alexandra Conigliaro just outside the penalty box, and Harvard was awarded a free kick.
Sophomore midfielder Peyton Johnson took the kick for the Crimson. New Hampshire goalie managed to get a hand on the ball, but it bounced to freshman midfielder Mai Le, who connected with Coppinger’s head for a goal with 38 seconds left on the clock.
Coppinger’s header was her first career goal and brought Harvard to a 2-0 lead.
In the second half, the Wildcat squad took to the field with more vigor than it had previously demonstrated, but Harvard quickly put down the visiting team’s newfound energy.
Even with New Hampshire applying more ball pressure, the Crimson saw several chances at the net in the first few minutes of the second half.
Only four minutes into the half, Harvard widened its 2-0 lead. Co-captain Melanie Baskind slotted the ball through to Weisman.
She connected with the back of the net from just outside the six-yard line for her third goal of the season.
Less than three minutes later, Baskind picked up her second assist of the game—sixth of the season—with a pass to Casscells-Hamby, who drove the ball past the goalie for her third goal of the season, earning the home team a 4-0 lead over the Wildcats.
“We are putting it together really well on the offensive end,” Garrido said. “[We’re] really spreading the love … A lot of people were getting different opportunities, and people [were] very unselfish and [made] the right decisions. That’s what you need to do: make the right choice, and I think we are getting that.”
New Hampshire quickly answered the Crimson’s fast-paced play in a rare penetration past Harvard’s back line.
Less than a minute after the Crimson’s fourth goal, Wildcat Alyssa Michael assisted on Ledwith’s goal to bring the deficit to three.
Harvard maintained its 4-1 advantage for the remainder of the half and defeated New Hampshire, improving the Crimson’s record to 5-4.
Leone was extremely pleased with his players’ team unity and performance.
“We showed a lot of team cohesiveness,” praised Leone. “It was just a good connection with everybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being blown out of the water by Iona on Saturday morning, Harvard rallied to put up a fight in a back-and-forth battle against Fordham that afternoon. The Crimson (4-7, 0-2 CWPA) still left the weekend winless and 0-2 in its first games of Collegiate Water Polo Association conference play.
The Gaels (5-7, 1-1) overwhelmed Harvard in a crushing 13-4 blow to start the weekend. While the Crimson found a much more even match in the Rams (5-9, 2-0) that afternoon, it was Fordham that pulled ahead, scoring a late goal to narrowly defeat Harvard, 10-9.
The Crimson welcomed co-captain Luka Babic back to the pool after he sustained an injury to his eye in a double overtime victory against George Washington on Sept. 10 that left him with 15 stitches.
“It was great to have [Luka] back,” senior goalie Alex Popp said. “He is a leader on and off the court.”
But even with the return of the powerhouse attacker, Harvard was unable to seal the deal in this season’s first conference outings.
FORDHAM 10, HARVARD 9
Coming off a blowout earlier that morning, the Crimson turned things around in its second match of the day.
“We rebounded well from Iona … We really regrouped,” Popp said.
Harvard and Fordham exchanged goals throughout the game, and at the half, the Crimson narrowly trailed the Rams, 7-6.
Harvard entered the fourth period again trailing by one point, 8-7, but only seconds into the quarter, the score was knotted at eight goals apiece.
Each team scored again to bring the score to an even nine goals with four minutes left in the half.
With 44 seconds remaining, the Rams seized an opportunity to put one away on a Harvard penalty and snuck ahead of the Crimson, 10-9.
Harvard would go on to have a single opportunity to answer and compel Fordham into overtime. But sophomore utility Will Roller’s shot—taken with 11 seconds remaining on the clock—skipped over the cage and the Rams claimed victory.
Although the visitors did not come out on top, Harvard coach Ted Minnis praised his team’s effort in the close match.
“It would have been easy to just give up after the previous game [against Iona] … but I was proud how our boys battled out there [against Fordham] and stayed in it until the very end,” Minnis said.
Despite the unfavorable result, Popp also found the silver lining in his team’s resilience.
“It was a loss, but [it was] a moral victory.”
IONA 13, HARVARD 4
While Harvard struggled to adjust to the non-regulation size pool, the Gaels found themselves at home, mercilessly putting away goal after unanswered goal.
“[Iona] has a different set-up,” Roller said. “We weren’t able to adapt.”
But Minnis found the pool to be no excuse for Harvard’s less-than-stellar performance.
“There were few things we did well [against Iona] to be honest,” said Minnis. “Their offense didn’t do anything surprising … We just didn’t get it together out there.”
Whatever the issue was, Iona outworked the Crimson on both sides of the pool.
Despite five saves from Popp and another nine from sophomore goalie Jimmy Field, the Crimson was unable to avert the potent Gael offense and was outscored by nine points.
With two weeks before its home opener against MIT, Harvard has an opportunity to return to the drawing board.
This weekend’s pair of losses highlighted that there will not be a shortage of things to work on in the practices leading up to its five-game stretch of home games.
“We are going to go back into preseason mode,” Minnis said. “We are going to rework every component of the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the season doesn’t get under way for nearly two months, this weekend had important implications for the future of Harvard men’s basketball.
For the fifth straight year, head coach Tommy Amaker hosted a slew of high school basketball prospects on campus for the football team’s home opener. The campus visits—official for the high school class of 2012 and unofficial for the class of 2013—are an important part of the decision-making process for all prospective athletes.
Some of the blue-chip recruits listed Harvard as one of their top choices, up there with the likes of basketball powerhouses as Kansas and UConn. To gauge their interest in Harvard, we’ll refer to the most authoritative source of news we know: the players’ Twitter accounts.
Seven of the eight prospects Amaker hosted (and we stalked) have Twitters, and regular tweets throughout the weekend indicate that the basketball program kept the recruits entertained.
“Hands down that was the best weekend of my life,” tweeted Davon Reed, a junior at Princeton Day School (N.J.).
Tweets from another junior, Alex Foster, who is ranked No. 82 in his class by MaxPreps.com, are also reflected that the recruits enjoyed their time on campus.
“Looks like I know where I’m going for college,” he tweeted at approximately 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, a wee-hours-of-the-morning post that appears to bode well for the program.
Other than watching Crimson football defeat Brown, 24-7, in its first home game of the season, the recruits got taste of Harvard life by, among other things, working out, having dinner at Legal Seafoods (we’ll let them believe that’s authentic), and, of course, partying.
“One of those nights where u can’t tell Ur parents about! Haha,” tweeted Foster of his Saturday-night escapades.
Although the other prospects aren’t as active with their Twitter feeds as Foster and Reed, the rest of the players seemed to have a good time as well. “lol, a weekend I will never forget,” tweeted current Harvard junior Brandyn Curry. Tagged in the tweet were recruits Stephen Domingo, Siyani Chambers, and Brannen Greene.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the ball nearly out of bounds on the right side of the field, Crimson field hockey co-captain Carly Dickson took control and hit a centering pass to teammate junior Katelin Wahl. Wahl took a shot, scoring the tying goal for Harvard.
This proved to be the turning point early in the second period, as the Crimson (4-3, 1-1 Ivy) went on to defeat the Bryant Bulldogs (4-5, 0-0 NEC), 2-1, at Jordan Field on Sunday afternoon.
The first half of the game was an even, scoreless matchup. Strong defense from both teams kept the score at 0-0. With a little over five minutes remaining in the first half, junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos made a diving save to prevent a Bryant goal, one of five that day. Tassopoulos currently has a .784 save percentage.
“We try to make sure that our defense from the forward to the mids to the backs is a priority for every game, and I think today it really showed,” Tassopoulos said. “Our defense was very composed and [it] let us field the ball out of the back.”
Two minutes later, Bulldogs sophomore MaKayla Hancock also made a key defensive save to hold off the Crimson.
Coming out of the first period, both teams were ready to try to put some points on the board.
Bryant capitalized on a short corner opportunity seven minutes into the second half with a goal by Bulldogs senior Courtney Landi.
Harvard responded quickly.
“Right after [Bryant] scored, we knew we had to get back in fast, so I was trying to get that attack,” Dickson said of her game-tying assist. “Kate did a great job of shooting in the goal.”
The Crimson closed off the win with a goal by freshman Paige Haley. It was the team’s second win of the weekend home stand, defeating Penn 4-1 on Saturday.
“Yesterday was one of our best games of the season against Penn,” Haley said. “We really passed strong and had great pass combinations. Today was a more simple and more scrappy game. I thought we did well, but there are things to improve on. We are definitely glad to be back on our winning streak.”
Both Harvard’s players and Crimson coach Sue Caples emphasized the need for consistent improvement regardless of the positive results.
“Bryant played a really strong game and battled tough; they definitely outplayed us in some areas,” Caples said. “We got the results, but how we get the results is important to us. The last couple of games, we gave up too many shots. We did not give up too many goals, but we gave up too many quality opportunities [for the other team to score].”
The home team was also presented with the challenge of playing two back-to-back games in one weekend, taking a physical toll on the team.
“Last weekend, we had one really good game and one not so good game,” Tassopoulos said. “We wanted to really string two games together this weekend, and I think that’s what we did.”
While physically difficult, the two-game weekend proved beneficial for the players’ mental focus.
“We just picked up where we left off yesterday [against Penn],” Haley said. “It is a field hockey weekend, so your thoughts are really there.”
With a winning record, Harvard is looking forward to a strong rest of the season.
“We are really excited about Ivy League play,” Tassopoulos said. “It is going to be a lot of fun because all of the teams are pretty even this year, so it is very open. It is exciting to see the new player combinations we have on the field with all of our freshmen.”
Bryant has two more games before its first conference matchup on Oct. 7 against Monmouth. The Crimson will be taking on Brown and Vermont next weekend at home.
“Our goal is to get one percent better every day,” Caples said. “If we do that, we’ll be in a good position next Saturday against Brown.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first Ivy home game at Jordan Field on Saturday, Harvard (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) got off to a hot start in the second half to bury Penn (1-6, 1-1), 4-1, and pick up its first league win of the season.
“It was a great team effort,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “People were able to contribute in a lot of ways, which is really very exciting. We have a lot of depth, and we were able to use that.  We are six games in now, and we are starting to really gel with each other.”
The Crimson dominated time of possession from the start en route to numerous scoring opportunities, including a backhanded shot from co-captain Carly Dickson that the Quakers’ senior goalie Kieran Sweeney had to stop with a jumping save.
The home team finally scored when freshman Caitlin Rea faked out her defenders before finding freshman Noel Painter, who deflected the ball into the goal to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead 14 minutes into the game.
But Harvard was unable to stretch the lead despite a 12-3 shot advantage in the half.
Caples admitted that being up by just one goal in a game like this can put you on edge.
“It’s a funny game,” Caples said.  “You can dominate, dominate, and it takes one to go down [when you have a one-goal lead]. We had a lot of opportunities in the first half, we would have liked to have had more to show for it.”
In order to better take advantage of its scoring opportunities, the Crimson had to make some adjustments at halftime.
“Sometimes we were just a little too stationary in the [defense],” sophomore Bridget McGillivray said. “We needed to manipulate the defenders more, move them around, and throw them off.”
Harvard obtained much more to show for its effort very early in the second half.
Just 1:14 into the second period, Dickson scored off a penalty stroke, placing the ball perfectly in the top left corner of the goal.
A little over a minute later, the Crimson added to its 2-0 lead when sophomore Mariah Pewarski scored off an assist from Dickson.
It did not take long for Harvard to strike again.
About two and a half minutes later, Bridget McGillivray redirected a pass from her sister, co-captain Georgia McGillivray, after a corner.
“It was from my sister again,” the sophomore said. “She swept it in far post, and I was just there waiting for it.”
The Crimson was clearly pleased with its effort to begin the second half.
“Our start of the second half was excellent,” Dickson said. “It was the best start of any half we’ve had so far.”
“We were just stringing together all of our passing sequences and moving up the field quickly,” Bridget McGillivray said.
Penn did show signs of life in the second half after the fury of goals, but Harvard kept the Quakers off the board until Penn sophomore Julie Tahan scored off a penalty stroke with 16:41 left in the game.
“I think we had a lull after our goals,” Dickson said. “I think we’re young, and we need to learn how to maintain that energy when we’re up that much.”
Caples, who was shocked that the Quakers ended up with more shots in the second half than the Crimson, echoed the co-captain’s feelings.
“We got a little careless defensively that gave them some opportunities,” Caples said. “We have to learn how to keep attacking and playing our game.”
Though the Quakers outshot Harvard in the second half, the Crimson still won the overall count. Harvard ended up with 23 shots for the game compared to Penn’s 15.
Junior Cynthia Tassopoulos had six saves for the Crimson.
Despite the 4-1 victory on Saturday, Caples still sees areas in which Harvard can improve.
“We definitely need to give up less on the defensive side,” Caples said. “We gave up at least two corners for being within five yards, which is careless.”
Despite the defensive lapses, there seems to be optimism coming from the Crimson side.
“I think everyone had a lot of energy going in,” Dickson said. “It’s always different to play an Ivy game, especially on your home turf, so everyone was pretty excited. I think we had a strong overall [performance].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After never winning a tournament last year, the Harvard women’s golf team notched its second first-place finish just two tournaments into the 2011 season.
One week after claiming first at the Yale Invitational, the Crimson has again come out on top in this past weekend’s Princeton Invitational.
With a team three-round score of 906, 42 above par (302-301-303), Harvard held on four strokes ahead of Brown and nine ahead of Columbia in the 12-team tournament.
This was the lowest the Crimson had ever scored at Princeton’s Springdale Golf Club.
“I’m proud of the girls for getting the job done,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said.
Once again, highly-touted freshman Tiffany Lim led the Crimson to victory, finishing first in the tournament at three under par and holding the tournament’s lowest single-round score of 70 in the second round.
Sophomore Bonnie Hu, who is also a member of the Crimson business board, freshman Brenna Nelson, captain Christine Cho, and sophomore Julie MacDonnell tied for eighth, 13th, 40th, and 48th, respectively.
Rainy conditions throughout the weekend plagued the course, making it very difficult for all 12 teams. But the weather may have proved advantageous for the Crimson, which started four California natives who, according to Lim, are more accustomed to rainy conditions.
“We were prepared for [the rain], and we knew what to do when we encountered it,” said Lim, who posted a three-round total of 213.  “When it does rain [in California], we are still out there practicing, whereas on the East Coast, when there is bad weather, people aren’t outside practicing. We are out there 365 days a year, so we’re used to playing in worse weather.”
Just because the Crimson might have been more accustomed to the rain didn’t mean it was a walk in the park, as wet conditions make putts harder to finish.
“It was difficult to make a lot of putts,” Rhoads said. “Within our team or any of the other teams, I saw very few putts made outside of three feet.”
Harvard jumped out to an early lead, posting a first-round score of 302—one stroke ahead of Brown and Rollins College.
But the squad separated itself from the pack in the second round, shooting a 301—its best score of the tournament—to pull ahead by five strokes.
Entering the final round yesterday, Lim felt the Crimson’s lead was far from secure.
“[Five strokes] is essentially nothing—anything can happen,” Lim said. “So we just tried to ignore our placement, ignore the scores, and play our own game.”
Hu and Nelson stepped up in the final round, posting their best scores of the tournament.
Hu notched 74 strokes with Nelson one behind at 75. Lim had another standout round with a score of 71, the lowest among the field.
“We struggled a little [yesterday], but we still managed to pull through, and I think that was a great thing,” said Hu, who finished with a three-round score of 224, eight above par.
“It was a busy week for us,” Rhoads said. “We had recruits in town, and school was starting to get very tough, and we had to leave super early Friday morning, and also the tough weather. Given the circumstances, I am very proud of them, and it’s definitely a good way to start the season.”
Harvard heads to a tournament at Penn State this upcoming weekend hopeful to continue its winning streak.
“[We will] try to bring the best game that we can to Penn State because we’d certainly like to continue the trend of how we started the season,” Rhoads said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy weekend for the Harvard men’s soccer team as a pair of teams in California gave the Crimson a whole lot of trouble. Harvard (2-4-1) fell to Stanford Friday night, 1-0, before escaping Santa Clara Sunday with a scoreless draw, despite being outshot by a three-to-one margin by the No. 25 Broncos. The team was unable to be reached for comment after Sunday’s draw.
HARVARD 0, SANTA CLARA 0
Looking to shake off Friday’s loss to Stanford, Harvard came into its Sunday evening game against Santa Clara (4-1-3) hoping to end its trip to California on a high note and finally put to bed its issues on the offensive side of the pitch. But when the dust settled in Buck Shaw Stadium, the Crimson came away flat and with more questions heading into Ivy League play next week.
Despite being outshot by the Broncos, 18-6, and giving up 13 corner kicks, the game went scoreless even after two overtime periods.
Throughout regulation play, Santa Clara dictated the pace of the game by dominating ball possession and keeping the Crimson firmly in its defensive end of the pitch. Despite the Broncos control of the game, junior Crimson goalkeeper Brett Conrad was hard to beat.
Though Santa Clara fired 15 shots— compared to the Crimson’s one—in regulation time and also managed to put several quality shots on goal, Conrad was there every time to reject them.
Conrad’s highlight-reel moments at net came in the 32nd minute, when he first denied Broncos midfielder Harrison Hanley at point-blank range. Seconds later, the junior made an incredible diving stab to rob defender Welsey Culver of another great goal-scoring chance.
Conrad’s most important save of the game came late in the second half with less than three minutes to play, when a free kick by Broncos Brandon Zimmerman flew towards the net. Conrad made the save to preserve the draw and send the match into overtime.
In regulation play, the story was all about Conrad. In overtime, the storyline changed and it was all about missed opportunities for the Crimson.
During both overtime sessions, Harvard finally came to life offensively and threatened to steal the game away from the Broncos. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the reoccuring trend of being unable to finish reared its ugly head once again and prevented Harvard from capturing what would have been a storybook finish against a dominant Santa Clara side.
In the 99th minute, co-captain Scott Prozeller had the first of many great scoring chances for Harvard. The forward found some open space in front of net and took a well placed shot at net, but Santa Clara goalkeeper Kevin Klasila snatched the ball from the air as time expired in the first overtime, leaving Prozeller with a look of frustration on his face.
In the second overtime, the Crimson once again seemed destined to score with each of its offensive chances, but the visiting team was unable to capitalize on its opportunities.
In the 103rd minute, junior forward Zack Wolfenzon had a chance for a game-winning goal, when a cross found the forward only a few yards from goal. Wolfenzon made contact with his head, but the header shot went directly into the waiting hands of the Broncos goalkeeper.
Wolfenzon nearly redeemed himself two minutes later when he fired a shot on target, but Klasila made the save to end the match as a draw.
STANFORD 1, HARVARD 0
Traveling out to Palo Alto, Calif., the Harvard men’s soccer team hoped to earn the same positive results as in last year’s stunning season-opener against then No. 13 Stanford. But the Crimson could not come away with the victory on the Cardinal’s home turf, falling by a one-goal margin to Stanford Friday night in front of nearly 1,800 fans at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
The match was largely a defensive struggle until the 42nd minute, when Cardinal junior midfielder Eric Anderson sent a long cross deep into the Harvard penalty box off a free kick. The ball found Stanford junior forward Adam Jahn, who headed the ball past senior keeper Austin Harms for the score.
The Cardinal doubled the Crimson’s shots for the half, 10-5, but the Harvard offense tested Stanford sophomore keeper Jason Dodson, who made three saves throughout the period to maintain his squad’s lead. Harms’ effort kept the Crimson within one, tipping another threatening 30-yard free kick by Anderson over the bar.
In the second half, Harvard picked up the intensity, sending more players forward to look for the equalizer, but the Crimson offense could not penetrate the Cardinal defense.  With less than three minutes remaining, Harvard hoped to tie up the game off a corner, but the Stanford back line cleared the service to maintain the win and its first shut-out of the season.
The Cardinal led the Crimson in shots, 14-9, and in corners, 5-3, for the match, with Harms recording four saves.
Harvard will now shift focus to Wednesday’s matchup against local rivals Boston University, in hopes of avenging its 2-1 loss to the Terriers last season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To kick off the 2011-2012 season, the Crimson men’s tennis team hosted some of the nation’s best collegiate tennis programs this weekend at the annual Harvard Chowder Fest tournament held at Beren Tennis Center.
Ranked 73rd in the nation, the hosts went up against Michigan Wolverines, 10th-ranked Texas A&M Aggies, and three-time defending NCAA national champion USC Trojans.
The start of the action on Friday proved to be tough for Harvard as Texas A&M swept its top five doubles team. The Crimson demonstrated its resilience in the afternoon session, crushing the Trojans’ top four doubles teams in decisive fashion.
The doubles team of co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster, playing in the No. 1 position, shut down Daniel Nguyen and Ray Sarmiento of USC, 9-7, to get their teammates going in the right direction against the nation’s top team.
“Casey and I just came out with lots of energy and played really aggressive doubles,” Felton said after the victory on Friday. “In all of the matches, we were going toe-to-toe with [USC], which was a really encouraging sign.”
In singles competition on Friday, USC took seven out of eight matches in the evening session.
The only Harvard player to record a victory was junior Andy Nguyen, who defeated USC’s Corey Smith, 6-3, 7-5, at the No. 8 position.
Saturday mirrored much of Friday for the Crimson, who dropped nine out of 10 singles matches to the Aggies in the morning session.
Denis Nguyen, younger brother of the lone winner on the first day of action, recorded the only singles victory of the day, beating the Aggies’ Colin Hoover in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, at the No. 3 position.
Coming off an impressive victory over USC’s top doubles duo, the pair of Felton and MacMaster fell to Texas A&M’s Junior Ore and Alexis Klegou, 8-3. But once again, Harvard’s doubles rebounded, securing two victories in the afternoon session. Sophomore John Thornton and junior Joshua Tchan bested the Aggies’ Jeremy Efferding and Beau Blackshear, 8-2. To cap off the second day of play, the lethal combination of the Nguyen brothers defeated Michigan’s Alex Buzzi and Barret Franks in a 9-8 nail-biter.
Sunday featured the final singles flight of the tournament between Harvard and Michigan. The Crimson edged out the victory in the series, taking six out of the eight matches.
The strong performance of all the Harvard singles players conveyed the squad’s resilience once again, as they had lost all but two singles matches over the first two days.
Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72, entering his 35th season at the helm of the tennis program, viewed the tournament this weekend as a learning experience.
“We had not had any competitions leading up to this one,” said Fish, the coach with the most wins in Harvard men’s tennis history. “We decided to let the freshmen get their sea legs and the team really trained. We’re getting as much done in these first three weeks as we can.”
Indeed, Harvard has been hard at work in the first few weeks of the season, but the passion that the team has shown this weekend says something about where the team is headed.
“We have five freshmen coming in and each one of them is bringing a lot to the team,” Felton said. “I think the attitudes on this team mean that we’re going to have a good year.”
This past spring, the Crimson fell short of an Ivy League title for the third year in a row. Fish knows that a conference title is always on the minds of his players, but he asserts that it is not their only goal.
“Clearly that will be one of our background goals, but like anything else we will have process goals,” Fish said. “If we get better at a task each day and do the best we can, then we will be fine.”

Don't  expect Republican presidential candidate W. Mitt Romney to be dropping  the H-bomb anytime soon. Out on the campaign trail, the Harvard Business  School and Harvard Law School alum has been careful not to flaunt his  association with the University and has instead taken to bashing fair  Harvard.
 
In  speeches across the country, Romney has repeated a line that uses  President Barack Obama's Harvard Law School degree to take aim at the  president's foreign policy record. "That may be what they think in that  Harvard faculty lounge," Romney has said, "but it's not what they know  on the battlefield!" Romney has failed to mention that he himself graduated from Harvard with a dual degree in business and law. 
 
Romney's derisive comments toward Harvard are nothing new. As governor of Massachusetts in 2005, he spoke out against plans to conduct embryonic stem cell research in some of Harvard’s laboratories. The next year, he opposed former Iranian president Mohammed Khatami's visit to the Institute of  Politics, even refusing to provide police protection for the event and  boasting about that decision in a later campaign ad.
 
Nevertheless, Romney has reportedly enlisted Harvard professors N. Gregory Mankiw and Meghan L. O'Sullivan as  advisers for his 2012 campaign. Perhaps he's been spending some time in  that faculty lounge himself.
