After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated 2:43 p.m., Jan. 13.
Two former mayors and a previous prime minister of Haiti are among those selected to serve as spring semester fellows at the Institute of Politics, the IOP announced yesterday.
The six fellows, whose diverse backgrounds represent the many levels of public service that exist in today’s world, were chosen by a student advisory committee and IOP staff.
“We think—as did the founders of the Institute, as did President Kennedy and his family—that the critical part is the opportunity to meet with and learn from and follow those people who have themselves devoted their life to public service,” IOP Director Bill P. Purcell said.
The fellows will spend the semester in Cambridge and lead weekly study groups with students.
The group includes two mayors: Manny A. Diaz, the mayor of Miami from 2001-2009 and former president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and Greg J. Nickels, who helped lead the coalition of mayors fighting for climate protection during his two terms as the mayor of Seattle.
“[Diaz and Nickels] both know a lot about American cities,” Purcell said, “but each has also been involved with and has been very thoughtful about broader international issues, from the environment to immigration.”
People with ties to Washington will also join the IOP this spring, including Ernest J. Istook, a former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma and a current distinguished fellow at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, and Mary Catherine "M.C" Andrews, former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush and director of the White House Office of Global Communications.
Andrews, who holds a Masters in Public Administration from the Kennedy School, expressed her excitement at returning to Cambridge this spring to lead a study group about the role of communication in international diplomacy.
“My time at the Kennedy School was absolutely pivotal about my thinking about public policy,” Andrews said. “I’m really excited to try to inspire some of the students I’ll have the chance to work with to get to know and to love the issue and to realize that it’s important.”
The other fellows will be Michèle Pierre-Louis, the former Prime Minister of Haiti, and John J. Sweeney, the President Emeritus of the AFL-CIO.
In contrast with the other fellows, Sweeney has spent his career working outside of the government, and he said that he looks forward to engaging in dialogue with the other fellows.
The topics and syllabi of the study groups, including information on guest speakers, will be available in the first weeks of the spring term, Purcell said. Students will also have the opportunity to meet all of the fellows at an open house on February 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge will be without a mayor for at least two more weeks, as the new City Council members, despite narrowing down the number of candidates, have yet to elect a leader for the 2010-2012 term.
The mayor—who also serves on the Cambridge School Committee—is chosen from within by the Council. A councillor must receive five or more votes in order to be elected mayor. At last week's meeting, five candidates received at least one vote.
“It’s a cumbersome process,” said Councillor Henrietta Davis, who placed third in today's vote. “We’re working at it even though it’s a potentially contentious issue.”
Councillor David P. Maher had the highest number of votes for the second consecutive week, with four votes from Leland Cheung, Sam Seidel, Timothy J. Toomey and himself. Cheung switched his vote from Marjorie C. Decker—who withdrew from the race—to Maher this week.
“I have been a steady leader,” Maher said in an interview. He added that he believes the mayor is responsible for leading the Council to agreement, and that he has “a reputation as a consensus builder.”
Meanwhile, Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves '72, who served as mayor from 2005-2007 and 1992-1995, got the additional support of Decker, who had previously voted for herself.
Current frontrunner Maher said that he hopes the Council elects a mayor soon, since committees cannot be formed until a mayor is selected.
Robert Winters, who teaches at the Harvard Extension School and writes a blog about Cambridge politics, disagreed with Maher’s reasoning.
“The only important committees are the ordinance and the finance committees, both of which are committees of the whole,” he said, meaning all councillors serve on these committees. In Winters’s opinion, “the people make a little too much out of the election.”
With the new mayor still undecided, some Cambridge residents and Cambridge School Committee members have expressed concerns about the election process.
“I wish all six of us school committee members could vote because it affects us,” said Patricia M. Nolan ’80.
“There should be a way to get the citizens involved,” said former Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons, adding that one way to do so would be changing the City's charter, which determines the distribution of governing power among the Council and the City Manager.
Cambridge resident Red T. Mitchel recommended that citizens select four mayoral nominees from the nine City Council members then have the Council choose the mayor from amongst the nominees.
“The councillors should still get a chance to vote for their chair, because the mayor is essentially the chair of the city council,” Mitchel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adams House Master and Harvard Medical School professor Judith S. Palfrey '67 will leave her historic Cambridge abode to carry the 2010 Olympic Flame Tuesday, Jan. 19 across a 300-yard stretch in Calgary, Canada.
Palfrey will join a group of 20 torchbearers selected by the Coca-Cola Company—including Olympic gold medallists Shawn Johnson and Steven Lopez—to run a two-day leg of the Olympic Torch Relay. The relay will last for 106 days as the Olympic Flame makes its way across Canada to Vancouver for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in February.
Palfrey, who is president of the American  Academy of Pediatrics, was notified before Christmas of her selection in recognition of her efforts to improve the quality of healthcare for children.
"It's exciting to be a part of the history of the Olympics and to be tied into all the people that have been involved," Palfrey said Monday in a phone interview. "It's one of those things that you never think you're going to do."
According to Coca-Cola spokesperson Helen E. Tarleton, the selection committee was also impressed with Palfrey's commitment to promoting the health and wellness of children as AAP president.
Palfrey is also the principal investigator of Opening Doors, a project directed at improving access to services for children with special health care needs in under-served and low-income communities.
The project, funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, focuses on delivering routine care to children from traditionally under-served communities by using improved developmental screening tools and helps disabled youth participate in sports programs at local YMCAs and high schools.
"We all joked that not many research projects will ever be able to report that one of their principal investigators is representing their cause as an Olympic Torchbearer," said Noelle L. Huntington, who is the research director of Opening Doors as well as a pediatrics instructor at the Medical School. "She is running for children's health and particularly for the health of children who must overcome so many other barriers."
Palfrey's colleagues praised her longstanding passion for helping children with disabilities, and Susan M. Foley, co-principal investigator of Opening Doors affiliated with UMass-Boston, commented that the "symbolism of her carrying the torch is potent."
According to Adams House residents, Palfrey's enthusiasm does not stop at her research, as she and her husband, John G. “Sean” Palfrey '67, are often seen participating in House activities, such as the annual Drag Night.
"Adams House has a very lively and creative spirit that doesn't come from the past, but from the attitude that Sean and Judy Palfrey instill today," said Matthew J. Corriel '05, an Adams House resident tutor.
"It's remarkable how she seems to live three lives and always has the time to be genuinely committed to all of the House members," Corriel said.
CEO of Thailand's Kasikornbank Banthoon Lamsam, who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1977, ran the eighth section of the 2008 Olympic Summer Games torch relay in Bangkok.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s diving team traveled to Princeton this past weekend to faceoff against some of the top competition in the Ivy League at the annual Princeton Diving Invitational.
On the men’s side, Harvard divers were paired against divers from the University of Pennsylvania. The two schools’ swimming teams met in a dual meet this past weekend in Philadelphia.
Over two days of diving, the Crimson contingent of freshman Michael Stanton, sophomore Taylor Nickel, and juniors Zach Ranta and Henry Winslow put up formidable scores against a competitive field of Quaker opponents. The divers’ results contributed to an overall Harvard victory, outscoring Penn, 183-117.
Stanton had strong performances in both events, finishing first in the three-meter dive with a score of 319.73 and third in the one-meter event scoring 280.28. Ranta performed equally strong taking second in the one-meter event with 291.30 points, just four points behind the Quaker winner, Jeff Cragg. Ranta also took third place in the three-meter event.
“I thought we had some really good finishes towards the top end,” said Nickel. “We were looking really strong especially after winter break and only a couple weeks of training.”
The Harvard women also had strong finishes, particularly in the platform diving competition where freshmen Teagan Lehrmann and Brittany Powell took third with 238.05 points and fourth with 231.40 points, respectively. The pair of rookies qualified for the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships with the performances.
Junior Jenny Reese led the way for the Crimson in Saturday’s springboard events. Reese finished runner-up in the one-meter with 262.20 points, only seven points behind the winner, Princeton’s Carolyn Littlefield. Sophomore Leslie Rea barely missed a second-place finish in the three-meter event by a mere 1.12 points. Reese followed Rea in fourth with 244.88 points.
“With the solid performances this past weekend and some good training ahead of us, we should be pretty strong going into HYP and eventually Ivies,” said Nickel of both diving teams.
The two-day competition came during the long winter break and after the teams had had only some limited training together. The Harvard swimming and diving teams leave this week for a training trip in Hawaii and a chance to improve on the dives that have already helped bring victory.
“We are looking forward to just having some more time in the water,” said Nickel. “Getting hours in the water, training, doing dives, and just being away from the stress of school for a change are going to be great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the conference opener against defending Ivy League champion Dartmouth looming, the Harvard women’s basketball team isn’t losing focus.
The Crimson (9-4) squared off with the New Jersey Institute of Technology (5-10) for the first time ever and held off the Highlanders to win its second-consecutive road game, 69-53.
Sophomore Brogan Berry led three Harvard players in double figures with 15 points along with a team-high eight assists. Junior Emma Markley and freshman Victoria Lippert each added 13 points.
Playing in front of a loud crowd of 1,125 to celebrate NJIT’s Education Day, the Crimson dimmed the opposition right from the tip-off with a 7-0 run to open the contest. The Highlanders were able to close the gap to 11-7, but Harvard used a soul-crushing 17-0 run to bring its lead to 28-7.
NJIT was able to gain a little momentum heading into halftime, outscoring the Crimson, 10-4, to bring the score to 32-17. The 17 points were the fewest Harvard has allowed in a half this season.
“Overall, I’m very, very impressed with our team’s effort this afternoon,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It was an unusual game because of the Education Day and the noon tip-off, but it was a great atmosphere, and I’m proud of the way we started strong.”
The second half was much more competitive, as the Highlanders hit 46% of their shots from the field and also connected on six of seven from three-point range. But Harvard was able to keep pace and shot 59% from the field in the second half en route to the 69-53 final score.
“I think overall we did a pretty god job and played solid defense,” co-captain Claire Wheeler said. They shot too many threes against us, especially in the second half. [NJIT’s Jessica Gerald] had six threes against us, and we definitely need to do a better job of adjusting defensively to who has the hot hand. We’re definitely not going to get away with that against Dartmouth.”
The Crimson entered the game best in the Ivy League in overall scoring, but it certainly had its best defensive effort of the season against the Highlanders. NJIT’s 53 points was the lowest total allowed all season, and Harvard held the Highlanders to 36% from the field overall and added nine blocked shots along with eight steals.
The Crimson was led on the glass by Markley and freshman Miriam Rutzen, who each pulled down six boards to help Harvard hold a 35-27 rebounding advantage.
“We definitely did a nice job stopping them, and we have been working toward [playing better defense],” Delaney-Smith said. “The single area I wish we would’ve done better in was containing their top scorer, who had 20 points.”
After beginning the season with a 0-4 record on the road, Harvard won its second-consecutive game away from home to open its four-game road trip with a 2-0 start.
“I think this is just a case of a young team gaining experience,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was never, ‘You guys played great at home, you’re not playing well on the road.’ There were a lot of other factors that contributed to that, and I think some of those are starting to come together.”
The Crimson will open Ivy League play Saturday at Dartmouth before rounding out its road trip the following Thursday at No. 16 Florida State.
“We definitely have a healthy rivalry with Dartmouth,” Wheeler said. “We actually went as a team to see them play Boston College last week, and I think that between our veterans who remember last year’s game and our freshmen, we’ll come out flying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior goalie Christina Kessler of the Harvard women’s hockey team took another tour on the international circuit last week, backstopping the Canadian U-22 squad to a gold medal at the MLP Cup in Ravensburg, Germany.
Kessler blanked Switzerland in a 9-0 win in the gold-medal game—the netminder’s fourth shutout with the U-22 team, tying a Canadian record.
The senior was the winner in net in both Canada’s 4-1 preliminary win over Switzerland and a 4-3 overtime nailbiter against Sweden—the defending MLP champions—in the semifinals.
It was the third international appearance for the goaltender, who was part of Canada’s silver-medal squad at the MLP Cup last year and also played in a 2008 series against the American U-22 team.
Though Kessler’s trip overseas yielded a great deal of success, her Crimson teammates stumbled in her absence. Harvard tied Princeton, 3-3, on Friday before losing to Quinnipiac, 1-0, on Saturday despite holding a 22-shot advantage in the contest.
Rookie Laura Bellamy got her first two starts in net for the Crimson, recording a combined 21 saves over the weekend.
Harvard slipped to No. 6 in the national polls this morning, but the team has a chance to rebound against Cornell, which slipped out of the rankings today for the first time since early November, at home on Friday.
