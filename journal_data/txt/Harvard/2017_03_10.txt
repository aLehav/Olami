After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barring, of course, a tumultuous surprise ending with a Best Picture mix-up, the annual highlight of Hollywood’s year played out with its usual champagne-infused, designer-label glitz. On Sunday night, the 89th Academy Awards celebrated the film industry’s best and brightest. And also “Suicide Squad.”
The night kicked off with a win for Mahershala Ali, who took home Best Supporting Actor for his performance in “Moonlight,” becoming the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar. Ali’s early victory foreshadowed success, not only for “Moonlight,” but also for diversity and solidarity against discrimination.
In fact, the Oscars, along with the other prizes this awards season, became an intersection between politics and arts. In the midst of a divisive, contentious political climate, political acceptance speeches are now par for the course. These days, accepting an award without asserting at least a vague political declaration seems oblivious, or at worst, willfully ignorant.
In their acceptance speech for Best Adapted Screenplay, “Moonlight” writers Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney advocated for “all those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender-conforming [people] who don't see themselves.” When “The Salesman” won Best Foreign Language Film, Iranian astronaut Anousheh Ansari read a boycott statement from director Asghar Farhadi, in protest of Trump’s anti-Muslim immigration policy. And Cheryl Boone, President of the Academy, delivered a statement championing the inclusion of diverse art, saying, “Tonight is proof that art has no borders, art has no single language, and art does not belong to a single faith.”
It was a welcome departure from last year’s #OscarsSoWhite, but it would be inaccurate to credit Sunday night’s Oscars with entirely subverting the privilege that governs the film industry. The nominations for Best Director overlooked female filmmakers entirely, for one. Another disappointing moment occurred when Brie Larson, who won last year’s Best Leading Actress for her role as a sexual assault survivor in “Room,” presented the Oscar for Best Leading Actor to Casey Affleck, who faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment. Larson, a sexual assault advocate, was put in a similar position only weeks ago at the Golden Globes, where she presented Affleck with another one of cinema’s highest honors.
Both times, Larson opened the envelope, then proceeded to hand Affleck his statuette, stone-faced. When Affleck cited his competitor, Denzel Washington, as inspiration, Washington looked similarly unimpressed.
Though host Jimmy Kimmel took several superficial jabs at Donald Trump, including several snarky tweets at the President, he bolstered the President’s exclusionary rhetoric through a handful of insensitive and poorly-received jokes. In one segment, Kimmel brought in a bus full of T-shirt clad, selfie-stick-equipped tourists (of questionable authenticity) under the pretense of bringing them to an Oscars exhibit.
One Asian tourist couple, recently married, shook Meryl Streep’s hand.
Kimmel thrust the mic to the woman. “What’s your name?”
“Yulree,” she answered, and with the practiced air of someone who explains the pronunciation of her name on a regular basis, added, “It rhymes with ‘jewelry.’”
“Well, I know it rhymes with jewelry,” Kimmel said, “Wow, that’s some name.”
Kimmel made a face, then turned to her husband. “Oh. And what’s your name?”
“Patrick,” he said.
“Patrick,” Kimmel repeated. “See, that’s a name!”
We get it, Jimmy: their names are not like yours. In the midst of a celebration of artistic diversity, during an already self-indulgent segment, a white man pointed out the “otherness” of foreign names.
Clearly, the Oscars, and the industry as a whole, still have a ways to go before they can be fairly considered diverse, let alone equal or inclusive. Art may lack borders, but the way we celebrate it suggests that some barriers to entry will take years to dismantle.
Until then: “Patrick” might be a real name by Kimmel’s standards—but that night, one statuette was engraved with “Mahershala.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just as rock and roll would be lackluster without the topless teens at music festivals, “Trainspotting” owes its charm largely to the cult surrounding it. For the believers, the film is some sort of 90s proletarian manifesto thrown into the face of a stupid century: Either you dig it and dance along to “Lust for Life,” or you are spoiled bourgeois scum and to hell with your phony attitude and your dental insurance. It is counterculture at its most triumphant, and the protagonists, who are too fast to live and too young to die, are fin-de-siècle Hamlets.
Kids of the 60s took it to the street, but kids of the 90s took it in the vein. It is not just because—as the old saying goes—the total onset of materialism paralysed the individual. Rather, all that the individual craved now was to be paralyzed. And while I first watched “Trainspotting” more than a decade after its release, I thought that I felt exactly the same as those young people. To me, everything in the film is a metaphor for my own situation: The drugs symbolize an escapism rooted in nihilism, the grown-ups embody a reality simultaneously alienating and intimidating, and the time (after the so-called “end of history” and before the turn of the millennium) and place (Scotland, a country that “can’t even find a decent culture to be colonized by”) stand for the total marginalization that anyone with the wrong class or race is born into. While obscene by most social standards, what the protagonist Renton and his little group settle on seemed to me to be the natural, almost innocuous reaction to all these miseries. After all, they are not attempting to overthrow anything. All they want is to retreat into the void of heroin and discotheques, the world forgetting, by the world forgot. Don’t they at least have the right to that? They are not hurting anyone other than themselves….
Except it is not true. There’s no such thing as “choose not to choose,” because passive self-indulgence brings about active harm, and that is the part of the film that I didn’t understand until much later. The first encounter with the real world happens when Renton wakes up in Diane’s home and finds the disco queen from the night before now wearing a private school uniform and standing by her happily middle-class parents. The awkwardness only foreshadows the tragic deaths of Allison’s baby and Tommy, both due to the irresponsible behavior of the group. At these occasions, Renton, who usually seems so in control and carefree, who is so proud to be anti-everything, can only sit aside speechless and sheepishly cook up like real scum.
It may be inconvenient to think of one’s responsibilities and connections to a world that he doesn’t want to be part of, but they exist nevertheless. It is all too easy to blame everything on the rich people and act the working class hero, but that is just sheer cowardice. While Renton and his so-called friends prefer to think of themselves as forgotten children of the civilization, they are in fact its leeches. They desire to be marginalized, to be outcasts, so that they can be content not caring for anyone else. But there is nothing cool about it. There is nothing cool about hurting other people and ignoring one’s responsibilities, and calling it authenticity or subversiveness.
That is what I thought when I last watched “Trainspotting” a year ago, and this time I was skeptical of the film’s ending. The kids are easily given a second chance, through which Renton is able to escape even further, but where is he going to escape to? Even after he abandons the rest of group, he still has to decide between being society’s pest or its accomplice. The intrinsic self-contradictions of the alternative lifestyle still holds. Maybe that’s where film and reality differ. An open ending can be an integral part of a film, but in life you have to choose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an email this Wednesday, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana released the report of the committee tasked with recommending implementation procedures for sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. Khurana accepted the majority of the committee's recommendations, save a suggestion that leadership positions in the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson be included in the sanctions. For these, he has deferred to another committee.
We have already voiced our opposition to administrators interfering in UC elections, but we commend the implementation committee for arriving at a means of enforcement that would preclude a potential witch hunt for members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. It is good that the recommendations also convey the gravity of the sanctions to would-be transgressors.
The report proposes that students applying for fellowships, team captaincies, or other positions covered by the sanctions would need to sign a statement affirming their awareness and compliance with the new policy. This would serve as a preventative rather than reactive measure, hopefully avoiding actual violations of the policy and thus precluding the need for investigations into students’ personal lives.
Moreover, it is emphasized in the report that the statement is intended to be an agreement directly between the student and the College, so that  “faculty, faculty deans and tutors, athletic coaches, fellow organization members, teammates ... should not be responsible for policing the policy or ensuring that it is complied with.” We hope this clause will minimize the intrusiveness of the policy and streamline its enforcement by restricting information to only the parties that are directly involved.
That said, the administration should be more transparent about the involvement of the Honor Council in punishing potential violations. As noted in the report, this proposal would require either an expansion of the jurisdiction of the Honor Council or a peculiar couching of false affirmations as an instance of academic dishonesty. Either path could dilute the mission of the Honor Council. In light of the discontent voiced by current members, prospective applicants to the Council should be notified of the exact policies they will be asked to enforce before they assume their positions.
Furthermore, the report does not shed any light on how investigations will be conducted. As they will connect to students’ personal lives, these proposed Honor Council investigations will differ substantially from cases of academic dishonesty. Since violations might take place a year before or after a student assumes a leadership position, the collection of evidence might be difficult.
Until more detail is provided by Khurana or the administration, the suggestions of the committee will remain just that: suggestions. Nevertheless, we believe that the committee has identified the correct guiding principle in seeking to enforce the sanctions. Now, we ask administrators for clarity on the procedural aspects of this policy.
As they develop these protocols, they are right to “err on the side of allowing some students to evade the restrictions than adopt processes that students regard as inquisitional.” A witch hunt for final club members would not accomplish the aims of the policy. The enforcement of the sanctions should not overshadow their intended goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For someone lonely on a weekend night, Harvard Square is nothing but windows. Walk down Mass. Ave, take the left onto JFK, loop back around to Mt. Auburn, and you’ll pass the Kong, Tatte, J.P. Licks, Clover, Starbucks, Felipe’s, Tealuxe, Tasty Burger, El Jefe’s. Even the 1 bus is just one long, shifting pane of glass.
We sight-dependent humans love to describe things in terms of vision, and windows—that enchanting marriage of visual transparency and physical impenetrability—occupy a special place in our imaginations and metaphorical landscapes. One of the most recognizable American paintings is Edward Hopper’s “Nighthawks,” which depicts a late-night view into a diner. The streets sulk browns and turquoises, but the diner’s walls radiate pale yellow, and the blond bartender is dressed in white. A couple sits side-by-side at the bar with faces toward the viewer, hands resting close to each other on the counter; the third customer, another sharply-dressed man, sits a few stools down.
Look in through a Square window during the weekend and you witness even more vibrant scenes, people unguarded among good food and company. You feel like the crab in T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” scuttling along red brick seafloor beneath miles of liquid evening, past flashes of ecosystems to which you do not belong. Their visibility can only emphasize your lack thereof. Harvard’s high profile and impenetrable facades make it especially easy to feel unseen while keenly aware of everyone else’s visibility.
People have always striven to capture loneliness—if not to defeat it, at least to render it articulable and thus prevent it from becoming despair. We want to work, play, sing, paint, dance, act, write, love, text, talk, cry our way out of it; these acts and their memories, to quote Eliot again, become “the fragments shored against [our] ruin.” In her book “The Lonely City: Adventures in the Art of Being Alone,” Olivia Laing tries to reconcile her isolation through visual art, and Edward Hopper appears as just one of many New York City artists in whose works Laing traces themes of estrangement. Andy Warhol, whose infinite Marilyn Monroes and sociable celebrity we do not generally consider lonely, compulsively taped his life to overcome the linguistic solitude of his awkward non-native speech. David Wojnarowicz, who endured the isolation of an abusive childhood and violent stigmatization of his sexuality, famously photographed subjects wearing expressionless Rimbaud masks that look both isolated and insulated. The willfully reticent Hopper painted countless scenes of windows, restaurants, rooms, and building facades with an isolated and isolating eye, even as he resisted naming loneliness as a theme in his work. None of them really recorded, photographed, or painted their way out—nor could they have. The condition is a terminal and universal, even for those who defiantly embody and capture it.
“Nighthawks” illustrates this conundrum: though the immediate sensation is of looking in from an estranged exterior, even the interior’s occupants are alone. The couple stare ahead without touching; the other man presents his back to us; the bartender, seen from the side, looks haggard. None of their eyes meet each other’s, or ours. The proximity of their bodies, circumscribed behind curving bar counter and window, excludes the viewer—yet, ironically, cannot do for them what a sympathetic gaze might be able to. You feel that what the people in the painting need is to really be seen. The cruel irony is that they have been, millions of times, and just have no way of knowing. We are united in our inability to perceive commune beyond loneliness’s glassy surface. Like the oblivious diners who sit separately together and together separately—and the painting’s viewers, who experience communal isolation and isolated community—we often do not know when we are in turn the ones behind the radiant window front, or how desperately someone inside needs us to turn and look as we pass them in the night.
The most generally loved person I know, who stops to greet people everywhere we go, once told me that he sometimes feels like “no one here really cares whether I’m even alive.” I grimaced and promised, as we always do, to be better, to bear better witness. Thoughtful pieces about loneliness periodically resurface, diagnosing its isolation, proposing individual and structural actions we can take to remedy it. We can amend our behaviors and mindsets, work to push against this place’s particular afflictions. I also recognized in my friend’s statement, however, an emotion too potent and primal to transcend any tangible elements of Harvard itself. As Laing quotes from a Dennis Wilson song, “Loneliness is a very special place,” and so generations of us return to “Nighthawks”: There is a resonance between its astute spatial architecture and some essential, intimate space within us. Beyond a certain point Harvard is just another representation of loneliness, another unique cultural and spatial arrangement in which we can all sit around the same counter yet not feel together at all.
But this situation is not altogether dire. To be lonely is to occupy the most intimate space in the human experience, even as you feel shut out from it. We think about ourselves and others more deeply and honestly in this space than in any other; and from this space, as Laing documents, emerge some of our most enduring, beautiful fragments. Hopper and Wojnarowicz and Warhol’s works are physically and culturally around us, as are those—whether artistic or scientific, tangible, or conceptual—of everyone who shores life’s endeavors against their ruin. A work of art, a bodily sensation, a conversation, a history: these fragments make up the world. Even when you walk alone through the fluorescent barrage of our Cambridge streets, they are with you, swirling and present.

“Men are taught to apologize for their weaknesses, women for their strengths.”
For centuries now, society has conflated sex with gender, creating a hierarchy among the sexes. Lois Wyse’s words above show this phenomenon to be true: From a young age, boys are disciplined to present themselves as stoic, while girls are instructed to portray themselves as emotional. Because of the association between emotionlessness and strength, and sensitivity and weakness, society hierarchically places men above women. Men are associated with strength, and women with weakness.
The commonplace assumption that stereotypically masculine traits are mutually exclusive with characteristically feminine ones breeds this type of thinking. However, when gender is placed on a spectrum, it becomes possible for a myriad of traits to overlap and coexist within one body, without some being superior to others. Considering gender on a spectrum allows people to be human.
No person perfectly matches either of the two extremes of the gender spectrum—men are innately emotional beings and women are intrinsically strong ones. People exist somewhere in the nebulous space between the two endpoints of the spectrum, regardless of their sex assigned at birth.
How we think about gender is important because gender directly relates to the systems that surround us—politics, economics, culture. Therefore, when values of superiority and inferiority become assigned to different genders, these sentiments manifest themselves in other spheres of society too.
It is because of this longtime worldwide tradition of discrimination against women that we need International Women’s Day, which began in the 1900s as a call for women’s equality.
Today’s world still witnesses the systematic discriminatory practices erected throughout history with the sole purpose of subjugating women to a status of inferiority. Centuries of unchecked compartmentalization of gender into two polarized categories birthed and institutionalized the superiority of males over females. Inequitable pay, lack of governmental representation, sexual assault, and underrepresentation in the educational and professional spheres carry the influence of the sexist patriarchy with them.
Despite all the false perceptions of gender and opposition to gender parity, women have overcome. Throughout history, women have proven, against all odds, to be resilient. From the dedicated work of Malala Yousafzai in securing equal access to education to the efforts of Susan B. Anthony to get women the right to vote, countless women have left footprints that can’t be erased, no matter how male-dominated our society is.
While International Women’s Day is a spectacular way to celebrate those who have enacted change, it is important to not forget that transgender women are just as woman as ciswomen.
We praise Rosa Parks, Marie Curie, and Frida Kahlo for their lasting influence, and we should continue to do so. But what about Marsha P. Johnson and her pioneering advocacy within the BGLTQ community? Do we sing her name in conjunction with her cis sisters, or is her story forgotten because of her transgender identity? We cannot erase trans bodies from their contributions to society because of the innate intersectionality—the ability for multiple social constructs to apply to one individual—of the female identity: it encompasses, race, sexuality, class.
Being a cisgender male in today’s world is a privilege, but it should not be. Gender—male, female, nonbinary, transgender—should not define a person’s worth. Sadly, the institutions established throughout our history do not reflect this seemingly basic fact. I am privileged by my identity and do not need to face the obstacles women must face every day. That does not mean, however, that I will stand by idly and watch half of the world’s population suffer at the hands of sexism and misogyny. As long as practices that discriminate on the basis of gender exist, we are all at risk.
I am proud to call myself a feminist. I am proud to stand in solidarity with women. I am not in the fight to give women strength—for they already possess that. Rather, I am in the fight with women and men around the world to help tear down the institutions that prevent women from being allowed to exercise their personhood to its fullest extent. I am in the fight to enact and normalize the equality women deserve, rather than the status the patriarchy has attributed to them. We have already seen what women can do with immense barriers in front of them. Imagine what they can do without them. The future is not in preserving the male-centric society that exists. The future is female.

On Thursday at 8:30 a.m., doors of University Hall burst open with elated House Committee chairs waving envelopes containing this year’s House assignments, inducting freshmen into the 12 upperclassmen residences.
Students clad in festive House attire played horns and took pictures as they gathered around the John Harvard statue to welcome first-year students to their upperclassmen Houses, where many students reside until graduation.
The celebration started in the early hours of the morning as each of the HoCo chairs gathered students in their respective Houses for breakfast and cheers before storming Harvard Yard. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who is also a Faculty Dean in Cabot House, joined the Housing Day revelry, cheering while hoisted on the shoulders of a student near the John Harvard statue.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who began her new role leading the College’s Office of Student Life in August, said experiencing Housing Day for the first time was “amazing” and that she has been excited for the campus tradition since she came to the College.
“People have talked about this since I interviewed,” O’Dair said. “It’s everything everyone said and more. I just love the House spirit, I love the energy, especially this early in the morning.”
Students said they were especially excited to be placed in Winthrop House, which will re-open in August following a year of renovations. New facilities in the House will include a student lounge called the Lion’s Den, a two-story grille, and rooftop terrace, all located in the new Beren Hall addition.
“I am excited for the Lion’s Den and the new grille. The grille better have late hours, though, because I need a place where I can get curly fries at 2 a.m.,” said I. Blu Frankel ’20, a future Winthrop resident. “There’s also a sky terrace with glass all around with a 360-degree view that I am very excited about.”
Freshmen who were assigned to soon-to-be renovated Lowell House, like Connor D. Bridges ’20, said they were optimistic about living in swing housing for the next two years while the building undergoes extensive renovations as part of Harvard’s ongoing House Renewal project. Students living in swing housing occupy the former Harvard Inn and several apartment-style buildings in Harvard Square.
“Since all of the sophomores get stuck together at the Inn, I think the community might be even stronger,” Bridges said. “I remember hearing that Dunster’s community was even stronger when they were in swing housing.”
The annual event occurred against the backdrop of a College committee’s proposal that may eliminate Harvard’s current housing model in favor of one more similar to Yale’s—which would assign freshmen to Houses earlier in their freshman year.
Consistent with previous years, some students were disappointed after learning that they were placed in one of Houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, considerably further away from classroom buildings than houses along the Charles River.
“I wasn't that upset at first, but it does kind of ruin Housing Day when people go up to you and say, ‘I'm sorry,’ and, ‘It'll be okay,’ when you tell them your House,” Lily C. Jacobs ’20 said. Jacobs received a housing assignment to Currier House—one of the three Quad Houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68 disparaged recently released recommendations for enforcing the College's penalties on single-gender social groups in a blog post Wednesday, calling some of the suggestions "quite repellent."
Lewis took issue with the final report of a committee tasked with recommending how to implement the College’s penalties, in particular arguing that suggesting that the Honor Council to enforce the policy goes against the “legislation that created that Council.” He added he believes “the College cannot, without a Faculty vote, punish students for lying about their club membership.”
“If I were a student who was punished on the basis of an illegitimate assumption of authority by the Honor Council, I would hire a lawyer,” Lewis wrote.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who accepted nearly all of the report’s recommendations Monday, wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that he had not yet read Lewis’s blog post, but planned to do so.
Some members of the Council have also said they find the proposed expansion of their role concerning. Council member Meg G. Panetta ’17 said the Council plans to release a public statement on the subject after their next meeting.
Under the College’s policy, undergraduate members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations—starting with the Class of 2021—will be barred from certain leadership positions, athletic captaincies, and fellowships. But the policy may change; a faculty committee, created in January and co-chaired by Khurana, will determine the final version of the College’s penalties.
Lewis has been one of the policy’s most vocal opponents. Last fall, Lewis led a group of faculty members opposed to the penalties in an effort to pass faculty legislation barring their enactment. He withdrew that motion after Khurana announced the creation of the faculty committee that could “revise or replace the sanctions,” but Lewis wrote he would reintroduce the motion if he felt the policy was not adequately revised.
According to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, Khurana will enforce the penalties through two different methods. The Honor Council will investigate cases in which members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations who apply to fellowships, while Khurana plans to use a similar “trust-based system” to discipline members who violate the policy by holding leadership roles in recognized student groups.
The implementation committee’s 46-page report provides a broad plan for how to enforce the College’s penalties, in particular calling for the creation of a new category of recognized social groups on campus and expanding the number of fellowships barred to members of single-gender social organizations. Khurana emailed the report to the student body Monday.
In his blog post, Lewis also criticized the report for misunderstanding the “sociology” of Harvard’s fraternities and sororities and for employing what he called an arbitrary standard to determine which social groups would be subject to the policy.
He added he found the language of the report “patronizing” and “easy to ridicule.”
“I had particular fun imagining the scenario of Appendix H, where we were asked to envision readings of Chaucer in the dining halls as a welcoming, gender-inclusive form of social life,” Lewis wrote, referring to the report’s suggestion that student “dining societies” could gather in dining halls and read Chaucer aloud together in lieu of joining final clubs.
Many Harvard students have also taken note of that particular recommendation. Over the past few days, a student-run Facebook group called “Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens” has exploded with posts satirizing the idea.
One post in the group features a photoshopped picture of Khurana eating “New England Clam Chaucer,” while another depicts Khurana dancing to lyrics from Chaucer’s “The Wife of Bath’s Prologue.”
Still another features side-by-side portraits of Chaucer and Khurana and asks students to “name a more iconic duo.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A University-wide committee tasked with reviewing Harvard’s Title IX policy has discussed adoption of the “affirmative consent” standard—a standard the University has consistently rejected—in conversations about re-wording the policy.
The committee, chaired by Biology professor and former Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, began working in January 2016 to evaluate the policy Harvard uses to define sexual harassment and assault and determine whether to revise it. At its meetings, the committee has addressed perceptions of the policy, examined adjudication procedures, and “had a discussion on affirmative consent,” Pfister said.
“I think a number of us know that that word—consent—is an important part of how students are thinking about this issue,” Pfister said.
Affirmative consent is a standard that requires all parties to affirmatively agree to engage in sexual activity. A number of universities have adopted the requirement—considered the highest standard of proof—as part of their Title IX policies, including all California universities and those in the State Universities of New York system.
“I think it’s fair to say that the idea of consent or affirmative consent is the background culture students are aware of and recognize,” Pfister said.
The current policy, which Harvard adopted in 2014 as its first University-wide Title IX policy, uses the “unwelcome conduct” standard and does not include the word “consent” in its definition of harassment or assault. The policy defines conduct as unwelcome if one party “did not request or invite it” and “regarded the unrequested or uninvited conduct as undesirable or offensive.”
After Harvard unveiled the policy in 2014, undergraduates criticized the University for not involving students in its formulation and called on the University to adopt the affirmative consent standard. Students have also raised concerns that the language of the policy creates confusion about its meaning, Pfister said.
Harvard convened the Title IX review committee in the fall of 2015 to examine the policy’s implementation and potentially recommend changes. Its membership consists of faculty and staff from across Harvard’s schools, as well as two undergraduates and two graduate students.
Over the past year, committee members have met with members of the student group Our Harvard Can Do Better, Title IX coordinators, resident deans, counselors, and representatives from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. They have also read several sexual assault cases provided by former Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides and studies policies at peer institutions, Pfister said.
Pfister said the committee’s work has focused largely on students and ensuring the language of the policy is clear. “We’ve been very student-oriented on the committee,” Pfister said.
The committee will eventually issue recommendations to the University, although Pfister said he is unsure when that will occur and what form those proposals might take. Pfister declined to comment on whether the committee has specifically considered amending the policy to include affirmative consent.
As the committee works to review the policy—and potentially change it—schools across the University have implemented a number of sexual assault prevention trainings in response to recommendations issued by a University-wide task force last March. A re-wording of the policy would require these trainings to be updated to reflect the new language.
Pfister emphasized that the committee’s work will continue even after it delivers its initial recommendations.
“In a way we’re feeling we’re kind of watch dogs, looking at and continuing to think about these issues,” he said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will run a budget deficit—albeit a smaller one than initially projected—in the coming year, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
The process of formulating next year’s FAS budget is ongoing but nearing completion. FAS—which receives roughly half its income from the endowment—has had to tighten its belt because of the endowment’s recent poor returns and dwindling reserves, according to Smith.
“Since the financial crisis we’ve been dealing with issues,” Smith said. “Earlier in the fall, I said one of the things that happened is we’ve gotten past the worst parts of the financial crisis from 2008, but we are absolutely dependent upon the endowment distribution performance. So every couple of years, having that dip down on us makes things difficult for us again.”
In fiscal year 2016, the endowment posted negative 2 percent returns, its worst performance since the nadir of the financial crisis. University President Drew G. Faust called the returns  “disappointing,” and said they would put pressure on budgets across the University.
Last month, Smith said in an interview that the number of graduate school admissions slots will decrease this year by 4.4 percent due to budgetary constraints. He said that he has had to make no other cuts of that size in the past month.
Additionally, FAS will increase personnel expenditures by giving raises to some employees this year, according to Smith.
Various segments of FAS annually present their own budgets to Smith, who then works with them to discern what FAS can and cannot afford.
“The units did a great job presenting budgets that were extremely reasonable given the financial situations that we find ourselves in, so I’m not left with 'I’ve got to make a huge budgetary cut in order to make the budget work,'” he said.
Smith said because of the ongoing nature of the budgeting process, he cannot provide an exact number for the final size of the deficit, but that it will be “reasonably small.” He added that the projected deficit for this fiscal year has shrunk over the past five years, and that the current deficit is smaller than the last projection.
“I feel good about that,” he said of beating the projection. “It’s still a deficit, and I don’t feel good about that. I’d rather us run with the money we take in and spend it on the academic program on the way out, but if we have to run it, if it’s not getting worse than what the past [projections] said, that’s a huge step for us.”

The Harvard Kennedy School of Government has raised roughly $580 million in its capital campaign, surpassing its original $500 million goal and marking a $10 million increase from December 2016.
Going forward, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf says the school will focus on funding student financial aid, an ongoing construction project set to finish next winter, and developing programs that engage with “digital technology and governance.”
Elmendorf said he wants to hire faculty specializing in areas like cyber security, as well as provide funds to the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy in order to conduct further research. He says he finds the area particularly relevant in an age of increased dependence on technology.
“Digital technology is changing the way businesses work. It’s changing our personal lives,” Elmendorf said. “We need to train our students and work with policymakers to push faster and use digital technology.”
He added that a more immediate goal is to complete fundraising for the Kennedy School’s construction project, which will remodel and connect Kennedy School buildings such as the Taubman, Rubenstein, Littauer, and Belfer buildings, as well as adds about 77,000 square feet of space to the school’s JFK St. campus.
While the project’s total price tag is roughly $126 million, Elmendorf said his predecessor, David T. Ellwood ’75, who left the school in 2015, raised most of the funds.
The Kennedy School surpassed its original campaign goal of $500 million in 2016, adding to the University’s total record-breaking $7 billion campaign. Elmendorf said in December, however, that the Kennedy School’s “goal is not to hit a particular dollar value,” and that he will continue fundraising for new developments.
Elmendorf noted that, unlike other Harvard schools, both past and recent gifts to the Kennedy School come from non-alumni donors. Instead, he said people interested in the Kennedy School’s work tend to donate to the campaign.
“In contrast with many academic institutions, we raise comparatively little money from our alumni and most of our money from people who are interested in public policy,” he said. “People realize that we are a powerful force for good in the world. And they want to support that and be part of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust took to the pages of the New York Times Thursday to lay out an impassioned case for continuing to fund the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal grant-making agency that Faust wrote “nurtures our national soul.”
Last month, President Donald Trump included the NEH and its sister program, the National Endowment for the Arts, on a draft list of programs up for elimination in this year’s federal budget.
In the op-ed, Faust, a historian of the American South, described several projects funded by the NEH, including a wildly popular 1990 Civil War documentary, a cross-country tour of Shakespeare’s First Folio, and the digitization of eight million pages of historic newspapers.
"Reports suggest that the Trump administration’s coming budget will defund the endowment,” Faust wrote. “I would wager that few readers of this newspaper, and probably few Americans anywhere, are untouched by an N.E.H.-sponsored project or program.”
Research funding is among several of Faust’s federal policy priorities when she meets with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Researchers from across Harvard’s disciplines and schools—from the Medical School to humanities departments in the College —have voiced concerns about funding cuts.
This year, Faust has met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and other politicians in Washington.
Faust does not frequently write op-eds, although she has written pieces in the past for the Boston Globe, Washington Post, and The Crimson, among others.
“The [NEH] helps Americans explore and better understand how we came to be the nation, people and world we are,” Faust wrote. “We must ensure that it continues.”

An ongoing National Labor Relations Board hearing that could determine the fate of Harvard’s student unionization effort may soon turn to the formal objections filed by both union organizers and the University.
The NLRB hearing, which convened on February 22, continued to meet throughout the week of February 27, focusing on challenged ballots in the November unionization election which currently remains too close to call. At issue during the hearing is both the challenged ballots and the objections filed by Harvard and union organizers.
The NLRB did not hold the hearing from March 6 to March 10, but proceedings will resume on Monday. The NLRB’s decision about the validity of the objections could determine the fate of the student unionization effort at Harvard.
In December, union organizers filed their objection. They argued the election had been unfair, claiming that lists of eligible voters that Harvard had provided before the election had been inaccurate and incomplete.
If NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh concludes that the union’s objections are valid, he could call for a re-vote.
The University also filed an objection, albeit on a much smaller scale. Lawyers representing Harvard alleged that a single ballot that the NLRB marked void should be counted. The ballot contained a mark in the box that signified a vote against unionization, and also included a short message to the vote counter and a smiley face.
In an order announcing the hearing’s date and agenda, Walsh wrote that “the Challenged Ballots and Objections raise substantial and material factual issues that may be best resolved by hearing.”
So far during the NLRB hearing, the parties have debated the eligibility of challenged ballots, votes from the November election that remain in dispute.
In its assertions about challenged ballots earlier in the hearing, the union argued that there should be a “lookback period” that gives students who had worked at most one academic year before the election the ability to vote.
“We contend that doctoral students who have been employed in the bargaining unit for at least one semester during the academic year prior to the election itself, and who were not, at the time of the election, in their dissertation year, are eligible to vote,” said Thomas W. Meiklejohn, a lawyer for HGSU-UAW, during opening arguments.
The University, however, has presented a different interpretation of NLRB case law. “There should be no lookback period,” Joseph P. McConnell, a lawyer for Harvard, said. “And it’s certainly not an anathema to the Board’s policies that there not be a lookback period.”
After the hearing ends, both parties will submit post-hearing briefs to hearing officer Thomas A. Miller. Walsh will issue his decisions, based on Miller’s recommendations, about the challenged ballots and the objections.
“The hearing process will continue until all the relevant facts and evidence are presented, and the NLRB issues its decisions based on the totality of these proceedings,” FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven said.

Despite the announcement of 19 members Tuesday, the composition of a faculty committee tasked with re-examining a controversial College policy on social groups is still in flux, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
Roughly half a dozen students will be added to the committee in the coming days, along with additional faculty and staff members not originally announced earlier this week, Smith said in an interview on Thursday. The committee’s co-chairs, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and music professor Suzannah Clark will select the students on the committee. 
“I’m really not the right person to be choosing the students, so I’ve delegated that to the co-chairs and asked Susie and Rakesh to think about it,” Smith said. “I’m obviously looking at making sure that we’ve got a good, thoughtful grouping of students.”
Smith said the “handful of students” would likely include members of the Undergraduate Council. He added, however, that he preferred to keep the committee small.
“I want that committee to be actually able to have conversations. If you get too many people in a room you can’t actually have conversations,” Smith said.
Shortly after Smith’s email to the Faculty, Naisha Bradley, director of the Harvard College Women's Center, was added as another member of the committee.
Starting with the class of 2021, the controversial policy bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions in clubs or varsity teams and from being recommended for a number of postgraduate fellowships. Khurana announced the penalties in May 2015, and he now leads the committee that could revise or replace the policy.
Smith said part of the impetus for appointing Khurana, one of the policy’s original architects, as co-chair of the committee was to include faculty and staff with deep commitments to the policy in addition to those with no opinions on it.
“We’re getting closer and closer to the time period in which students will actually be affected by this. Instead of putting another stage in the process, let’s have the College deeply involved in this,” Smith said. “So we kind of got that balance between the College and Rakesh’s depth of knowledge from working on this for a long time, and a new perspective coming in.”
Smith announced the composition of the faculty committee, including the promise of future student membership, in an email to Faculty members Tuesday afternoon. Khurana announced the existence of the new committee following months of intense debate among Faculty members in the fall. During those meetings, some professors criticized College administrators for what they saw as a lack of faculty consultation prior to the policy's rollout, a charge Smith deemed “categorically false” in December.
“I certainly had a few people write to me and say that they would be interested and were offering to be members of the committee,” Smith said. “So I looked through all those different lists and tried to find people that I thought were interested on this topic, were thoughtful on this topic, could represent our diversity of views.”
The creation of the new faculty committee drew criticism in a Monday report from a separate committee tasked with crafting recommendations for the policy’s implementation. That committee did not know about the faculty committee until shortly before it was publicly announced. The implementation committee’s report pointed to the creation of a second committee as an obstacle to candid discussion.
“Could we have communicated better to the implementation committee along the way, and then they wouldn’t have had as many questions?” Smith said. “Probably.”
Smith said the committee will begin meeting after spring break. They’ll present their findings to University President Drew G. Faust in early fall 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Change may be tough to adjust to, but it can be equally as exciting. And this weekend will certainly provide no lack of intrigue as the Harvard women’s basketball team participates in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament at the Palestra in Philadelphia.
The winner of “Ivy Madness,” as it’s been dubbed, will get automatic qualification to the NCAA Tournament; in previous seasons, the regular season Ancient Eight champion was that bid’s recipient. As such, the Crimson (20-7, 8-6 Ivy) get a chance to wipe the slate clean and earn its way into March Madness for the first time since the 2006-07 campaign.
“The good thing about this tournament is that it’s a clean slate,” said freshman point guard Katie Benzan, recently named to the First-Team All-Ivy roster. “No matter how poorly or how well we did this season, everyone has to win two games against two really good teams.”
Harvard, the third seed, will face Princeton on Saturday night after watching Penn and Brown battle in the other semifinal. The Tigers (15-12, 9-5) finished second in conference play for the second consecutive year, defeating the Crimson twice on the way there.
In February’s matchup in New Jersey, the hosts needed overtime to overcome Harvard, 63-58. This past weekend, Princeton staved off a furious Crimson rally to hold on, 64-60, at Lavietes Pavilion. There is no doubt that Saturday’s game will be similarly competitive.
“It doesn’t matter that we lost,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “You could look at it as beating a team three times could be difficult. I’ve always felt that.”
Neither team comes into the tournament on a high note. The Tigers lost three of their last four games, while Harvard has lost four of its past five after a program-record 16-game win streak earlier in the season. During that stretch, the Crimson has shot just 32.6 percent from the field and 27.5 percent from beyond the arc, down from 40.8 and 33.5 percent respectively in the first 22 games.
Despite her team’s struggles to put the ball in the basket, however, Coach Delaney-Smith wasn’t worried about her players’ confidence heading into the weekend. She’s more concerned with getting back to the basics.
“I will point to basketball specific weaknesses, like boxing out and fundamentals that we were getting away with and not growing in those fundamentals,” Delaney-Smith said. “These are fundamentals we have control over, it’s not putting the ball in the basket. We rush our execution; we don’t let each other use their skill set. We don’t set good enough screens or use good enough screens.”
Harvard’s depth was its greatest asset early in the season, but over the past few weeks the offense has grown reliant on a few key players. Benzan has been particularly effective, while captain Destiny Nunley and sophomore guard Madeline Raster are key cogs in the offense as well. Delaney-Smith will need those two, freshman center Jeannie Boehm, and the remainder of the rotation to be at its best this weekend.
The Tigers have qualified for the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back seasons and have two seniors and a junior among their leaders in minutes played. Forward Leslie Robinson is the main inside threat, averaging 10.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game while making 49.8 percent of her field goals.
Despite all that experience, Princeton’s top performer this season has been freshman Bella Alarie, a 6-foot-4 ‘small’ forward who was recently named Ivy Rookie of the Year. A solid outside shooter with the size to take on smaller defenders and the speed to get by forwards, Alarie is averaging 12.6 points, 1.7 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game.
Ultimately, the tournament will be a new experience for the entire squad and one that they will likely remember for the remainder of their careers. The opportunity to use the regular season as a protracted qualifier has given the Crimson an opportunity to work through some of its problems and build resilience, something that will be invaluable this weekend.
“We all are dying for Saturday at 6:30,” Benzan said. “We all just want to play and win and we’re all working hard; we just really want to win this time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You really couldn’t have drawn it up any better. Storylines abound as the Ivy League prepares to hold its first ever men’s basketball tournament. Rivalries? Check. History? Hell yeah. A shot at perfection? You got it. Saturday’s semifinals feature the Ivy League’s best basketball rivalry and the conference’s oldest one. Penn and Princeton will take center stage early Saturday afternoon with Harvard and Yale to follow.
The quartet and its coaches account for basically everything you need to know about Ivy League basketball over the last half century. The Crimson or Bulldogs have been the conference’s NCAA Tournament representative for each of the last five seasons. The Tigers took that honor home in 2011. Penn coach Steve Donahue preceded Princeton with three straight league titles at Cornell. Before that, the Quakers and Tigers either won or shared all but two Ivy League titles between 1963 and 2007. Penn and Princeton were so dominant that they used to schedule their second regular season matchup for the Tuesday after the other six Ancient Eight schools wrapped up their conference slates. The games often served as de facto conference championships.
With a real conference championship now on the books, the Quakers and Tigers will be meeting for the 237th time on Saturday. Penn leads the all-time series, 124-112 after the most recent meeting on Feb. 7. Since then, the Quakers and Tigers are the two hottest teams in the Ivy League—Penn has won six of its last eight games while Princeton finished its Ivy League slate without a loss. After losing to Yale in the teams’ first go-round, the Quakers humiliated the Elis at home. Two weeks, the Quakers got revenge against a Harvard team that beat Penn by ten in Cambridge.
Even though the Tigers clinched the Ivy League’s top seed two weekends ago, Princeton did not lay off the gas in the conference’s final regular season weekend. The Tigers dropped the Crimson in the closing seconds for the second time last Friday before ripping Dartmouth’s big green limbs off the following night. While the Penn-Princeton rivalry is old—the teams first met in 1903—it is more notable for the success of the two programs. The Quakers and Tigers have combined for 51 conference championships and 26 of the league’s 43 NCAA Tournament wins.
If the Penn-Princeton rivalry is Philadelphia’s Main Line, Harvard and Yale just bought a place at Two Liberty Place. You thought The Game was just a football rivalry? You would be wrong. Not only have the Crimson and Bulldogs played meaningful basketball games for the first time ever in recent years, the teams and their head coaches are not particularly fond of one another.
Both matchups this season—two Harvard wins—have gotten chippy. The last time that the two teams met at the Palestra, Steve Mondou-Missi ’15 put the finishing touches on an epic late season collapse by the Bulldogs. Yale coach James Jones does not forget that game and has taken exception to Tommy Amaker’s recruiting tactics, saying in 2014 that his program “could not get involved with many of the kids” that Amaker has brought to Cambridge.
Both semifinal matchups and the championship if Princeton wins on Saturday feature matchups that have gone the same way in two playings this season. It is not easy to beat a team three teams in a season. Since 2002, three pairs of Ivy League teams have met thrice in a season and never has one team won all three matchups. Of last season’s Final Four teams, Villanova was the only one to beat a team (15-18 Georgetown) three times.
Did we mention that the tournament is being played at the Palestra? The old dog, which is celebrating its 90th anniversary this season and has hosted more games, more teams, and more NCAA Tournaments than any other arena, will learn a new trick this weekend. The Cathedral of College Basketball has seen its fair share of Ivy League, high school, and college basketball over the years. In 2012 and 2013, Notre Dame senior Steve Vasturia and Miami junior Ja’Quan Newton squared off in the always star-powered Philadelphia Catholic League finals, which began being played at the Palestra in 1937.
When a high school senior named LeBron James came to Philadelphia to square off with Maureece Rice and his Strawberry Mansion Knights, the game was played at the historic arena and even Allen Iverson was a guest in the hallowed bleachers. Miles Bridges, Tyler Hansbrough, Jeremy Lin, Kyle Lowry, and Jameer Nelson have all been visitors at the Ivy League’s largest arena. Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and James came to the Palestra to take on a team of Philadelphia stars during the 2011 NBA Lockout.
The building feels old school. Photographers complain about the sightlines and players bemoan the small locker rooms but that all is overpowered by the building’s charm and history. While the stands feature minimal lighting, the court is a brightly illuminated center stage. Ivy League and Philadelphia Big Five banners hang from the rafters. The building feels and literally looks like a cathedral.
We’re supposed to be unbiased and all but I think that the Quakers making the inaugural Ivy League Tournament is the best thing that could have happened for the conference. Sure, the hosts could get their doors blown off by Princeton on Saturday afternoon but a tournament played at your home arena without you playing in it is like when you go out to dinner with a friend and a friend of a friend and your friend goes to the bathroom. Trust us, having the Philadelphia horse in the race will make the whole weekend a lot better.
To understand what the Palestra means to Philadelphia, you have to know a little bit about the City of Brotherly Love. My senior religion teacher described Philadelphia as the most parochial place he had ever lived. For being the nation’s fifth-largest city, Philadelphia has a small-town feel. Residents identify themselves by their neighborhoods and Catholics do likewise with their parishes. The small-town, family affair goes all the way down to the city’s most popular sport.
While the Eagles dominate Philadelphia’s professional sports scene, college basketball gives you a better idea of what the city is all about. Philadelphia has six Division I college basketball teams to its name and each has its own rabid fan base. Big Five games sell out whether it’s Villanova-Penn on a Saturday night at the Palestra or Temple-La Salle midweek at 19th and Olney. Big Five wins are oftentimes more meaningful than conference ones and the rivalries are some of the most intense in college basketball. A talented and high stakes high school basketball scene only adds to the fun.
Competing in the Big Five has a special pull for players and coaches alike. John Giannini has been the head man at La Salle since 2004. Phil Martelli is in his 22nd season at St. Joseph’s. Martelli’s Jesuit high school and Temple coach Fran Dunphy’s alma mater play an annual Thanksgiving football game. Dunphy coached the Quakers for 17 seasons before taking his talents to North Broad Street in 2006. One of Dunphy’s assistants at Penn was Donahue, who hails from the same Philadelphia suburb as his former boss and current Big Five rival.
Villanova coach Jay Wright grew up north of the city and was an assistant under former Drexel coach Eddie Burke. Fraternal is one word you could use to describe amateur basketball in Philadelphia. To tie it all together, Bill “Speedy” Morris, the all-time winningest coach in Philadelphia Catholic League history, coached those 2012 and 2013 league championship games at the Palestra with St. Joseph’s Prep, went against Martelli, Dunphy, and Wright while he was the at La Salle, and game planned for Donahue while the Penn coach was a high schooler at Cardinal O’Hara and Morris was in charge at Roman Catholic High School. The city and its basketball history are parochial, both in the Catholic and traditional meaning of the word, and no building is a greater reflection of that than the Cathedral of College Basketball.
Philadelphia has won only one major sports championship since 1983. Whether it is Rocky or the ’01 Iverson-led Sixers, Philadelphia is a city of underdogs. Its love of college basketball reflects that mentality. Of the ten largest cities in the US, Philadelphia and New York are the only two with more than four Division I basketball programs. The city has its own de facto basketball conference and its own unique basketball culture. It’s why former Philadelphia mayor and Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell has season tickets for Penn basketball and why Smokey Joe’s is packed after big Quaker wins. It’s why 60,000 people turned out for Villanova’s parade through Center City last April and why Nelson still gets a standing ovation when he comes back to play the Sixers.
Philadelphia may be in its own little world when it comes to college basketball but the city wouldn’t have it any other way. Philadelphia relishes the fact that Villanova beat North Carolina on a miraculous buzzer beater and that St. Joseph’s is one of only three teams this century with a perfect regular season and that La Salle rode a Southwest Philly floater to the Sweet Sixteen four seasons ago and that Temple throws the kitchen sink at Syracuse or Kansas or Indiana and even that Penn has won 25 Ivy League titles and played in arguably the greatest Final Four ever.
You can market it all you want—more than its beverages, its casinos, its music, and its iconic Love Park, Philadelphia loves it college basketball and the arena that helps to tell so many of its stories. The Ivy League will get to see why this weekend and will have a chance to make some history of its own.
Now to the (quite few) picks:
PRINCETON VS PENN
All good things must come to an end―the Ivy League regular season as we once knew it, Harambe, this column. This weekend will mark the end of the road for three Ivy League teams. As Princeton takes on Penn then, we’ve decided to take a look back at how the Quakers traditionally have traditionally dealt with the Tigers.
For those of you new to the Ivy League I’ll provide some background. A Quaker―according to a reliable source, Wikipedia―is a member of a historically Christian group generally known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are plentiful in the Northeast. Tigers roughly fall under the same definition.
As the Quakers take on the Tigers then, we figured it would be valuable to look at the way in which Quakers have traditionally dealt with their feline counterparts from Princeton. Given we’ve seen Princeton stun the Quakers several times this season, we decided to take a more nuanced approach to the question at hand. We hate to say it, but it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say Penn sort of stumbled into the tournament after Columbia stumbled just a bit harder.
Let’s not give Princeton a break here though. They too have not yet been vindicated by reliable sources. According to a credible source known as Urban Dictionary, Princeton is nothing more than, “a medium-sized town in New Jersey, home not only to the Tigers, but also Palmer Square, and more importantly, a centrally located J. Crew.”
Ah, how could we forget about Princeton’s centrally located J. Crew! Rumor has it it’s almost as legendary as the Tigers’ historic ‘locomotive’ chant which no one has actually ever heard of.
It’s tough to say this given how much Princeton sucks at non-basketball activities, but the even playing at home, we think the Quakers won’t be able to move past their natural inclination to peace.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD VS YALE
We don’t typically take to quoting other publications, but I think the Yale Daily News did a particularly good job of summing up one of the most prolific games witnessed in Harvard basketball history―and we weren’t even playing.
Take it away, YDN.
“When it came time for the fateful inbounds play with 1.8 seconds remaining — a lob and game-winning finish by Big Green forward Gabus Maldunas, a senior playing his final game for pride and pride alone — only the 1000-plus fans in attendance could see. That shot created a one-game playoff the following weekend between Yale and Harvard at the famed Palestra, and the rest is history.”
We’re not actually sure how the brutal 2015 Yale-Dartmouth game and the ensuing one game playoff against Harvard are relevant here, but we figured if there’s ever a time to pour some salt on those wounds, then why not today.
It’ll probably sting on Saturday, too.
Pick: Harvard

The sun is (somewhat) out, there are more tourists about, and students are crawling out of their library nooks—spring break is starting. Whether you’re jetting off to a sandy beach, going back home (hello properly sized bed!), or staying in good ol’ Boston to network, you can finally indulge in some TV binging without feeling guilty about your three unfinished papers. Now’s your chance to check out some more underrated shows, instead of clinging to your old favorites. Here are some hidden TV gems that are as under-appreciated as the Quad and almost as entertaining as reading Chaucer out loud 
Search PartyThis dark comedy about a hipster Nancy Drew has a cast of Harvard-type characters. From that Spee “savior” who is always bragging about his volunteering trip to Cambodia, to awkward self-promoters trying to network, the 10 episode noir sitcom will have you laughing, crying, and relating to a bunch of college grads trying to be adults.
Unbreakable Kimmy SchmidtIf midterms and rejection from the Crimson Key Society’s comp are bringing you down, you could use some of Kimmy Schmidt’s ever-sunny attitude. Seriously, this Netflix original has more happy spunk than Dean Khurana during Visitas. The two cheerful seasons that are out right now will give you some perspective: although you’ll have FOMO from your linking group’s trip to the Bahamas, at least you haven’t been locked in a bunker for 4 years like Kimmy (oh wait, if Lamont basement counts, you totally have been).
3%This Brazilian dystopian drama has all the elements of a perfect binge. Hot people? Check. Creepy sci fi technology? Check. Enough (but not too many) episodes to satisfy your TV cravings? Check. How can you resist?
Crazy Ex-GirlfriendIf our senior spring article inspired you to tone down your tendency to overachieve, you will relate to “the crazy ex” Rebecca Bunch, an Ivy-League lawyer who trades her prestigious job for a chance at happiness in California. This funny but complex show has 2 seasons available on Netflix so you can put that VPN to rest.
Young PopeLike Tommy D, the young pope is too cool for his job. He is sizzling hot, broody and charming. He is so hip he even became a meme. If you don’t take this self-aggrandizing HBO drama too seriously, you’re in for a good time.
The Santa Clarita DietAlthough we often joke that consulting recruits turn into zombies, Drew Barrymore proves that being a zombie is oh-so fun in this new Netflix flick. This show is perfect if you looking for a light-hearted but surprisingly heart-warming family comedy with a twist. However, beware: the show features more puke than freshman dorms on Housing Day eve.

So, you got quadded. If you’re fake, you feigned excitement upon hearing “Cabot…Cabot…Cabot!” or “Currier…Currier…Currier!” or “Pforzheimer…Pforzheimer…Pforzheimer!” right outside your room on Housing Day,  and even after witnessing how vibrant of a community these houses provide, you still feel somewhat disappointed about how far away your new home is from everything else on campus. Never fear: just find you a river daddy! You'll be able to rely on the inhabitants of river houses for your daily—and nightly ;)—needs. Each house can offer you something different. Read below if you're interested: 
Eliot DaddyAre you an athlete with morning practice? Do you have to wake up at 5:45 a.m. for morning lift and it’s already 1 in the morning and walking back to the quad at night and then back to the river in the morning would give you almost 40 minutes less sleep? Get you an Eliot Daddy whose room you can sleep in at night to maximize sleep time. After all, you’ll perform better with more sleep!Dunster/Winthrop DaddyGetting tired of Harvard dorm life? Wanna feel like you’re on vacation and staying in a 4-star hotel? Dunster and Winthrop (starting next fall), the two most recently renovated houses on campus, can offer you hotel-like accommodations. They feature luxurious common spaces, buffet-style meals, and clean, comfortable rooms.Lowell DaddyHungry and unwilling to go to and fro the quad in between classes for a total meal time of about 7 minutes? Identify a Lowell daddy to sneak you into the Winn (Lowelltell?) during the next two years of swing housing. The location is ideal, the rooming expansive, and the food options mildly delectable.Mather DaddyNeed a quick nap? Identify a sole Mather daddy to grant you access to their dorm room. If they’re busy and not in the room, ask them to tape the door beforehand. With four singles in their room, you can nap in any one of the singles with guaranteed peace and quiet.Quincy DaddyAre you trying to throw a party and want river folk (and freshmen) to attend? Quincy is perfectly situated between all the houses and dorms to ensure good attendance. Your Quincy Daddy will submit the party form on your behalf and grant you their room (and if you’re lucky, snacks, beverages, and speakers) for the night.Kirkland DaddyMissing the unnaturally close-knit community of the Quad, yet don’t want to venture all the way back there in order to feel like you’re part of something bigger than yourself? Your Kirkland Daddy can introduce you to everyone in their tiny house, so you can have a riverside community too. #incestfest
