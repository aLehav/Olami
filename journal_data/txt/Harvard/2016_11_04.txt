After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An ordinary guy is, like many, fed up with politics. What’s more, he thinks the country would be better off with someone like him in charge. Inexplicably, the next morning he wakes up as the President of the United States—and has to navigate a series of crises, including a natural disaster and a diplomatic crisis that spirals into a nuclear catastrophe.
Such is the premise of “Greg in Charge,” a play that will run at the Adams Pool Theater from Nov. 4 to 6, on the precipice of the election. The producer and writer, Daniel J. Kenny ’18, who is also the editor-in-chief of Satire V, chose farce as his medium to portray the present political pandemonium. He cites Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” as an inspiration in writing “Greg In Charge,” from which the titular protagonist derives his name.
The characters do not explicitly satirize either presidential candidate but rather serve to represent the shortcomings and disappointments of the country’s political system as a whole.  “It is an echo of the hilarity that is our present political atmosphere right now, but with a refreshing amount of nothing to do with anything on the nose that’s actually happening,” says Ali L. Astin ’19, who will play Greg’s vice president.
Beyond the domestic sphere, the play also reflects the current populist moment that spans Western democracy. “On the one hand, there’s the idea that an ordinary person can just be put in charge, and we’re seeing that right now with Trump,” Kenny says. “And you have this sort of technocrat/bureaucrat of Washington, which is now being represented by Hillary Clinton…. So in a sense it’s a satire of both the long-time politicians and those who are saying, ‘Why not? I’ll try this out.’”
While the premise of the play itself is undoubtedly politically charged, Jamie P. Herring ’18, Greg’s chair of the joint chiefs of staff, describes the play as light-hearted. According to Herring, the morale of the story is clear and simple: “We shouldn’t be so hard on politicians, because regardless, they’re going to do a better job than we are.” Kenny’s openness to ad-lib contributions to the script and provision for actor interpretation support this lively and kinetic take on the upcoming election.
So what audience does “Greg in Charge” target? The answer seems to include just about anyone. “If you want to feel vaguely or ambiguously upset at politics or just laugh your ass off, that’s the reason we’re here,” Astin says.

You know how listening to My Chemical Romance has become a measure for how bad your taste is? To many, they’ve become whiny angst personified, immortalized by the black, skeleton-like marching band uniforms from their “Welcome to the Black Parade” music video. But this wasn’t always the case. In 2006, coming off the moderate success of their previous album, “Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge,” My Chemical Romance wanted to record a classic album, something for which they would be remembered. As a result, they wound up taking a lot of influence from Pink Floyd, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Queen—the last of which is most notable throughout the album. They then took the idea of a concept album, made fresh again with Green Day’s “American Idiot” after more or less dying out after the ’70s, and wrote an album about a patient with cancer who finds out he has two weeks to live and proceeds to reflect on his life.
The album, backed by singles like “Welcome to the Black Parade” and “Teenagers,” was a hit, going double platinum in the U.S. and achieving widespread critical acclaim. It was thought to be an immense improvement for a decent but angsty band and that the album would set the stage for similarly great work to come. Of course, critics also said the same thing about Rick Ross’ 2010 album “Teflon Don,” and he’s spent the last six years mired in work ranging from mediocre to horrible. “The Black Parade” gave My Chemical Romance a similar fate; they released another album in a similar style that was a critical flop and disbanded three years later. In the end, critics vastly overestimated how classic this album was.
Despite being a concept album, the narrative of “The Black Parade” is somewhat muddled, with very little consensus on what the actual story is. For example, one could interpret that the first song, “The End.,” features the protagonist dying, and the rest of the album is just a reflection on his life (supported by the sound of the flatlining heart monitor in the outro). Other interpretations are that the story is about a cancer patient seeking meaning.
The album begins with a general prelude before transitioning to the main story with “Dead!”, where the protagonist finds out he has cancer and has two weeks to live. The next few songs revolve around his reconciliation with an ex-lover. Meanwhile, the protagonist grows more anxious, culminating in the best song on the album, “Welcome to the Black Parade”—a sonic vision of death as a parade. The next several songs feature the protagonist ending his relationship with his ex-lover and reconciling with his mother before resigning himself to death.
After “Sleep,” the narrative is hard to follow.  It could be that the protagonist dies at the end of “Sleep,” and everything after is just his reflection from the grave. This would make sense given the sequence of the songs. “Sleep” could also be a setup for the narrator thinking about his life before he dies (“Now will it matter after I’m gone?”). However, it is possible to think of the last track, “Famous Last Words,” as an ending that is open to interpretation (read: the protagonist didn’t die). This may be in large part because lead singer Gerard Way wrote the song to help his brother Mikey Way, My Chemical Romance’s bassist, who was dealing with severe anxiety at the time. “Famous Last Words” has a more hopeful tone that does not necessarily fit the rest of the album due to the intent with which it was created; lines like “I am not afraid to keep on living” demonstrate the positivity of the song.
The album itself is incredibly angsty with moments of poignant emotional vulnerability.  The songs themselves are for the most part high-quality, affecting, and catchy. It’s a good album that flows well with the sole exception of “Teenagers.” The song is probably the largest issue in terms of the album’s quality—it jarringly follows the most trying moment on the album, in which the protagonist comes to peace with his impending death (“Sleep”), and rants about the way adults treat teenagers. It sounds like it would be clever if it were poking fun at tropes in the emo genre, until you realize that it’s not ironic in the slightest. It’s so whiny that it’s hard to get through without cringing at least once. More importantly, it disrupts the flow of the album because of how overdone it is compared to the songs around it.
Emotionally, too, the album is lacking.  An album about a cancer patient has the potential to evoke more than only angst, love, and despair. While these sentiments capture some of what this sort of experience is like, they are fairly limited and more just a product of the emo genre.
“Teenagers,” the lack of emotional range, and the confusing narrative are some of the reasons “The Black Parade” hasn’t been remembered well. The narrative serves to work against the album’s legacy by making the story too confusing to firmly grasp. And while My Chemical Romance was lauded at the time for their bold use of the concept album, “The Black Parade” took them in a direction that wasn’t sustainable.
So was “The Black Parade” a good album? It was a great album that really should have been done by a band that could cover the range of emotions involved in this sort of concept better than My Chemical Romance. As far as concept albums about dying go, The Antlers’ “Hospice” is probably better. While the band’s natural style proved to be its own undoing, “The Black Parade” stands as an excellent but flawed album in its own right.

During my seven years as U.S. Secretary of Education under President Obama, I was guided by the conviction that public schools must be gateways of opportunity for all our children. To make that happen, I knew we had to get beyond the political rhetoric and find what worked for kids. We launched a competitive grant initiative called Race to the Top to help states to change what was broken and expand what was working. In Massachusetts, that meant more flexibilities for district schools and more charter schools.
I visited Massachusetts many times during my tenure, and saw first-hand why charter schools in Boston and cities throughout the Commonwealth are some of the best in the nation. Their commitment to excellence is unparalleled.
Massachusetts has long been recognized as a national leader in public education. Whether traditional district school or public charter school, there is a commitment to public education here that you don’t see everywhere else.
This success is worth celebrating, but Massachusetts still has much work to do. The Bay State’s racial achievement gap remains among the country’s largest, and it has been persistent despite the state’s general success. Too many children are still attending schools that don’t measure up, and this disparity follows all-too-familiar demographic patterns.
To remain the nation’s education leader, Massachusetts must ensure that its lauded education system works for all students. That means expanding schools and policies that work for students usually left behind, no matter the political consequences.
In Massachusetts, public charter schools work to close achievement gaps. Since they were first opened here in the 1990s, charter schools have proven to be innovative game-changers, helping to improve student success and open new doors of opportunity—particularly for children of color and those living in poverty.
No matter their background, all children have potential. It’s the responsibility of schools to teach every child and to have high expectations for every student to meet and exceed. I learned that lesson firsthand in my mother’s after-school tutoring program—and I saw it in action in my visits to many charter schools that are helping to narrow the achievement gap. Naysayers often claim that school quality can never combat poverty’s effects, and I of course agree that anti-poverty programs and wraparound community services are extremely important, but Massachusetts charter schools show that poverty is not destiny in education. High-performing public charters are one more proof positive that, as President Obama says, “the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.”
Massachusetts charter schools show the nation what is possible when education leaders put children first. Moving forward, advancing educational opportunity for all kids will require keeping what works for children at the center of the conversation. While adults argue about adult issues and interests, more than 30,000 children remain on waiting lists for high-quality public charter seats in Massachusetts—and a shot at a brighter future.
Far too often, the chief beneficiaries of high-performing charter schools—low-income families and children—are forgotten amid divisive political controversies over funding and the hiring of nonunion teachers in charter schools. The parents and children who are desperately seeking better schools are an afterthought, and their needs take a backseat to special interest politics.
It doesn’t matter to me whether the sign on the door of a school has the word “Charter” in it, and it doesn’t matter to children or parents, either. The only thing that matters is if a school is giving every student who walks in the door the quality public education he or she needs and deserves to succeed.
In Massachusetts, it’s clear public charter schools are part of the solution, and must be expanded again.

To the editor:
A November 1 editorial in The Crimson urged students to vote in favor of Question 2, a ballot initiative which would allow the state of Massachusetts to approve 12 additional charter schools per year. While The Crimson rightly notes that “much more work is needed to make Massachusetts’ education system truly equitable,” Question 2 would devastate Massachusetts public schools, and citizens should vote it down next Tuesday.
As the editorial mentions, “opponents of Question 2 have focused mostly on their potential cost,” and it’s easy to see why. This year, charter schools will be granted more than $450 million in aid that would have gone to public schools, and estimates suggest that approving Question 2 could put public schools roughly $100 million further in the hole. That means less money for textbooks, teacher pay, and less support for special needs students. The editorial also mentions that additional charters would be placed in higher-need districts, but this would be a bug, not a feature: offering a small minority of students a better education while even further damaging underprivileged schools’ finances is not a solution.
Charter schools come with a litany of other concerns. For one, they are not accountable to voters through school board elections, a point left unaddressed by The Crimson’s editorial. The editorial board also ignores charter schools’ overreliance on disciplinary action: while charter schools comprise just 4 percent of Massachusetts public schools, they represent nearly 14 percent of schools with suspension and expulsion rates over 20 percent. Far from helping underprivileged students in Massachusetts, passage of Question 2 would strike a blow to public school funding and accountability, all while over-disciplining students. On November 8, vote no on Question 2.
Sincerely, 
Henry S. Atkins

At this point, the Asian-American family sitcom Fresh Off the Boat is pretty old news. The show came out three years ago, garnered a lot of critical acclaim, and generally did better than you might expect a show with an all-Asian American cast to do. More interesting than the show itself, however, was the emergence of the man behind the show—or, rather, the man behind the critically acclaimed memoir behind the show. His name is Eddie Huang, and he is a loud, somewhat vulgar ex-lawyer-turned-celebrity-chef who loves hip-hop, sneakers, and authentic Chinese food. When Eddie Huang became famous, people called him the representative of a new wave of Asian Americans. Meanwhile, Eddie once said in a Slate interview that he prefers to refer to himself simply as a “big dick Asian.”
At first, it was a little difficult for me to relate. When Eddie Huang crashed the party, I was just a senior in high school, working diligently to become the best model minority I could be. At the time, I didn’t really have the bandwidth to worry about the things that Eddie wrote about: higher-order needs, like belonging and Asian self-actualization. And one evening, while I was with my family, one of his interviews came on the television and my parents clucked their tongues with disapproval. None of us knew what to make of him—this egg-shaped, verbally aggressive man who laughed way too loudly and wore clothes we’d never seen another Chinese person wear. Certainly no one in my entire extended family resembled this guy in any way. I considered the possibility that Eddie Huang was just too ahead of the curve for us to “get it,” kind of like when the first iPhone came out and it only had one button.
People who follow the show will know that two years ago, Eddie severed ties with Fresh Off the Boat, citing his frustration with the artistic direction that the show had taken. FOTB, Eddie told Vulture magazine, was getting way too “cornstarch.” And he was right. Sometimes after watching an episode I’ll think to myself, Wow, I wish my family was that boring and perfect.
Eddie’s next career move was truly astonishing: He started his own show, which was just about him rather than some made-up version of his childhood self, called Huang’s World—and he aired it on the VICE News Network. Huang’s World is a series of hour-long food documentaries following Eddie on his epicurean travels around the world—to London, Moscow, Detroit, Mongolia—and they’re all brilliant.
In one episode, Eddie travels to Chengdu, the city where I was born and to which I sometimes (begrudgingly) return at the behest of extended family. For context’s sake, Chengdu is a city in the south of China known mostly for being the site of the national panda conservatory. Growing up, my folks would always tell me that Chengdu was a good place to retire because it had 1) the best food, and 2) the most beautiful women in China. In fact, the humid climate and spicy local food is said to cause the “spiciness” of the women. That last bit, by the way, always struck me as a strange way to talk about people, as if they were grapes growing in Napa Valley. Anyway, Eddie’s hour in Chengdu was the most authentic representation of the city I had ever seen—more authentic, really, than many of the tourist brochures that the city itself produces. In one scene, Eddie eats pig brain tofu. Unbelievable, I thought, that this could be on television. It was the first time I’ve ever seen a show and thought, wow, this was really meant for people like me.
Regardless of what you think of his antics, there is no denying the fact that Eddie Huang is a man of integrity. His position as a chef is especially important when you consider the fact that the history of American Chinese food is just a history of immigrants pandering to mainstream tastes. They don’t want pig brain tofu? Fine, let’s just use chicken and pork instead and glaze it with so much sweet and sour sauce that it’s basically barbecue. Gradually, it dawned on me that Eddie Huang is, in fact, a hero of sorts, using his cultural authority to redefine the cultural space of Chinese food. More Yenching, less Kong.
In the “Shanghai” episode of “Huang’s World,” Eddie mentions that he can trace his ancestry back to the Hunan province of China, a region famous for producing many famous revolutionary leaders like Mao ZeDong. When I heard that, I found myself nodding along, thinking yes, that sounds about right.

Last week, the Harvard community learned about the “scouting report” produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team. This week, we discovered that the annual tradition of objectifying members of the women’s soccer team continued into 2016.
When the 2012 report was first exposed by The Crimson, both teams' coaches suggested that the culture of the men's team had improved since then. Sadly, this is not the case.
It is disappointing enough that the 2012 men’s soccer team produced such a report. It is even more disappointing, but perhaps not surprising, that the men’s soccer team has continued this tradition of objectifying, belittling, and demeaning their female counterparts.
The blatant sexism and predatory entitlement portrayed in the report is an egregious reflection on not only members of the team, but also the Harvard community. Therefore, we commend the administration’s swiftness in sanctioning the team and terminating their season. But this punishment, while significant for the athletes involved, is not sufficient. It is ending a season that is already drawing to a close. As a result, it does not do enough to disincentivize this behavior or punish the team members who were either actively involved in creating these misogynistic reports or who tacitly condoned the behavior.
Athletic teams, including the men’s soccer team, already receive educational seminars on sexual assault and sexual harassment. They know that what they are doing is wrong. We need a system of accountability to hold individuals responsible for their wrongdoing and provide real consequences.
In light of this need for individual accountability, we believe that the University must pursue further steps to ensure that the players understand the gravity of their actions. First and foremost, a formal and public apology addressed collectively to the women who were the subjects of this abuse and signed by the members of the men’s team is a necessary step of contrition, remorse, and healing.
An apology alone, however, would be far too little, far too late. Harvard should suspend the team indefinitely pending full-scale investigation of the program, students, and coaching staff. A deeper investigation is warranted, during which the men’s soccer team should remain suspended.
We also do not know whether the men’s soccer team is the only athletic team that actively engages in misogyny and sexual harassment. Therefore, the administration should conduct an investigation of the entire Harvard athletic program. Every athletic team should undergo a thorough investigation—and if evidence of abuse and sexual harassment is revealed, then the University should similarly suspend those teams.
Harvard must also determine whether current men's soccer Coach Pieter S. Lehrer can remain in his current role. In his initial comments about the 2012 report, he vowed to teach his athletes a valuable lesson, while current women's soccer coach Christopher P. Hamblin suggested that this predatory culture was a thing of the past. Clearly, the culture is just as toxic today as it was in 2012. We urge a further investigation to determine the extent to which the coaches and athletic department staff were aware of or complicit in these actions.
Finally, though the investigation conducted by the Office of the General Counsel was vital in revealing truths that the team itself was unwilling to admit, we also urge the administration to provide students with more information on how it was handled in the interest of transparency. Ultimately, such transparency would go hand in hand with the sunlight needed to root out the toxic culture of harassment encapsulated by these revelations. We applaud the University's decisiveness so far, and urge it to continue ensuring that these violations of our community standards are uncovered, addressed, and remedied.

On behalf of all of us at Harvard Men’s Soccer, we sincerely apologize for the harm our words and actions have caused women everywhere, and especially our close friends on the Women’s Soccer team. Our team has been blessed with the opportunity to know and learn from these incredible women, receive their unconditional support, and form with them some of the strongest friendships on this campus. In return, we hurt them with the things we said, in the form of the inappropriate scouting reports, and with the things we did not say, in the form of our dishonesty toward them, and for that we are very sorry.
We want to affirm that the scouting report did not and does not reflect our view of the members of Harvard Women’s Soccer or of women in general. The relationship we have enjoyed with their team to this day means the world to us, and we are deeply ashamed that it took a public revelation, a loss of trust, and damaged friendships for us to fully grasp the gravity of our conduct, for which each member of our team takes full and equal responsibility. No woman deserves to be treated in this manner; not our mothers, our sisters, nor our peers. We apologize to them, and to all those who trusted us, supported us, and believed in us.
Please do not misconstrue our silence up until this point as a lack of remorse on our part. Out of respect for the women’s team, who expressed their desire to focus on the remainder of their season, we postponed the release of our public apology so as not to burden them with further distractions. Now that the Athletic Department has decided to terminate our season, we feel it is appropriate and necessary to address the situation publicly. We accept responsibility for the mistakes and serious lapses in judgment that have led us here, and, in addition to accepting the sanctions from the Athletic Department, are shifting our focus toward the concrete actions we can take to address the fundamental issue of sexism in our community.
When our current coaches took over the program in 2013, they sparked a massive culture change, one in which it is paramount to hold each other accountable for our actions. These scouting reports, an inexcusable manifestation of sexism and misogyny on our part, persisted in spite of this culture change, and we must now hold ourselves accountable for them. Our coaches have also taught us to be open in accepting our mistakes and to always focus on the next most important thing—and the next most important thing for us now is to do everything we can to start rebuilding the trust and relationships we severed, while doing anything possible to help heal the pain we have caused Harvard Women’s Soccer, their families, and women everywhere.
To do so, we must first confront the issues of sexism and misogyny within our own locker room, so that we can take up the call issued by the women of the Harvard Women’s Soccer Class of 2016 to join them in combatting this sort of behavior. Starting with ourselves, all players on this team now commit our efforts to spur a cultural change that goes beyond the scope of our own team.
Over the course of the previous week, we have been devoting our attention to this problem as our top priority, and our meetings as a team and with University officials have yielded a few specific proposals to educate ourselves and to help others come to the same realizations that we reached without repeating our mistakes. We hope to guide conversation among the other athletic teams about sexism, and we ask for input from the community at large, openly welcoming and encouraging any and all constructive discussion of and collaboration with our efforts.
There are no excuses for our behavior, and all we can do now is take it upon ourselves to be an example of change for the better. Our apology comes from a place of optimism and a willingness to advance an agenda of gender equality that is in line with the relationships that we want to cultivate. We take responsibility for our actions, and we accept the consequences that come from them and now focus on what we can do to move forward. We wholeheartedly promise to do anything in our power to build a more respectful and harmonious athletic field, classroom, and Harvard community.
This op-ed was written by the members of the 2016 Harvard Men's Soccer Team.
Editor's Note:  Due to this apology's content and its relevance to the Harvard community, at the request of the team we allowed it to be signed by the team as a whole rather than as individuals.
—Nelson L. Barrette '17 and Ryan P. O'Meara '18, Editorial Chairs—Mariel A. Klein '17, President

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 3, 2016, at 10:54 p.m.
Harvard has cancelled the men’s soccer team’s season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the team’s season because the “practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.”
“As a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 men’s soccer season,” Scalise wrote. “The team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.”
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team created a “scouting report” of that year’s women’s soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvard’s team of lawyers, to “review” the matter.
“As I asked the OGC to undertake this, it had to be on a fairly short time frame because the season is proceeding apace,” Faust said in an interview Thursday. “I wanted a response that would be within the context of the team’s responsibilities representing Harvard and this athletic season.”
According to both Scalise and a statement from University President Drew G. Faust, members of the soccer team were not initially forthcoming about their involvement in the “reports.”
“The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard’s view that both the team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,” Faust wrote in a statement.
Faust wrote she “was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men’s soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.”
Faust also said Thursday that there have been preliminary discussions about whether or not this type of behavior takes place on other sports teams.
“I felt it was important to at least try to get some preliminary notion of are there people who know of other incidents, so the question has not been delved into deeply beyond the soccer team, but I have asked that it at least be raised as a question: is this wider spread?” Faust said.
Last week, when Scalise first saw the documents—which were, until recently, publicly accessible through the 2012 team’s Google Group—he said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both men’s and women’s teams to discuss the report, but added that any response should be internal to Harvard and “not a media thing.”
The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response will work to “further educate” the men’s soccer team specifically and student-athletes generally, according to Scalise. 
“Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior,” Scalise added.
Men's soccer coach Pieter S. Lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is "beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration.”
In a statement Thursday evening, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that he was “saddened and disappointed to learn that the extremely offensive ‘scouting report’ produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team continued through the current season.”
When The Crimson initially wrote on the lewd document from 2012, Khurana  did not respond to multiple requests for an in-person interview to view the documents, instead writing in an emailed statement that he was “always profoundly disturbed and upset by allegations of sexism.”
“As I was not Dean of Harvard College in 2012 and do not have knowledge of this particular email, I cannot speak to the alleged conduct of these particular students,” Khurana wrote at the time.
The six 2012 women recruits written about in the “report” responded to The Crimson’s initial story in a joint op-ed earlier this week, condemning the “report” but ultimately forgiving the men’s team for their actions. The op-ed drew praise from Scalise and many students over social media.
“We are appalled that female athletes who are told to feel empowered and proud of their abilities are so regularly reduced to a physical appearance,” they wrote.
Had the men’s soccer team competed and won in its game this Saturday against Columbia, it would have clinched an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.

First-time Harvard voters in the U.S. presidential election say this year’s controversial candidates have both motivated and dampened their enthusiasm to vote Tuesday.
Citizens must be at least 18 years old to vote, and, for many on Harvard’s campus, this year marks the first time they’re eligible to vote in a presidential election. Students can vote absentee in their home states, or can register to vote in Massachusetts. 
According to Institute of Politics Vice President Austin E. Sowa ’17, nearly 1,400 students registered to vote during the College’s online check-in process in August.
“Every single undergraduate was afforded the opportunity to register to vote or request absentee ballots in all 50 states through that process this fall,” Sowa said.
Joshua B. Kuppersmith ’19 said he is enthusiastic about voting for the first time because he believes it is his civic responsibility.
“I think it’s our duty as citizens,” he said. “This is our main chance to determine the future of our nation, and so we have to take advantage of that duty if we want to control the direction that our nation is heading in.”
In The Crimson’s recent election survey, just over half of survey respondents voting for Republican candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said their preferred candidate was trustworthy—52 percent and 56 percent, respectively. Some first-time voters said their lack of confidence in the candidates has affected their decisions.
“I think like at times I’ve rotated between the two candidates out of dislike for both of them,” Kanon F. Dean ’18 said. “I’m an independent voter, so I don’t think I’ve made up my mind yet.”
Jullian A. Duran ’18 also said he doesn’t have much enthusiasm for a particular candidate. Instead, he said, he feels an obligation to prevent a Trump victory.
"I’m not as motivated I guess to vote for Hillary as much as I am to vote against Trump," he said. "As a Hispanic male, obviously, and as an immigrant... there are issues I take with the things he says.”
While preventing a Trump presidency motivates some students, others, like Sarah K. Murphy ’18, voiced strong support for Clinton.
“I've always like thought well of Secretary Clinton,” she said. “There's a very clear divide between a candidate who cares about student issues, women's issues, making sure that the country works for everyone, and Donald Trump.”
With less than one week left until the election, voter registration has ended in most states, and Sowa said the IOP’s efforts are now focused on educating voters about the candidates and making sure students know where to vote on Election Day.

Affiliates of the Harvard Graduate School of Education gathered in Longfellow Hall Thursday at a storytelling event intended to bring strangers at the school closer with one another.
The hour-long event, called “Double Take: Stories That Make You Think Twice,” happens once a semester and provides a venue for performers to speak openly about their personal experiences and struggles, according to Matthew M. Weber, Director of Digital Communications Strategy and Preceptor of Education at GSE.
Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan began Double Take last year in an attempt to foster closer bonds between people working and studying at the school. Thursday marked the second-ever Double Take, which began last academic year.
According to Weber, who helped organize the event, Double Take creates an opportunity for people to tell their personal stories, and for audience members to see the storytellers in a different, more intimate, light. 
“It’s always thinking about how can a community be strengthened, and what it is that we can do as a community to get to know each other a little better and how that can allow our community to grow,” Weber said.
Earlier this semester, Weber and other colleagues set up a recording studio at the Education School, encouraging anyone who wanted to share their stories to come and do so. Speakers were then coached in storytelling skills, and eight were ultimately chosen to present their stories in front of a live audience Thursday afternoon.
Storytellers focused their narratives on difficult life experiences. These included suffering multiple miscarriages, dealing with a father’s stroke, and living with a physical disability.
One of the storytellers, School of Education student Adan Gonzalez, spoke about being the son of immigrants and his struggle to escape the inner city.
“When I was 12 years old, I started learning English and became a translator for my family,” Gonzalez said. “It was fun—I got to translate the bills my family could soon be evicted for.”
Ethan W. Smith, another School of Education student, shared a personal story of coming to terms with being transgender.
“This was a really unique opportunity to kind of just let the story drive itself, and that was really freeing for me,” Smith said.
Double Take is part of a larger initiative launched this year at the School of Education called the Visible, Open, Interactive Communication for Educators, or VOICE, program. According to Weber, the program looks to help Ed School students become better communicators in various forms, including in narrative storytelling.

At a lecture Thursday, Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow emphasized the benefits of resolving bioethical issues through mediation, rather than litigation.
Minow gave her speech at the Harvard Medical School’s annual George W. Gay Lecture, an event HMS describes on its website as “quite possibly the oldest medical ethics lectureship in the United States.”
The lecture, titled “Religion, Medicine, and Law: How to Heal When Values Conflict,” attracted an audience of roughly 100 people, from physicians and public health students to medical students and professors. The event took place in the Carl W. Walter Amphitheater.
Exploring various ethical debates regarding vaccinations, reproductive freedom, and physician-assisted suicide, Minow stressed that “attentiveness to religion matters even from a purely healthcare vantage point.”
She began by discussing Zubik v. Burwell, a 2016 Supreme Court case brought by a group of religious non-profits challenging the contraception coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. Minow called the case, which was ultimately sent back to the lower courts without a decision, a key example of the interplay between medicine and law, and an example of the justice system failing to resolve a bioethical issue.
“The court did what courts were not supposed to do; they didn’t decide and it remains unsatisfying,” Minow said.
Acknowledging that the judiciary cannot always resolve issues in which there are bioethical considerations, Minow stressed the necessity of mediation when there are “limited solutions in the judiciary.” She also highlighted that working through these issues generally requires a sense of humility.
Applause rang in the auditorium as Minow ended with a call to action: “Let’s break free of our compulsion to break unresolvable conflicts.”
One person in the audience said Minow presented unique views and new ideas.
“I find it fascinating, and coming from Liberia, and stepping in this lecture, I can bring some things back home,” Gloria Mason, a student at HMS studying bioethics, said.

Harvard’s upper crust and high-profile poltiicans celebrated the official opening of the Harvard Life Lab, a new biotech research and enterprise facility in Allston, with speeches and a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday afternoon.
Speakers at the crowded Harvard Innovation Lab event included University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. Massachusetts Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III and former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 also attended.
In her opening remarks, Faust said she found the “aims” of the start-up teams slated to matriculate at the Life Lab—goals ranging from faster DNA sequencing to targeted genome editing to better vaccines—to be “inspiring.” Harvard announced its plans to build the Life Lab in February of this year.
“Life, in short, will be better because of this space and because of the creativity it will spark and the students, faculty, and alumni it will bring together,” Faust said, addressing the nearly 200 Harvard affiliates and local residents who gathered in the i-Lab’s lobby.
The two-story, 15,000-square-foot Life Lab, which cost roughly $17 million to build, features 36 lab benches, fume hoods, tissue culture and microscopy facilities, a private faculty-in-residence lab suite, conference rooms, and co-working spaces to support team planning. The building is now Harvard’s third entrepreneurial center on Western Ave., sitting next to the five-year old i-lab and across the street from the alumni-focused Harvard Innovation Launch Lab opened in 2014.
Construction of the Life Lab, first announced in October, was made possible by a donation from Business School alumnae Judy M. and Stephen G. Pagliuca, for whom the space is now named. Both spoke at Wednesday’s opening ceremony.
Judy Pagliuca said she found the experience “very emotional.”
“I’m not going to use any big words here because I really want to bring this down to an emotional level,” she said. “When you make a donation like this… there’s really primitive feelings that spur you to do it.”
In total, 17 biotechnology ventures, representing eight different Harvard schools, will take up residence at the Life Lab in the coming months, and some have already moved in. Each company went through an intensive application process, which was conducted by a selection committee composed of Harvard faculty and administrators and biotech entrepreneurs.
Business School professor Srikant M. Datar, who helped lead the committee, said he was pleased with the results of its deliberations.
“We really could not have asked or hoped for a stronger cohort of scientists and entrepreneurs to be the first group of individuals to start at the Life Lab,” Datar said.
Walsh echoed Datar’s sentiments, but emphasized that nearly half of the groups had female founders–something he termed “an important stat.”
“We should have a clap for that,” he instructed the audience. “Hopefully that’s a sign of things to come in the coming weeks,” he added, referencing the upcoming presidential election on Nov. 8. His sentiment was met with loud cheers and applause.
Reflecting on the day’s events, Faust said she was optimistic for the future.
“The Life Lab represents some of our greatest hopes for what Harvard can achieve in the years to come,” Faust said. “We are all so pleased today and so very grateful to the Pagliucas for envisioning a future in which all roads lead to Allston.”

Harvard’s Title IX offices are responding to a sexually explicit document produced by the 2012 men’s soccer team, supplementing a separate review by the University’s Office of the General Counsel that ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the men’s soccer season.
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team produced a “scouting report” that ranked new members of the women’s soccer team based on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. Earlier this week, University President Drew G. Faust said she had instructed OGC—Harvard's legal arm— to “review” the report. That review uncovered documents similar to the 2012 “report,” which included explicit comments about having sex with the women. They continued after 2012, including in 2016.
Apart from the OGC review, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides is working with the College’s Title IX office to respond to the “scouting report.” 
“I have been in communication with Emily Miller, one of the College Title IX Coordinators, about this information learned about the ‘scouting report’ and we are providing support to Emily as we normally do when she receives disclosures and she is looking for input and guidance,” Karvonides wrote in an email.
In an interview Thursday, Faust differentiated between the Title IX office’s legal role and the OGC review, which focused on the culture among the athletes.
“I think it’s important to support our Title IX capacities, and that Title IX has a clear, legally mandated role. I wanted to make sure that they could execute on what their assignments are,” Faust said. “But I also thought there were broader questions that might not be legal in nature so much as questions of culture, value, expectations of athletes. Questions that might be specific to our understanding of student responsibility beyond simply what is legally mandated by Title IX.”
Harvard’s Title IX policy defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, graphic, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.” The University policy and procedures also mandates that administrators respond to instances of sexual harassment that it knows, or reasonably should have known, about.
The federal government continues to investigate the College’s compliance with Title IX in a case opened in 2014.

Some athletes and students expressed support for the University’s decision to cancel the men’s soccer team’s season in the immediate aftermath of a review from the Office of the General Counsel, which revealed that the team had produced a sexually explicit “scouting report” rating women on their perceived physical attractiveness in 2016.
“I think the school’s response is definitely justified because [the reports were] a horrible thing to do,” said  Jeanne Olivier ’19, a member of the women’s heavyweight crew team.
“The school needs to set an example that this type of behavior is just not tolerable,” Olivier said, emphasizing that she only spoke for herself and not her team. “Especially as athletes–not that we should be held to a higher standard–but you do buy into a sportsmanship agreement when you join a Division I team.”
Olivier said that in light of these reports, issues of misogyny in team culture have “definitely been on [her team members'] minds more,” adding that the leaders of the women’s heavyweight crew team have talked to underclassmen about being “proactive instead of reactive to these kind of issues.”
Maya M. Learned ’18, the captain of the women’s rugby team, added that while the news of the lewd report was “shocking,” she believes such behavior exists among other men’s teams. Indeed, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview with The Crimson that administrators have discussed whether or not this type of behavior takes place on other sports teams.
Learned said she had not seen similar behavior in women’s sports.
“Especially on the rugby team, we’re all about body positivity, and I think that’s true for a lot of sports,” Learned said.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student-athletes on Thursday that he decided to cancel the soccer team’s remaining matches because “Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior.”
Describing the decision to suspend the team as “self-explanatory,” Liz O’Leary, the head coach of the women’s heavyweight crew team, added, “I think what the athletic director has written sums it all up–I support his decision.”
When reached, some members of women’s basketball and softball teams declined to comment. Several members of the men’s squash, volleyball, football, and basketball teams also declined to comment.
Multiple other students applauded Harvard’s decision to suspend the team's season, including Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a co-organizer for anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better.
“We were really glad to hear the news. This is one of the first times that we’ve seen Harvard take significant and immediate action in response to a case of sexual harassment or sexual violence in a way that was very visible,” she said. “So we absolutely think this was the right decision to make; there was clearly a dangerous and problematic culture on the men’s soccer team which needed immediate intervention.”
“It seems like they’re taking the problem seriously since they found out the behavior has still been going on,” Matthew H. Shaw ’20 said. “Ending the season now signals it’s a big deal.”
Goldberg said that while the decision was the right one to take, she felt that Harvard has more work to do in the future to address similar attitudes across its sports teams and the campus at large.
“We’re hoping that Harvard is going to be really sensitive to this incident as symptomatic of a larger problem and take more significant action,” Goldberg said.
Goldberg said she thought that, specifically, the University should hold individual team members responsible.
“I see no reason why individuals should not be held accountable. I think part of the message that we have the opportunity to send right now is that you don’t stop being culpable just because you’re part of an organization,” Goldberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia football (2-5, 1-3 Ivy) has won two games. In neither one did the Lions score a touchdown.
On Oct. 8, Columbia outlasted Wagner, 15-13. The Lions defense conceded a mere 12 first downs and held the Seahawks scoreless after halftime. Meanwhile, the offense totaled five field goals.
Two weeks later, Columbia beat Dartmouth at home, 9-7. Again the defense proved ferocious, limiting the Big Green to one third-down conversion on 17 tries; again the offense proved anemic.
“They’ve won two games like it was 1955,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They believe that they can gobble up receivers with their man coverage. And they’re good.”
Even in the grind-and-grit world of Ivy League football, the Lions defense stands out. The team tops the Ancient Eight in passing defense (193 yards per game), and senior linebacker Gianmarco Rea leads everyone in tackles.
In four of six weeks, Columbia has held opponents to fewer than 20 points. The Lions have done so through an old-school recipe: lots of man coverage spiced with occasional blitzes.
Everyone knows how the Columbia defense will play. The sole suspense lies in how the Crimson offense will respond—and whether that response will be enough to keep Harvard (6-1, 4-0 Ivy) in first place in the Ivy League.
“It’s going to be a challenge,” said sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley. “They have a lot of upperclassmen now…. I thought [Jared Katz] was one of the best corners in the league last year. He’s a real good player, and he’s back.”
As fearsome as the Lions defense has proven, the offense has proven equally feckless.
Every team in the Ancient Eight averages more than 20 points a game—except Columba, which puts up 13. Harvard has posted three times as many touchdowns (27) as Columbia (nine); in fact all Ivy League competitors have at least doubled the Lions’ touchdown total.
Look only at the Lions defense, and you wonder why the team hasn’t steamrolled teams. Look only at the offense, and you wonder why Columbia hasn’t disbanded its football team.
On Saturday, when the Lions visit Harvard Stadium, the Crimson will almost certainly find the end zone. The program has scored points in 185 straight games, and in 2016 Harvard averages over 29 points a game.
Moreover, the Crimson enters this weekend with an offense that, while still tender, looks as healthy as it has since mid-October.
After missing the Holy Cross game, Shelton-Mosley grabbed 12 passes for 159 yards in the last two games. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano remains mobile, and a trio of rushers—namely junior Semar Smith, sophomore Charlie Booker, and freshman Lavance Northington—contributed to a 194-yard rushing attack.
More uncertain is the state of the defense. Against the Big Green, the secondary conceded 296 passing yards over the final three quarters, allowing Dartmouth to wriggle out of a 14-0 hole to force late-game drama.
Columbia marks a major test for this unit—not only as a chance to erase memories of last week but also as preparation for next weekend’s matchup at Penn. Tied for first in the Ivy League, the Quakers possess a star duo in senior quarterback Alek Torgersen and junior wideout Justin Watson.
The Lions sport fewer downfield threats. Senior Scooter Hollis and freshman Josh Wainwright lead the receivers, but those two have combined for fewer than 80 yards per game.
Junior Anders Hill will quarterback the attack. The Boulder, Colo. native began the season as a backup to Florida transfer Skyler Mornhinweg (senior), but Hill took the reins in week three. Since then he has tossed for four touchdowns and four interceptions.
Columbia’s rushing attack is hardly more intimidating. Although the Lions run nearly 40 times a contest, the team averages three yards per outing—and now must face a powerful Crimson line.
“Our workload has been alleviated by the amazing play of the D-line,” sophomore linebacker Anthony Camargo said. “They make the jobs of the linebackers and the defensive backs a lot easier.”
Recent history suggests that viewers should expect a blowout on Saturday. Here are the scores of the Harvard-Columbia games from 2012 to 2014: 69-0, 34-0, and 45-0.
Last year, though, the Lions erased a 24-3 deficit to force a one-score contest. And given the tight championship, the Crimson has no margin for error.
“Think about this,” Murphy said. “We have seven practices left in our career as the 2016 Harvard football team…. You’ve got to have a sense of urgency.”

If it’s not about the size of the dog in the fight, then no one told this year’s Harvard men’s basketball team. On Thursday night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson capitalized on its size advantage to down Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 78-63. In what felt like a road game for Harvard, the Crimson started four players 6’5” or taller and rode the major height advantage to disrupt passing lanes and force 28 MIT turnovers.
The success on the offensive end was just what the doctor ordered to start the season following a 2015-2016 campaign in which the Crimson often struggled to find its scoring touch. Harvard’s freshmen showed promise, while its returners lent steady hands in limited action.
“Playing a lot of young guys, it’s fun to see where they are and we’ll see where we can progress and continue to grow,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “But it’s good for us to go against a team like this that’s pretty darn disciplined.”
Junior forward Chris Egi, starting in place of the inactive Zena Edosomwan, provided an exclamation point to begin the contest. Egi corralled a steal on the defensive end, dribbled the length of the floor, evaded an MIT defender, and threw down an emphatic two-handed dunk to put Harvard up 7-5. The Engineers never got closer.
The Markham, Ont. native could be an X-factor for the Crimson this season. A top recruit coming out of high school, Egi averaged 11.5 minutes per game last season but was a non-factor on the offensive end and struggled at the free throw line. However, if Egi can carve out a role in the crowded Crimson frontcourt, he could have a breakout season similar to the one Edosomwan had last season. His size (6’9”, 220) was on display against MIT, as the junior finished with 10 points and six rebounds in 22 minutes.
“I just thought he did a terrific job in a lot of ways for us, giving us energy, playing with a high motor,” Amaker said. “I think playing as a junior, being an experienced guy, that can help some of the younger players. I just thought seeing Chris develop as he has is very encouraging.”
Harvard got off to a hot start and jumped out to a 24-13 lead. Toward the end of the first half, the Crimson struggled to stop MIT, and the Engineers got the game to within six at halftime. As Amaker tinkered with different lineups, MIT was able to keep the game competitive but never got closer than seven in the second half. For the game, the visitors shot 46 percent from the field, but the high percentage was largely negated by 13 Harvard steals.
Harvard’s highly touted freshman class was thrown into the fire immediately on Thursday. All seven members saw action, with point guard Bryce Aiken flanking co-captain Siyani Chambers for much of the night, leading all scorers with 17 points.
“It’s been awesome,” Aiken said. “We’re both interchangeable. If he gets the ball out, I’ll gladly run the wing and vice versa. I think we’re very effective when we play together.”
Seth Towns, Robert Baker, and Chris Lewis all cracked the starting lineup and combined for 21 points and nine rebounds. Rookie Christian Juzang played 27 minutes and chipped in 14 points on the wing for the Crimson.
Both teams struggled with turnovers throughout the contest. The Engineers conceded 41 points off turnovers to make Harvard’s 11 turnovers look like small potatoes. Although the offense wasn’t always pretty, it was drastically different from the grind-it-out, slow-paced, half-court game that was the norm for Harvard last season.
The change was evident from the tip, as Amaker decided to start freshman Towns, a wing who is not afraid to penetrate defenses and let his jumper fly. Less than 10 minutes into play, the first-year converted an and-one reverse layup that brought the home crowd to its feet.
Chambers, one of the few Harvard members of the team’s expected core who logged major minutes on Thursday, was the workhorse that Harvard fans are used to seeing. The senior hit the deck early and often but showed no ill effects from the ACL injury that caused him to miss last season. In his first organized game in more than 18 months, Chambers had nine points and four assists, quarterbacking lineups almost exclusively made up of players with which he has never seen game action.
“I’m just very blessed to be back out here and play the game that I love,” Chambers said. “It felt really good to be back out there with my teammates and getting our first win.”
Co-captain Corbin Miller and junior Andre Chatfield did not enter the game, and sophomores Tommy McCarthy and Weisner Perez only logged a combined five minutes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 04, 2016 at 12:05 p.m
Before an Office of the General Counsel review into vulgar “scouting reports” produced by the men’s soccer team over the past several years resulted in the cancellation of their season, the 2016 team sat atop the Ivy League.
From a competitive perspective, the exposure of the team’s explicit annual tradition—a document rating freshman women’s soccer recruits on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance—comes at arguably the worst time for the Crimson. Because of the suspension, the team must forfeit the remainder of its regular season games–against Columbia and Penn–as well as any potential postseason play.
Going into the game against the Lions this weekend, Harvard had a 4-0-1 record and 13 points while Columbia and Dartmouth trailed the Crimson in second place with a 3-1-1 mark and 10 points.
A win at home against the Lions would have clinched at least a share of the Ancient Eight crown–the team’s first since 2009–and secured an automatic NCAA tournament bid.
In addition, Harvard is currently ranked 18th in the Top Drawer Soccer poll and 15th in the RPI, which the tournament committee uses for seeding purposes. With the top 16 squads in the RPI garnering a first-round bye and home advantage through at least the second round in the NCAA Tournament, a pair of victories in the final two games would likely have given the team the conference’s first top-16 seed since the Crimson was the 10-seed in 2009.
University President Drew G. Faust indicated that members of the soccer team had not been forthcoming when initially approached about the “scouting reports” and emphasized the gravity of their behavior.
“The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard’s view that both the team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,” Faust wrote in a statement.
Losing a prime opportunity is likely frustrating for Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer and the senior class. Since Lehrer took over the reins of the team in the fall of 2013, the squad has come close to winning the conference title each year, only to finish as runner-up and fail to make the tournament.
“We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” Lehrer wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.”
Despite a rough start to conference play following a 3-3 tie to Yale and a California road trip that saw the teams drop games to Stanford and Cal by 3-1 and 6-2, respectively, the team had been on a roll. The squad was undefeated in its last nine games, and had a five-game win streak on the road.
But the potential ramifications for the team don’t stop there. The suspension of the season could make recruits hesitant to commit to a program now-tainted by the lewd “scouting reports,” while current commits might retract their decision and opt to play at other schools. As of now, topdrawersoccer.com has four players commited to the class of 2021 and two commited to the class of 2022.
If Harvard were to impose restrictions on future seasons–whether it be postseason bans or an indefinite suspension–members of the younger classes on the team could potentially transfer to other programs, assuming no other disciplinary action prevents them from leaving the College. With the freshman class in particular playing impressively, there is likely to be a plethora of teams–including Ivy rivals–interested in potential transfers.
