After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an opening scene that would have felt more at home in an art house horror film, Lenny Beraldo (Jude Law), or Pope Pius XIII, emerges from a towering pile of curiously motionless human infants. At first, “The Young Pope”—with its unabashed opulence, excessive provocations, and obvious attempts at satire of the Catholic Church—feels like a gaudy melodrama designed to shock an undiscriminating viewer. However, its somewhat obvious wink at the audience makes the show more meaningful when one considers its real-world context. Within the first ten minutes, “The Young Pope” seems to comment on its own aggrandized existence by subsequently revealing a behind-the-scenes moment. The almost nauseatingly excessive camerawork, imagery, and choreography behind the infant pile emphasizes the show’s over-the-top nature. Thus begins HBO’s newest series.
“The Young Pope” arrives into a television scene rife with antiheroes. At first, Beraldo fades into the crowd. Over the first two episodes he has not revealed himself to be a master manipulator or politician in the style of Netflix’s Frank Underwood on “House of Cards.” He is also not a charismatic or sympathetic villain in any way that evokes conflicted feelings, like those who dominate HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”  He is more of a petulant child than a political mastermind, and it’s confusing as to how he was able to become this young pope—and how he will be able to maintain his role. That’s where the true significance of the show lies.
With regards to acting, Jude Law preens as Lenny Beraldo. His American accent sounds like that of a Hollywood diva with a forced affectation and his physicality is strutting and over the top. Beraldo is comically vicious. He is excessively rude, but not in any exceedingly original way. Yes, some of his quips are intelligent, but none are quotable or biting.They are just mean. After he's served his first papal breakfast (a mouthwatering spread of fruit, pancakes, croissants, and other delicacies), he demands a Coca-Cola Cherry Zero instead and verbally humiliates a doting nun who kisses and pinches his cheek.
Diane Keaton delivers a reliable performance as the enigmatic Sister Mary. It is clear that she is a mother figure, a guiding presence, and the first reassuring voice. The show adds another dimension to Sister Mary’s character when it is revealed she looked after not only an orphaned Lenny but another boy as well, and from their first interaction treated them very differently. In perhaps the most interesting moment of the show, a young distraught Lenny nervously calls her Ma and is reprimanded; he is only to call her Sister Mary. However, when the other boy arrives she insists he call her Ma. It will be interesting to see the role of Sister Mary in engineering the rise of Lenny.
It is in episode two that we finally find out what the young pope is made of. Devising a radical new marketing campaign for his papacy—a vast departure from the previous merchandizing strategy, but supported by the Vatican’s marketing head—Beraldo finally reveals some of the savviness that made him pope. Delivering his address ensconced in shadows and amidst thunder, Pope Pius XIII reveals a boundless conservatism. His delivery is just shy of throwing a tantrum and in an over-dramatic ending, a clap of thunder and lightning mark the end of his sermon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the earliest days of orientation, we hear murmurs about the mythical “comp,” Harvard’s trial by fire. The club fair buzzes with whispers about the relative difficulties of each club’s admittance process. Some clubs are more open about their comps' stipulations. Others, like the notorious Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, keep the particular demands of their comp more veiled. But whatever the demands, it is clear that the system for comping extracurriculars is broken.
A successful comp, one that results in membership at semester’s end, tends to value past experience in the club’s field at the expense of current interest. In extracurriculars that encompass all kinds of debate, performance, and writing, there is a persistent and insidious bias against newcomers. Comps often presume a preliminary understanding of the conventions of each club’s particular genre. For example, to join an improv troupe, you should probably already know about improv’s golden rule: “Yes, and….” All of these fields have unwritten rules. Even if you don’t know the exact format of a staff editorial, I found the Crimson editorial comp to presume a working knowledge of newspaper staples like graf format and academic tone.
But one might be inclined to argue that past experience goes hand in hand with interest. One might assume the most experienced members of a comp class are also the most interested and enthusiastic. But it is important to acknowledge that experience is often determined not by interest, but by opportunity. The comp process puts too much weight on the accident of your high school background, like whether, for example, your school had a mock trial team or a musical instrument requirement, and not more intangible features like curiosity in a field.
Comping community service organizations is particularly restrictive. It serves only to cap the number of participants in a field that desperately needs more. One would be hard-pressed to argue that a group serving Cambridge’s homeless population at the Phillip Brooks House or Boston children with learning disabilities would be unhappy with more participants.
Finally, if you’re comping a business staff position, you better be ready to pay to play. Stratospheric ad sale benchmarks at a lot of organizations are nearly impossible to meet without having the means to exploit a network of past family connections. Either that, or you have to really be persuasive enough to sell local companies on ten thousand dollar ads in a student publication—in which case you probably should not be working for free. Furthermore, business staffs of some of the more selective organizations have a perverse incentive to keep you comping. As long as they know you are still interested in joining the club, they will keep you fundraising aggressively. In this broken system, the compers are the engine that provides the cash.
Comping makes trying new things prohibitively hard. A new interest or passion can seem either too unavailable or intimidating in college if accompanied by a comp. Instead, you might be tempted to select the safest comp. And while you’re at it, you will probably relinquish your creativity and follow the prescribed set of comp requirements to the letter. Rather than mandate a comp that filters by skill, clubs should be more inclusive at the onset and filter by participation and improvement. Clubs should give everyone a foot in the door and distribute the burden of the work more evenly between compers and members. Instead of promising compers that things will get better, they should offer a process that engages and rewards interest.
Here at Harvard, we’re often too driven by an unending quest for exclusivity. For many incoming freshmen ready to “comp,” it seems as if Harvard is not selective enough. In this atmosphere, some clubs insist, against all common sense, that comp does not stand for competition. This comp mindset demands that students strive to be the elect, the chosen few. But, in reality, a toxic fight for membership leaves nobody better off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, a coalition of Harvard student activists gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall and presented a list of demands to University President Drew G. Faust, calling upon Faust and the rest of the Harvard administration to “embark on a course of action that upholds our community values in the face of a new political reality.” This “Inaugurate a New Harvard” event, co-sponsored by Divest Harvard, the Harvard Islamic Society, Our Harvard Can Do Better, Student Labor Action Movement, Act on a Dream, Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard, Ethnic Studies Coalition, and Concilio Latino, demonstrates collaboration from a range of student organizations. We commend the intersectionality and the turnout from different student groups at this event, and hope that this sets a precedent for the role student organizations should take in facing the Trump administration, especially given the limitations that University administration has in taking direct action.
Many Harvard students have expressed their concerns about Donald Trump, both before and after the election and subsequent inauguration. Student activism to protect the rights of themselves and their peers is encouraging, and we encourage more students to take an active role in confronting significant problems that may continue to arise during the Trump presidency. Because students are not bound by stricter policies like the University as a whole is, it is critical that Harvard students continue to show their support and advocacy in the months to come.
Despite the University’s limitations, we recognize that Harvard has already taken some steps to tackle the problems that may endanger students during the Trump administration. Most notably, the University administration has taken significant steps to protect its undocumented students. However, the administration’s initiatives have often been more political and, as a result, lacking in tangible results. More should be done to directly reassure students that feel targeted by Trump’s policies. For example, Harvard can take more immediate, actionable steps instead of deferring to committees, and go forward with proposals put forward by previous reports. This would be much more productive than bringing together yet another group of students and faculty to discuss issues when there are proposals available that simply require action.
Knowing that Harvard must be tactful in forming its public positions, we are hopeful that the University will hold itself to a higher standard internally, starting by appointing a new Title IX officer that will "remain committed to Title IX enforcement independent of national political change," as Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, expressed.
Additionally, even with these constraints on public appearance, Harvard needs to prioritize the mental and physical well-being of students. Harvard admits students of all backgrounds and identities, and it is the University’s responsibility to protect them. It is important that Harvard upholds this duty so that unnecessary burden is not placed on its students. A failure to protect students is a failure to protect the diversity on our campus.
In the face of the Trump administration, Harvard students and administrators alike must take action to ensure the safety of all students on campus. While the University administration's public restraint is understandable and has its merits, students cannot be activists alone. Taking responsibility and initiative on all fronts will be of paramount importance to meet the challenges of the Trump era.

A fashion statement that takes guts: Wearing my coat inside out.
A statement about fashion: Daring to wear what takes guts is always in style.
A story: When an unexpected package arrived from my godmother, I knew it held clothes. Opening this box to find a few of my fashionable godmother’s castoffs felt like receiving presents on Christmas. The most exciting item inside was a faux fur coat that didn’t fit her right. One problem: It didn’t fit me right either.
I was crestfallen. This coat was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Every detail was unique. My favorite feature was the lining: fabric printed with an artist’s pencil-sketched portraits. I wanted—maybe needed—to wear it around New York City. It was too big in all the wrong ways, but I saw this as a challenge. I was determined to make it work.
It was my mother who had the epiphany: “Turn that coat inside out.”
Somehow, the coat fit like a charm. And though it was attention grabbing in its original form, it was even more so now. It was the kind of coat people would have an opinion about. Likely, many would think it bizarre. To be frank, that frightened me a bit.
This is hard to admit. I like to think of myself as someone who doesn’t let others’ opinions get in the way of my happiness. I’m proud to march to the beat of my own drum. I look for ways to be different. I live in fear of following trends—fashion-related and otherwise—and becoming just another cookie made out of the same mold as a million other girls.
But standing in my room, cloaked in pencil-drawn faces and faux fur, faced with the real possibility of stepping outside in that getup, my instinct was to worry about what people might think of me.
The fact is, that’s human nature. We’re hardwired to seek validation from others. And in many instances, caring about what others think of us is healthy. Though we shouldn’t judge our worth based upon our bone structure, body shape, or any other physical characteristic that is out of our control, it is healthy to keep in mind the opinions of our dearest friends and allies when considering what type of person we want to be.
And that’s where outfits come in—we construct them to reflect our personalities. There’s more to an outfit than meets the eye. Sometimes, there’s a story behind a coat; there are conversations between mothers and daughters, styling sessions amongst sisters, and pep talks in front of mirrors.
In these instances, a compliment is not superficial; it’s a way of validating a gal’s willingness to experiment with the clothes in her closet. In this case, to compliment a woman’s coat is to reward her for taking a risk. It acknowledges the strength that it takes to feel vulnerable in public. In these instances, to love the coat is to love the gal wearing it.
It’s easy to think about fashion and all of the discussion that goes with it as meaningless, looks-driven, and shallow. True, the industry is a multi-million dollar machine that makes money by telling us how we should look. True, marketing departments try to convince us with each new season that our clothing isn’t hip anymore, and that we need to buy their product to be cool or successful or trendy or some other desirable quality. Yes, it’s true, many of the compliments we give each other about clothing are dull, and mainstream media seems more impressed by models’ thin bodies and Kardashians’ expensive purses than I think they should be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wednesday’s announcement that a historic policy set to penalize members of single-gender groups could be “revised or replaced” has left some students hopeful that the sanctions will change—while still others are calling on the University to stay its course and limit the influence of the organizations.

In emails to College and Faculty affiliates Wednesday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that a new committee—comprised of faculty, students, and staff—will be tasked with studying “whether the policy can be improved, either by changing aspects of its existing structure or through some broader revision.”
The original policy, slated to take effect with the Class of 2021, would bar members of final clubs, fraternities, and sororities from holding leadership positions or receiving College endorsement for fellowships. With Wednesday’s announcement, though, a revised or entirely new policy could be approved by University President Drew G. Faust in the fall of 2017.
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18—who criticized the existing sanctions throughout their campaign—praised administrators for including more student and faculty opinions on the new committee as they reconsider the College’s policy.
“For such an important policy, wherever the cards fall—if they do fall in the end—it’s important for us to include as many voices as possible,” Khansarinia said.
Madeleine L. Lapuerta ’20 took a similar view, writing in an email that “the previous proposed sanction on single-sex organizations lacked necessary specificity in order to truly target and attempt to abolish the atmosphere of sexual assault on Harvard's campus.”
“I am glad that its detrimental broadness has been recognized and, as a result, that the sanctions could be positively altered,” she added.
Davis Lazowski ’19 said there was “room for improvement” in the original policy, but added that he believed “there needs to be some changes to the final clubs,” and “would be very disappointed if that didn’t happen.”
In a November survey conducted by The Crimson, more than 53 percent of surveyed undergraduates reported an unfavorable view of Harvard’s current policy—compared to the 26.1 percent of respondents in favor of the sanctions.
While students generally discussed possible changes the new committee may recommend, Harvey A. Silverglate, an attorney and member of a legal team advising the all-male Fly Club, called the formation of the committee a “pernicious procedural trick.”
“It’s a classic example of a situation where the administration has changed the appearances but not the substance,” he said. “I’ve looked at it, and turned it upside down and inside out, and every time I look at it it says the same thing to me: ‘we’ve decided this, but for window dressing we’re going to give the faculty and students a role. But that role will not change what we do.’”
In the email announcing the new committee, Khurana wrote that administrators “take seriously the call from members of the Faculty to have further input into how the University should best solve the problems presented by the USGSOs.”
“We will also ensure that the Faculty has the opportunity to comment on the committee’s report before any recommendations are conveyed to President Faust,” he wrote.
Calling the original sanctions “an important step forward,” Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 said the new committee “seems kind of like an unfortunate backsliding.”
“However, I do see this as something that is not fully determined,” she said. “It seems they’re trying to revise the policy but not necessarily eliminate it, so I’m hopeful it will somehow manage to go forward.”

With a cruise down Massachusetts Ave. in a Bentley convertible, Hasty Pudding Theatricals honored Octavia L. Spencer as its 2017 Woman of the Year Thursday.
Spencer, who has appeared in films including “Insurgent” and “The Help,” was recently named an Oscar contender for her supporting role in “Hidden Figures.” At Thursday’s celebration, Spencer was honored with a parade through the Square and a roast in Farkas Hall, accompanied by Pudding cast members in costume.
At the roast, Hasty Pudding Theatricals president Guan Chen ’17 and vice president Daniel S. Milaschewski ’17 praised Spencer for hosting a free screening of “Hidden Figures” for low-income families in Los Angeles, Calif. earlier this month.
The roast turned playful as the actress was asked to throw a pan full of chocolate pudding—dubbed a “poop pie”—at a cast member dressed as President Donald Trump’s advisor Kellyanne Conway, parodying a scene from “The Help.”
“We have a new president, and I’m waiting for him to demonstrate that he will be president of all of us of these United States, so in that moment of levity, I enjoyed giving her the pie,” Spencer said. “She’s a woman and she needs to understand why women are speaking out in fear of some of the rights we have already litigated being revisited.”
Spencer, a Montgomery, Ala. native, later tackled a rowdy Pudding cast member dressed in University of Alabama paraphernalia to the ground.
“I think my thighs are going to hurt for a while,” Spencer said following the skit.
Following the roast was a live-streamed press conference—available to the public for the first time this year—where Spencer addressed several questions on diversity in Hollywood.
“I want to see diversity in film, and when I say diversity, I mean I want to see women of all shapes and sizes, people of all shapes and sizes, and people with disabilities,” Spencer said. “It is about creating a landscape that demonstrates what our society is as a whole and I think Hollywood today is not conducive to what we see around us.”
The actress was later given the traditional “Pudding Pot” as well as a $25,000 donation courtesy of the Hasty Pudding Institute to the charity of her choosing.
“I have had many honors but this touches me in so many ways,” Spencer said. “I love that everything here is steeped in tradition and it just makes me smile.”
Devon Gunter ’20, who attended the parade, said he was inspired by Spencer’s character in “Hidden Figures.”
“It’s really amazing that she is able to come here and be celebrated in this way,” Gunter said.
The Hasty Pudding will honor actor Ryan Reynolds as its 2017 Man of the Year Feb. 3.

While music fans are snatching up tickets for this spring’s Boston Calling—held for the first time at Harvard’s athletic facilities across the Charles—some Allston residents are worried about the foot traffic the music festival will bring to their neighborhood.
The Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee held a meeting Wednesday at Honan Library to discuss concerns about the upcoming music festival, which will take place from May 26 to 28 along North Harvard St. in Allston. Previously, the music festival has been held in Boston’s City Hall Plaza twice a year, in the spring and fall.
Allston resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 said in an interview that he was concerned about the musical festival—which has drawn more than 20,000 attendees in previous years—moving to Allston.
“Bad things happened when it was downtown, not terrible things, but a certain amount of rowdy stuff on the periphery,” he said.
Edward G. LeFlore of CSL Consulting, who represented Harvard at the meeting, said that Boston Calling is working closely with the car-sharing service Uber to develop an efficient system for transportation that weekend.
On weekdays, a residential parking pass is required to park on some streets in Allston. Allston residents said that they would like to see residential parking extended into the weekend of Boston Calling to prevent overflow parking in their neighborhoods.
During the annual Harvard-Yale football game in November, some Allston residents said they were frustrated by the congestion on their neighborhood streets.
“I was on my driveway and not able to pull out for over ten minutes. I don’t want this to happen again,” said Joyce R. Radnor, an Allston resident who attended the meeting, about Harvard-Yale weekend.
In addition to the crowding, Allston residents said they were also concerned about safety during the festival.
“We don’t want people coming in the middle of the night, at 1 a.m., drunk, to retrieve their cars,” said Radnor.
Whelan echoed Radnor’s safety concerns, but said those concerns do not necessarily mean that hosting the Boston Calling in Allston is a “terrible idea.” He added that he could be interested in attending the festival’s film showcase curated by Harvard alumna Natalie Portman ’03.
“Whether they can deliver, we won’t know until it’s over,” Whelan said. “If they put reassurances in place and back them up, they should get a chance to do it once, and if doesn’t work, we’ll never do it again,” he continued.
LeFlore said communication with Allston residents will be key in Boston Calling’s next steps as the festival’s organizers figure out logistics.
“We all know that if they hold this [music festival] against the will of the neighborhood, it’s not going to happen again. And this is something that they want to bring back year and year again in the future,” LeFlore said.

Renovations to Winthrop House—including the five-story Beren Hall addition—will be completed ahead of schedule, enabling all residents to move back to the House in August 2017.
Winthrop’s Gore and Standish Halls, built in 1914 to to house freshmen, have been under construction since summer 2016. Beren Hall, named for donor Robert M. Beren ’47, was originally expected to open after the rest of the House.
According to Winthrop House Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson, the early completion of Beren Hall will eliminate the need for overflow housing in the DeWolfe St. apartments and allow all students to live in the House next fall.
“This will be the first time that all of Winthrop House, our entire community, will be under one roof,” Robinson said. “We, personally, are thrilled with that.”
Housing all Winthrop students was a key component of the House’s original renovation plan, according to Steve Needham, Harvard’s senior director of project management.
Gigi M. N. Kisela ’17, an intern for Harvard’s Planning and Project Management Department and Winthrop House resident, became involved with the House’s renovation last summer. She said she is most excited about Beren Hall, the House’s new residential building composed entirely of suites with in-suite bathrooms.
The building will also feature a rooftop terrace, a fitness center, student cafe, two-story grille, and a student lounge called the Lion’s Den, according to Robinson.
Winthrop is the fourth upperclassman House to undergo renovations as part of the Harvard’s ongoing House renewal project and the second to be fully renovated after Dunster House, which reopened in 2015. In total, administrators estimate House Renewal could cost upwards of $1.3 billion, though the early completion of the Winthrop project will save Harvard an estimated $750,000.
Although the Faculty of Arts and Sciences surpassed its $2.5 billion capital campaign goal in June 2016, fundraising for House Renewal has lagged behind other areas. Furthermore, in the wake of low returns on the University’s endowment, House renewal has depleted FAS’s unrestricted reserves to “effectively zero,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in October.
In the past year, University administrators have had to consider new strategies to raise money for the project, including allowing donors to name spaces in the Houses of their choosing and endow faculty deanships.
Lowell House is slated to be renovated next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election, Harvard affiliates have voiced concerns about his stances on a number of issues, including immigration, federal research funding, and climate change.
But some alumni and tax experts say that Trump’s administration could affect another important—if less public—aspect of University affairs: charitable giving.
Harvard is in the midst of a capital campaign that has raised more than $7 billion, breaking higher education fundraising records. But some experts say that Trump’s policies could remove some tax incentives to donate. The Tax Policy Center estimates the changes could result in 4.5 percent to 9 percent less charitable giving—equaling $13.5 billion to $26.1 billion.
Experts say the coming changes also prompted a surge in donations to organizations across the country before the end of 2016.
“There’s potentially major changes in the tax code coming in 2017 or 2018,” Michael T. Kerr ’81, the co-chair of the executive committee of the Harvard College Fund, said, adding that donors could be thinking, “I might be better off giving that gift in 2016.”
He said that December of 2016 was a particularly busy fundraising month for Harvard. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard received more than $1 billion in gifts, according to the University’s financial report.
“A lot of the actual cash and stocks and gifts actually flow to Harvard during the month of December. Especially this year in particular,” Kerr said, although he also said the increase could be “just a fact of where the campaign is.”
Trump’s tax plan, which he first proposed in September, would cap itemized deductions—which include mortgage interest, state income taxes, and charitable donations—at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples. Potential changes also include repealing the estate tax, raising the standard deduction so that fewer people itemize deductions, and lowering the income tax rate.
Tax experts say these changes could affect an institution like Harvard. Many called the itemized deductions cap in particular a potentially substantial change.
“In a campaign for a university like Harvard, those are low amounts for major gifts,” said Victoria B. Bjorklund, a former partner at Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP who has represented hundreds of donors and charitable organizations. “So I think that would be disturbing to major institutions that are conducting capital campaigns.”
Marc J. Bloostein, an estate planner and a partner of the firm Ropes & Gray LLP, said he noticed an increase in donations at the end of 2016 that stem from concerns about Trump’s tax plan.
“We did see significant amounts of charitable giving between the election and the end of December,” Bloostein said.
Harvard Law School professor Thomas J. Brennan, who teaches tax law, said he thinks the proposed changes could affect high income individuals, but not the “Warren Buffetts and Bill Gates” of the world.
“The people who are itemizing—aren’t extremely wealthy but are well enough off and generous—are the ones whose behavior will be most affected,” Brennan said.
Patrick McKiernan, a Harvard spokesperson, said that the University is paying attention to the proposed tax changes.
“The University is following these issues closely in Washington, but it is still early in the process and there are few specifics available on the scope or direction of changes,” McKiernan wrote in an email, adding that the end of a calendar and fiscal year “tend to be busy times.”
Some other donors to Harvard said that changes in the tax code will not play a major role in shaping alumni decisions to give to the University.
“It will be a factor. I don’t think it will be a big factor. Because the human motivations are still there,” Paul J. Zofnass ’69 said, referring to donors’ desires to improve the University and the world.
Other donors agreed, arguing that University’s fundraising priorities are more important than any tax break.
“Certainly speaking for myself, I don’t give money to Harvard or anywhere else because I get a tax deduction for it,” Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said. “In fact, many people give money way beyond what they can get a tax deduction for.”
Buttenwieser said he considers potential tax code changes a “minor consideration.”
“One might accelerate a gift that one was going to give anyway I suppose, but I don’t think it’s a very important part of anybody’s thinking,” he said. “I have never seen any piece of information from Harvard saying ‘give now before the tax code changes.’”
Still though, experts said that tax incentives often impact a donor’s decision to give.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, members of a committee tasked with recommending how to implement penalties on members of single-gender social clubs received an email wishing them a happy new year.
The brief message, from committee co-chairs Douglas Melton and Kay K. Shelemay, informed them the committee was “moving toward a completed first draft” of recommendations for Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
But two days later, members of the implementation committee learned that their recommendations, which they had been working on for months, may not carry the weight they initially expected. Just minutes before Khurana announced the news to the school, implementation committee members found out that the policy they were working to implement could be “revised or replaced” by an entirely new committee.
“As we continue our work, it is important for you to know that the current policy will remain in effect, pending the assessment of this new committee,” wrote Shelemay and Melton in a Wednesday afternoon email to committee members.
“Dean Khurana has assured us that our recommendations will provide needed guidance for the current policy and inform the work of the new faculty committee as well,” reads the email,   obtained by The Crimson.
The new committee, comprised of faculty, students, and staff, will brainstorm how to improve the College’s policy—which, as it currently stands, would bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions and College endorsement for fellowships. The new group will submit its final recommendations to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, after which University President Drew G. Faust will review the potentially reworked policy.
Announcing the new body, dubbed “the Faculty Committee,” Khurana wrote that “we take seriously the call from members of the Faculty to have further input” into shaping the sanctions. The College’s policy has been dogged by criticism from a vocal set of faculty who have accused the administrators of skirting shared governance in crafting the original sanctions.
Though members of the committee were not notified of a potential change until minutes before Khurana’s announcement, Melton said Thursday he heard the news “probably in the last two days.” Melton said he was not involved in the formation of the new committee.
“I knew there was going to be an announcement, but I had no role in the creation of the committee,” Melton said. “And, to my knowledge, nor did anyone on the [implementation] committee.”
In an emailed statement, Khurana wrote that he “stayed in regular communication with the co-chairs of the implementation committee as I considered how best to respond to faculty members' desire to provide input on how the [single-gender] policy might be improved.”
Melton said that the implementation committee’s role was and remains advisory despite the new committee's potential influence on the policy. Any changes to policy resulting from the recommendations would require administrative approval.
“I would say more broadly that it’s possible that the recommendations of the implementation committee will not be accepted by the Dean of the College, or Mike Smith, or Drew Faust. We’re going to make recommendations to them. We don’t set policy,” Melton said.
Faust said the implementation committee’s work will still be valuable in potentially revising the sanctions.
“They’ve really done a lot of work and outreach, and collecting ideas so I think that this will build right on what they’ve done,” Faust said.
Daniel V. Banks ’17, a former Vice President of the Undergraduate Council who currently serves on the implementation committee, said committee members remain committed to completing the task they were initially assigned.
“What I will say is that the implementation committee was convened to get a job done, to talk about the intricacies and the logistics of adopting this policy,” he said.
“The implementation committee will continue to hammer out the details until told otherwise,” he added.
Melton said the implementation committee will deliver its recommendations to Khurana as planned, likely within a month. After Khurana reviews these recommendations, a version of the final report will be shared with the College.
“I am pleased with the progress the committee has made,” Melton said. “We’re not just sitting on our hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A record 286 women registered for sorority recruitment earlier this month, a slight increase from the 280 students who rushed last spring.
The heightened interest comes several months before a College policy penalizing members of single-gender social organizations, like sororities and final clubs, is set to take effect. Starting with the Class of 2021, the new policy will bar members of single-gender social clubs from assuming leadership roles in student groups and from receive College endorsement for fellowships. 
Months of administrative scrutiny of single-gender social organizations culminated last May when University President Drew G. Faust unveiled a new policy penalizing members of single-gender social organizations. In the wake of the policy, hundreds of women in final clubs and sororities rallied in Harvard Yard to protest the sanctions and the National Panhellenic Council issued a statement criticizing them. 
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Wednesday, however, that the sanctions could be “revised or replaced” by a new Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee tasked with improving them.
Halie C. LeSavage ’17, the president of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, did not say whether she thought rush numbers had been influenced by the sanctions. She also did not say how Panhellenic Council leaders would discuss the sanctions with members of next year’s rush class.
Greek life has expanded on Harvard’s campus in recent years—before 2011, rush class size averaged 150 women. Four sororities—Alpha Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Kappa Gamma—currently operate Cambridge chapters.
“Women in the classes of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 who participate in recruitment this spring would still be eligible for all benefits that come with membership in a Cambridge-Area Panhellenic sorority,” LeSavage wrote in an emailed statement.
LeSavage did not say whether any sororities had considered disaffiliating from their national organizations or going gender-neutral in response to the College’s sanctions.
The rush process will officially begin Saturday, and will end two days later on Monday, LeSavage said. “Bid day”—the day on which participants receive their offers from sororities, known as “bids”—will take place Feb. 1, she said.

Octavia L. Spencer is about to have a new award on her shelf, right up there next to her Oscar statuette and Golden Globe trophy.
Spencer was named the 2017 Woman of the Year by Hasting Pudding Theatricals Thursday afternoon, an annual award given to a performer who has made lasting contributions to the entertainment world. Spencer's performance as an actress in "The Help" earned her several awards in 2012, including an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award among others. Just a few days ago, Spencer was named an Oscar nominee for her role in "Hidden Figures."



The festivities began with a parade through Cambridge in a Bentley convertible, surrounded by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals members dressed in costume. The Woman of the Year award has been presented annually since 1951, making Spencer the 67th female entertainer to receive the award.



Following the parade, Spencer was honored with a roast in Farkas Hall. During the roast, Spencer was asked to mimic a scene from "The Help" by throwing a chocolate pie at a Pudding cast member dressed as President Donald Trump's advisor Kellyanne Conway.


Treated like royalty by the Pudding cast members, Spencer was awarded the "Pudding Pot." Spencer later lightheartedly said that, when compared to an Oscar, the Pudding Pot "was hard to get."

Following the parade and roast, Spencer took part in a press conference—broadcast live for the first time this year. Spencer spoke about topics ranging from diversity in entertainment to Trump's presidency.
"I don't think that men... are actively saying 'we gotta keep the women out," Spencer said, adding that women are instead simply often overlooked. "As a female who is African American who is also a producer, it's my job to make sure I voice those opinions." 
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals has been the subject of criticism for its decision to maintain an all-male cast for their annual spring production.
The press conference continued for approximately 30 minutes.

“It took me 15 years to become an overnight success. So know that you have to buy a good pair of sneakers and train,” Spencer said when asked about advice for women of color. 
“But if you stay in the game long enough, you will win… you will win a race. But the question is: will you be persistent at it?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each time the Harvard men’s hockey team sets course for Ithaca, New York, it’s safe to presume a proclamation from the Cornell Athletic Department is on the way.
“In advance of the game, fans are reminded that there is a zero-tolerance policy in place regarding bringing fish into Lynah Rink,” reads the AD’s statement from Thursday, one day prior to the university’s sold-out bout with the Crimson.
This ‘tough talk,’ presumably nothing more than a legal requisite, never ceases to amuse. Because anyone who knows a thing or two about Cornell hockey—Ithaca’s seafood suppliers in particular—knows exactly what to expect when Harvard comes to town.
Fish. Will. Fly.
It’s a tradition that dates back to 1963 and one that required a bit of provocation. But at the very least, that provocation provides a clear answer to (a slight variation of) the age-old paradox: What came first? The chicken or the fish?
Spoiler. It’s the chicken. At a Harvard home game 54 years ago, Crimson fans changed the course of hockey history, heaving dead poultry onto the ice in what was believed to be a dig at Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
Little did those rabble-rousers realize, they had triggered a war. Because the Big Red took the bait.
Beginning with a rematch less than a month after the incitement, every Harvard-Cornell contest held at Lynah since 1963 has famously featured the fish-flinging that has come to define one of college hockey’s oldest rivalries.
The goal of the Lynah faithful? Direct hits. Just prior to puck drop, all members of the student section—more accurately, the souls brave enough to smuggle seafood through the gates—rise to their feet when the enemy shows its face. Putting their precision and accuracy to the test, they then take aim at each member of the Crimson.
Yet, a plain text interpretation of Cornell’s latest advisory—one that’s been regurgitated for years—would suggest otherwise.
“The throwing of any object onto the ice before, during or after the game, or any other disruptive behavior, will not be tolerated and will result in ejection from the rink.”
Of course no one expects toleration from the administration, per se, but let’s be realistic. No one’s getting tossed—not for this anyway. In fact, a true fan would probably warn that you’re more likely to receive the boot for not following in the footsteps of the Faithful.
Besides, Cornell fans throw objects onto the ice before almost every game. Traditionally, members of the student section bring newspapers to peruse while the visiting team is being introduced by Cornell’s public address announcer. Once the introductions finish, the papers are tossed, but the hurlers are not.
Now, I’ll be honest. I don’t know how much there is to read out in Ithaca. So I’ll go out on a limb and say the bulk of these newspapers might be copies of The Cornell Daily Sun, the university’s independently run student publication.
Normally that fact would be superfluous, but this year, there’s a twist. On Wednesday, The Daily Sun ran a story revealing that Cornell’s aforementioned public address announcer, Arthur Mintz, is no advocate of the team’s rivalry with Harvard nor the fanfare that comes with it, much less the fish-flinging.
Therefore, if the Cornell crowd began gathering materials early enough this week, a heavy dose of irony could be in store for Friday night. As soon as Mintz finishes his Harvard introductions, there’s a chance the newspapers explaining his condemnation of flying fish could simultaneously find their way onto the ice right alongside—yep, you guessed it.
But irony aside, the truth of the matter is that Mintz is a member of the minority on this subject. And it’s not by accident. There’s simply no denying that the rivalry between the Crimson and the Big Red is good for Cornell, good for Harvard, and good for college hockey.
For one, these games give people a game to circle on their calendars. That goes for players, coaches, and fans alike. Heck, even announcers. As recently as 2012, NBC’s star broadcast team of Mike ‘Doc’ Emrick and Pierre McGuire was on hand to call the clash of these teams far above Cayuga’s waters.
Furthermore, things tend to get so wild inside Lynah that back in 2006, Cornell coach Mike Schafer, once a player for the Big Red, compared the “electricity” in the building when Harvard’s in town to that of what you might see when Duke and North Carolina go toe to toe on the hardwood. An article in The Crimson from 1988 made a similar claim, stating that “a Harvard-Cornell hockey game is as big and as boisterous as a Michigan-Ohio State football contest.”
Given where hockey currently stands on the totem pole of popularity within the world of college athletics, these statements may seem a tad ludicrous on the surface. But believe me: if you’re fishing for one college hockey game worth seeing and one venue worth seeing it at, it’s Harvard-Cornell at Lynah Rink.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not be unreasonable a generation from now to say that the direction of Ivy League basketball was determined by two men and two offseasons.
The conference has experienced extreme growth over the last decade, highlighted by the emergence of Steve Donahue’s Cornell teams and Tommy Amaker’s Harvard ones as legitimate mid-major threats. The level of play and the caliber of players in the Ivy League is the highest it has been in a long time. However, as the Crimson prepares to make its annual weekend roadtrip to New York to take on Cornell and Columbia, the conference stands at a crossroads.
Three Ivy League basketball programs have new coaches roaming the sidelines this season and half of the conference’s teams have a different head man than they did two seasons ago. Columbia, which won the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament last March, saw Kevin Smith leave to take the head job at the University of San Francisco. Cornell did not renew the contract of Bill Courtney after he posted a 10-18 record last season. Paul Cormier was axed from his second stint at Dartmouth. Donahue is now entering his second season at the helm for Penn.
The three first-year head coaches—Jim Engles at Columbia, Brian Earl at Cornell, and David McLaughlin at Dartmouth—represent the three newest members of what is becoming a conference coaching carousel.
The coaching changes highlight a separation that is emerging in the Ivy League. On the one hand, the conference is expanding the Ivy League Digital Network, sending its most marketable team to play a game in China, adding a postseason tournament to increase revenue and attract attention, and bringing in some of the most talented high school recruits the league has ever seen.
On the other, the eight teams’ facilities pale in comparison to many of their local rivals, let alone national powerhouses, against whom they are competing for recruits. While the difficulty of getting top-level athletes to Ivy League campuses has been overstated, Brown, the Killer C’s, Dartmouth, and Penn have struggled to attract players of the same caliber as the conference’s big three.
To put it more simply, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale have solidified themselves as the class of Ivy League basketball over the last five seasons while Brown, Cornell, and Dartmouth have emerged as perennial bottom feeders. The direction of the league going forward will largely have to do with the jobs that Donahue and Engles do at their respective schools.
Donahue is what you would call a splash hire, the biggest name an Ivy League program has poached since Amaker in 2007. Donahue is a perfect fit for the Quakers, a Delaware Valley native who served as an assistant under former Penn and current Temple coach Fran Dunphy. Donahue has a chance to crash the Harvard-Princeton-Yale party largely due to the Quakers’ tradition of winning (38 Ivy League championships) and his personal track record of success in the conference (three Ivy League championships and a Sweet Sixteen appearance at Cornell). Donahue went 5-9 in conference play in his first season and has 11 underclassmen on his roster.
While Penn appears to be on the right track under Donahue, the jury is still out on the job Engles will do with a Columbia program that has been trending upward in recent years but has had just five winning seasons since 1982. Smith proved that it is possible to win at Columbia (25 games and a CIT crown last season), but his departure for a program that last made the tournament in 1998 should be a red flag for Columbia and the conference as a whole.
If you want a coach who can win at a school with no tradition of winning, Engles is your guy. The Staten Island native took over an NJIT team that was finishing its transition to Division I in 2008. The Highlanders went 1-30 in 2008-2009. Four seasons later, NJIT was celebrating a Great West Conference championship. Engles won 20 or more games in each of the last two seasons.
Columbia is hoping that Engles is the right man to bring the Lions their first NCAA Tournament bid since 1968. He knows how to recruit from New York and will continue to draw from the nation’s largest metropolitan area. It doesn’t hurt that Columbia has been one of the city’s more successful programs in recent years, having won more games than Fordham, Seton Hall, and St. John’s over the past three seasons. Engles has five players committed for next year, with two coming from the New York metro, and his first recruiting class is currently ranked second in the Ivy by 247Sports.
Last season was a dream season of sorts for the top half of the Ivy League. Princeton and Yale were clearly the best teams in the conference and both had enough talent to make some noise come tournament time. Yale beat Baylor and gave Duke a game in the Round of 32. Princeton won 22 games and was a six seed in the NIT while Columbia brought home the CIT and Harvard beat Auburn, BYU, and Princeton during the regular season. The quartet went a combined 29-3 against the bottom half of the league.
As Harvard, Princeton, and Yale (the league’s preseason top three) are beginning to assert their dominance this season, the future of these programs will largely come down to Columbia and Penn. Amaker and Yale coach James Jones have been tied to head coaching vacancies at major programs across the country while Mitch Henderson of Princeton is only 41 years old and was a finalist for the Northwestern job back in 2013.
How long these coaches will stay at their respective schools could largely come down to the level of play throughout the rest of the league. Earl and McLaughlin could follow in the footsteps of Amaker, Henderson, and Jones and bring success to Ithaca and Hanover, while Mike Martin’s youth and allegiance to Brown make him as likely as anyone to turn around the Bears.
However, the fate of the Ivy League will ultimately come down to the Lions and Quakers. If the Ivy League can have five legitimate teams that each have nonconference wins against big-time opponents, the idea of a two-bid Ivy may not seem too far fetched. However, the conference has a long way to go. Currently, Princeton is widely seen as the conference’s best team this season despite its signature nonconference win coming against Bucknell.
Is Columbia’s ceiling a third place finish in the conference? Is Donahue capable of making people want to toast to dear old Penn once again? Ten, 15, 20 years from now, will we look at the past decade as the pinnacle of Ivy League basketball or will it have been just the beginning of the Ancient Eight’s emergence as a legitimate mid-major conference? The answer may come down to Jim Engles and Steve Donahue.
Now to the picks:
HARVARD AT CORNELL
The first thought that comes to mind with this matchup is its outcome just a year ago. In that showdown, Harvard played catch-up throughout the second half until a late floater from then-freshman Tommy McCarthy gave the Crimson the win. It would be among the lone bright spots in a lackluster season for Harvard.
Nearly a year later the two teams couldn’t be more unrecognizable. Harvard comes in led by a squad of freshmen that have led the Crimson to nine wins in its past ten games while the Big Red relies on a trio of sophomores in Matt Morgan and Stone Gettings. The second-year duo and senior Robert Hatter combine to average over 43 of Cornell’s season average of 73 points per game.
To make sense of this matchup, one only needs to look at the team’s matchups with Houston. The Cougars handed the Big Red a 30-point loss while Harvard took down Houston on the road in January.
Pick: Harvard
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
You could make the argument that Dartmouth needs to win at some point.
I, for one, will not. This is a team that lost its first nine games of the season. Sure, it has the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year in Evan Boudreaux, but sometimes teamwork really does make the dream work.
Before Big Green fans take up arms, let me say Columbia hasn’t had a particularly stellar season either. They come into Friday having split games against Cornell and more than anything the Lions are a team that only wins games that they’re supposed to win. Prime example: Dartmouth.
Pick: Columbia
BROWN AT YALE
Where to begin with this one. A week ago it would’ve been easy to call a runaway Yale win, but after beating the Bears by a only single point in Providence the Bulldogs don’t look like the favorites they once were.
I do think, however, that geography is important to consider here. New Haven is a town of about 130,000 people located in Connecticut. It’s sort of this gothic concrete thing located in between the much more aesthetically pleasing temperate deciduous forests that dot the Northeast. In some circles, it’s also known as a place you should avoid when traveling between New York and Boston.
Be it what it may—and unbeknownst to many—New Haven is also where Yale is located. From an objective standpoint it would seem a bit weird to attribute any kind of homecourt advantage to a place that couldn’t come up with a better nickname than “The Elm City.” Given the atypical student body, however, playing in New Haven might just be what the Bulldogs need to beat Brown by more than a point.
Pick: Yale
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
Undisclosed sources say that Columbia’s whole team from last season is gone.
I’ve looked into it and it appears that they still have a roster. So barring some unforeseen event, there will be a game on Saturday.
Truth be told, the Lions did lose some key players in Grant Mullins and Maodo Lo. Despite their departure, Columbia has managed to eke out some wins, but this is clearly not the Lions squad that won 25 games a year ago. In many ways, this matchup is probably the most indicative of how much the league has changed in the past year—with Harvard on the rise, this will be a tough one for a program that handed the Crimson two losses a season ago.
Pick: Harvard
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
Dartmouth’s motto is “Vox clamantis in deserto.” This translates into “a voice crying out in the wilderness.”
Pick: Cornell

It’s a new semester and a new opportunity to freak out over your course schedule, your relationship status, and of course, your summer plans. Maybe you missed the memo about recruiting season getting moved up to the fall, didn’t have much luck with your other interviews, or just like to tell people that you’re not a “corporate sellout” (yet!) Rest assured—there are still amazing summer opportunities available that don’t have “Goldman Sachs” in their title. As always, Flyby has you covered with our guide to your summer search:
If you’re a junior planning on writing a thesis, consider doing thesis research this summer. Whether you’re holed up in a library on campus or traveling the world, Harvard likely has some money for you to get a head start on the soul-crushing, mind-numbing experience that will take over your senior year. Sound like fun yet?
Believe it or not, it is possible to get an internship outside of OCS’s main recruiting program. Check out the IOP’s Director’s Internships (application due February 5th). Even if you aren’t politically inclined and don’t have IOP experience, there are Director’s internships at places like Facebook, NASA, and MTV, so take a look. If you want to venture further afield while still getting work experience, look into the DRCLAS internship programs in South America (also due February 5th).
Harvard also offers on-campus research programs for non-thesisers. If you’re interested in Econ and Business, check out PRIMO through HBS (application due February 22nd), and if social science research is up your alley, you should also look into BLISS (also due February 22nd). More sciencey types should look into PRISE (due February 14th). Harvard also has SHARP (due February 22nd) for humanities research, and SURGH (due January 31st) for global health. That is, if the cheesy acronyms haven’t turned you off entirely.
If you’re hoping for an enviable, insta-worthy summer, apply to study abroad. The deadline for Harvard’s programs has already passed, but there are summer programs available through other schools that you may be able to get Harvard funding for. Study Marine Systems in Turks and Caicos, Portuguese in Brazil with Yale (If you can tolerate a whole summer with the Yalies), or pick your program at Cambridge without needing a pesky Marshall scholarship.
If you’re hoping to travel but don’t want to pay for a study abroad program, consider doing a work exchange. Sites like Workaway and HelpX can help connect you with people in need of various odd jobs from babysitting to teaching English to picking grapes. WWOOF can connect you with organic farms in need of farmhands. In exchange for a few hours of work a day, you’ll usually get free room and some board, plus a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in another culture and break out of the Harvard bubble. After all, you’ll have the rest of your life after college to work during the summer...why not do something different? Trust us, you’ll be the only person in your seminar next fall who worked on a goat farm instead of in a cubicle.
