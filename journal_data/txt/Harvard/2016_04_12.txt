After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By any stretch of the imagination, “Rush Hour”—yes, the remake of the moderately successful 1998 film “Rush Hour” (with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, remember them?)—is mediocre television. It is thinly plotted. Its characters are barely sketches of stereotypes. Every aspect of the show is derivative to a fault. If “Lethal Weapon” and “Once Upon A Time in China” had an underperforming baby, which then had a child with a mediocre CBS police procedural, you would have “Rush Hour.” But somewhere along the way, in an affront to common sense, “Rush Hour” is vaguely enjoyable and, oddly, culturally important.
“Rush Hour” is, in short, a combination between a culture clash and buddy-cop procedural. It tries on a few hats—comedy fits moderately well. Kung fu fits very well. Plot, on the other hand, runs a bit small: Chinese gangsters steal rare artifacts recently shipped to Los Angeles. After a series of benign events, Hong Kong detective Yan Naing Lee is brought to America to investigate the robbery. Soon he is paired with the generically named black detective James Carter. Various inconsequential things happen for 60 minutes. However, CBS police procedurals are not necessarily interesting (or for that matter, widely watched) because of their well-developed and interesting plots. Compelling characters form the backbone of these shows; only an investment in the happiness of these characters keeps inherently uninteresting narratives from actually being uninteresting. “Rush Hour” has successfully built this backbone—while unfortunately omitting an emphasis on making this episode’s plot passable.
Replacing Jackie Chan and Justin Tucker from the original Rush Hour are Jon Foo, known for notable roles in the 2010 film “Universal Soldier: Regeneration” as “UniSol 2” and “Olympus Has Fallen” as “Stunt Performer,” and Justin Hires, whose most notable work came in Key and Peele, where he reprised his role of “Bystander #1” and “Friend.” Foo plays Detective Lee, written as stoic and unflinchingly rule-abiding, with the soul of a bureaucrat inside the shell of a martial arts master. However, Foo—despite his complete lack of serious television or film experience—manages to elevate Detective Lee past the show writers’ bleak stereotypes and into half of the stable and sympathetic core of “Rush Hour.” It is not that Foo is a particularly skilled actor; he often delivers lines woodenly, looks disinterested in many scenes, and unsuccessfully toes the line between his natural boyish charm and his stoic characterization. Yet his character—despite his own failures as an actor and the obtuse characterization his writers have saddled him with—is simply likable because, by sheer force of will, Foo makes us like Detective Lee.
Opposite Foo is Hires, playing Detective James Carter—a similarly thinly written character who manages to transcend the writers’ simplistic conception of him. What makes Hires’ performance important, however, is the context within which he is acting. Currently, police procedurals (save LL Cool J as James Todd Smith on “NCIS Los Angeles”) feature a dearth of likable black men. One of the most watched shows currently airing featuring a predominately black cast, “Empire,” is essentially a dressed up hip-hop soap opera. As with all soap operas, it highlights the misbehaviors of all its characters. “Rush Hour,” while a flawed show, is presenting an alternative and important vision of blackness. It is presenting a character who is likable and can actually be admired, a character who just so happens to be black.
No one was clamoring for the television adaption of “Rush Hour”; so the writers, very cleverly, have not attempted to replicate the movie on television. Instead, they have mined specific themes of the film that are a welcome break from the repetitiveness of police procedurals. Kung fu and comedy stand out from CBS’s other vanilla offerings. And now, more than ever, the cultural dichotomy explored in the film is particularly important to examine on television today. What more could be asked from CBS’s TV machine?

With a crowd of smiling faces surrounding him, Conan C. O’Brien ’85 brandished his Sharpie to sign the enlarged poster of his face that graces Mather’s Junior Common Room. While on campus this February for a public appearance with Drew Faust, O’Brien returned to his former House and met current students. He spoke teasingly about Mather’s relative ugliness and his roommate, who would celebrate a finished problem set by shouting the nonsense term, “Foom!” Though the few jokes he told were impromptu, the small crowd of people seemed highly entertained. This reaction is the kind of electricity professional comedians look for.
In a 2011 piece for The New Yorker, ostensibly dispensing advice for crafting late-night television, Tina Fey wrote, “When hiring, mix Harvard nerds with Chicago improvisers and stir.” But what would happen if you mixed Harvard nerds with Harvard improvisers? A quick glance at Harvard’s extensive humor-minded community reveals that Harvard is home to a bit more than academic wit. Students who pursue comedy with passion seem to bounce off one another, supplementing the universal appeal of a good joke by uniting economics and English concentrators. Though comedy entails a somewhat unconventional career path, Harvard graduates have entered the entertainment industry for years. What is new and original, however, is the current diversity of options for on-campus comedy. For a broader spectrum of comedians, Harvard abounds in opportunities to improve both written and stage humor. Aware as they are of the inherent status as Harvard students, comic artists here express true passion for their extracurricular interests. Comedians on campus are not inherently funnier than comedians elsewhere; they love comedy just as much as any other up-and-coming humorist. Harvard just happens to be the community through which they express that passion. They are organizing shows, dreaming up new joke concepts, and assembling fresh stand-up routines. Humor is entertaining, but entertainment is hard work.
Stand-up comics are generally considered solo artists, but like most art forms, comedy thrives in a communal atmosphere. Sierra L. Katow ’16, an active member of Harvard’s comedy scene, grew up outside L.A. Starting at age 16, she would often travel into the city to perform at shows, forming a personal attachment to the craft of comedy. “Comedians often like to think that their way of comedy is the way,” Katow says. “People think: ‘This is funny, and this is not. Some people are born with it, some are not.’ And I don’t believe in that. I think it’s really important to know that comedy is so contextualized by who you are and who other people are.”
For the first part of her freshman year, however, Katow found it difficult to understand her role as a comedian. After auditioning for several campus improv troupes, she failed to secure a spot in any group. But by joining other organizations like On Harvard Time and the Harvard College Stand Up Comic Society, she gradually determined how to work among Harvard comics. Now a member of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, she is highly visible as a campus comic, performing at events like the Lampoon’s roast of late-night TV mainstay Jimmy Fallon last semester.

Other students, however, arrive on campus with no professional experience in performing comedy. Julia N. Becerra ’16 professes herself to be such a student, stumbling upon OHT at Visitas four years ago and spending her first couple of semesters marching up to the Quad to OHT’s now non-existent studio. While becoming a correspondent for OHT requires an audition, the comp processes for writing, editing, and directing are relatively effort-based: members are never cut. “People are so intimidated when I try to get them to come,” Becerra says. “They’re like, ‘Oh everyone’s gonna be so funny and judge me if I’m not funny.’ [OHT members] literally don’t care. They are so surprisingly supportive of everyone.”
Along with her work for OHT, Becerra practices stand-up routines with the Harvard College Stand Up Comic Society.  Even though she admits struggling to balance problem sets with practice time, Becerra believes that the time she invests in her comedy skills is time well-spent. Katow echoes this need for consistency and determination. “There’s such a high standard here for people doing well right away,” she says. “The interesting thing about comedy is you have to work at it so long because you have to live your life. It takes so many years to find your voice and find your following. If you’re not able to get that when you’re 20, it’s okay.”
In addition to the exquisitely crafted stand-up routines, shows featuring intricately constructed improvisational humor occur most weekends on campus. The three most visible groups—the Immediate Gratification Players, On Thin Ice, and Three Letter Acronym—frequently hold performances that feature improv techniques practiced by a wide variety of students.
Karen L. Chee ’17, the Czar (in other words, president) of IGP, describes the troupe’s performances as a style of long-form improv called free-form montage. The audience volunteers a single word suggestion, and then IGP comedians use the word as inspiration for the entire show, creating a number of characters and relating them spontaneously. Chee says what makes a great show is its collaborative, relational aspect. “When you’re on stage, the whole point isn’t for you to stand out as a performer or for you to get the limelight,” she says. “It’s to support the other person and justify what they’re saying and make them look great.”
Chee did not expect to feel an immediate connection with her fellow improv actors, but she now considers them her family. A history and literature concentrator, Chee says that her dream job would be to eventually continue with comedy, preferably on a television show as a showrunner or writer, with a small acting part. But even as she contemplates her future, she recognizes the exclusivity of extracurricular improvisatory organizations. “There are very few spaces for you to just try something for fun, to learn something for the first time,” she says. “You have to already be at a certain level.”
Alexander N. Lee ’17, an English concentrator, certainly had already reached that level before arriving on campus. After taking classes with the famous Upright Citizens Brigade the summer before coming to Harvard, Lee joined TLA his freshman year, initially as an extracurricular interest. He now serves as the Pirate for TLA, or their business manager (their administrative titles are nautically themed). Originally founded for a specific type of structured performance known as The Harold, TLA  now focuses on long-form improv. According to Lee, while they do hold semesterly shows for students, their genuine passion for comedy outweighs any need for public interest. “A lot of members of the group would tell you that we do improv for ourselves, not for our audiences,” he says. “We have shows because we are an improv group, but I think a lot of members would be totally fine not even performing, just doing improv among ourselves.”
All the world’s a stage, but not all humor is performative. That is to say, since 1998, Satire V has presented mostly written comedy. “In Satire V, there are no bylines. You’re writing in the voice of Satire V. You’re sort of removing yourself from the process,” says Daniel J. Kenny ’18, the publication’s editor-in-chief.
As a government concentrator, Kenny sought out Satire V as a publication that could combine politics and comedy. The writing process, which features open member pitch meetings, is very inclusive but is also different from stand-up or most video sketches. “The joke is written out for people to read for as many times as possible. So it has to be written according to a news formula,” Kenny says. “Not to say that we constrict our writers, but there’s a way that it has to go along so that if you’re writing an area man piece, it can be read potentially five years from now and people will find it funny.”
As a primarily online publication, graphics are often key to articles published in Satire V. Antonia Chan ’18, current president of Satire V, started out as a graphics editor. “If someone emailed me being like, you know, ‘Marijuana was just legalized in DC. We need a picture of Elizabeth Warren smoking a blunt, ‘[I would be] like, OK!” Despite the fact that Satire V has a unified voice and platform, Chan never felt like an outsider upon joining the organization—her first attempt at comedy. “I think there’s a very refreshing lack of ego,” Chan says. “Everyone is in it because they love to do what they do.”

After ushering in its largest comp class ever last fall, Satire V brought back its video component this semester with the notable parody of a Housing Day video for Dudley House. This year also marks the opening of Satire V’s second annual spring musical, “The Tragedy of Macbeth, King of Pop.” For Kenny, however, Satire V is always about improving the organization as Harvard’s version of The Onion. “My goal is not to antagonize the Lampoon but rather to democratize comedy,” he says.
In the wake of ongoing conversation about institutionalized language and censorship such as the recent takedown of Currier’s Trump-themed housing day video, a number of Harvard students have voiced their opinions on political correctness. According to Becerra, policing language is not the point. “I’m not against offensive jokes, right,” Becerra says. “But I think it matters to what end.”
Becerra links the idea of positivity with constructive humor, in which students can perhaps obtain a higher level of comedy than the bare basics of stereotype or weak satire. OHT, for example, impressed Becerra with its gender spread. “The head writer was a woman; one or two of the producers were women,” she says. “It was usually at least half women in the writers’ room, and I remember noting to myself, ‘I bet this isn’t that common.’ That makes me really happy.” Such a standard both makes comedy groups more inclusive and lends more complexity to joke structures. In meetings, Becerra says, women might challenge misogynistic humor, pushing for jokes that move beyond stereotypes.
Groups are also doing their part to remain informed about the topics they approach in their shows. Even though improv is mostly an anything-goes affair, Lee says that TLA recognizes how language can shape someone’s experience of a performance. “We had a workshop recently with representatives from the Women’s Center,” he says. “So we can learn about gender issues and approach gender and sexuality in a more informed way in our comedy.”

Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who is pursuing comedy as a profession, is currently learning how to write humor now that he’s away from campus. Mayopoulos, who was infamous on campus for his gig as president of the Undergraduate Council, found that his humorous presidency appealed to many people. According to Mayopoulos, he hoped to transform the issues the UC discussed into politics that students were talking about—similar to the punditry of television personalities like Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. “Joking about [political] things helps make them more palatable to be consumed by these [people who are] really busy with their own lives,” he says.
But the journey from pursuing comedy as an undergraduate extracurricular to undertaking it as full-time employment can be daunting—much like any other career. Now taking improv classes, Mayopoulos is discovering how much more he has to learn. “It sort of comes back to Harvard,” he says. “Like, at Harvard, we all held ourselves to these very high standards. And now that I’m trying something else, I’m trying to hold myself to that standard. The problem is, how do you get yourself there?”
The network of Harvard graduates currently working on either comedic high-profile television shows or online writing gigs seems enormous. Alumni such as Megan L. Amram ’10 and Alexandra A. Petri ’10 write humorous content online—Amram on Twitter and Petri on her Washington Post blog, Compost (Petri is the pop-culture mastermind behind the Emo Kylo Ren Twitter account). The Theatre and Entertainment Meet-up, held on Feb. 6 this year, attracted more than 100 students to an event featuring a large panel of contemporary professionals and a networking brunch. Furthermore, in addition to on-campus events, OCS encourages comedy-minded students to use Harvardwood as a resource. Formed initially as a networking website for alumni, Harvardwood now exists as a vibrant community for both graduates already working in the industry and students looking to forge their own paths.
But the OCS knows that it cannot offer the final solution in an industry where a lot of connections are happenstance and spontaneous. “You have to road-test a lot of these things to really know,” says Deborah Carroll, associate director of the OCS. “When you’re in school, whether that’s your K-12 education or in college, there’s a lot of things… that are sort of prescribed. When you’re in the working world, it’s much more self-driven.”
It is important to note that most of the comics involved with organizations on campus already possess that kind of motivation. Though the Harvard network does exist, it is up to the students to get up on stage. “You have to do the work,” says Robin Mount, director of career, research, and international opportunities at OCS. “You have to do the research yourself and piece it together. And we can just help you.”
While comedy at its core is about having fun, those who identify as comedians on campus are far more serious about their craft. The goal is not to tell a good joke; it is to become a skilled performer who can turn any topic into a moment of laughter. These students thrive due to the variety of organizations that bring people together to exercise their sense of humor. It seems like a simple task—finding people to jest with—but finding the right fit requires substantially more effort.

And as these students follow this path and define their own ideas of comedy, they embark on their own journeys into professional life. Some may enter the entertainment business, as graduates like O’Brien or upcoming Class Day speaker Rashida L. Jones ’97 have done. Others may enter other careers and bring their comedic craft to other parts of their life. Becerra, for example, referenced the importance of comedy in community building, such as on First-Year Outdoor Program trips. “It’s so important... especially if you’re doing something that requires people to be challenged,” she says. “If you’re hiking 10 miles… and it’s all uphill, and you’re a freshman, and you’re really scared, and you don’t know if you’re [going to] make friends—it helps if someone can make a joke that makes you feel comfortable.”
Students comedians are bonded together by this need to ease away from term-time gravity. More than simply comfort, Kenny says, comedy at Harvard is about letting off steam in productive ways: “That’s what I’m interested in: when people look to comedy to give them an outlet for truth where they don’t have to be so serious.”

The eighth annual Harvard Student Art Show took place at Arts @ 29 Garden this weekend, organized for the first time as an independent event rather than as a part of ARTS FIRST weekend.  In its new home on 29 Garden Street, the exhibition spanned five rooms and two floors, with 70 pieces selected from around 230 submissions.
Directors Isabel C. Elson ’16 and James R. Thurm ’16 attributed the show’s change of schedule to the necessity of expanding the opportunities for Harvard students to engage with the arts. “It was sort of sad that there was just one weekend dedicated all year to the arts at Harvard,” Elson says. “I think it definitely should be spread out over the year. It’s not as if people only care about art for one weekend a year at Harvard.”
Thurm also ascribed this change to a difficult history of competition for limited space on campus. In previous years, the Harvard Student Art Show has taken place above the Cambridge Trust Company and the basement of CGIS Knafel. Both spaces were not ideal for showing art, especially when complications for hanging or displaying the art arose from facility restrictions. “Our goal this year was to get a space we could really own as ours,” Thurm says. “We also had total freedom to use the space as we liked,” Elson adds.
At 29 Garden Street, photographs and paintings lined the walls as attendants weaved through sculpture after sculpture, snacking on cheese and wine. The stories behind the pieces from 38 visual artists ranged from political to personal to scientific. “We really wanted to get a sense of the arts across campus… giving Harvard students a sample about what they’re thinking about, what they’re making,” Elson says. One piece titled “Family” by George T. Liu ’19 considered the relationship between his identity as a queer Asian and idealized concepts of a perfect family. Another painting called “24 Trump Pinatas,” by Paul D. Fiegenschue of the Graduate School of Design, depicted 24 papier-mâché renditions of presidential candidate Donald Trump on a single canvas. Javier A. Masis of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences put up seven pictures of coronal slices of a rat’s brain next to a actual rat’s brain immortalized in resin. The Harvard Student Art Show’s eclectic collection invites the audience to explore a wide variety of art of different mediums and stories from artists affiliated with different schools within the University.
The Harvard Student Art Show also expanded beyond the visual arts this year, including performances for the first time in many years. “Our goal is to have a lively space,” Thurm says. “We’re having all the performances in the gallery itself.” Performances included shows by groups such as the Harvard Ballet Company, the Harvard Lowkeys, and the Lighthouse Keepers, and by individuals singing with the acoustic guitar, or playing yangqin, a Chinese hammered dulcimer. Nick J. Stager ’16, a performance artist, had a space to himself as he wrote continuously, ensconced behind glass, on a typewriter for the entirety of the art show.
Artists, as usual, were also given the option of selling their work. “Selling your work is a part of being an artist. It’s some level of being able to sustain your next piece and continue to create and fund your passion,” Thurm says. “We want to be able to provide that opportunity.” Prices could be as low as $5 or as high as $2,500.
“The goal is to give student artists a place to showcase their work. There isn’t a lot of space to do that,” Thurm says. “We also want the community to interact with art more.”

An FBI agent, an archaeologist, and a neuroscientist are just some of the past and future guests at Institute of Politics Resident Fellow Anne Hawley's weekly study sessions. Hawley served as Director of the Massachusetts Council for the Arts for more than 10 years before taking the helm of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1989. She has brought her background in leadership and advocacy for the arts to the IOP to create an interdisciplinary program of events and discussions during her residency.
According to Hawley, only two fellows before her at the 50-year-old IOP were involved primarily in the arts. Will Shih ’16, producer for Hawley’s study groups and a former member of the committee in charge of choosing the IOP fellows, told the Crimson that Hawley’s study group is part of a broader movement within the IOP to include fellows from a more diverse range of fields. “We've been looking for a while now to be able to integrate this type of theme to our program,” he said. “Over the years we've had a lot of really amazing former politicians, political journalists, government officials in, but we've been thinking about new and innovative ways that we can integrate [cross-disciplinary studies]."
Hawley's student liaisons at the Institute, whose academic interests range from economics to history and literature to art history, are part of this shift towards a more inclusive and expansive approach to the study of politics.  When asked what types of students her programming aims to engage, Hawley said, "Everybody. We'd love to get people that are studying other things, whether it’s architecture or science or neurobiology or history or engineering. We especially want the engineers—we have to get them to think visually." One of the aims of Hawley's student liaisons, according to Julia E. Fay ’17, herself a first-time liaison and history and literature concentrator, is to reach out to members of the Harvard community who might not have otherwise been involved with the IOP.
The connection between art and government is natural for Hawley, who had to work closely with public officials during her 26-year tenure at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to transform the institution into a vibrant cultural resource for greater Boston. "Whether it's in education policy or zoning or in city planning or in areas of advocacy for policies in government, the arts have a powerful role not only in enhancing your life and making your brain bigger, but in enhancing public life," Hawley said. She explores this connection in her study groups, the topics of which have included American culture wars, politically motivated attacks on ancient works of art in Afghanistan, the repurposing of housing in Houston's African American neighborhoods, and the study of aesthetic perception from a neuroscientific perspective.
In addition to spanning the globe during their discussions of the intersection of art and politics in weekly study groups, Hawley's students enjoyed an exceptional opportunity closer to home when Hawley took them on a flashlight tour of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum after hours. The liaisons also mentioned lessons they have learned about their own lives under Hawley's mentorship. Fay said that she was struck by Hawley's encouragement not to be afraid of the winding path one might take in mapping out—or choosing not to map out—career trajectories.
Likewise, Shih says that Hawley urges him to pay closer attention to what is around him. "Whenever we're walking anywhere, it's always about observation. She'll always point and get me to notice something, whether it's horrible urban planning or great urban planning…. That's just something that I've learned incidentally from being around her," he said. Shih added that Hawley has also prompted him to consider a broader perspective on the role of art in the world, even outside of its political functions. "Art at its best does a lot to impart implicit lessons about humanity and how we relate to one another,” he said. “[It teaches us] something about who we are as people, and helps us understand… difficult moments in our past."

“Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true,” thunders Angelo (Brian A. Cami ’19), deputy to the Duke of Vienna, in one of the many moments of “Measure for Measure” that remains darkly pertinent centuries after the Shakespeare play was first performed. In Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production, running April 8 to 16 at the Loeb Experimental Theater, Angelo wears a business suit; the target of his sinister sexual advances, Isabella (Eliza B. Mantz ’18), dons a similarly contemporary costume; and their meeting takes place in a modern office, lit like a film noir. This setting, along with striking performances and suspenseful lighting and set design, weaponize Shakespeare’s complex text into a razor-sharp criticism of the startlingly familiar power structures that enable sexual violence.
Critics usually classify “Measure for Measure” as one of Shakespeare’s “problem plays.” Its tone veers wildly from political drama to slapstick farce, sometimes in the same scene, as it follows one of the Bard’s most convoluted plots. Put simply, after years of not enforcing Vienna’s vice laws, Duke Vincentio (Patrick J. Witt, a second-year Harvard Law student) leaves the government in Angelo’s hands, believing he will be better able to crack down on the city’s debauchery, and goes undercover as a friar. Angelo begins sentencing fornicators like Claudio (Ben I. Ubiñas ’19) to death. Claudio’s sister Isabella, who is about to become a nun, pleads with Angelo to pardon him. When he agrees on the condition that Isabella have sex with him, the disguised Duke, Isabella, and Angelo’s former betrothed, Mariana (Allegra C. Caldera ’17), conspire to restore justice to Vienna.
The cast fully capture the richness of Shakespeare’s characters. Cami and Mantz, in particular, act with remarkable emotional depth. As the play progresses, Mantz develops Isabella’s reaction from the shock and agony she initially experiences at the grave choice she faces into resolve and righteous fury. Witt plays the Duke-friar like a detective, appropriate given the show’s film noir visuals, and delivers lines in his paper-thin disguise (think Clark Kent) with a winking seriousness that neutralizes the absurdity of that plot point. The comic actors, especially Jamie P. Herring ’18 as a pimp named Pompey Bum, supply the humor woven into the largely serious show, eminently enjoyable performing both wordplay and slapstick.
Working within the relatively small space of the Loeb Experimental Theater, lighting designer Michaela J. Kane ’18 and scenic designer Eloise M. Wheeler ’17 have created an aesthetically gorgeous and inventive play. Kane’s warm, shadow-heavy lighting accentuates the play’s innate cynicism. The action alternates between four levels of the stage—Angelo’s office; a jail cell; a flexible exterior space; and, once, a balcony—and each scene stays within these spaces, an effective method of both varying the visuals and avoiding time-wasting scene changes that allows for quick, nearly film-like transitions to heighten the urgency.
But the chief success of this update is its antagonist. In his suit and intercom-equipped office, Cami is an instantly recognizable presence—the fresh-faced, crusading politician with an awful darkness just under his moralizing exterior. Cami and director Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16 build an Angelo terrified and sickened by his own depravity even as he rationalizes it, a suitably complex villain for the landscape of sexual violence. As his character’s position shifts from modest deputy to businesslike executive, from predator on a power trip to pariah in disgrace, Cami plays each role with the same captivating underlying psychology, giving the play another thrilling arc: a study of how power affects the powerful as well as the powerless.
With this renewed focus on the role of hierarchy in sexual violence, “Measure for Measure” acquits itself an exceptionally apt selection for Hyperion, and Fogel’s choice of a modern setting proves similarly shrewd. Happily, the staff and cast execute this vision in both technically successful and thematically fitting ways. As a work of theater and as social commentary, “Measure for Measure” exemplifies the enduring brilliance, insight, and relevance of Shakespeare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all this column’s previous musings on the Blaschkas’ “Oaten Pipes Hydroid,” something still puzzles. Developed from Allman’s illustration, the Hydroid’s two enlargement models are fairly close interpretations. But let’s look closely at the drawing of the "Hydroid" itself: Despite the glass figure’s elimination of much of Tubularia indivisa’s formal chaos, the animal in Allman’s plate writhes in sinuous curves. It branches into tiny buds; its heads turn in all directions. But the Hydroid suggests not a twisting arbor but a rigid bouquet: puzzling considering the Blaschkas’ otherwise faithful adherence to Allman’s plate.
Of course, the origins of this decision lie partly in economic necessity—slightly bent wires are quicker to produce than a curvilinear mass. As demand for their products increased, the Blaschkas began assembling animals more efficiently. Nevertheless, this utilitarian explanation feels insufficient. In Allman’s plate, most of the Hydroid heads lack sporosacs—and from the minority of heads that have them, they often dangle in a group of three. Allman’s enlargement, too, features a triplet chain. In the Blaschka Hydroid however, sporosacs fall in glittering pairs from nearly every flower, a multiplication of symmetry that required tedious, repetitive work to achieve. Even their microscopic model features two links and not three. This excess of twinning suggests some hidden intention on the part of the Blaschkas. Why this insistence on symmetry? For answers, we turn again to the legacy of the microscope.
An impassioned creationist and the founder of Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, Louis Agassiz purchased 350 Blaschka models for his museum after it opened in 1860. At this time, the study of the natural world had not yet sundered its ties to theology. Then-University President Charles Eliot wrote in 1886 that “the life principle or soul of that organism for which science has no better name than God, pervades and informs it so absolutely that there is no separating God from nature, or religion from science, or things sacred from things secular.” Squinting through the lens of a microscope, scientists received visual revelations.
The Blaschkas maintained a close and admiring correspondence with naturalist Ernst Haeckel, an eminent proponent of this doctrine. Haeckel studied marine invertebrates and protozoa; he believed in “crystal souls” and, according to historian David Brody, published volume after volume of works on sea life “studded with elaborately symmetrical groupings... finicky, jewel-box arrangements.” His lithographs rendered a natural world that was lavish and orderly, a totalitarian baroque that translated organic chaos into extravagantly stylized geometry. The microscopist’s illustrations argued that beneath the anarchy of life, there lay a methodical spiritual harmony. In a letter to Haeckel, Leopold Blaschka thanked him for his intellectual contributions to the glass models, writing that “[y]our kind attitude enables me, indeed, to execute my catalog more perfectly.” I believe that the symmetric design of the Hydroid reveals Haeckel’s spiritual influence.
Nearly all the literature on the Blaschka sea creatures discusses them in aggregate: As detailed substitutes for living specimens, the models conveyed biological information more handily than did illustrations. Explained as such, the collection constitutes little more than a footnote in the annals of zoological history. But the Hydroid hides a richer story, challenging the uncomplicated ‘scientific’ character of the model. Like all art, this Blaschka piece is a product of creative interpretation, and it takes significant liberties with its subject for both expressive and economic ends. Additionally, its historical context heavily stressed both the model’s ornamental status and the spirituality of all creation, both inflections invisible to the current period’s eye. In making these points, my goal was not to demonstrate that the Blaschka models are more ‘artistic’ than ‘objective.’ Rather, I argue that the peculiar character of 19th century natural history, which integrated under one name the aesthetic, rational, and spiritual, allowed the Hydroid to straddle a crossroads long vanished today—operating as the gorgeous representative of an altogether different notion of scientific truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve followed the general movement of music criticism in the past eight years or so, you’ve doubtless encountered the roiling debate over autotune. The vocal effect is essentially a tool used by vocalists to lay their voices atop a predetermined framework of notes and has been hailed as both the standard of music’s avant-garde and one of the four horsemen of music’s apocalypse. Opponents argue that autotune is a crutch and a flashy mask for concealing a lack of true musical talent; proponents counter is that autotune facilitates a new form of expression that opens up new avenues for voices that wouldn’t otherwise be heard. The fight over autotune expresses one of the Internet age’s central conflicts: the struggle between one’s own voice and the voices  that fill one’s environment.
The critical consensus has moved decisively in recent years towards an acceptance of autotune’s legitimacy. While Kanye West’s “808s and Heartbreak” received mixed reviews on its release (largely for its departure from traditional rapping and its use of autotune), it has since been recognized as an important demonstration of the effect’s value. In the past year alone, everyone from swaggering West protégé Travi$ Scott to earnest, melancholy Brooklyn cult favorites Porches has released critically acclaimed albums using autotune. Autotune at its most useful is a tool for mapping one’s voice systematically and forcefully onto another form of meaning—that of melody and harmony. In this respect, the musical trend points toward a larger trend in digital culture: the appropriation of expression from others to find one’s own.
One of the most recognizable and widespread expressions of this phenomenon comes through the advent of widely available, relatively easy-to-use image editing software. Originally designed for editing one’s own images, programs like Photoshop have since become known equally as a means for humorously manipulating images taken by others. A large community on Reddit exists solely for friendly communal competitions of humorous reinvention of photos. This process often manifests itself as a manner of popular discourse as well; a never-ending series of convoluted movie posters serves as a tome of derision for the bumbling “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” films. A similarly parodic but more reverent series of images serves to express a generation’s appreciation of Neutral Milk Hotel’s album “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.”  These appropriative forms have become a method of critique.
The democratic and accessible nature of such modes of expression has steadily woven itself inextricably into digital social discourse. Finding one’s own voice is connected more closely now than ever to speaking with the distorted voices of others, and all kinds of social media services exist partially—if not exclusively—for this aim. The popular app Dubsmash lets users lip-sync to songs, often giving the music humorous new contexts. More mundanely, Facebook’s sharing feature and the now-ubiquitous retweet allow users to use the words of other users to make points of their own, either to emphasize or critique the points of pundits and friends. Snapchat’s face-manipulating lenses feature allows users to haphazardly adopt the visages of everyone from a dog to the Mona Lisa. Increasingly, manners of public discourse involve a layering of one’s own voice with the aspects of others.
Given the ostensibly empowering nature of finding one’s voice in the voices of others, some doubts still remain. Can a voice truly be your own if it originated from someone else’s feelings and experiences? Is an artist speaking through the autotune, or are the imposed harmonic structures doing the real talking? At their core, these questions aren’t new to the digital era. The appropriation of the voices of others has been a human practice ever since those voices have been preserved. The tradition of quoting scripture to express one’s thoughts has endured millennia. Shakespeare almost never wrote a play without culling the general plot from some older source. Jazz music, arguably the most extensive art form that America calls its own, garnered significant popularity from its reimaginings of popular showtunes. And while Dubsmash formalizes the phenomenon, people have been lip-syncing to express their own emotions for years. The Internet doesn’t have a monopoly on bringing the voices of others into our mouths and placing them at our fingertips. The digital era simply makes more urgent the age-old question of self-identity: Where does the self end and the other begin?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics isn’t what you think it is.
As I’ve talked to people about economics, I’ve come to expect a series of generalized misconceptions. A few people I’ve met have even seemed to resent economists, nebulously citing the clout of business in politics as somehow a direct result of our discipline.
Since economics tells us that imperfect information distribution engenders suboptimal market outcomes, I aim in this piece to rectify the misunderstandings—to whatever small extent I can.
I first seek to dispel the popular complaint that economics is inhumane somehow, or greedy. Sure, it’s true that economists find it unsurprising that wealth (pecuniary or otherwise) has the power it does; our models predict it. But we didn’t make it so; it just is.
English political philosopher John Stuart Mill underscored the point in remarks he made propounding the importance of economics in evaluating decisions. Natural forces, he pointed out, are frequently treacherous. Gravity will cause even the most virtuous person to plummet to Earth after a fall; the ocean wrecks warships and humanitarian vessels indiscriminately. Nevertheless, we study physics and navigation. To do so, after all, is logical, not hard-hearted. Well, we study economics for the same reason: not because we relish the perils attendant, but because we wish to avoid them, and harness the underlying forces for our benefit.
Next, though, is the tougher complaint that economics is by nature soft at best and fallacious at worst. That economists are a bunch of cloistered academics who live in a fantasy land altogether ungrounded in reality, and simply congregate from time to time to congratulate one another on living there.
Essentially, the point here is that the models economists use to describe the world are flawed. And this I concede. Indeed, no economist would argue that our models are perfect. They’re just that—models. Still, each retains usefulness as a tool in thinking about the various parts of the world relevant to the particular problem it was designed for. And, vitally, our models are becoming continually more robust, most saliently today with the psychological and sociological supplements of behavioral economics.
For comparison, take physics, which, even as hard sciences go, lies just between topaz and diamond on the Mohs scale. The discipline is ancient; and whereas economics studies humans in all their infinite cognitive complexity, physics deals with inanimate lumps of matter. Yet, physicists still cannot fully describe the motion of three simple balls rolling around in the same plane.
See, it takes a very long time to understand subtle interactions like this. Consider that, while the entire discipline of economics is today only about 300 years old, Ptolemy’s flagrantly inaccurate geocentric model of the solar system was prevalent as late as the 16th century—more than two millennia after physics is considered to have been founded. (Tellingly, the insightful mathematical mind behind the newer heliocentric model, Nicolaus Copernicus, is also noted for his contributions to early monetary theory in economics.)
In this light, even the economist’s most obviously false simplifying assumption, that humans are wholly rational, is no more egregious than the physicist’s assumption that the universe is wholly frictionless. In each case, making the assumption at first turns an intractable question into a manageable one, and at least roughly illuminates the actual state of affairs.
In fact, for economists, the assumption of rationality is purposely valuable. Much like law’s “common man,” our “rational agent” is a fiction—but a useful fiction.  The more you study economics, the more you come to believe that the assumption shouldn’t be modified after all, at least not in most cases. For it allows us to say: Well, here’s what a perfect utility maximizer would do; and, since such creatures are by definition perfect at maximizing utility, maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to do the same thing ourselves. Thus, to me, economics is actually at an academic sweet spot between physics and philosophy.
Nonetheless, it’s easy to forget that all the jargon—“marginal,” “positive,” “normative”—isn’t the core of economics, not really. At its heart, economics is just a framework for solving real-world problems founded on the premise that rigorous decision-making conduces to optimal outcomes at both the individual and the social levels. That when people respond to the right incentives, civilization advances.
Ultimately, all economists ask the same fundamental question of economics. They have multifarious ways of asking it, certainly. They ponder queries ranging from “Is GDP a reliable evaluation metric for international poverty aid policies?” to “Does effective marketing induce consumers to purchase inferior quality breakfast cereals?”. But always and everywhere, we’re really asking the same fundamental question: Given that happiness is good, how can we make people happier?
Damn good question, if you ask me.

Given the impending relocation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston in 2020—a walk across the Charles River from Harvard’s Cambridge campus—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has begun to reconsider the scheduling of classes. Dean of Undergraduate Studies Jay M. Harris presented two proposals to the faculty at their monthly meeting and has made his goals clear: The new academic schedule will attempt to “[de-compress] the instructional day” so that “the great richness of [Harvard’s] catalog” will be made available to students and “[restore] academics as the central focus of [students’] experience of time.”
The proposals entertained by the faculty contain various improvements to Harvard’s current schedule system. For example, one proposal advocates for at least 45 minutes of travel time between Allston and Cambridge, and Harris champions 15 minutes of travel time within the Cambridge campus. These changes could come at the expense of Harvard time, a cherished eccentricity of Harvard’s schedule. Admittedly, the seven minutes can prove insufficient for many students, and faculty bemoan the informality around classes that it encourages. Nevertheless, only time will tell whether the logistical advantage outweighs the tradition of Harvard time.
Another proposed change is to designate Wednesdays as a day for seminars. Though this change would increase flexibility on other days, it may cause an overwhelming load of classes for students in seminar-intense concentrations. This change may also increase the frequency of Friday classes, which could prove problematic for student-athletes and fatal to three-day weekends.
Nevertheless, the goal of improving the accessibility and flexibility of Harvard’s catalog remains laudable in principle. Missing out on taking a class for several semesters often means missing out on it for good. This shift should consider the interests of the whole student body. The rescheduling of classes is an opportunity to make sure they better align with student-athletes’ schedules so that they can delve into whatever field interests them, rather than the concentration that does not interfere with practice and game times.
As the move to Allston is planned, we are also interested in the steps the University will take to ensure that students with disabilities can easily access class offerings there. Although the new campus itself will be fully accessible, travel to the area is often difficult for those in need of accessible transportation.
Though the plans presented to the FAS are in the early stages, we hope that students are consulted on this momentous change before anything is decided. As provisional as the proposals may be, the faculty will benefit from collaborating with students, who will eventually have to live by whatever schedule is eventually implemented. To take into account students’ interests is not a concession to the spirit of academic seriousness that the faculty seek to promote, but instead a basic measure that will provide faculty with broader ideas and new perspectives.

“The sky is falling, the wind is calling; Stand for something or die in the morning”              -Kendrick Lamar
I got a waffle and coffee last weekend with my freshman year roommate. It was nice to catch up with my first friend at Harvard, and after a few awkward small-talk questions, we began to talk with the rhythm and depth that we had when we were still rooming together. The conversation was all over the place; it went from what comes after college to the surprising similarities between Flume and Future.
Eventually, we began to discuss regional differences in America. The dialogue went something like, “The coldness of New England is reflected in the people.” I took this idea and ran with it, saying something ridiculously histrionic (an LA tendency) like, “Yeah, it’s reflected in the eyes of the people.” Saying something like, “The lack of warmth is manifest through the ubiquitous steely-eyed New Englanders.” As I continued to rant, I heard someone snort “steely eyed” under their breath and then burst into laughter. I turned around, ready to challenge whoever was mocking me. We made eye contact, and he said, “Sorry buddy, but I’m a lifelong New Englander.”
For a moment, I contemplated snapping back, “The fact that you’re wearing opaque glasses so I can’t actually see your eyes only reaffirms my point.” But, the rational side of me took over and I realized how childish that’d be. So instead of replying, I swallowed my pride and made some feeble remark about how my mind was wandering. I took the awkwardness in the coffee shop as penance for my callousness and left shortly afterwards.
All in, this pseudo-confrontation was relatively harmless. But in a different mode, it could be incredibly harmful. Imagine if my diatribe had been in the form of an article, with the official seal of The Crimson to validate the ignorance I was spewing. What scares me is the potential for writers, including myself, to influence and guide discussion. This is a big responsibility. In many regards, it can be beneficial when writing serves as a catalyst for discussion and growth. But writing can also promulgate impudent or subversive viewpoints. And the scary reality is that what should be a medium to spur dialogue can be distorted into a practice in promoting hate, ignorance, or bigotry.
It’d be so easy to say this encounter served as a lesson to be calculated while speaking, and even more calculated while writing. To speak of big words like journalistic integrity and extol moralistic truth.
But unfortunately, I don’t think it’s that easy. Calculated speech has never moved men to war, seduced a lover to bed, or brought people to God. No, it is the unabashed emotional truth that inspires, guides, and changes people. If you are always monitoring your speech, you are never truly saying anything.
Kobe Bryant exemplifies this. Tomorrow night, I’ll watch him, my childhood hero, finish his illustrious 20-year career with my hometown team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Kobe is going down in history as an all-time great. He is universally acclaimed for his intensity, his success, and his love for the game. But more than any other trait, Kobe will be remembered for what one person in this video says so eloquently, “Kobe what I love about you is your indifference to how people view you.”
Though my coffee shop experience reminded me how important it is to think before I speak, I don’t want to lose my voice in the process. As important as it is to be thoughtful before voicing our opinions, we can’t be afraid to do so if the message we truly believe happens to be hard for some people to hear. Kobe is loved because he knows this. He knew his potential and what it would take to fulfill his goals. He knew what it took to inspire those around him, and he pursued that ruthlessly. He never worried about rubbing people the wrong way.
It’s true: The pen is mightier than the sword in the hands of any gifted wordsmith. I’m new to writing, I’m definitely not a “wordsmith,” and what I have to say is probably not too virtuous, but I’ll be damned if I don’t speak my mind.
I’m not sure if I’ll continue to ramble on about New England, or other topics that I don’t know well. But when speaking on a topic I know, I’ll never abridge my beliefs for the sake of others.
So to the guy in the coffee shop, thanks for the opportunity to reflect.
And to Kobe Bryant, thank you for being you.

Posters inquiring “Who took our space?” and “Where is Brian?” littered the temporary construction fences surrounding the Smith Campus Center this weekend as part of a Harvard Graduate School of Design student’s efforts to start a conversation about how current renovations may affect life in Harvard Square.
Keebaik Sim, a student in the GSD’s Art, Design and the Public Domain program, spearheaded the poster campaign. He said his goal was, in part, to remind those frequenting Harvard Square that the plaza is a home to many homeless individuals. One such person was an acquaintance of Sim’s, whom he called Brian.
For an art project last semester, Sim created a video documenting Brian’s life as a homeless person in the Square.
“I decided to do a project relating to this person who is sitting and staying here for 23 years,” Sim said. “This person also has a culture, which is different from us but can be respected. It’s not an inferiority, but it’s just a difference.”
Sim said he worried the construction may have adverse effects on the local homeless population. Having not seen Brian since November, Sim wondered if the renovations may have forced him and other homeless individuals to leave the space outside of what was formerly Au Bon Pain.
“This is their cultural place and also a home for them,” he said. “Where are all of these people going to go?”
For Sim and other design students, the renovation could pose problems not only for homeless people but for individuals who use the space often, like students.
“Community is important, so it makes sense that there would be a concern if the renovation is going to change what has always been there,” Bryan Yang, a GSD student, said. “Without that, without public space, without gathering, how are you supposed to form social bonds beyond just the ones you have with classmates?”
However, Brigid O’Rourke, a Harvard spokesperson, stressed that the fences and renovations are only temporary.
“While we regret the temporary inconveniences that the construction may cause members of the Harvard community and our neighbors, we have incorporated various contingencies regarding many of these changes,” O’Rourke wrote in an email. “We look forward to the project’s completion when members of the public will have even more access to the building and its amenities than they did in the past.”
The posters, which have since been taken down, also asked Harvard Square visitors to share their memories of the Square by sending an email to a designated gmail address. Sim said he even reached out to Matt P. Damon ’92, albeit unsuccessfully, for a story about "Good Will Hunting," a movie in which Damon starred that partially took place in the Square.
“I just wanted to collect stories about this place that people are familiar with,” Sim said. “I’m very sure that [Matt Damon] has a specific story.”
The Smith Campus Center renovations are scheduled to take place from now until the fall of 2018, when the building is scheduled to reopen to the public. Current construction updates can be found at construction.harvard.edu.

Six weeks after Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira first alerted Harvard affiliates of two cases of mumps, the total number of confirmed cases at Harvard has risen to 22, according to the Cambridge Public Health Department.
The new number is an increase of six from the most recent figure announced in late March, according to HUHS Spokesperson Lindsey Baker. The virus has affected students across campus, including members of multiple athletic teams who are currently in self-isolation for “presumed cases of mumps,” Barreira said in March.
The virus has also spread to nearby schools, including Boston University and Tufts University.
Ninety-nine percent of undergraduates have been vaccinated against the virus, according to Barreira. However, the vaccine is only effective 88 percent of the time, Anita M. Barry, the director of the Infectious Disease Bureau in the Boston Public Health Commission, said.
Local public health regulations require that infected students be quarantined in isolated living conditions for five days. At the College, several students with the virus have temporarily relocated to the Harvard Inn. Inn residents received an email a few weeks ago from Dudley House Assistant Dean Christopher M. Gilbert, suggesting they may be able to move into upperclassman Houses to help provide more space for College students who may need emergency housing this semester.
Mumps is transmitted through salivary exchange, or respiratory droplets, fairly large particles that come out of people’s mouths and noses when they cough, shout, or otherwise forcefully expel air.
Barreira has directed students to take preventive measures that include refraining from sharing eating utensils, practicing hygienic habits like hand washing, and seeking medical attention at the onset of mumps-like symptoms.
As for a potential end to the Harvard mumps outbreak, Barry said last month that students’ departures from campus for the summer would slow transmission. She said the dense population and close proximity of students on a college campus makes it easier for mumps to spread.
According to Barreira, HUHS has been coordinating with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Cambridge Public Health Department, and other schools to address the situation.

Cambridge Police are still awaiting video surveillance in connection with a stabbing that occurred on Church Street late last month, Cambridge Police Department Spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email Monday.
The incident took place three weeks ago between two men who knew each other. After an argument, one man stabbed the other, with the victim sustaining an injury to his lower abdomen. The victim was taken to a local hospital and has since been released, according to Warnick.
“A person of interest was arrested on two warrants unrelated to the stabbing,” Warnick wrote on March 25. Nevertheless, he said the investigation is ongoing and the name of the suspect cannot be released yet.
"Once probable cause is established, an arrest for the stabbing could be made, but until then, a name can't be released," Warnick wrote.
Despite the incident’s close proximity to campus, the Harvard University Police Department did not send out a “MessageMe” alert or email to warn students to avoid the area.
“Based on the information available to the HUPD during the incident a determination was made that it was an isolated incident between parties that knew each other and that there was no continuing threat to the Harvard community,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email last week.
The stabbing occurred just one day prior to a fatal shooting near Mount Auburn Hospital, another violent incident involving two victims. One victim died shortly thereafter and the second victim has been released from the hospital, Warnick wrote on Monday.
According to Warnick and Meghan Kelly, Communications Director of the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, the Mt. Auburn shooting investigation remains “open and active.”

After the Undergraduate Council called on Harvard University Information Technology to extend a deadline for switching to HarvardKey, the University’s new online authentication system, HUIT clarified Monday that College students have until June 1, not April 20, to register.
During their Sunday general meeting, the UC voted 20-16 to send a letter to HUIT asking the department to extend the deadline for College students to register for HarvardKey. In the letter, written by the Council’s Education Committee, the UC objected to the deadline, which they claimed was April 20.
In a reply to the UC, HUIT Chief Technology Officer Jason Snyder wrote that the deadline for College students to register for HarvardKey is June 1, not April 20 as the UC had claimed.
The College’s faculty and staff, but not students, have until April 20 to register, according to Snyder. Snyder added that some College students who are also employees may have mistakenly received a notification via email last week that mentioned an April 20 deadline.
“We apologize for any confusion our communications to the Harvard community may have caused,” Snyder wrote in the email.
After the June 1 deadline, students who do not transition to HarvardKey will not be able to log in to some online services, including Microsoft Office 365, according to the HUIT website.
Several UC representatives raised concerns Sunday over the legislation, arguing that the Education Committee should have reached out to HUIT first before formally calling upon the department to extend the HarvardKey deadline.
The UC offered to help HUIT publicize the upcoming HarvardKey deadline. In his email to the UC, Snyder wrote that HUIT would be willing to work with the UC on “ways to better communicate and publicize activity impacting students.”
UC Cabot House Representative Christopher B. Cruz ’17, who sponsored the legislation, said he still supported the measure even though the UC was mistaken on the deadline.
“I understand that there was a fairly contentious debate last night, and that a lot of individuals feel this wasn’t the right measure to take,” he said. “But considering the deadline we believed we were facing, I think this was the right move.”
Former UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said that, though he was glad the UC tried to respond quickly to the issue, he wished the Council had taken more time to consider the proposal before passing legislation.
“I think this represented an incident in which the UC went too far in one direction,” Steinberg-Otter said.
HUIT plans to send an email to students Tuesday clarifying the June 1 deadline, according to Snyder.

Engineering students seeking non-tech internships have praised the relatively new in-house career advising services at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, though many expressed hope for its further expansion.
While the larger Faculty of Arts and Sciences' Office of Career Services provides clearer pathways for software engineering positions, students have criticized OCS in the past for failing to provide adequate support for those interested in other engineering internships.
Harvard College Engineering Society Co-President Daniel Wang ’17 said that SEAS Director of Experiential and Career Development Keith R. Karasek has improved the landscape for engineers in search of non-tech engineering internships.
“We felt that OCS wasn’t doing enough for engineers, and so the vision was for HCES to work with Keith and bring in companies and show them that Harvard produces awesome engineers even though the program is small, the caliber of our students is right up there,” Wang said. “I think if you ask any Harvard engineer, they’ll tell you OCS is kind of lacking.”
Karasek, who joined SEAS on a part-time basis in 2014 before being hired full-time in January of 2015, said his experience as an alumnus—Karasek earned a Ph.D. in applied physics at Harvard in 1980—and his proximity to SEAS students allows him to provide support that OCS cannot.
“I go down to every HCES lunch… I go down there and I just start going up to all the students, working the line and say, ‘what are you going to do next summer?’” Karasek said. “I mean, in OCS, they’ve got 10,000 students they’ve got to deal with.”
OCS Director Robin Mount declined to comment on specific criticisms, but she wrote in an email that OCS collaborates closely with Karasek and that “SEAS students may meet with Keith but they still have full access to all OCS services, advising, and resources.”
Karasek praised OCS’s staff, but also said students he met with would often “complain that they would go over to OCS and they get swamped by management consulting and financial jobs.”
While OCS hosts some engineering career fairs, such as the Engineering Boutique Night, Karasek often encourages students to head down Massachusetts Avenue to MIT to attend career fairs there and even participate in their on-campus interview program. Still, MIT limits the number of SEAS students who can participate in their on-campus interview program, and Harvard students are not welcome at MIT’s flagship fall career fair, according to Karasek.
Ivan A. Cisneros ’16 also said that Harvard’s Cambridge neighbor has a more established engineering scene, leading Harvard students to travel to MIT to take advantage of their better-developed recruiting “infrastructure.”
“There’s room for growth for getting more recruiters to also visit specifically Harvard in addition to MIT when they come over to the East Coast,” Cisneros said.
Wang, who worked at SpaceX this past summer, said that support for students looking for internships is “very much student-driven” despite Karasek’s efforts. Wang, for instance, encouraged SpaceX to come to campus this year to recruit other Harvard students.
While Karasek’s position does, on the surface, create redundancies with OCS, the parallel system falls under what SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III calls the “hybrid” nature of Engineering at Harvard.
“We are a school within a school,” Doyle said in a February interview. “So certainly in some aspects—managing our own finances, doing student advising—there are a lot of things that we set up that are parallel to FAS...because we have unique issues and matters for our students.’’
According to Wang, Doyle told HCES board members that he planned to expand Karasek’s role by creating “an office of career outreach and a team within SEAS that’s dedicated to engineers” when the school completes its partial move to Allston in 2020. Doyle, through SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff, declined to comment on the possibility of such an office.
“There are no plans we can discuss regarding new career counseling resources, now or when SEAS expands to Allston in four years,” Karoff wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michelle Rhee, former chancellor of the Washington D.C. Public Schools and founder of the StudentsFirst advocacy organization, reflected on the challenges she faced and the criticisms she received for her education policies while in office at an event hosted by the Institute of Politics on Monday.

Rhee said her unexpected appointment in 2007 created political opposition because of her relatively young age and limited experience in educational leadership. Despite the “pushback” she received, Rhee said she remained focused on taking a new path to bring rapid change to the Washington, D.C., public school district.
Rhee said her biggest accomplishment was improving the schools in her district along a variety of measures, including higher reading and math scores, and increased graduation rates and enrollment.
“What we managed to do was to set the district on a completely different trajectory. When we took over, it was the lowest performing school district in the country,” Rhee said. “After our first few years in office, we became the fastest-growing district in the case of student-achievement levels.”
Much of the pushback she received was related to her policies for teacher evaluation, which linked student test scores with teacher performance ratings.
Rhee acknowledged that the criticism she received had a “kernel of truth” to them. However, she said every decision was made was “in the best interest of students” and emphasized the importance of teachers as a solution to America’s education problems.
Referencing Rhee’s controversial policies, attendee Adora I. Mora ’10 said Rhee “owns her actions.”
“She understood that she did it for a reason and that not everyone’s going to be happy with what she did,” Mora added.
However, Rhee said her goals were not fully realized because of the four-year term limit for her appointment.
“At the end of the day, we did not accomplish what we set out to, in that what I hoped was that we would close the achievement gap, that we would be a district where race and income were no longer the determining factors of student achievement levels,” Rhee said.
Rhee’s discussion inspired Charles A. Grandson IV, the associate director for leadership development at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, to change his perspective on Rhee’s educational policies.
“I actually am a product of D.C. public schools,” Grandson said. “I was not her biggest cheerleader before...but after listening to her today, I totally get what she’s about, what she’s trying to accomplish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a shorter than usual meeting Monday, the Cambridge City Council tackled issues ranging from a lack of local affordable housing, to a potential medical marijuana dispensary, and prescription drugs disposal.
Spiking property values and rents, which stand to become a hot topic of discussion for the City Council over the course of this term, were at the center of the recently released Cambridge Inclusionary Housing Study.
After reading the report, whose findings indicate housing rates in Cambridge are increasing faster than incomes, City Manager Richard C. Rossi recommended that the Council consider raising the percentage of required affordable housing. The Council currently requires some housing developments to maintain a 15 percent affordable housing ratio.
“I would suggest that the City Council consider an increase in the inclusionary standards to be in the range of 17 percent to 20 percent of the total of newly-built units,” Rossi wrote in a letter to the City Council.
Several City Councillors ran on a platform to solve the affordable housing crisis outlined in the recent report.
“We have an affordable housing crisis in Cambridge. That’s no secret,” Councillor Jan Devereux said. “It’s been recognized for quite a while that the program needs to be strengthened.
Devereux, a member of the City Council’s Housing Committee, claimed that the study would lead to recommendations about affordable housing in the city. The Council will send the results of the report to its Housing committee and potentially its Zoning and Ordinance committee for further discussion, according to Devereux.
At Monday’s meeting, Mayor E. Denise Simmons said the Housing Committee will meet at least three times to debate the matter, including one meeting that will include local residents and developers.
The Council also postponed a resolution on Sage Cannabis’ proposal to create a new medical marijuana zone on Massachusetts Avenue. The resolution, which was sponsored by Zoning and Ordinance Committee members Marc C. McGovern and Leland Cheung, requested that the City Manager write a letter of “non-opposition” to Sage Cannabis’ proposal.
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said such a letter would not explicitly approve the new medical marijuana zone, but would aid Sage Cannabis in the state approval process.
“A city manager or mayor doesn’t have to take a moral position or even a logistical position to whether or not they want it,” Mazen said. “It’s important for the state process.”
The Council plans to vote on the letter along with the zoning changes on April 25, according to Devereux.
The Council also adopted a resolution that calls on the City Manager to increase prescription drug drop off locations to impede the growing opioid crisis.
“For many residents, especially seniors, it can be challenging to get to these locations, which may mean that medications are improperly disposed of or remain in medicine cabinets where they could be misused,” the resolution reads.
Devereux, who sponsored the resolution, said the city should play a more active role in making prescription drug disposal as simple as possible for Cambridge residents.
“We want to make it really easy for residents to get them out of their homes—not flush them down the toilet, leave them in their medicine cabinet, or throw them in the trash,” Devereux said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 12, 2016, at 12:33 p.m.
Harvard has raised at least $6.5 billion in its capital campaign, breaking a higher education fundraising record after only two and half years of its five year-long public drive, according to two donors with direct knowledge of the campaign’s progress.
With $6.5 billion raised, Harvard has surpassed its public goal and Stanford’s $6.2 billion capital campaign, which ended in late 2011 and set a higher education record. The first capital campaign at Harvard to involve each of the University’s 12 schools simultaneously, the fundraising drive aims to support student financial aid, a new campus in Allston, and the renewal of undergraduate Houses, among other priorities.
By the time of its public launch in September 2013, the “One Harvard” campaign had already raised $2.8 billion in gifts and pledges during its “quiet phase.” Since then, Harvard has attracted multiple high-level gifts that moved its total closer to the $6.5 billion target. 
Harvard last detailed the progress of its overall campaign in October 2015, when donations totaled $6.1 billion. Harvard administrators are generally tight-lipped about campaign data, and University President Drew G. Faust said earlier this month that Harvard times announcements to coincide with the end of the fiscal year or tax year. She said Harvard does not plan to release an updated figure until later this spring or summer.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment for this story.
Despite the rapid success of the campaign, both Faust and Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, said last semester that Harvard had no plans to raise the campaign’s goal. Some peer institutions, like Columbia University, raised their fundraising goals during their own fundraising drives.
Unique to the current capital campaign is Harvard’s willingness to rename its schools in honor of particularly generous donors. Billionaire Gerald L. Chan’s $350 million gift renamed the Harvard School of Public Health, and Harvard named the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences after hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson, who pledged a record-setting $400 million to the school.
The campaign’s success has not gone without scrutiny. Last summer, when Harvard announced Paulson's donation, a chorus of critics denounced the gift as unnecessary and excessive for one of the world’s wealthiest schools.
But with about two years left in its campaign, Harvard is focusing attention on funding individual priorities that still need the money, Faust said in an interview earlier this month.
Financial aid in the College and graduate schools, while buoyed by a nine-figure gift from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 two years ago, remains an area of particular emphasis, Faust said. She added that she will also focus on funding the new SEAS campus in Allston, although the SEAS campaign, with Paulson’s gift, has far surpassed its initial $450 million goal.
Faust said she will continue to push for gifts toward House renewal, a priority that has lagged behind other areas in the campaign, which support projects including the upcoming renovation of Winthrop House. Several of the University’s schools, including the Graduate School of Education and the Divinity School, are also short of their goals, Faust said in the interview earlier this month.
Harvard’s last capital campaign launched in 1994 under then-President Neil L. Rudenstine, while Faust was still teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. That campaign finished at $2.6 billion over the course of five years.
Faust became Harvard’s president in 2007, a transition, she said, that determined when the new capital campaign would begin. By the time Faust settled into her position, the country was reeling from the financial crisis of 2008—a troublesome time to launch a new campaign, she said. The University would wait five years from the initial stock market crash to publicly debut its new fundraising drive.
The world’s wealthiest university, Harvard is funded in part by the returns on its $37.6 billion endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two extra-inning defeats condemned the Harvard baseball team (9-17, 2-6 Ivy) to an encouraging but somewhat heart-breaking weekend against Ancient Eight rivals Columbia and Penn. The Crimson won the opening game on both Saturday and Sunday but lost in 11 innings in the second half of each doubleheader.
The Lions (9-18, 3-4) couldn’t keep up with the Harvard offense in the first game but rebounded, riding a two-run ninth inning to a comeback victory in the second. The Quakers (13-14, 5-3) responded to a morning loss on Sunday with a late comeback and extra-inning heroics of their own.
“I think any time you go into a series, you want to try to get three of the four,” coach Bill Decker said. “We got people in the right positions and we need a guy to step up and deliver that big hit…. We got two guys up with the bases loaded to win it [against Penn], and it didn’t go our way.”
PENN 6, HARVARD 5 (11 INNINGS)
The Crimson lost another hard-fought affair in 11 innings to round out the weekend. Freshman righty Kevin Stone was tagged for four runs in four-plus innings of work, allowing a couple of runs to cross the plate in the top of the third. His offense responded in the bottom of the fourth, with junior catcher Josh Ellis following up junior shortstop Drew Reid’s RBI single with a two-run double down the left field line to give his team a 3-2 lead. The catcher had a game-high three RBIs. Sophomore Matt Rothenberg also had a two-hit game, and freshman center fielder Ben Skinner also recorded a run for the Crimson.
Penn shortstop Ryan Mincher hit a two-run two-bagger of his own in the top of the fifth to restore the Quakers’ lead, 5-4, only to see the Crimson load the bases and then score two thanks to a walk and sacrifice fly in the bottom of the sixth.
Mincher’s RBI double tied things up in the top of the ninth before Chris Rabasco’s RBI single off of freshman Simon Rosenblum-Larson earned the Quakers a win.
HARVARD 3, PENN 2 (7 INNINGS)
Behind strong pitching and timely hitting, the Crimson overcame struggles at the plate to defeat the Quakers in the shortened opener of Sunday’s doubleheader, 3-2. Sophomore starter Ian Miller walked five and struck out four in three innings of two-run ball. Senior lefty Shaun Rubin earned the win thanks to four scoreless innings in relief of Miller, who fanned four over three innings and alowed just four hits and two runs.
A run in two of the first three innings gave Penn a 2-0 lead after three, with leadoff hitter and center fielder Gary Tesch hitting an RBI single in the top of the second. Catcher Matt O’Neill’s groundout to second then scored Mincher to double the Quakers’ advantage. Harvard responded with three runs in the bottom of the fifth inning off of Penn starter Mike Reitcheck. Skinner hit an RBI single to right before senior second baseman Mitch Klug’s grounder forced a Quaker error that plated two more runs.
COLUMBIA 4,
HARVARD 3, (11 INNINGS)
The Crimson suffered a heart-breaking loss in the second leg of Saturday’s doubleheader against the Lions, falling by a single run in 11 innings. Despite tying the game with a run in the bottom of the ninth, Harvard was unable to outlast its Ancient Eight rival in extras.
Senior ace Sean Poppen pitched five innings of one-run ball, exiting with a 2-1 lead, but Columbia scored two in the ninth and then one in the top of the eleventh to grab a road win.
Sophomore third baseman John Fallon continued his power streak with his fifth home run of the season, the most in the Ivy League, roping a belt-high pitch into the trees beyond the left field wall to give his team a 2-1 lead after four innings. The score stayed that way into the ninth inning, when Lions’ first baseman Nick Maguire hit a two-run single off of senior righty T.J. Laurisch to give Columbia a 3-2 advantage.
Skinner responded in the bottom of the frame with a two-out, RBI triple but was stranded at third. The Crimson would come to regret that, when Shane Adams plated Maguire with a single up the middle off of senior southpaw Sean O’Neill.
HARVARD 11,
COLUMBIA 3 (7 INNINGS)
The Crimson offense started off the weekend in style, recording its second double-digit output of the season in support of junior right-hander Nick Gruener. Two freshmen played central roles in the outburst, with freshmen Pat McColl and Trent Bryan combining for five hits and nine RBIs.
Gruener pitched his fourth consecutive complete game in the shortened game, striking out eight Lions batters in seven innings of three-run ball.
“I felt strong,” Gruener said. “My arm’s been feeling really good, and I think that I hit 94-95 again, which is pretty exciting. The team hit well behind me, scored a lot of runs, and I can win any game if I get that hitting.”
McColl opened the scoring in the bottom of the first with an RBI groundout to first and then added an RBI single in the bottom of the third to extend the team’s lead to 3-0. The Lions got one run back in the top of the fourth  after an RBI double before Harvard quickly responded with four in the bottom of the inning to take a 7-1 lead.
The Crimson put the game to bed one inning later, with Bryan’s bases-clearing double resulting in three runs and McColl’s single, the final of his career-high five RBIs, pushing the lead to 11-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most varsity-level sports have cores centered around their upperclassmen. They are the players who have been around the longest and are the most seasoned. But the women’s rugby team at Harvard has only competed at a varsity level for three years, so it has only recently begun to recruit players. Because of this, the core of the team now is centered around the younger athletes who played the sport in high school. The team captains, Crimson sports editor Isabel Delaura and Maya Learned, are both sophomores, and 19 players on the 27-woman roster are either freshmen or sophomores.
As one of the 11 freshmen on the team, Caitlin Weigel has already begun to make an impact due to her extensive background in the sport. Weigel has been playing rugby longer than it has been a varsity sport at Harvard. A two-time All-American out of Hudson, Ohio, Weigel was a three-year letter earner for her high school rugby team.
She was also a three-time All-Ohio and All-Midwest, and was named 2015’s Ms. Rugby Ohio and Hudson Rugby MVP. She was an All-Ohio MVP in 2014, as well. In addition to rugby, Weigel was a four-year letter winner for the swim team. She was a two-event All-American in swimming, and she earned a letter in soccer.
In her first year with the Crimson, Weigel regularly started at center in the fall season, and notched six tries in a performance that made a significant difference this weekend at the Atlanta 7s tournament.
“I would definitely say that having some players on the team who have high school experience is key,” said Head Coach Sue Parker on April 3 after the Quinnipiac 7s tournament. “Not only do they provide infrastructure on the field and composure, but they also...increase the rate at which other new players that we get on campus can learn...and I think that’s irreplaceable.”
The impact of the underclassmen on the team has been hard to miss. In the team’s first few tournaments, Weigel and sophomore Dalton Youngblood were the team leaders in tries. Weigel continued to be a dominant force in sevens this weekend as well, tallying tries in nearly every game and helping the team go to a 3-1 record in pool play. The team beat Ohio State, Lindenwood, and Texas A&M in pool play, losing only to Life University. Harvard eventually lost its second game in the final to Life.
In the team’s 20-14 victory against top-seeded Lindenwood, Weigel scored two tries in the second half to win the game for the Crimson. Up to its game against the Crimson, Lindenwood was routing teams in fall season 15s by scores of 88-0, 130-0, and 132-0. Lindenwood went 10-2 in 15s in the fall, and was 10-1 in sevens before the Atlanta tournament.
Weigel was instrumental in the the rugby team dealing the Lions its third loss of the sevens season. After going down 14-7, Weigel dominated in the second half. She found the endzone twice, including  a go ahead score late in the second half.
“I feel really good about our performance this weekend,” Weigel said. “Lindenwood got a score off the first kick-off. We really had to...come back from that.”
Weigel also downed the Crimson’s lone try against Life University in pool play. She remained a constant factor throughout the two-day tournament as the team beat Ohio State and Texas A&M.
Outside of this tournament, Weigel has proved to be a force in the Crimson’s other tournaments this sevens season, scoring in the Frostbite 7s, Crimson 7s, and Quinnipiac 7s tournaments. At Quinnipiac, Weigel was the second leading scorer for Harvard, tallying four tries throughout the day.
“I think the work that as a team we’ve been doing...has really translated well to this season,” Weigel said. “Passing progressions and kick work before practice. I definitely feel like sevens is my game and the practice I’ve put in is starting to show.”

Last Saturday, the Identities Fashion Show turned Northwest Labs into a pulsing, energetic center of fashion and student creativity. This Crimson Roving Reporter sat down with several people at the event, exploring the inner mechanics of a fashion show and what goes on behind the models’ flawless smizing.
Cengiz Cemaloglu ’18, creative team member
Roving Reporter: What was your role in Identities?
Cengiz Cemaloglu: I am one of the creative team members for menswear, which involves choosing the clothing, choosing the designers, choosing the models, teaching them how to walk, choosing the themes of the section, choosing the music, and coordinating the logistics of shipping the clothes.
RR: There’s a particular emphasis on China this year. Why is that?
CC: This year’s show has a much more international focus. We wanted to showcase fashion’s global reach—how globalization has caused a dialogue between Chinese and American fashion. Everyone used to look toward what American fashion was and copy it in a way, but now a lot of focus is shifting to Asia, so we wanted to concentrate on that.
RR: The entire world erupts in flames, and you can only save three fashion items. What would they be?
CC: Definitely not underwear.... I think high heels are very aesthetically pleasing—they look good on everyone. I think it’s a strange thing to say, but I also really like the Turkish style of hijab. [Lastly,] dress shirts. I think dress shirts make a statement, and they also make you feel very important about yourself.
Garrett C. Allen ’16, model
RR: Can you tell me a little bit about what you’re wearing?
Garrett C. Allen: I’m wearing a long dress shirt with a ton of multi-colored rhinestones. It’s really heavy, surprisingly. It glistens and glitters—I would wear it to class. It’s comfy, I could fall asleep in section if I needed to, and [I would] wake up and sparkle. I’m also very excited for my motorcycle gear section—there’s lots of leather, and the designer even had us carry motorcycle helmets.
RR: What was the hardest part about training for this show?
GCA: We’ve been here since 10 a.m., first of all. And although it seems easy—it’s just walking—it turns out that walking is hard and it takes a lot of skill. The motorcycle gear designer was very particular about what he wanted—he wanted us to look very natural. You’re not marketing yourself, you’re marketing clothes. He was very particular about how to hold the helmets. But it all falls into place. This is my second and last year doing it, and I wished I did it the other years because it’s really fun. It’s a really nice group of people and I really love all the board members and creative designers. I really like fashion myself so it’s really cool to do something so fashion-centric on campus.
Katie G. Tutrone ’17, model
RR: Can you tell me about what you’re wearing?
Katie G. Tutrone: It’s a lot different than all the other pieces in my section. I kind of feel like I’m wearing an udder. It’s really comfortable. I feel like a giant stress ball—multiple stress balls. I kind of want to walk out of here with it.
RR: What was your initial reaction when you saw this look?
KGT: I was about to swear. I thought there was no way this was going to get on me. It looked so tiny on the rack, but it surprisingly fit over my head—it was a tight squeeze. I mean, it looks better than I thought. Still ridiculous, but not bad.
RR: I’m excited to see you walk in it.
KGT: I’ll probably walk with my hands inside these things and then pull them out so people will say, “Whoa! She has two sets of hands!”
Dajon A. Thomas ’19, model
RR: What made you want to get involved in Identities?
Dajon A. Thomas: I’ve always had a general interest in fashion, and this was a great opportunity to get involved in the process and [see] the development of this show.
RR: If you could only wear clothing made out of one food item for the rest of your life, what would it be?
DAT: I think it would be really cool to wear licorice. I would really like something black, and I really enjoy licorice.
Laura S. Chang, ’17, executive producer and head of publicity board
RR: How did you get involved in fashion?
Laura S. Chang: I was really fascinated by this interesting paradox in fashion where it’s seen as something really trivial but also as something really high end that we don’t really understand. Intelligence in [as in knowledge about] fashion might be seen as oxymoronic, but it’s absolutely not true. A lot of people at Harvard are actually very interested in fashion, and this is an amazing opportunity.
RR: What does fashion add to the Harvard experience?
LSC: It really helps widen perspectives and also allows people an opportunity they wouldn’t have otherwise. You can see our show isn’t like the typical modern fashion show where every model is waif thin. There is a lot of diversity in the models and designers.
RR: What is your favorite fashion faux pas?
LSC: I mix metals all the time. I mix brown and black.
