Season Seven of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” premiered on Feb. 4 with two episodes filled with the shenanigans and multifaceted characters that fans have come to know and love. Given that the show is already renewed for an eighth season, it comes as no surprise that the showrunners deliver a classic combination of tense police business, fast-paced comedy, and touching moments between characters for a successful premiere that bodes well for the rest of the season.
Season Six ended with the removal of corrupt Commissioner John Kelly (Phil Reeves), but at a price. Beloved Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) was demoted to serve a year as a street cop by his arch-nemesis, Commissioner Madeline Wuntch (Kyra Sedgwick). The first episode of Season Seven, titled “Manhunter,” resolves this cliffhanger, revealing what life is like in the Nine-Nine without Holt in charge. In an exciting search for the man behind an assassination attempt, the episode follows the familiar dynamic duos of goofy Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and sidekick Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), intimidating Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) and anxious Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), along with the new partnership of stoic-yet-sassy Holt and indecisive Debbie Fogle (Vanessa Bayer). Peralta is thrilled when Sergeant Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) puts him in charge of the manhunt, until he runs into “Officer Dad,” AKA Captain Holt, at the crime scene. Eager for his big break as “the manhunter,” Jake hopes to take credit for cracking the case, but his aspirations are crushed when Holt steals his thunder.
The premiere is an excellent reminder of the amazing friendships formed in the Brooklyn precinct over the last six seasons. Rosa helps Amy through a pregnancy scare that’s as touching as it is laughable. Her attempts at calming Amy’s nerves include suggesting she aggressively kick things or listen to babbling brooks, which Rosa attempts to replicate with a hilarious series of “glubs.” Amy’s concerns also prompt a necessary conversation between her and Jake about their future, making up for the lack of intimate “Peraltiago” screen time in Season Six. Other than a few oddly placed and unproductive scenes, in which Terry Jeffords complains about his gossiping daughters, “Manhunter” is a well-composed reintroduction to the squad in all of its quirky yet lovable glory. Vanessa Bayer’s debut as Debbie Fogle also makes a valuable contribution to the episode’s comedic appeal, creating a funny contrast between her overly cheerful personality and Holt’s neverending pessimism. The tension of the manhunt is settled by the end of the episode, allowing the squad to focus less on crime and more on their new captain in episode two.
The second half of the premiere, titled “Captain Kim,” returns to the typical structure of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”’s standalone episodes. Holt’s replacement is revealed to be Captain Julie Kim (Nicole Bilderback), the NYPD’s first Asian American female captain. Immediately, the bullpen is filled with doubt after meeting the seemingly too kind stand-in. Suspicious of Captain Kim’s motivations for joining the Nine-Nine, the squad searches for ties between her and the resentful Commissioner Wuntch at a dinner party that she invites them to. As per usual, the squad’s plan to discover her secrets falls apart, resulting in cringe-worthy yet amusing chaos. In one of the episode’s greatest plotlines, Holt is not the only character experiencing a change of role; Charles Boyle is temporarily rebranded as the bullpen’s “bad boy” after he borrows Rosa’s leather jacket for the weekend. Charles’ new mojo, Terry’s exchanges with an ex-convict whom he testified against, and Holt’s laugh-out-loud versions of drunken escapades make this episode a must-see, even funnier than the first half of the premiere.
Ultimately, the premiere episodes set an excellent tone for the rest of the season. As the only remaining Mike Schur show on air after the finale of “The Good Place,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” maintains the tradition of interspersing comedy and heartwarming, relatable moments, creating a wholesome family atmosphere in the NYPD precinct. While one can never know what the writers have in store, audiences should expect further explorations of the shifting character dynamics following Holt’s fall from grace, developments in Jake and Amy’s relationship, and the potential introduction of a long term villain as the show has done in prior seasons. Upcoming episodes include a renewal of the precinct’s Jimmy Jabs contest, titled “The Jimmy Jabs Games II,” and a dive into Holt’s new partner, with an episode titled “Debbie.” Who knows what kind of trouble the squad will get into next?

Billie Eilish’s “No Time To Die” embodies the essence of James Bond: a familiar combination of suspense, sorrow, and sincerity. Through an echoing abyss, minor piano keys whisper beneath an ascendant string opening. Eilish’s sweetly somber vocals swim smoothly through the gloomy atmosphere, captivating her audience while conveying a story of betrayal and growing apathy between lovers.
Her newly released track perfectly captures both the mood of previous James Bond themes and Eilish’s own famously melancholy sound. Eilish’s music is often preoccupied with darkness, particularly in the form of heartbreak and the emptiness that accompanies it. These themes are especially evident on songs like “everything i wanted” and “when the party’s over,” where she sings, “Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own / And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.” “No Time To Die,” embodies a similar atmosphere, present even in the first verse: “I should have known / I'd leave alone / Just goes to show / That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe.” Eilish’s depiction of love here mirrors previous James Bond theme songs, where the singer and their lover indulge in a toxic, manipulative relationship that leaves them ultimately empty.
“No Time To Die” intimately depicts this deceptive, apathetic love with its straightforward but meaningful lines and simple melody. This melody sets the mood of the music and supports the overall message Eilish conveys. One must ask, however, whether Eilish is speaking about a physical or emotional death when she sings “There’s just no time to die,” and what deeper implications the piece may hold.
Eilish has a well-known preoccupation with death, but this consistency of death- and apathy-related themes brings forth a well-warranted question: Is it dangerous for Eilish to frequently return to these dejected emotions in her work, and what type of impact does this reinforce on today’s youth? Is Eilish a negative influence on maturing adolescents who do not yet understand themselves? And should society put restrictions on underage listeners overindulging in music with such negative messages, or place disclaimers on the music itself (such as those on songs with explicit lyrics) to warn listeners of troubling content?
With the rise of warning labels and audience-maturity ratings throughout the entertainment industry, the continual discussion of these issues is particularly essential; Eilish, with her powerful influence over a predominantly-young fanbase, will no doubt continue to occupy a prominent role in that conversation. These questions do not have easy answers — but perhaps, in the case of “No Time to Die,” they don’t need to. For if Eilish’s project is simply to make a great Bond theme song, then she has, without a doubt, succeeded.

Trivia game HQ, which once offered prizes of up to $300,000, held its final round the night of Feb. 14, following the announcement that the company would cease operations. The game was played for the final prize of a rousing $5, contributed by host Matt Richards.
The former home screen staple, whose parent company recently went under, did not fall gracefully. On Feb. 15, Scott Rogowsky, the original host, tweeted in a passionate thread that the company was “poisoned with a lethal cocktail of incompetence, arrogance, short-sightedness & sociopathic delusion,” implying that the collapse could have been avoided. The company is no stranger to misfortune — in 2018, cofounder Colin Kroll tragically passed away from an overdose, causing the company to falter. By this point, however, the app was already declining from its once near-universal popularity.
For those of us in college, HQ evokes memories of playing with friends after leaving high school for the day — but this was not a game limited to a small population of young users. BBC news estimates that at its prime in early 2018, the show reached up to 2.3 million players in one round.
The app offered a free game of trivia with a live host, originally Scott Rogowsky. Because the game only happened twice a day at a specified time, it brought people together from across the globe. The game democratized the world of game show television, bringing it into people’s homes and hands twice a day with the chance to win cold hard cash (though you would likely have to split between a very large winner base). The final show featured the hosts consuming alcohol and holding nothing back with their language in their last hurrah.
After running out of money, the company leaves 25 full-time employees without a job, joining the ranks of apps such as Flappy Bird and other flash-in-the-pan game sensations. However, there may be hope — on Feb. 18 co-founder Rus Yusopov tweeted that “HQ WILL LIVE ON” after he had found a new buyer for the company. Nothing seems concrete yet, but for avid HQ fans, a new-and-improved HQ trivia may be forthcoming — so make sure to tweet at Yusopov “if you have ideas on how to make chapter 2 of HQ even better than chapter 1.”

In front of you is a stunning view of a huge forest, up to a mountain top, and you are listening to the sound of birds chirping, with sunshine warmly touching your face, and fresh air coming in through your lungs. Breathing in, you take in this moment fully, and breathing out, you cherish the peace this moment offers you from the chaos of your life.
Moments in nature, similar to what you have hopefully just experienced in your mind, sparked my interest in mindfulness several years ago. During a summer countryside trip back in Mongolia, looking at a sunset beside a small lake, I could not help but notice how my thoughts disappeared and how I was simply aware of all my surroundings and sensations: the orange, pink, and red colors of the sky and the fresh smell after rain. It was freeing and peaceful not to think for a time and simply observe my surroundings.
Intrigued by these sensations, I started studying meditation and stumbled upon the concept of mindfulness. Mindfulness is defined in many different ways but on the simplest level, it is to be fully present and aware of what is going on in and around you at a given moment. After spending a few years learning more about it and trying to practice it daily, I realized anyone can bring even small mindful moments to their lives to improve their mental health and experience both good and bad moments more fully.
Coming to Harvard, I felt and feel constant stress and pressure to achieve, to do more and be more, caused by my own thinking and the expectations I put on myself. Comparisons to other amazing students at Harvard certainly do not help, but intentionally bringing small mindful moments to my day-to-day life allowed me to be more grounded.
Mindfulness is usually connected to mindfulness meditation — a form of meditation in which the focus is on breathing and the present moment. There are even some studies that demonstrate the effects of mindfulness meditation on the brain. It would be redundant to list the benefits of mindfulness meditation, because of its increasing accessibility, so I wanted to expound more on what the distinct concept of mindfulness can mean at its very simplified core for busy and stressed-out college students.
The concept of being present sounds simple, but it is surprising how rarely we actually do it. With thousands of thoughts going through our minds a day, in our heads, we are usually daydreaming, worrying, or letting our mind wander even if we want to focus on something. Instead of having our “mind full” in this way, being mindful allows us to experience the moment, no matter how good or bad, without judgment or resistance. It starts from being aware of our thoughts, our surroundings, and accepting them as they come.
I believe it is especially important for Harvard or any college student to take care of their mental space amid all the pressure and stress they surely experience some time during their college career. Whether by pushing ourselves to meet the deadlines of various classes and activities, or constantly worrying about the future and if we are doing enough, we exert so much energy into thinking, overthinking, ruminating, and agonizing. It is tiring. We burn out. That is why it is critical to allow our mind and body to rest, not only when we are asleep, but also when we are going through our days. Mindfulness is not limited to meditation, and we can bring it into every aspect of our lives, little by little.
For me, it begins with something as simple as sitting down for five minutes on my bed in the morning, before the chaos of the day ensues, simply checking in on my body and taking a few deep breaths. Sometimes it is being aware of the morning sunshine and adorable dogs when walking through the Yard instead of ruminating on what I said or did earlier. Other times it is simply sitting with myself when I am stressed or sad and feeling the emotions and thoughts instead of resisting and suppressing them in my mind. Mindfulness is for anyone, and it can start from mindfulness meditation, or just noticing the patterns of the mind, paying more conscious attention to our surroundings, and consistently directing attention to our present reality.
Here, I also want to acknowledge that mindfulness is a broad concept, with a long and complex history, stemming from religious traditions, with differing definitions and practices. My definition has been simplified and covers only a small fraction of what mindfulness is.
That being said, I encourage my fellow students and those intending to improve their well-being to start practicing mindfulness in order to have more groundedness and experience both wonderful and painful times without getting caught up in their own minds.
Even though we might not find ourselves on top of a mountain, looking at a forest every day, there is still peace even in the chaos of things if we open ourselves more to the present and accept it without judgment through mindfulness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Private prisons only make a bad justice system worse.
Last week, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign filed suit against Harvard in Massachusetts state court over the University’s alleged investments in companies with ties to the prison industry. Arguing that the University’s refusal to investigate the scope of potential investments in the prison industry amounts to a “violation of fiduciary duty and break of the Harvard Charter,” the five student plaintiffs asked the court to prohibit Harvard from investing in the “prison-industrial complex” and to make “such practices” illegal.
Private prisons take advantage of the overcriminalization of people of color for monetary gain. People of color are disproportionately stopped or arrested by the police, charged by prosecutors at higher rates, and sentenced to longer terms for the same charges. The mistreatment of people of color by the criminal justice system is the result of an abominable combination of racialized socioeconomic disparities and race-driven legislation. For example, when Congress chose to differentially punish crack and powder cocaine, the sentencing disparity between black Americans and white Americans for drug-related crimes more than quadrupled. Increased sentences increase private prison profits.
Moreover, private prisons pervert the very principles of justice that should underpin the carceral system, creating structural incentives for disregarding and undermining these principles. For example, in 2009, two Pennsylvania judges were charged with taking millions of dollars in kickbacks in exchange for sending teenagers to two private juvenile detention centers.
But even as we recognize the violence of private prisons against communities of color and American society more broadly, we find ourselves feeling uncomfortable with the nature of divestment politics and our own position, as an editorial board, within them.
When we opined in favor of fossil fuel divestment last spring, we wrote that we think supporting divestment is appropriate only in the most extreme cases. But since then, we have confronted a number of calls for divestment — from Puerto Rican debt, from indigenous and agricultural landholdings, from Israel — that have posed the difficult task of having to compare moral wrongs and degrees of existential significance.
The existential and moral importance of fossil fuel divestment remains clear, but a reactive approach to divestment does not instantiate a meaningful approach to addressing the sociopolitical significance of Harvard’s financial practices.
Divestment campaigns are but one means, championed by students, to raise alarm against a political economy that underwrites deeply troubling and exploitative practices of capital accumulation. In that light, the HPDC lawsuit represents the extreme (and justifiable) frustration — not least owing to the University’s often condescending indifference — that students have with the limited tools available to them to challenge such injustice. After all, the issue they protest does not appear to be particularly juridical — certainly not in the sense of the landmark social justice cases that have appeared before United States courts. Rather, these students would seem to be constructing a legal claim — donating to a university, the values of which they evidently disagree with — in order to pursue a case in the courts that might more typically be pursued on the street or, as they showed last semester, the football field. As one plaintiff said in light of his $12.24 donation, “moral standing” was more important than “legal.”
And while we share the frustration of these students, we believe that one-off editorials supporting the increasing number of divestment campaigns will tend not to constitute a meaningful critique of these structural problems or do justice to their activism. Just as it is not our place to pass judgment on each individual walkout and sit-in, so too it seems presumptuous to do so for divestment campaigns.
As such, though we continue to support divestment activism in its power to raise critical moral and social questions from students’ perspectives, private prison divestment does not meet our criteria for support. But that’s not really what matters. What matters is that students are heard loud and clear: It’s time to shut down private prisons for the sake of those whom they dehumanize and the justice system they pervert.

Last Tuesday, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign filed a lawsuit against the University for its investments in companies connected to the private prison industry. In the lawsuit, HPDC argues that Harvard — specifically naming University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, and the Harvard Management Company — has failed to “manage the endowment in good faith” and has violated “its legal duty to consider the charitable purposes of its investments.
We acknowledge that the legal basis of this lawsuit is tenuous at best. That said, we laud the lawsuit’s effectiveness as a means to heighten awareness of the often sidelined prison divestment movement. Most importantly, we agree with the moral gumption of its cause.
Investments in companies managing private prisons are deeply immoral and signal a willingness to profit from the inhumane practices these institutions perpetuate. As such, the conversations HPDC has sparked on the morally reprehensible state of private prisons in the United States are valuable and urgent.
The list of injustices profit-motivated, privatized incarceration perpetuates is depressingly long. Inmates of color are disproportionately represented in private prisons where they are then unjustly housed in inhumane, unsafe conditions. The pursuit of profit encourages private prisons to delay the release of their inmates by actively reducing their likelihood of obtaining parole.
Beyond this, stakeholders in the industry erode democracy and decency. They have spent millions lobbying state and federal governments in favor of harsher and longer sentencing. Private prison operators such as CoreCivic and GEO Group — which HPDC asserts the University is connected to through a related Mid-Cap ETF fund — are also known operators of immigrant detention centers that, according to the New York Times, contain “barely edible food, indifferent health care, guard brutality and assorted corner-cutting measures,” including those that house immigrant children separated from their parents.
We recognize that there is a large discrepancy in the amount HPDC and the University estimate Harvard has invested in companies tied to the prison industry. Regardless of whether this figure is as large as the $3 million that HDPC alleges or the much smaller $18,000 that Bacow claims, we believe there is still a strong moral rationale for divesting. Either way, Harvard has effectively turned a blind eye to or, worse, signed off on these egregious injustices.
But any fact-friendly person should be able to recognize the well-documented harm private prisons perpetuate. The issue, then, is not whether the private prison industry is highly unethical (it is) nor whether it actively hurts marginalized communities (it does). That much is beyond doubt. The question is how we, as a university community, ought to confront that reality.
Adopting a complacent, pessimistic stance, as this Editorial Board has, is tempting. It might even seem logical. Under an economic and corporate status quo in which child labor and environmental destruction remain commonplace, why even bother with ethical investment? Isn’t divesting from anything ultimately futile?
Yet cynicism has never been a friend of social change. In cases where the moral alarm is resoundingly, successfully raised, we believe it is the job of all University affiliates at large, and The Crimson Editorial Board, to listen. Though, in our campus’s divestment spring, dissecting all the arguments and movements calling for divestment may be overwhelming, dismissing all of these movements because they are numerous is ham-fisted. To adopt such a mindset obfuscates the University’s and our campus community’s responsibility to consider how to best address injustice and other complex moral quandaries.
In the spring of last semester, our Editorial Board articulated, in an overturning of long-held precedent, why it now supports fossil fuel divestment. The basis of this opinion was made clear: “Simply put, we should not allow our educations to be funded by the destruction of the environment and degradation of human life, particularly those who are already systematically disadvantaged.” To us, arguing that the conditions in prison prisons do not reach the standard of degrading human life or harming the systematically disadvantaged is illogical and facetious.
Harvard, because of its economic and institutional heft, enjoys a privileged position — one that allows it the unique fiscal flexibility to choose its investments responsibly and to nudge society in a positive direction. Pushing our university to do so, to avoid the most morally abhorrent investments from a field of tainted options, is far preferable to simply accepting that ethical perfection is unattainable; applying these moral standards — demanding that the food we eat and the buildings we live in are not partially subsidized by outright cruelty — is infinitely superior to indifferent resignation.
Our investments might never be perfect. But that doesn't mean they can’t be better.

Melinda A. Gates will receive the Radcliffe Medal in May in recognition of her significant impact on women and girls worldwide through her work as a philanthropist and entrepreneur, Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study announced Tuesday.
Gates is the co-founder and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the founder of Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation firm focused on solving problems that impact American women and families.
The institute awards the medal — its highest honor — each year to an individual who embodies a “commitment to excellence, inclusion, and social impact,” according to a press release.
Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute, praised Gates in the release for her “remarkable” work.
“We are honoring Melinda for her remarkable impact around the world, for putting women and girls at the center of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s work, and for her urgent and ambitious commitment to the unfinished business of empowering women here in the United States,” Brown-Nagin said in the press release.
Gates announced in October that she was dedicating $1 billion to “expanding women’s power and influence” in the United States through Pivotal Ventures. She also released a best-selling book on the topic — “The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World” — in April 2019.
At the helm of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she has shifted the organization’s focus increasingly towards women and girls, according to the press release.
Additionally, the foundation has donated millions to Harvard over the past several decades, including a donation of $50 million or more during the 2018-2019 academic year, according to a University report sent to alumni.
Gates will receive the medal on Radcliffe Day, an annual celebration of the institute scheduled for May 29. In the release, Brown-Nagin added that a number of other milestones will coincide with this year’s festivities.
“This celebration is especially fitting as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment and consider the work that remains to be done to achieve the promise of full enfranchisement and political empowerment of all women in the United States,” Brown-Nagin said.
2020 also marks the 20th anniversary of the Radcliffe Institute’s founding.
In honor of both the “historic moment” and Gates’s selection, a panel at the Radcliffe Day ceremony will explore women’s empowerment, per the release.
It will include a panel with former University President Drew G. Faust, who was the founding dean of the Radcliffe Institute; Iris Bohnet, the director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School; Thasunda Brown Duckett, the CEO of Chase consumer banking; Amanda N. Nguyen ’13, the founder and CEO of Rise Justice Labs; and Gina M. Raimondo ’93, the governor of Rhode Island.
Gates will also participate in a “wide-ranging keynote conversation” with philanthropist David Rubenstein prior to receiving her medal from Brown-Nagin.
Past medalists have included labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta, former Secretaries of State Madeleine K. Albright and Hillary Clinton, Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor, and Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison.

Harvard University Health Services launched a health survey Tuesday to gather data on what HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen called the “current held experiences” of undergraduate students.
The survey, which Nguyen and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent in an email, asks students about their physical, mental, and sexual health, as well as alcohol and drug use.
The questionnaire comes three months after Nguyen replaced Paul J. Barreira as HUHS Director. Barreira held the position for seven years and announced in January 2019 that he was stepping down.
The survey asks undergraduates detailed questions about their sleep and exercise habits, stress management, substance use, eating patterns, body image, sexual activity and safety, unwanted sexual conduct, and self-harm.
Aside from asking survey-takers about their own health, HUHS also asked them about their perceptions of other undergraduates’ drug and alcohol use and sexual activity.
Before certain sections, the survey informs students that they are allowed to skip questions that are “upsetting or distressing.” It also directs them toward a variety of HUHS services, including mental health counselors and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
In an interview last week, Nguyen said he wants to use data from the survey to determine how to address student needs.
“I'm hopeful that a large number of students will participate,” Nguyen said. “That's how we understand the priorities that we will focus on in the coming couple of years.”
Nguyen, who previously stated that he wants to focus on serving underrepresented groups on campus, said the survey — if it gets enough responses — will be a way to determine how to approach health issues for racial and ethnic minorities in particular.
“What I'm hoping for is that we have as diverse a group of students participating in this survey as possible, so that we can understand not only what the overall College population looks like in terms of their health, but also, can we look at racial and ethnic minorities and see if their experience is different from that of the general population?” Nguyen said.
In a bid to increase participation rates, HUHS has tried to sweeten the pot for survey-takers by offering them a five-dollar gift card to El Jefe’s Taqueria or a five-dollar donation to aid the animals of Australia.
The survey closes on March 11, after which administrators will review the results. Throughout fall 2020, HUHS will release major trends from the survey to Harvard affiliates.

Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said in a Tuesday interview that it is “healthy” that roughly one in four Harvard student-athletes drops their sport during their time at Harvard.
Last week, an analysis by The Crimson found 27 percent of the current senior class who has played on a varsity sports team at Harvard quit their sport by their senior year. Nine former student-athletes in the Class of 2020 cited academic and extracurricular interests, injuries, and mental health concerns as the main reasons behind their decisions to step away from athletics.
Scalise said on Tuesday that his department is not concerned by the estimated one-in-four attrition rate.
Scalise noted that sports are a component of a student-athletes’ educational experience and compared athletes’ decision to stop playing their sport to students’ decision to change their concentration.
“Athletes and all students come here to develop,” Scalise said. “And it’s like what people do when they write what major they’ll major in or the concentration they’re interested in. You come in here with a certain set of ideas of what you want to do, and then over time you grow and develop and sometimes you grow deeper in that area.”
“Sometimes you grow away from that area and you experience other things,” he added.
Scalise said he thinks an athlete’s decision to step away from their sport shows they have developed newfound interests.
“For me it’s actually a pretty healthy number to have 25 percent because it means that there are some students who have chosen to do other things, they got excited about something else that they did, or they said the time I’m putting into this activity could — it would be better for me to spend it elsewhere,” he said.
Though Scalise said members of his department interview and survey graduating athletes each year to gather feedback on their time at Harvard, he maintained that Athletics is not interested in pursuing ways to increase athlete retention.
“There’s nothing that we’re doing to increase that number in any way shape or form,” he said.
Still, Scalise said he monitors and reviews teams that experience inordinate rates of attrition. Men’s soccer and women’s lightweight crew both experienced attrition rates of at least fifty percent among members of the Class of 2020, according to The Crimson’s analysis.
“There’s certain instances where when there’s a lot of turnover on a specific team that causes us to say I wonder what’s going on here,” he said. “And you try to investigate and see what’s the root cause of this particular team having that experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than a week before Super Tuesday, Massachusetts residents are already casting their ballots in the 2020 presidential primaries.
For the first time ever during a presidential primary, Massachusetts is holding a five-day early voting period where residents can cast ballots at any open polling locations in their municipalities.
“Early voting opens up a lot more convenience in voting for people who don’t qualify for absentee ballots,” Debra O’Malley, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, said.
Unlike on Election Day, early voters are not assigned to specific polling places. In Cambridge, residents can cast their ballots at any of six polling locations open for early voting.
On Monday, the first day of early voting, 1,716 voters cast ballots, according to Cambridge Election Commission assistant director Lesley Waxman.
The Massachusetts state legislature passed a bill in 2014 that approved early voting for general elections. The legislature passed a provision approving early voting for the 2020 presidential primaries at Galvin’s request.
More than 20 percent of voters cast ballots early in 2018. In Cambridge, more than a quarter of voters went to the polls early for the midterm elections.
“It’s never been shown that early voting necessarily increases turnout, but it does make it much easier for the people who want to vote to vote,” O’Malley said.
Rebecca Simonson, a first-time early voter who said she cast her ballot for United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said she “appreciated the convenience” of the process.
“It was a lot easier than the normal process of going to my precinct location and voting,” Simonson said.
Simonson, who voted at Cambridge’s Main Library, said she supports Warren because she is “wise and principled.” She added that she decided to ignore the issue of electability — which Democratic voters tell pollsters is the most important issue to them nationally — and vote based on her perception of who will make the best chief executive.
“It’s a circular issue where everyone talks about electability and it means that they don’t consider the best candidate, necessarily,” Simonson said. “I’ve decided to pick my candidate and go for it and tell everyone that they’re great in the hopes that other people will also follow that line of thinking and vote for the best person for the position, rather than worrying about all the noise.”
Democratic presidential candidates are ramping up their campaigns in Massachusetts ahead of next Tuesday’s primary, when Bay State voters will go to the polls along with 13 other states. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is scheduled to hold two events in Massachusetts over the weekend, including one on Boston Common at noon on Saturday.
Cambridge resident Ryan DeGroot said he voted for Sanders and added that he is wary of billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s titanic campaign spending.
DeGroot also said that he appreciated the speed of the voting process at the Main Library Tuesday.
“You just walk in, take the ballot, go fill it in, and then fist bump the person at the ballot box and then walk out,” he said. “So it’s pretty nice.”

Tech billionaires, foreign entities, and at least one Democratic presidential candidate number among Harvard’s top donors, according to the Harvard University Report of Giving 2018-2019.
Three donations totalling $431 million topped the donor honor roll.
The largest came from entrepreneur Leonard Blavatnik — a graduate of Harvard Business School — who committed $200 million to Harvard Medical School, the largest gift in its history. The funds are aimed at “solving some of humanity’s most acute biomedical challenges,” per a Medical School webpage dedicated to the gift. In recognition of the gift, the Medical School named its umbrella research institute and a biotech startup lab for Blavatnik.
Hansjörg Wyss — another Business School alumnus — donated $131 million to the eponymous Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. The gift marked Wyss’s third major donation to the University since 2009.
David E. Goel ’93 and Stacey L. Goel donated $100 million to fund a research and arts performance center that will be part of the University’s new campus in Allston.
An anonymous gift capped off the top tier of donations, which includes gifts totaling more than $100 million.
Asked about the report, Harvard spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on specific donations.
“Harvard depends on the generosity of alumni and donors who support our mission at all levels, enabling the university to have a lasting impact in areas of teaching, learning, research and innovation,” Hennessy wrote in an emailed statement.
Other big-ticket donations include gifts from both boldface names in the tech world and major philanthropic groups.
The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation donated at least $50 million to fund early childhood development and public health research at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Medical School.
Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 — the founder and CEO of the investment group Citadel — donated $50 million to Harvard this year. Griffin previously made the largest gift in College history, giving $150 million in 2014. Of that gift, $125 million went directly to the College’s financial aid office, which was subsequently re-named in his honor.
The estate of the late David E. Rockefeller, a banker and the grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, also contributed $50 million, as did the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Morningside Foundation.
Pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan ’07 and College dropout and Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg jointly founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
The Morningside Foundation is the family trust of brothers Gerald L. and Ronnie C. Chan, who pledged $350 million to the School of Public Health in 2014.
Lakshmi N. Mittal and his family also donated $25 million to the University last year. In 2017, Mittal announced a $25 million gift to establish an endowed fund for Harvard’s South Asia Institute, which was subsequently renamed for him.
Bloomberg Philanthropies, the philanthropic organization of current presidential candidate and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, donated at least $10 million dollars during the period.
The government of the United Arab Emirates was also listed among the donors who gave at least $10 million. In the past, they have funded the Emirates Leadership Institute at the Harvard Kennedy School.
At least one donor on the list has come under fire for initiatives it funds.
The John Templeton Foundation also donated at least $10 million. In the past, the Templeton Foundation has been criticized for funding research that blends religion and science. The Templeton Foundation did not respond to a request for comment on the donation or the criticisms.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview last Tuesday that he hopes to expand the way Harvard College and its students define public service.
He said he believes people often have a “narrow” perception of what constitutes public service, citing stereotypes that students assign to different jobs and industries.
“I want to have a kind of expansive definition of that, because I think the old definitions tended to be too narrow and not necessarily reflect the array,” he said. “Just based on my experiences, both as a faculty member at the business school and as well as faculty dean in Cabot, this is more of a continuum than these kinds of discrete categories that people often place.”
Khurana said, for example, that students who enter careers in consulting — a profession he said lends itself to “caricatures” — often do service work via advising governments, nonprofit organizations, and companies in sectors such as health care and education.
“But the question of how you approach that job and the orientation you bring to that also matters,” he said.
Keeping this wider definition in mind, Khurana said he hopes that the Phillips Brooks House and the Office of Career Services can collaborate to provide students with a “wide array” of public service opportunities.
He also spoke about the College’s role in promoting public service more broadly.
“We expect all of our students to integrate this notion of service and the responsibility that comes with being an engaged member of our community in whatever aspects or careers they end up choosing,” he said.
He cited both longstanding Harvard institutions like Phillips Brooks House and the Institute of Politics, as well as newer College programs like Service Starts with Summer, which the College launched last year.
Summer Starts with Service offers incoming freshmen the opportunity to serve in their hometowns alongside Harvard faculty and student leaders the summer before matriculation. A select number who commit to more than 100 hours of service receive a $1500 stipend.
Khurana added that the College must provide opportunities for students to serve inside and outside of the classroom.
“Finding opportunities to work on complex problems — which are transdisciplinary, cut across array of institutions or disciplines — and understanding systems is important,” he said.
He gave the example of the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship, which offers courses that include a public service component and cultivates an “appreciation for non-academic perspectives, knowledge, and expertise,” according to its website.
Regardless of their undergraduate pursuits, Khurana said the College should provide many options for students to explore public service after they leave Harvard.
“I think what's also important is that we make sure that we're giving students as many alternatives and choices to consider what their first job would be after college,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Adrian C. Vermeule ’90 sparked outrage online after posting a tweet on Thursday comparing attendees of the Summit on Principle Conservatism to concentration camp detainees.
The summit, set to occur in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 29, will bring together conservative leaders and activists to discuss conservatism in the United States and the next steps for the political movement.
Vermeule posted an advertisement for the summit on Twitter which included pictures of 26 speakers scheduled for the event. The tweet — which has since been deleted along with Vermeule’s Twitter account — included the caption: “The very first group for the camps.”
The comment drew criticism from professors and Harvard alumni, who interpreted the line as a reference to Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.
“This sort of crude antisemitism isn’t protected by academic freedom,” Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences alumnus Gerard S. Harbison wrote in a tweet. “Tweeting Holocaust jokes would a red line [sic] for me.”
Law School graduate and University of California, Berkeley Law School Professor Orin S. Kerr also responded to the tweet, noting his personal ties to the Holocaust.
“Bummed I wasn’t invited, but then my family hasn’t had good experiences in the camps,” Kerr wrote in a tweet.
Vermeule explained in an emailed statement that the tweet intended to point out that any distinction between conservatives who dislike Trump and Trump supporters would be irrelevant to a future administration controlled by the “extremist” left.
“As most readers understood, the tweet was a sardonic joke to the effect that if and when an extremist left-wing administration came into power, the Republicans who call themselves ‘Never-Trumpers,’ no less than any other conservatives, would soon be sent to gulags of the sort that were a staple of 20th-century Communist regimes,” he wrote.
Carrie F. Cordero, an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University, wrote in an emailed statement that she can read Vermeuele’s post as a joke, but does not find it appropriate for a Harvard professor. Cordero is slated to speak at the summit.
“The most generous reading of his tweet was that it was in jest and intended to be provocative,” she wrote. “As a Jewish American and one of the individuals participating in the conference he was tweeting about, however, I believe his flippant reference to ‘camps’ has no place in civil discourse and disgraces Harvard faculty, students and alumni.”
Vermeule noted he considers this style of joke to be common on the internet and that he did not have any sinister intention to make the comment. He criticized “self-described Republicans” and “political opponents” for giving his joke an offensive interpretation.
“In our political climate, a few very loud people will attempt to exploit any possible misunderstanding for political advantage,” Vermeule wrote. “If we allow these people to dominate public discussion and drive out free expression and political humor, however, we will all be worse off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four experts gathered to discuss the origins and persisting challenges of racism in urban housing policy at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Tuesday evening.
Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of History, Race, and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, moderated the event. Panelists included Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an assistant professor of African American studies at Princeton University; David A. Williams ’07, the policy director at Opportunity Insights, a Harvard-based research and policy lab; and Lizabeth A. Cohen, a Harvard History professor.
The speakers explained the influence of the private sector — specifically the real estate industry — in shaping housing policies that, according to Taylor, enabled “the racial marginalization of non-white people.” They argued that the government must intervene to address national housing issues, rather than defer to the interests of the private sector.
“In order to actually match the scale of the crisis, we have to embrace the language of entitlement and the idea that the state has a role to play, and we cannot defer that responsibility to a real estate industry, to a banking industry, whose entire history is wound up in white supremacy and racial discrimination that have created these problems that we are living with now,” Taylor said.
Taylor also placed the public-private partnerships within a larger historical context.
“As early as 1924, the National Association of Real Estate boards had already made it a rule that any realtor who introduced someone of a different race into a racially homogenous neighborhood would lose their license,” Taylor said.
“These are the people who were recruited into [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's federal housing administration to help shape the first federal laws regarding housing policy and home ownership in particular. So they bring with them their ‘expertise’ in segregregation,” she added.
Later in the discussion, Muhammad asked Williams if determining the causes of housing segregation is an “open-ended question” for his team at Opportunity Insights.
“Interrogating those questions, I think is really important to understand, well-intentioned or not, what are the implications of the policy choices we’re actually making,” Williams said.
Williams said he feels optimistic about policy measures that help families get increased access to housing.
“This isn’t going to solve the entire issue. Most families who qualify for Section 8 still don’t receive those vouchers because there isn’t enough funding for it,” Williams said. “But I think there’s something about actually providing services that can help navigate some of the systemic barriers that we’ve seen because of our history, and I think that does give some kind of optimism moving forward.”

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ upcoming move to Allston approaches, SEAS students living in the Radcliffe Quadrangle say they are worried about travel logistics to classes across the river.
The Quad is located approximately half a mile northwest of Harvard Yard — and even farther away from the brand new, 500,000 square foot SEAS campus, where many classes will take place next fall.
Currier resident and Biomedical Engineering concentrator Anna M. Raheem ’20 said the new campus poses logistical difficulties for enrolling in classes on both sides of the river.
“I think it will be really difficult for students to enroll in classes, both at the Allston campus and at the College,” Raheem said.
Raheem added she hopes the University will implement a strong transportation infrastructure to ensure that students can be “fully integrated into the college environment,” as travel time will eat into students’ schedules.
"If engineering students are required to take all of their classes at the Allston campus, it would decrease the amount of time that they can spend in the houses or at the College,” she said.
Soheil Sadabadi ’20, a Currier resident and Computer Science concentrator, expressed concerns for dependence on the shuttle system.
“Even with the shuttle service, it will just create such a logistical nightmare, because having to commute 10 or 15 minutes between your classes just to go from a class in the Science Center all the way to Allston is going to be extremely difficult,” he said.
Meredith L. Weenick ’90, Harvard’s vice president for campus services, wrote in an emailed statement that the University will add “supporting roadways” and shuttle routes to address transportation needs to and from the Science and Engineering Complex.
“The creation of new supporting roadways will add to the overall functionality of the SEC,” she wrote. “Harvard will also offer expanded and enhanced shuttle routes that include additional stops in both Cambridge and Allston and a direct Quad to SEC route via Harvard Square, as well as continue both daytime and evening van services as a supplement to the fixed shuttle routes.”
Weenick wrote the University will also improve on alternative modes of transport across the river.
“There are also plans for new pedestrian walkways, hundreds of bike and scooter parking spaces, protected bike lanes, new wayfinding signage and an updated digital tracking that will all contribute toward the safe and easy transportation both to and from the SEC,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council recently approved a measure that advises police not to arrest unlicensed drivers in Cambridge in an effort to protect undocumented immigrants.
The new policy is part of the city’s “Welcoming Community” ordinance, a measure that aims to solidify Cambridge’s status as a sanctuary city. The purpose of the ordinance is to “increase public confidence in Cambridge’s government by providing guidelines” for the city’s involvement in federal immigration enforcement — and to “declare that all are welcome here,” according to a policy order.
The ordinance, which passed with seven affirmatives and one “present” vote during the Council’s Feb. 10 meeting, encourages Cambridge Police to issue court summonses to unlicensed drivers if those drivers have not committed other violations which might warrant an arrest.
Undocumented and unlicensed drivers face often risks of detention and deportation when they are arrested. According to the ordinance, this occurs because police enter fingerprints of suspects into databases used by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The new law, however, aims to protect undocumented immigrants by discouraging police officers from taking unlicensed drivers into custody.
Although police have informally practiced this procedure in Cambridge in the past, the council — whose members have previously criticized federal immigration policies — wanted to enact an official ordinance to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement.
Under the new law, officers also will give unlicensed drivers the opportunity to arrange for a licensed driver to drive the vehicle away before authorities impound it.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan wrote in an email to The Crimson Tuesday that the official ordinance was necessary to “communicate to our immigrant community that our police are not deputized agents of ICE” and “make it clear that we want this policy to continue.”
Organizations supporting the ordinance include the Brazilian Worker Center, the Welcome Project, and the Massachusetts branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. On their website, the Massachusetts ACLU encourages cities and towns to pass policies that support immigrants and prevent deportation.
“Cities and towns cannot legally be forced to use their own resources to assist in the enforcement of immigration laws,” the website reads. “They can, however, create policies that send a clear message: immigrants are welcome here and they should not fear their local government.”
Zondervan wrote that he hopes to see more cities adopt similar policies in the future.
“As long as the federal government insists on waging war on immigrants, we at the local and state level have to step up our efforts to keep our communities safe,” he wrote.
“That means making it clear to our immigrant community members that they can safely reach out to the police when they need help or see someone in trouble, without fearing that they will be deported,” he added.

Harvest Bowl
Craving a Sweetgreen harvest bowl, but lacking the funds for it? Toss together mesclun greens, beets, and sweet potato pieces from the salad bar. Add a cubed apple for crunch and sweetness, plus a spoonful of brown rice for more substance. If you’re an omnivore, add some chicken from the salad bar and mix everything together. Throw on some of the roasted soy almond blend (located next to the bougie sunbutter flavors that you’ve never tried) for a crunchy and chewy topping. Finally, drizzle your salad with a tablespoon or two of balsamic vinegar.
Bruschetta
Grab a few baguette slices and throw them in the toaster. While your bread is toasting, slice some cherry tomatoes and toss them in a drizzle of olive oil. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. Top the toasted bread with the tomato mixture and enjoy. It’s so good that you’ll regret not spending the semester abroad.
Peanut Butter and Jelly Yogurt Parfait
Switch up your plating and get those ~presentation~ points by layering yogurt, peanut butter (or sunflower seed butter), jam, and granola in the glass drinking cups. It’s a blast from your kindergarten past as well as a sophisticated dessert fit for a college student.
