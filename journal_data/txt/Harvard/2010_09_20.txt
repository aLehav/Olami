After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a must-win game.
While a regular season game is almost always must-win, it’s rare to find a preseason game that matters as much as Friday’s women’s soccer game. With a three-game losing streak behind them and the Ivy League season ahead, Harvard (2-3-1) came out Friday night to face University of Rhode Island (0-6-1) in a battle under the lights.
“Massive, absolutely massive,” junior Melanie Baskind explained. “We needed to get a win tonight. Lost three straight before this, so we couldn’t ask for anything better than the result we got.”
The result was a 2-1 victory for the Crimson, led by goals from co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh and Baskind. Coming off a third-consecutive loss on Friday against cross-town rival BU, Harvard displayed a needed sense of urgency against the Rams.
“I mean, [the emotion] hasn’t been there really in any of our games,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “Just playing this game, emotionally we were there. Our backs were against the wall and we knew it.”
The game began with plenty of opportunities on both sides of the field starting with junior Rebecca Millock’s penalty shot for the Crimson after refs called a handball on URI inches outside of the box.
“They were really the complete opposite from BU,” Baskind said. “They didn’t even really attempt to string together passes, it was all long balls. They played very direct so our back line was getting run at the entire game. It was a big change, and we adjusted well. We matched their intensity.”
While Millock’s shot soared inches above the crossbar, another opportunity for Harvard arrived when sophomore Aisha Price took a long shot that again crossed just above the bar and Rams goalie Sasha Reiber’s hands.
It wasn’t until four minutes before halftime when Harvard got a goal on the board. Price, known for her booming throw-ins, created confusion in front of URI’s Reiber with a throw-in that bounced off players from both teams before hitting Baskind’s cleat and the back of the net.
“I think it was just chaos,” Baskind said. “We were very excited about scoring off of the throw-in because [Price’s throw-in] is obviously a dangerous weapon that we have...I think it was just a scramble. I don’t know, just ball banging around, [then onto my] back heel, ends up in the back of the net.”
As halftime ended, the Rams took the field ready to respond to the Crimson’s 12-8 shot advantage. URI’s Stephanie Santos sent a pass that landed on the foot of Kaylen Shimoda. Shimoda’s blast from 20 yards out, her third goal of the season, flew above the reach of Crimson freshman goalkeeper Jessica Wright.
Wright, who played against BU on Thursday, had a better game against the Rams, making five saves on the night while conceding just the one score. According to Leone, Wright, who earned her first career win, will continue to switch on-and-off with sophomore AJ Millet throughout the season.
Tied at one goal apiece with 30 minutes left, the Crimson knew from experience that it was time to act. For a surprised crowd, it only took 38 seconds until Sheeleigh netted the winning goal.
“A quick little ball through the middle on a breakaway and Sheeleigh tucked it home,” Leone said. “It was awesome.”
“I think if you look at a lot of our games this year, either for or against us the goals have come in bunches,” Baskind said. “We’ve been more aware that when we get scored against, the next five minutes are massively important. Sheeleigh is a very dangerous player, so I wasn’t surprised she capitalized so quickly.”
Harvard’s defense remained solid for the remainder of the contest, locking down a Rams offense that took 10 shots in the second half. With 29 seconds remaining, URI took its last chance off of a corner kick, with goalie Reiber running down the field to help. But as time struck zero, the Crimson had the win.
“We’ve been trying to find our identity,” Leone remarked after the game. “Every year is different and so we knew Ivy Leagues were coming, and we just wanted to have a good game before, so this was really important.”
As preseason ends, play against the Ancient Eight begins. First up, the Penn Quakers, who own a 3-2-0 record with all the wins coming via shutout. After losing to BU last year and bouncing back to beat Penn, 3-2, Harvard hopes to keep this year’s winning momentum going.
“People just did their jobs today. Everyone played their part, and it worked out for us,” Baskind said. “Now we’re just looking forward to the Ivy League season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given its lack of success with third-down conversions and Harvard’s apparent ability to score at will, it was no surprise that Holy Cross decided to take its chances on fourth down during Saturday’s night game at Harvard Stadium. But the Crusaders were not rewarded for their daring. Each time a signal caller, whether it was Kevin Watson or Ryan Taggart, headed for the line of scrimmage, he was quickly knocked down by a Harvard lineman.
“Those stops were huge, obviously,” captain Collin Zych said. “Any time you can get a stop on fourth and one, that’s huge.”
The Crimson’s success at stopping fourth-down conversions—Holy Cross only got through once in five attempts—exemplified the kind of dominance the defensive line enjoyed all night.
“Our D-Line played well all night, led by [senior] Josue Ortiz, who at least from where I was standing was making a lot of plays,” Zych said. “Our defensive line was being disruptive, causing problems for the offense, and that makes everyone’s job easier.”
And yet watching the line of scrimmage itself was often misleading. While Harvard managed to break through for two sacks, including one by Ortiz which resulted in an 11-yard loss, the Crusaders’ offensive line was usually successful at protecting the pocket and giving its quarterbacks time. But it would be wrong to say that Holy Cross won the battle in the trenches, because while the Crimson didn’t always break in, it didn’t let anything out either. The Crusaders put up only 84 rushing yards all game.
ALONG FOR THE RIDE
It’s no secret that Collin Zych is a good football player—he’s been named a preseason All-American by three media organizations and preseason Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year by three more. One might have suspected that Harvard would rely heavily on Zych, especially in the early games when its new starters were figuring things out on the field.
But against the Crusaders on Saturday, the Crimson captain was barely needed. His five tackles, one of which was solo, seemed more of a luxury than a necessity. Harvard’s front seven kept the outcome under control, giving Zych just enough opportunities at the ballcarrier to make sure that he wouldn’t miss out on the fun.
And while the safety made big plays and punished any who dared challenge him, many of the biggest highlights came from a pair of linebackers new to the starting lineup, juniors Blaise Deal and Alex Gedeon.
“Our linebackers—Blaise Deal, certainly Alex Gedeon and Nick Hasselberg—all very athletic, and they can run,” Murphy said. “They’re like safeties. That helps a great deal.”
Deal, the strong-side linebacker, led Harvard with 11 tackles, four of which were solo, while Gedeon, playing on the weak side, put up the same numbers as Zych—five tackles, one solo. The pair also notched an interception each. Gedeon’s, which came 20 seconds before the end of the first half, killed any momentum Holy Cross might have been gathering on what was at that point its longest drive of the night. Deal’s came in the fourth quarter, when the Crimson was already winning by 34.
THE MORE THE MERRIER
Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 had Matt Luft. Senior Collier Winters had Chris Lorditch. Andrew Hatch doesn’t seem to have a favorite receiver—the senior starter would rather just throw to all of them.
The obvious first option would seem to be Lorditch, last year a second-team All-Ivy pick who hauled in the game-winning touchdown against Yale. And yet the senior went the entire first half without a single reception. Instead, Hatch looked to other targets, such as senior Marco Iannuzzi and junior Adam Chrissis, who helped Harvard mount a 20-0 lead by halftime. Iannuzzi hauled in a 26-yard pass to give the quarterback his first touchdown as the Crimson’s starter.
Lorditch’s silence was not to last. The senior finished the game with 74 yards and two touchdowns on four receptions, good for tops on the team.
But even with its top receiver playing up to standard, Harvard was characterized more by its balance. Three receivers—Lorditch, Iannuzzi, and junior Levi Richards—posted over 50 yards. Chrissis, who had 47 yards, was not far behind.
With a wealth of options, Hatch doesn’t have to choose a favorite receiver any time soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Andrew Hatch took his first snap on Saturday night, it was the fulfillment of a five-year-long journey that has caught the attention of media outlets across the country.
But what was still in question as the Harvard football season opened was just how good this journeyman would be.
Shedding the ‘second-string’ label in a dominant performance under the lights, the senior came out ready to prove that even after so many miles traveled and so many years of waiting, he’s the championship-caliber quarterback the Crimson has come to expect.
“They lose their quarterback for a season, and their second-string kid is probably the best quarterback in the league, and potentially the best player in their league,” said Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore. “I mean, that’s pretty scary. It speaks volumes to what Harvard has established here.”
Hatch has only held the starting job for a few weeks, after senior incumbent starter Collier Winters went down with a season-ending hip injury in preseason. But looking at a one-game sample, it seems that having the decision taken out of his hands may have been the best thing that could have happened to Harvard coach Tim Murphy.
Standing at 6’4”, Hatch is much more the stereotypical Crimson quarterback than the scrappy, 5’11” Winters. And with his 20-of-25 performance on Saturday, Hatch proved that he’s more of a pure passer than Winters—a skill that Harvard’s talented receiving corps took advantage of all night.
Hatch started the game by completing his first six passes, including three straight strikes for double-digit yardage. He finished with 276 yards and three touchdowns. And when his passes weren’t caught, it was more often than not the fault of the receiver than a misplaced throw. Three of his five incompletions came on dropped passes—including one to senior tight end Nicolai Schwarzkopf that would have been good for a touchdown.
“Whatever I called, he just made the right read, whether it was flat balls or deep balls,” Murphy said. “We dropped a deep ball, we dropped a touchdown on a choice route. I mean, we had high expectations [for Hatch], but you still never know. So from that standpoint, Andrew exceeded our expectations. It sets the bar high for the next time out.”
The field general had his highlight-reel throws—most notably the 43-yard bomb that lofted downfield right into the hands of a streaking Chris Lorditch—but it wasn’t just his arm that impressed. Hatch finished the game as the Crimson’s second-leading rusher, with 39 net yards on 11 carries highlighted by a 17-yard scamper that set up Harvard’s first touchdown.
He also proved resilient in the pocket, shaking off a would-be sack near the end of the first half and turning it into a first-down rush.
But for all the individual attention Hatch will undoubtedly continue to receive, his performance was far from a one-man show.
Playing in front of him was an offensive line that was arguably the biggest offseason question for the Crimson. After graduating four starters—including James Williams ’10, now with the Indianapolis Colts—Murphy and offensive line coach Ron Crook had their work cut out for them.
But anchored by returning senior starter Brent Osborne, the fresh-faced line came out ready to prove its readiness.
From the first series of the game, the group consistently won its battles in the trenches, giving Hatch the time to make those perfect passes and giving senior tailback Gino Gordon the space to run for 62 yards and a touchdown.
“The receivers ran good routes, and the O-line gave me time to look around and see what they were giving us,” Hatch said. “I just tried not to force anything and take what they were giving me and get a completion.”
The secret’s now out: if it can continue playing the kind of football it played last night, Harvard’s equipped to make a run to the top of the league. It’s got a quarterback who can carry a squad, an offensive line to protect him, and a veteran team that knows what it takes to win a championship.
“We were prepared,” Hatch said. “It’s always nice to get that first snap under your belt, and it’s a lot of fun to be out there.”
All the Crimson has to do is keep the magic of Saturday night’s game alive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of a record-setting night game crowd on Saturday, it seemed that the Harvard football team only did one thing wrong—it failed to give the fans a nailbiter. In a 34-6 drubbing of Holy Cross, the Crimson (1-0) excelled in every facet of the game, sending the Crusaders (1-2) to their second straight lopsided loss.
“A very solid effort across the board,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We pretty much executed the game plan as planned.”
Indeed, Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore agreed that the Crimson did not surprise his squad—it simply outplayed the visitors on both sides of the ball.
The leader of the effort on the offensive side was senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, whose first starting performance with the Crimson did not disappoint. The signal caller started out on fire, completing his first six passes and 20 of 25 overall for for 276 yards and three touchdowns.
“Hatch just made a lot of good decisions,” Murphy said. “We talked all preseason about the difference between being a good thrower and being a good quarterback. He really did a good job, other than one throw...both on his reads and when to pull it down.”
And with the passing game in sync, the running game was not far behind.
Following a short field goal from rookie David Mothander to open the scoring, Harvard took over on a failed punt at the Holy Cross 29. Faced with a short field, the Crimson pounded the ball on the ground behind a revamped offensive line. Despite having four new starters on the line, senior Gino Gordon enjoyed solid holes on three straight handoffs, dashing into the endzone for Harvard’s first touchdown of the season—and a 10-0 lead—with 1:52 left in the first quarter.
Things only got better for the Crimson in the second frame, as the defense continually stifled the Crusaders. After holding the visitors to just 30 total yards in the opening quarter, Harvard’s defense forced a three-and-out and an interception by junior linebacker Alex Gedeon to take a shutout into halftime.
“I think the highlight was our defense—we never really let up,” Murphy said. “[The Crusaders] weren’t really committed to the run. A lot of times we had eight guys in coverage, and they had no place to go with it.”
“It’s a luxury to have linebackers like we have—the defensive backs can be more aggressive,” added captain and safety Collin Zych. “We can mix up coverages and give them different looks, which is definitely a luxury, and we hope to just build on what we have.”
Meanwhile, nothing the Holy Cross defense threw at Hatch could slow down the senior gunslinger. Hatch completed four of five passes and rushed for 10 yards on the Crimson’s first drive of the second quarter, capping it off with a 26-yard strike to senior Marco Iannuzzi to put Harvard up, 17-0.
Hatch followed by orchestrating a drive down to the Crusader seven-yard line, where Mothander booted his second field goal of the day and left the Crusaders reeling.
“We’re just not making plays,” Gilmore said. “And that’s not a physical thing, it’s a mental thing. I don’t know if we’re panicking. We’re not loose enough, we’re not playing with enough confidence.”
The Crusaders went with a new quarterback, Kevin Watson, in an effort to shake things up in the second half, but the defense stifled Watson for no gain on fourth-down rushes to end Holy Cross’ first two drives. Instead, it was Harvard that struck first, as Hatch hit senior Chris Lorditch on an eight-yard touchdown pass, one of two scores for Lorditch on the day. The pair also connected on what would be Hatch’s last throw of the day—a 43-yard strike with 7:31 to go in the game, when Lorditch got behind the cornerback and safety on a post route.
“That last [throw] that I was in on to Lorditch felt pretty good,” Hatch said. “Most of them were feeling pretty good.”
Leading 34-0, the Crimson coasted to victory as the defense remained strong. Junior linebacker Blaise Deal came up with Harvard’s second interception of the day with six minutes remaining, and, although Holy Cross finally got into the endzone with a minute remaining, the 28-point victory marked a promising start for Crimson football.
“Coach Murphy has done a great job, not only recruiting the right types of players but doing a great job coaching them,” Gilmore said. “They’re very sound, very explosive in all three phases. [Harvard is] a very good football program right now.”
Although the Crimson’s resounding victory provided none of the drama of last season’s 24-21 victory over Brown in the night game, Harvard was more than happy to provide the fans with a solid showing. And in response, the crowd of 21,704 certainly gave Harvard an added boost.
“We always enjoy playing these night games,” Zych said. “The atmosphere is obviously different than the traditional one o’clock kickoffs, and a lot of guys feed off that energy and intensity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson will be looking forward to the start of its Ivy League season next week after dropping all three of its weekend contests at the Northwestern Invitational.
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-9) faced its biggest competition of the season thus far, losing to Marquette (7-5), Northwestern (10-1), and Charlotte (9-5) all in straight sets.
“Our preseason tournaments, there’s no pressure to win or anything like that. They’re just preparing us for our Ivy League games,” co-captain Miyo Pettit said. “The teams we played this weekend [were] the best competition we’ve seen so far.”
It’s no surprise that the Crimson faced a challenge against its power conference foes this weekend. Northwestern, a member of the Big 10, received votes for this week’s NCAA top 25 rankings, while Marquette from the Big East boasts a Rating Percentage Index inside the top 100 nationally.
Despite a current losing streak of six games, Harvard is hopeful for the weeks ahead. “I think this weekend we had a lot better energy than we’ve had in the past,” said sophomore Taylor Docter, a key contributor this weekend. “I think everyone’s just really looking forward to next weekend. Hopefully we’ll enter strong against Dartmouth.”
CHARLOTTE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard fell, 25-18, 25-18, 25-16, in its final game Saturday to Charlotte.
“Getting a winning mentality was something we needed to take away from this weekend,” Pettit said at the conclusion of the three tournament matches.
Junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll had a team-high five kills, and received help from junior Christine Wu, who led the Crimson with eight digs and two aces.
After a weekend of play over 1,000 miles away from home, Harvard had started to feel the effects of its eight-game roadstand.
“This year we have been traveling a lot more than last year,” Docter said. “It’s tiring and draining being on the road.”
While the team will have to wait until October to host its first opponent since Sept. 4, a matchup at Dartmouth will serve as a much more familiar, closer, and friendlier environment.
NORTHWESTERN 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard started its Saturday against the tournament’s host, losing to Northwestern, 25-19, 25-13, 25-20.
Senior Mikaelle Comrie paced Harvard with eight kills, and Docter tallied up five kills and eight digs. Northwestern totaled 40 kills, while Harvard managed only 27.
Despite Northwestern’s convincing victory, Pettit remained optimistic after the match.
“Northwestern is a very competitive, high-level team, and we held our own against them,” the co-captain said. “We were leading most of the first set. That was something very good for our confidence level, recognizing that we can play at a very high level.”
Ingersoll agreed, stating that the match was “a good building-off point for us to take into Ivies next week.”
Pettit believes that after playing point-for-point with a top-level Big 10 squad, the team has grown even closer and is working even stronger together as a unit.
“Volleyball is a game of movement, and momentum comes from good team chemistry, and that was there today and this weekend,” Pettit said.
MARQUETTE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard started off its tournament Friday night with a straight-sets defeat, losing to Charlotte, 25-15, 25-15, 25-18.
Comrie and Wu led the way for the Crimson with eight kills and 10 digs, respectively. The Crimson also got help from its young core, with freshmen and sophomores representing four of the match’s six starters.
“A lot of the sophomores and freshmen are really stepping up,” Pettit said. “I’m seeing it after every single set, getting that experience under our belt with these preseason games.”
Pettit admitted that while the team’s developing youngsters continue to improve, the group is a step away from being able to compete at its highest level.
“We still haven’t established consistent play,” Pettit said. “Something that we need to work on is playing to 25, finishing the game. And then I think the wins will come.”
The night’s low point struck when freshman starting setter Natalie Doyle suffered an ankle sprain, an injury that would cause her to miss the rest of the tournament. Matters became worse when, shortly after the match, fellow freshman starter Teresa Skelly came down with food poisoning. Both players hope to be in action for Harvard’s next match, when the squad travels up to Dartmouth on Friday to kick off its Ivy League season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After surging through its first few games of the season, the No. 6 men’s soccer team has finally been tripped up.
The Crimson (2-1-1) fell to UC Santa Barbara (1-2-2), 2-0, Friday night at the Lobo Classic on the campus of the University of New Mexico. It was the first time since October 2009 that the team was shut out in a regular season match.
Junior forward Joe Eubanks and freshman forward David Opoku both scored their first goals of the season for the Gauchos, who earned their first win after starting the season ranked No. 8 nationally in the preseason polls.
“It was a tough game,” co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “Santa Barbara’s a very good opponent. Both teams got opportunities to make their mark on the game and they were fortunate in being able to convert on their opportunities.”
Unlike its previous game when Connecticut got off 25 shots, the Harvard defense was able to hold Santa Barbara to 10 attempts, but six of those were on goal. Junior goalie Austin Harms made four saves in defeat for the Crimson.
The Harvard offense, for its part, was held to single digits in shots for the second-straight match. The team managed only eight attempts, five of which were on goal and saved by Santa Barbara goalie Sam Hayden.
“That’s something that we talked a lot about after the game,” sophomore forward Brian Rogers said. “Right now we’re kind of struggling going forward. We’re not creating as many opportunities as we really should be for the kind of talent we have.”
The disparity was greatest in the first half, when the Crimson was outshot 8-2 and 5-1 on net.
In the 40th minute, the Gauchos had their first strong scoring opportunity, but junior defenseman Chris Hunter drilled the crossbar with a shot. Moments later, after applying continuous pressure, sophomore forward Sam Garza sent a cross pass to Eubanks in the box, and Eubanks buried the ball into the left corner of the goal to put his team up, 1-0.
“I was pretty happy with our performance for the most part,” LaGreca said of the defense. “There were a few instances where we could have kept ourselves a little more organized, but Santa Barbara has some pretty talented players, and we were able to shut them down for the majority of the game.”
Harvard opened the second half with back-to-back shot attempts by sophomores Zack Wolfenzon and Rogers, but Hayden was able to make saves on both.
“I thought that it was a hard-fought game,” Rogers said. “But we didn’t play particularly well; it was a bit of a disappointment.”
With 3:16 remaining in the contest, Santa Barbara was able to add the dagger, when Opoku beat Harms one-on-one inside the box for his first collegiate goal.
Final minute desperation attempts by freshmen Kyle Henderson and Ross Friedman were saved by Hayden and missed high, respectively, and the Gauchos came away with the shutout.
Garza led the game with three shots on goal. Sophomore forwards Scott Prozeller and Rogers led Harvard with two shots on net apiece after being the only Crimson offensive players to play a full 90 minutes.
After the game, Rogers admitted that with the team’s offensive struggles, he occasionally feels extra pressure to score as his team’s go-to offensive option. But the forward said he knows that as his young teammates develop and the team grows, its only a matter of time before the goals start picking up.
“I think that I’m someone that people look to to score,” Rogers said. “But at the same time I think we’ll get into trouble if we rely too heavily on me...it’s still pretty early in the season, and we have a lot of freshmen that are really talented. I think we’ll really start to hit our stride when we become more comfortable with each other and get more people involved.”
Both LaGreca and Rogers said that the long flight, the time change, and the different environment—playing nearly a mile above sea level, in temperatures far warmer than the team was accustomed to in Cambridge—all could have had a small impact on the squad’s play, but neither wanted to make excuses.
“The other team was playing in the same environment,” Rogers said. “If we want to be the kind of team that we want to be, we have to be able to play in any environment and overcome those things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team traveled to Farmingdale, N.Y., last weekend to participate in The McLaughlin at the Bethpage Red Course. The 15-team tournament—the Crimson’s second event of the season—was hosted by St. John’s and featured a mix of Ivy and non-Ivy programs.
Although Harvard set a school record for lowest team score in a three-round tournament with a total of 856 strokes, it ultimately finished tied for seventh place.
“It was nice to see we had some consistent low scores,” junior captain Tony Grillo said. “But as a team, we were definitely disappointed, because we got beaten by a fairly large margin.”
The site of the tournament, the Red Course, is one of five courses in Bethpage State Park. The Black Course played host to the U.S. Open in 2002 and 2009.
“Bethpage Red was a very different layout than what we’re used to,” freshman Seiji Liu said. “It had some long holes and some tricky short ones, but the course itself was changed when [it rained] the night before the event. It changed it from firm and fast conditions to very soggy and wet.”
Last year at The McLaughlin, the Crimson had its best showing of the fall. Harvard finished fifth out of 18 teams, shooting an 858—then a record for the lowest three-round score. Greg Shuman ’10 claimed a share of the individual championship by carding a 208, the lowest tournament score in school history by five strokes.
Seeking to replicate last year’s success, the Crimson opened the tournament on Friday morning.
With overcast skies and tough winds, Harvard shot a 285 in the opening round, putting it six strokes behind Villanova for the lead.
Freshman Theo Lederhausen led the team as he tallied a 69, one under par. Junior Mark Pollak was right behind Lederhausen, shooting an even-par 70, and he was followed by Liu (71), Grillo (75), and junior Connor Wentzell (76).
“It’s really good to see the freshmen are playing well,” Grillo said. “Last week it was Seiji Liu who went out and won most of his matches handily when Theo didn’t have a great week, and this week Theo turned right around and was able to post a low score to keep us in there for the first round.”
“You don’t normally have that kind of backing from freshmen,” he added.
“It just shows that Harvard’s program is moving forward in the right direction,” said Liu of his class’s impact.
In the afternoon, the Crimson carded a 284. This time, Grillo led the way, recovering from his early round and firing a much-improved 68.
“[My swing] just came together a little bit for me in the second round, and I was able to hold on and make some putts to shoot a low score,” he said.
Pollak, Lederhausen, and Liu demonstrated consistency, posting a 71, 72, and 73, respectively.
Harvard came into Saturday’s final round 10 strokes behind tournament leader Princeton. Although the Crimson failed to catch its Ivy rival, Grillo’s round-best 71 and a 72 apiece from Pollak, Lederhausen, and Liu carried the team to its record finish.
“Although we didn’t win the event, our scores for the three days were very strong and consistent,” Liu said.
Overall, Pollak and Lederhauser tied for the team lead with 213 strokes. Grillo finished with 214, Liu with 216, and Wentzell with 229.
The Tigers, whom Harvard beat handily last week, came in second place shooting an 840, two strokes behind West Florida. Villanova, Sacred Heart, and IUPUI rounded out the top five.
“It was disappointing to see [Princeton] so far ahead of us this week,” Grillo said. “We feel like we are a better team than them and feel like we are a good enough team to have won [The McLaughlin]. It just wasn’t our week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The engines are slowing down for the No. 6 Harvard men’s soccer team (2-1-2) after an energetic start to the season.
The Crimson was caught in a scoreless deadlock, the second of the season, against New Mexico (3-1-2) yesterday afternoon. Even after double overtime under the Albuquerque sun, both teams failed to find the back of the net, though not from a lack of opportunities. Harvard fired seven shots while the Lobos had 14, seven of which junior goalkeeper Austin Harms had to prevent from going in.
“In the first half, I thought we were a little better,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “We pressured them well, and we had a few more attacking opportunities than they did. In the second half, though, we thought UNM got hold of the game, and they pressured us, and they clearly had the better opportunities on goal.”
Those opportunities kept Harms busy for most of the second half, but it was Harvard that set the tone early on, with a type of high-quality soccer that was much different from the way the team played in its loss against UC Santa Barbara on Friday.
The Crimson was able to control UNM’s flair and create opportunities for itself. Junior Baba Omosegbon had a shot on goal early in the game, and 20 minutes later, sophomore forward Brian Rogers took a shot at goalkeeper Justin Holmes, but Holmes successfully took care of each opportunity.
New Mexico failed to have a successful shot at Harms in the first half, and the drought continued into the first few minutes of the second half. But eventually, Harvard let down just enough for the hosts to take advantage of the opportunity.
The Lobos’ Michael Green challenged the Crimson goalkeeper with two shots in the 67th minute, warning Harms of what was yet to come.
New Mexico bombarded Harvard in the second half with 11 shots, testing Harms in a variety of ways.
The junior had to block Ryan Farquharson’s shot right after the sequence with Green, and, only a couple of minutes later, Harms had to block a header from Green again.
“Harms in goal played incredibly well,” Junot said. “He bailed us out in both games. Ultimately against Santa Barbara they had too much attack, and Harms couldn’t save [the two goals], but today he played fantastic, perhaps the best player on the field.”
Without a score in either half, both teams went into overtime, but fatigue played a part in the pace of the game. The match turned into an exchange of counterattacks but only to result in a lack of goals.
“We have talented enough players to play beautiful soccer, but a lot of the time we get pressured,” Harms said. “We’re lobbing balls forward behind the defense and just letting our forwards run onto it, which is sometimes an effective method, but in my opinion we have talent to combine and really get in behind teams like that.”
The Crimson’s sole shot on goal after the first half came off the foot of sophomore Scott Prozeller in the first period of overtime. But Holmes turned this attempt away too, preserving his clean sheet. Harms also earned a shutout, the 14th of his career, despite having to work much harder for it.
The Harvard backstop nearly helped the Crimson steal a late-game score after saving a shot from Lance Rozeboom. Harms played the ball up as Harvard put a series of passes together to get freshman forward Connor McCarthy a chance to shoot. His attempt flew high, though, sending the Crimson to a scoreless tie.
“I think the hardest thing to do in soccer is to score a goal,” Junot said. “Friday and [yesterday], I thought we improved dramatically in our attacking play. You can’t put your finger on why you don’t score goals in the game, but at the end of the day you don’t lose games if other teams don’t score on you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite losing its first two matches, the Harvard men’s water polo team rebounded in convincing fashion to easily win its third and final game in the annual Eastern College Athletic Conference Men’s Water Polo Championships, held at the Blodgett Pool last weekend. Tenth-seeded Harvard finished a disappointing 11th out of 12 teams.
The Crimson (3-7) began the tournament on Friday in a highly-anticipated matchup against crosstown rival MIT, losing on the Engineers’ fourth-quarter goal in a thrilling 7-6 defeat. In Saturday’s contest, Harvard proved to be no match for 11th-seeded Mercyhurst, which resoundingly defeated the Crimson, 11-3. After the lopsided loss came Harvard’s lopsided win, a 19-3 rout over Washington and Jefferson.
The fact that the tournament was at Harvard made it that much more important to the team.
“We talked about protecting our house and not letting people come in and beat us in our home,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We wanted to make a statement that we know what we’re doing...[and that] Harvard water polo is going to be something people here on campus are...very proud of.“
HARVARD 19, WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON 3
In its final match of the tournament yesterday, the Crimson dominated from the outset to the conclusion.
Indeed, after scoring twice in the first minute and a half, Harvard did not relent, netting seven goals in the first period and tacking on seven more in the second. In addition to the solid offense, the defense stifled nearly every opportunity that the opposing team had, accounting for the Crimson’s 14-2 lead at the half.
The Presidents (0-5) only managed to add one score in the second half, while 11 different Crimson players had found the back of the net by the end of the contest. Harvard’s 19 goals are the team’s most in a game this season.
Despite a shaky start to the tournament, Minnis was pleased with the team’s play in its final match.
“[We] played really hard on defense,” Minnis said. “And we didn’t let them believe they could play with us at any point. I was very proud of the way the boys played.”
MERCYHURST 11, HARVARD 3
After losing a nailbiter against MIT the previous day, Harvard took on Mercyhurst (4-3) looking to bounce back on Saturday. But throughout the game, the home team failed to keep up with the opposing Lakers. Only down by one after the first period, the Crimson faded in the rest of the match, only scoring once more in the final three periods while Mercyhurst scored eight times.
A part of Harvard’s problem was squandered opportunity: though the Crimson had a total of 12 6-on-5 advantages near the Lakers’ goal, Harvard scored only once with a man up. In addition, Mercyhurst utilized the drop—a defensive strategy to which the Crimson had little exposure—in which the Laker defenders crashed towards the goal to take away Harvard’s advantage.
Minnis summarized the loss succinctly: “It was ugly.”
MIT 7, HARVARD 6
Harvard squared off against MIT (3-3) on Friday in a packed Blodgett Pool, filled with the din of pot-clanging MIT students. While the Crimson only surrendered one goal in the first period, the defense began to slip in the second, allowing four scores. Meanwhile, Harvard could not find its rhythm offensively, stifled by the Engineers’ defense.
It took more than four minutes for the Crimson to take its first shot, and Harvard entered halftime down 5-0. The second half seemed to be a completely different game.
Fueled by Minnis’ halftime speech, which, according to senior driver Jeff Lee, “really fired us up,” the Crimson scored three times in total in the third period, making the score 6-3. Lee scored two of the goals.
In the final period, Harvard quickly scored twice, and junior co-captain Luka Babic nailed a long-distance equalizer with 4:54 left in regulation. Nevertheless, the Crimson failed to hang on to the tie, and the Engineers’ goal later in the period proved to be the deciding one.
The game could have been much more lopsided had it not been for the play of junior goalkeeper Alexandre Popp. His 15 saves mark his highest total this season and tied a career best.
“Teddy’s been telling me all season: ‘You gotta make the saves you need to make, and the one or two extra saves to change the momentum,’” Popp said. “And that’s what I was telling myself all during warm-up: it’s going to be a close game. I gotta do my job and a little extra.”
Popp’s mental preparation paid dividends.
“Alex had a couple really key saves,” Lee said.
Lee also played an integral part in the team’s comeback, as his hat trick accounted for half of the team’s goals.
“Jeff is Jeff,” Minnis said. “He comes out there and he plays hard and he goes and gets those goals when we need some goals.”
Nevertheless, Minnis focused not on the accomplishments of the individual but of the team.
“We win as a group, and we lose as a group, and I think tonight was a total team effort by everyone,” he said.

The rust of a long offseason can take quite a while to shake off, as the Harvard women’s golf team realized at this weekend’s Princeton Invitational.
Shooting a 54-hole team total of 920, the Crimson finished sixth out of 12 squads at the two-day tournament, held at Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, N.J beginning Saturday.
“It’s obviously quite a disappointing start to the season,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It is just one tournament; it’s the first tournament of the year.”
“There’s a lot of things to be sorted out, and it’s a long year, but certainly we would have liked to have put forth a stronger result in relation to the other teams,” he added.
Accumulating a three-round score of 896, Yale took first in the team competition, followed by Princeton and reigning Ivy champion Penn, which turned in scores of 899 and 907, respectively.
Rounding out the top five were Georgetown and Rollins College, the champion of last year’s tournament. Seventh-place Columbia was the only league representative to finish behind the Crimson, which had finished second at the event in 2009.
The strong play of each of the Ivy squads may signal a general trend of improvement in the Ancient Eight.
“One thing that’s very clear is that the league has gotten a lot stronger,” Rhoads said. “What we shot this year, in other years, probably would have been good enough for first, or second, or third, at the very least, and this year it was good enough for sixth.”
“What was good enough is not good enough anymore,” he added. “It’s a good wake-up call for us.”
The only golfer in the field to end up below par on the 6,108-yard, par-72 course, Bulldog freshman Seo Hee Moon took home the top individual prize, firing a three-under 213.
Harvard’s best finisher was freshman Bonnie Hu, who tied for fourth overall with a six-over 222.
The highly-touted rookie—ranked ninth in her class by the National Junior Scoreboard—had her best performance in the second round, when she started out hot to reach four-under early and ended up with a two-under 70.
“I was just making a lot of putts and getting up and down a lot,” Hu said. “I didn’t actually hit that many greens, but I kept making pars...and actually quite a few birdies.”
“She has no real weaknesses in her game,” Rhoads added. “She hits it far, she hits it straight. She chips well, and she putts very well.”
Junior Christine Cho contributed Harvard’s second-best score of the weekend, as her nine-over 225 was good for a tie for 10th place.
Cho, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, recovered from a first-round 79 to fire a pair of 73s.
“She had an illness at the beginning of the summer where she lost a bunch of weight and some strength, so she’s trying to get her distance back,” Rhoads noted.
Each of the Crimson golfers had her lowest-scoring round in her second time around the course.
“I was certainly proud of how they bounced back after quite an uncharacteristically high first round,” Rhoads said. “They did okay in the third round.”
Next up was rookie Fritzie Reuter, whose total of 237 put her in a tie for 32nd, and just one stroke behind was captain Mia Kabasakalis, who tied for 35th.
The team’s only senior, Kabasakalis agreed with her coach’s assessment of the squad’s difficulties in returning from a long and busy summer.
“We are maybe a little bit rustier than we were last year, and a little bit less prepared, and everybody else in the league played better than last year,” she said. “That set us back a lot, and so I think we need to use this as motivation...we can do better.”
Sophomore Katie Sylvan, the league’s top rookie last season, was the final Harvard finisher of the weekend, as she tied for 47th.
The Crimson now must regroup and prepare for next week’s Golfweek Conference Challenge in Vail, Colo., where it will come up against what is likely the strongest field it will face all year.
At last year’s competition the squad placed an impressive seventh out of 18 of the nation’s top teams, but it appears that Harvard will now need to make up some ground on teams within its own conference.
“It’s an unfamiliar territory for the team, but it’ll be good for them, to see how they respond,” Rhoads said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (2-4, 0-1 Ivy) lost in the final minutes of Saturday’s game against rival Yale (4-1, 1-0 Ivy) at Jordan Field, thus continuing a four-game skid. With less than four minutes left on the clock, Bulldog junior Mia Rosati took a pass from freshman teammate Georgia Holland and managed to push the ball across the line through a crowded goal-line scramble.
The goal represented the only blemish on the day for sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, who stymied a feverish Yale attack all game long with six saves. Tassopulos’ play kept the Crimson in the game throughout the contest, as the Bulldogs enjoyed a majority of the possessions, piecing several dangerous attacks together and finally culminating in Rosati’s game-winner.
Tassopoulos ranks second in the Ancient Eight in saves (34) and third in goals-against average (1.59). The sophomore was an All-Ivy honorable mention in 2009.
Afterward, Harvard coach Sue Caples was quick to acknowledge the stalwart defense exhibited by her keeper.
“You really don’t want goalies to have to make amazing saves,” Caples said. “She has been standing on her head a little bit. Yale had some very high-percentage goal-scoring opportunities. [Cynthia]’s a very smart goalkeeper, very skilled and in some ways made some things look routine. She came up with some big saves today, definitely.”
The Crimson worked hard defensively all afternoon, consistently frustrating the Bulldogs’ attack—currently ranked third in the Ivy League in scoring average.
As time was winding down, it appeared that the game would head into overtime, but Yale’s late goal ended the possibility, and Harvard could not respond with three minutes left.
The Crimson had several good chances to score throughout the game but could not capitalize. In the final minute of the second half, a defensive interception caused a breakaway, producing a shot on the Bulldogs’ goal that slid just wide. Freshman Emily Cain, Yale’s second-half keeper, blocked a promising Harvard shot in the second half with 22 minutes to go to keep it scoreless.
The Crimson’s best chance of the game occurred in the last 18 minutes of play when Harvard forced a turnover in the Bulldogs’ defensive third. Senior forward Chloe Keating intercepted a Yale pass and quickly slid the ball to freshman Rachael Rosenfeld, who fired off a rocket from the left side of the field—only to see Cain deftly redirect the ball wide of the post.
After a first half in which the Crimson seemed to be back on its heels, Harvard came out organized and aggressive to open the second. In the opening moments of the second half, sophomore forward Katelin Wahl fired a shot that sailed just high of the cage.
The Bulldogs once again resumed their advantage in possession, working the ball around and searching for a way through the determined Harvard defense. Harvard’s best spell occurred with about 20 minutes to play, when the Crimson had several shots on goal—all of which fell just wide or were deflected.
“I’m pretty disappointed about the outcome, but I’m proud of the girls and how they played,” junior co-captain Carly Dickson said. “It’s a totally different feel then the rest of the Ivy League games. In the locker room, everyone is so pumped up.”
Dickson had a solid afternoon, leading Harvard with three shots, one of which was on goal, and playing all 70 minutes of the game. Yale outshot the Crimson, 17-5, and also held a 9-3 advantage in penalty corners.
Harvard will look to regroup at home against Northeastern next Wednesday before heading to Philadelphia this weekend to battle Penn in its second Ivy League tilt.

The Harvard cross country teams started off their seasons on the right foot this Saturday as they traveled to Van Courtlandt Park in New York to compete in the Iona Meet of Champions. The men’s team finished fifth, while the women placed 13th in the first race of the season.
“We went into the race with two goals, to get a race under our belts and to see the course that we were going to run at in the Ivy League Championships,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “We accomplished both of those goals and...I was happy with the results.”
While many of the more seasoned veterans rested for the meet against Yale this Friday, Iona was an opportunity for some of the other runners to gain more experience.
“We wanted to give some of the other kids an opportunity to get a race under their belt,” Saretsky said. “That way, they could be that much sharper and that much better prepared for this Friday’s race.”
But the athletes didn’t need to wait until Friday to start delivering results.
On the men’s side, the freshmen led the way for Harvard, posting four of the top five times in the 8K to help the Crimson to a top-five finish in the 19-team field.
“[For the men’s team,] the story is in the strength of our freshmen,” Saretsky said. “Having four freshmen in our top five really stuck out in my mind, and it was great to see.”
Rookie Maksim Korolev started off Harvard and crossed the line in 25:31, placing 11th overall in the first race of his collegiate career. Fellow freshman Kurt Ruegg finished 24th at 25:59 and was closely followed by classmates Aaron Watanabe and Kellen Blumberg. Sophomore Stewart Richardson rounded out the top five runners with a 54th-place finish and a time of 26:19, leaving only 20 seconds between the Crimson’s second and fifth runners.
“All of the guys did a really great job yesterday, especially the freshmen,” junior Alison Lee said. “They were in a great pack, really communicated, and pushed each other along. I think that shows how the rest of the season is going to be for the men’s and women’s side...a really unified team.”
On the women’s side, the seniors had a stronger presence in the top five runners while the freshmen continued to perform, earning the Crimson its 13th place finish in the 6K, 18-team field.
Senior track captain Thea Lee successfully crossed over to more rugged terrain as the top finisher for Harvard, crossing the line in 23:36 and placing 61st overall. Senior Cara Sprague and freshman Catherine Hasbrouck earned 73rd and 76th with times of 24:08 and 24:09, respectively, followed by senior Jamie Olson and Alison Lee in 83rd and 91st place.
“I think it was a great race for all of us, a really good effort,” Alison Lee said. “[Hasbrouck] ran well in her first race for us as a freshman, and I think overall the team did well for our first race of the season.”
With the depth of the Crimson roster and an impressive showing from the freshman class, the rest of the season seems promising for the cross-country squads.
“We did great last season, and I’m excited to see how we build off of that,” Alison Lee said. “We have a lot of upperclassmen this year and a really experienced team, so I am hoping that will continue to push the freshmen to do well. They’ve already been doing a great job, and I’m excited for us to all continue to improve together.”
“We are really looking forward to continuing to develop and continuing to get better,” Saretsky said. “It’s going to take a lot of hard work, and we have a lot more in store in front of us, but I think we are off to a great start.”

Plans for Boeing to move into the space-tourism field have touched off controversy on the future role of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the direction of government involvement in space travel. Ultimately, allowing the private sector into space transit and tourism is a smart decision.
The plans call for private flights to bring a mix of people—likely four International Space Station crewmembers and three tourists—up at a time. Such flights are simply transit ones and offer little scientific value. Still, because the crewmembers can conduct important research once inside the I.S.S., NASA will now be able to devote its attention to those experiments along with other valuable endeavors on Earth, rather than allotting resources to launching the astronauts themselves.
Space tourism will draw attention to NASA’s work, specifically the attention of a high-yield pool of executives and innovators who will be paying the incredibly steep fares for their trips. The interest that such flights bring will likely translate into eventual funding opportunities, offering both the prospect of new major investors and competition to Boeing in the aerospace sector.
However, a key role still remains for the U.S. government in our exploration of space. While the government is right to include Boeing and others in some of those endeavors, it cannot pass off all responsibility to private companies. The U.S. must continue to fund NASA and promote scientific research, like the experiments being conducted on the I.S.S. Such inquiry both contributes to the public good and has the potential to create future jobs. It is also worth noting that the government and NASA will provide some funding and support for Boeing’s project, because no company would take the risk of such development without government backing.
In the early years of NASA, the prospect of flying to the moon and the excitement of space travel drove children to study science and consider a career track oriented toward space exploration. Although many such students did not ultimately choose to pursue scientific careers, their increased interest improved the public’s scientific understanding and led to more people seeing value in space-related projects. We hope that the development of space tourism and the new innovation made possible by including the private sector will have a similar effect in the years to come.
Cooperation between private companies and the government is essential as we further develop technology for the research and exploration of space. Moving forward, the U.S. must also play an increasingly important role in international space affairs. Although private companies like Boeing may be the ones physically bringing people off of Earth, there will be a need for governments back on our planet to regulate the industry. As issues of access and rights in space develop, we hope that the U.S. maintains active involvement in those affairs.
Innovation in space transit and research is key. If that innovation comes courtesy of the private sector’s pursuit of space-tourism profits, the public will nevertheless benefit from greater knowledge of the universe around us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The New York Times described this city as a “palm-fringed Middle Eastern city [that] is bingeing on new buildings and cultural projects” with a “fast-expanding night-life strip, an upstart design district, new hotels and the country’s first contemporary art museum.” This particular city was also named the destination of the year in 2009 by The New York Times as well as Lonely Planet. You might start to think I was talking of Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Antalya, or even Larnaca—the favored tourist destinations in the Middle East.
I am in fact talking about Beirut, Lebanon’s  capital (not the drinking game). Currently, the U.S. Department of State “continues to urge U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Lebanon  due to current safety and security concerns.” And in compliance with this warning, Harvard College offers no funding or sponsorship to students  who are interested in studying there. The U.S. travel warning needs to be  revisited in light of the new developments in the country, and the College  should re-evaluate this policy in order to encourage academic inquiry there.
The warning, issued in March of 2009, came before a pivotal election, which gave U.S.-backed politicians majority in Parliament and resulted in a unity government. The unity government came to resolve political tension that had governed the country since 2005, and it so far has maintained an enviable security record relative to the region with the exception of a recent incident last August. The British government has updated its travel warning since then to include only certain places in Lebanon where security might be an issue, South Lebanon and the Palestinian refugee camps. Moreover, 2009 saw almost 1.85 million tourists visiting the country, and the number is expected to increase for 2010. To keep this in perspective, note that Lebanon has less than four million inhabitants.
The U.S warning references a few examples of sporadic violent outbreaks, notably the 2006 summer war between Lebanon and Israel and the fighting that occurred between supporters of Hezbollah and those of the Future movement that resulted in the blocking of roads leading to and from the Lebanese airport. But both incidents came as a result of building political tensions and other internal factors, which have since been negated, due to the unity government and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Additionally, evacuation of foreigners in these two incidences was remarkably easy. Any foreign citizen on Lebanese grounds could have easily left either by driving to Damascus, two hours away, or by sailing to Cyprus.
Travel and study in Lebanon are sure to be uniquely rewarding. Lebanon is a scenic country, it has a diverse culture, and it has unique demographic interactions that are worthy of study. Eighteen different religious groups coexist in Lebanon under the rule of a democratic parliamentary system that is heavily influenced by religion. Moreover, the National Museum contains relics over 6,000 years old showcasing life in Lebanon from the Phoenicians to the Ottomans, passing by the Romans and the Crusaders. Biodiversity in Lebanon is one of the richest in the world, with terrain ranging from coastal strips to 10,000 feet high mountains.
Lebanon is also home to some of the oldest universities in the Middle East and some of its best. Both the American University of Beirut and the Lebanese American University are registered in the state of New York, and their degrees are internationally accredited. Recently, LAU opened a medical school in collaboration with Partners Harvard Medical International. Also, Clemenceau Medical Center recently opened in Beirut in partnership with Johns Hopkins  University and was ranked among the top 10 hospitals for Medical Tourism.
Lebanon has a lot to offer students in various academic fields, and the current political climate allows students to enjoy it in the midst of a peaceful economic boom. It is, hence, regrettable that the U.S. Department of State urges its citizens to refrain from visiting this Middle Eastern haven, and it is even more regrettable that Harvard refuses to offer sponsorship and funding to students interested in experiencing all that Lebanon has to offer. Students would then see for themselves why Beirut is the Paris of the Middle East.
Elias A. Shaaya ’12, a Crimson associate editorial editor, is a molecular and cellular biology concentrator in Eliot House. He is a Lebanese citizen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been called “the joke of journalism.” Osama Saraya, the man ultimately responsible for its publication, fancies it “expressive.” There is a lot one can say about the doctored photo of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, which upon its discovery has become a media sensation and a source of embarrassment to the Egypt government and its official newspaper (and apparent Photoshop user) Al-Ahram. Funny? The comparison of the photos is, undoubtedly. Inspiration for online parodies? Done—you can see Mubarak lead the moon landing. But CNN has called the controversy a triumph of new versus old in media—and in this case falls guilty of wrongly extrapolating from Western expectations.
Al-Ahram’s sneaky attempt to place Egypt in the forefront of the peace process was spotted by blogger Wael Khalil, whose blog post has since made the rounds of major media publications. Khalil himself seems to be amused by the attention his post has received—as recounted by the Huffington Post, his Twitter account announces, “Currently enjoying my moment as a famed blogger.” Video of the procession of leaders confirms Khalil as correct.
Given Al-Ahram’s reputation as a government-supporting publication—its directors are officially appointed—one might assume that the move was a subtle one related to regional politics. Placing Mubarak in front of Obama and the Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian leaders could imply Egypt possessing a leadership role in the Middle East peace talks. Taking a step back, Al-Ahram’s decision would seemingly indicate self-doubt about Egypt’s leader’s role, with the paper uncomfortable showing him in the back of the group.
Adding to the embarrassment would be the stance of CNN’s Middle East blog, “Inside the Middle East”—that new media in Egypt can now pack a punch and reach a wide audience, while Al-Ahram is fumbling and out of touch.
Unfortunately for lovers of “new media”—presumably CNN’s phrase for “blogs plus Twitter”—the reality may not be so convenient. In what will be a standard for this column, Pros and Kons consulted Harvard’s resident expert on Mubarak and Egyptian affairs: E. Roger Owen, A.J. Meyer Professor of Middle East History and former Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. According to Owen, this Photoshop controversy is less impressive when one realizes that editing is the standard for a publication like Al-Ahram. “I would assume that every photo of Mubarak is photoshopped,” Owen said. Subtly (or in this case, more blatantly) altering how a leader is presented is more common than not in the region.
Most important to the whole controversy, Owen points out, is the man who is not in the picture: Mubarak’s son, Gamal, party leader in the ruling party’s National Democrat Party, and the heir-apparent to President Mubarak, if the NDP has its way. Mubarak has been rumored to have terminal cancer—Owen, for his part, is convinced—and the looming succession dominates Egyptian politics. With the army uneasy about Gamal, Egypt faces a time of general uncertainty about its leadership.
The element lost in all this is that Al-Ahram’s purpose was more likely intended to encourage those already supporting Mubarak, not deceive a general populace potentially not favoring the leader. While British publications and, to a lesser extent, CNN, have found in this an angle convenient to the West—masquerading biased media is busted and its true colors exposed—Al-Ahram does not carry that expectation. According to Owen, the Al-Ahram experience is just one part of a triangulation Egyptian people must conduct to determine news.
Stateside, we have different expectations of media. The risk of misinterpreting stories like this will always exist, simply due to the difference of cultures. There is a greater risk, however, when events seem to mirror trends we can observe at home. It’s all the rage to gush about tweeting and new media in the U.S. alongside talk of the death of traditional media (still counting down to that one). The rise of new media, however, hasn’t necessarily become a relevant theme in a place such as Egypt. According to Owen, bloggers in the Arab-speaking world are still a rare breed in a place where people listen to radio (BBC, Israeli) for news.
What we see here is a long-time leader on his last legs. Whether those legs carry him to the front of a group of leaders or the back in a photo can yield amusing results. Either way, an octogenarian leader was walking pretty spritely, considering, and the big question will be how his son fares in those shoes.
Egypt’s establishment may be concerned right now, but not because of its role in the peace process or in a photograph. And as to those who allegedly will have lost faith in Al-Ahram as a balanced publication? Owen perhaps puts it best: “Unhappy you, if you are reduced to only Egyptian media.”

To the editors:
I’m writing to voice my disappointment with the Sept. 16 Crimson Staff Editorial, “The Blog and the Fury,” in which the Crimson asserted that Martin H. Peretz’s claim that Muslim life cheap “may have begun with a kernel of truth.”
While the editorial makes clear that the Crimson Staff does not support Peretz’s comments, statements of this nature implicitly condone the motives that drove Peretz to write his piece. In calling Peretz’s written statements an “oversimplification” of the truth, is the Crimson suggesting that a more toned-down version of the former Harvard professor’s editorial would have been acceptable? I do not know what kernel of truth the Crimson may be referring to, but if anything, Peretz’s comments are based on a fundamental lack of cultural sensitivity and an outright misrepresentation of the Muslim people.
The Crimson also attempts to downplay the consequences of Peretz’s remarks. What has followed Peretz’s Sept. 4 editorial is anything but “a small media firestorm.” In fact, these remarks have been attacked by dozens of national publications and more than 4,000 political blogs. A simple Google search on the issue yields half a million hits. At a time when events like the Marc Hauser scandal shake the integrity of this university, prominent members of our community like Marty Peretz should be subject to even higher standards. Downplaying the Peretz remarks is inappropriate to say the least.
I hope that the Crimson reflects carefully upon the values that its staff members hold dear and upon the role its editorials play in broadcasting the principles and beliefs of this great university.

Harvard University received donations worth $596 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, down slightly from the $602 million raised a year earlier.
Despite the slight decline, the year’s numbers encouraged Harvard’s fundraisers during last year’s weak economy.
“In a time when people were feeling uncertain, we feel very good about that,” said Tamara E. Rogers ’74, Harvard’s vice president for alumni affairs and development, referring to the fundraising total.
The number of donors increased in fiscal year 2010, but they tended to give slightly lower amounts on average than last year.
“We didn’t see as many huge gifts as we have in past years, but we did see good, solid performance,” Rogers said.
Harvard has not yet released fundraising numbers for individual schools, but the Faculty of Arts and Sciences exceeded its goal of raising $40 million dollars in current-use funds. Those funds can be spent immediately for any purpose, making them especially desirable for FAS administrators cutting budgets.
The University did not disclose what portion of this year’s receipts were available for current use versus investment in the endowment.
The total announced today includes only cash received in fiscal year 2010 and does not include money that has been pledged but not received.
Among Harvard’s professional schools, Harvard Business School, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard Kennedy School had the strongest fundraising years.
According to Rogers, peer institutions’ fundraising numbers were similar to Harvard’s totals.
“It’s hard to compare to our exact peers because most are in or have just completed [capital] campaigns, but it looks in a preliminary way that holding steady was a good result,” she said. “A couple were up, a number were down, and some were holding steady.”
Plans for the future of the University’s own, long-awaited capital campaign remain unclear, but administrators are heartened by this year’s returns.
“It’s a great place to start from, and I’m very encouraged by the numbers of donors, and by the fact that our numbers held steady,” Rogers said. “Naturally, I wish that we had had more really large gifts, but I have great confidence for the future.”
Harvard’s last campaign, which ended in 2001, raised $2.6 billion, equivalent to $3.2 billion in today’s dollars.
Today’s announcement follows recent good news on University finances—just over a week ago, the Harvard Management Company announced an 11 percent investment return for the endowment in fiscal year 2010.

On Saturday evening, Harvard hosted the 21st annual Allston-Brighton Day tailgate before the first football game of the season, a match under the lights against Holy Cross.
The University invited residents of the Allston and Brighton neighborhoods and provided the complimentary food and drinks, along with free tickets to the game.
In a sparsely populated red and white tent next to the Harvard Stadium, residents from the neighboring communities gathered for cookies, soda, and submarine sandwiches as the Harvard Band practiced nearby.
Yvette Parker, a Charlesview resident who attended the tailgate for the first time, said the event was a kind gesture from Harvard.
“We feel like Harvard is trying to be nice to us because they haven’t done what they’re supposed to do,” Parker said, referring to construction plans Harvard had made in Allston that were set back in the wake of the economic recession. “What better experience than a free one?”
Parker, who said she does not attend Allston community meetings, added that she was pleased to have been invited to a Harvard event, especially since several members of her family could join her.
Allston resident Ed A. Kotomori said he enjoyed spending time with his neighbors.
“It’s a great time for Harvard to meet the community and showcase the bands and everything that goes on within the game and the rivalries,” said Joel E. Kotomori, Ed’s son.
For Tim J. Quinn, who had only started attending the annual Allston-Brighton Day event last year, said that he was also “happy to be here.”
“I think they’re a terrific neighbor,” said Quinn, a self-proclaimed member of the “silent majority” of Allston residents who he said do not have “beef” with Harvard.
“The spirit is good. The band is good,” Quinn said. “Life is good.”

When Arya Mehrabanzad ’14 came to Harvard from Texas, he said he thought his days of football fanaticism were over.
At the student tailgate before last Saturday’s Holy Cross football game—an event co-sponsored by Harvard University Athletics and the Undergraduate Council—he said his fears may have been confirmed.
“Lately I’ve been worried that there’s not a lot of school spirit,” Mehrabanzad said. “I was told to expect this, but I’m kind of disappointed.”
This weekend’s barbeque was the third UC-sponsored event intended to ammend the perceived lack of athletic pride at Harvard, according to UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11. After the results of last spring’s UC survey indicated that 61 percent of student respondents approved of last April’s UC tailgate at the Harvard-Duke lacrosse game, Bowman said that he and UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 decided to continue using athletics to bring students together. Along with Saturday’s tailgate, the UC partnered with University Athletics to sponsor a raffle and give away T-shirts and sunglasses at a men’s soccer game earlier this month.
“Harvard social life is so decentralized,” Bowman said. “Sports is one of the few areas where we can bring the entire Harvard community together.”
And with University Athletics footing the bill for these events—all of which have included free food, giveaways, and raffles—sporting events are a no-cost way for the UC to create a larger Harvard social community, which Bowman said has been a goal of his administration.
While food ran out in 20 minutes at last spring’s lacrosse tailgate, this time around, it was nearly kickoff—two hours after the barbecue’s start—before the 250 free food tickets and iPad raffle tickets ran out, according to Associate Director of Athletics Sue D. Byrne.
But Byrne said she was pleased with the turnout at the game, adding that game-goers overflowed the newly expanded student section at Harvard Stadium. She attributed low turnout at the tailgate to other student group and House events that occurred simultaneously.
Many of the students eating pulled pork sandwiches and red beans and rice at the barbecue were athletes, who said they went over to the UC tent only after food at the adjacent athlete tailgate had run low.
Kirkland House UC representative Ivet A. Bell ’13 said that she hopes better outreach to students will encourage more people to come to future UC-sponsored sports events.
“A simple e-mail won’t get people to come out,” Bell said. “What reps should be doing is really talking to people and having that personal connection to bring people out to events.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the University has been involved in multiple layers of support for a piece of legislation providing relief for undocumented students, many undergraduates and Harvard affiliates have also been rallying with several unaffiliated organizations on the state and national levels.
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid introduced last week the possibility that this legislation—known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act—would make its way to the Senate floor this Tuesday. If passed, the Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
In July, United We Dream—a national student-led organization that advocates for equal access to higher education—started DREAM University, a series of teach-ins that tour the nation, providing informal classes on immigration issues for undocumented students and related work.
The Student Immigrant Movement, a Mass. student group that advocates for equal rights for immigrant students, plans to hold a press conference today followed by a DREAM University teach-in and a vigil.
“SIM has done really phenomenal work,” said Colette S. Perold ’11, a member of the Student Immigration Movement as well as Harvard’s own Student Labor Action Movement.
Perold noted the “energy and enthusiasm” those involved have put forth in the past few days since Reid’s announcement last Tuesday.
“There’s a lot of work around here to push for this amendment to go the Senate for a vote,” said Perold, referring to the increased number of phone calls  SIM members and others have made to the office of U.S. Senator Scott P. Brown of Mass. Brown has yet to declare publicly whether he supports the DREAM Act.
“I’m extremely hopeful for Tuesday,” Perold said. “Considering SIM’s track record, I cannot imagine that [the vote] will not have positive results on Tuesday.”
On the other side of the heated national debate surrounding the Act, Jim  Gilchrist, founder and president of the immigration law enforcement advocacy group Minuteman Project, is not as optimistic.
“I don’t think it’ll get passed,” Gilchrist said. “But I don’t think it’ll get defeated by a large margin.”
Gilchrist added that his organization was not anti-immigration, but rather concerned about “fairness” to legal U.S. residents.
“We want to believe it’s a nation of people under the rule of law,” he said.
Maria Ospina, a College fellow in the department of romance languages and literatures who teaches several undocumented students in her class, has been following the struggles of her students. However, she too has doubts about Tuesday’s outcome.
“I am not very optimistic about it just because of the climate of the xenophobia in the U.S. that I’ve seen in recent months,” Ospina said, citing recent debates about Islam and the drug wars. She said she is glad that discussion over immigration reform has once again garnered national media attention.
“I’m not too optimistic,” she said, “but I’m crossing my fingers like everyone else.”

After months of speculation, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren was appointed to lead the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection by President Obama last Friday.
To sidestep a heated confirmation battle, Warren was named as assistant to the President and special adviser to Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner.
The position will allow Warren to lay the foundation for the Bureau and its operations. There remains a possibility that Warren will be named permanent director in the future, and if not, she will “play a pivotal role” in picking a director and will help in making future decisions about the agency, according to Obama, who has known Warren since he was a student at the Law School,
She will also oversee all parts of the Bureau’s creation, including staff recruitment and designing policy initiatives, Obama added.
The treasury is charged with oversight of the Bureau until July 2011, when the Federal Reserve will assume control and a permanent director will be named.
“Secretary Geithner and I both agree that Elizabeth is the best person to stand this agency up,” Obama said in his announcement.
“Elizabeth understands what I strongly believe—that a strong, growing economy begins with a strong and thriving middle class. And that means every American has to get a fair shake in their financial dealings.”
Warren was first to conceive of the Bureau, which was signed into law in July 2010 as part of recent financial reform legislation.
Previously, Warren chaired the Congressional Oversight Panel, which was created in 2008 and charged with implementing the Troubled Asset Relief Program that supplied capital to Wall Street during the beginning of the recession.
Warren became a vocal champion of consumer protection rights in the wake of the financial crisis, and advocated the creation of an agency to oversee the regulation of financial products such as mortgages and credit cards.
“The new law creates a chance to put a tough cop on the beat and provide real accountability and oversight of the consumer credit market,” Warren said in a statement released by the White House.
“The time for hiding tricks and traps in the fine print is over,” she wrote.
Warren was slated to teach two classes at the Law School this fall. The announcement that she would not be teaching a contracts course fueled rumors that Warren would take the position in Washington. With her appointment, Warren will likely not teach her “Empirical Analysis of Law” course.
“There is no one as well equipped to advise the President and provide clear analysis and advocacy on consumer issues in this complex economy as Elizabeth Warren,” wrote Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release, adding that “we will miss her fiercely.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to what student groups considered “racist” and “disturbing” anti-Muslim remarks made by former Harvard professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz, five student support groups joined to send an open letter to senior administrators in the Committee of Degrees in Social Studies, encouraging the committee not to honor Peretz at its fiftieth-year anniversary celebration.
The presidents of the Harvard Islamic Society, the Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA, the Harvard Society of Arab Students, and Latinas Unidas signed the letter on Thursday and received an endorsement from the president of the Harvard Black Students Association, in its call for the committee not to host Peretz in its celebration Sept. 25.
“We respectfully ask that you reconsider having Mr. Peretz as one of the Celebration’s speakers, or at least that he be publicly challenged to defend views that are, in our opinion, indefensible,” stated the open letter, which is addressed to the Chair of the Committee of Degrees on Social Studies Richard Tuck and the Director of Studies Anya E. Bernstein.
The letter also cites examples of Peretz’s former pieces, in which he makes racist comments about Mexicans and Blacks.
President of the Harvard Islamic Society Abdelnasser A. Rashid ’11-’12 said that given Peretz’s “history of making terribly racist statements,” his latest comments were unsurprising.
“I hope that the University refuses to lend legitimacy to his racist views by honoring him at a prestigious celebration,” Rashid said. “By honoring Peretz, the University will send a message to its Muslim students that they are not valued members of the Harvard community, and that it is acceptable to be bigoted against Muslims.”
In addition to the written document sent to the committee, Rashid and the Harvard Islamic Society corresponded with alumni to draft a petition, to be signed by students of the Harvard community who feel that Peretz should not be publicly honored “in light of his long record of racist statements.”
Simon L. Sternin ’01 said that he and other Social Studies alumni have been in touch with the Social Studies Committee to express their concerns.
Peretz has recently appologized for his comments on the eve of the Jewish holiday Yom Kiuppur.
“In this past year I have publicly committed the sin of wild and wounding language, especially hurtful to our Muslim brothers and sisters,” Peretz wrote in the blog post. “I allowed emotion to run way ahead of reason, and feelings to trample arguments. For this I am sorry.”
Tuck did not respond to repeated attempts for an interview. Bernstein declined to comment, saying that the committee will issue a statement later today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John E. Murdoch, a professor of the history of science and an expert in the field of medieval medicine, died of unknown causes Thursday. He was 83.
Since joining the Harvard faculty in 1963, Murdoch has come to be recognized as one of the preeminent figures in the field of scientific history, although his specialty was ancient Greek and Medieval Latin scientific philosophy. Just last year, the History of Science Society awarded him the George Sarton Medal, considered to be one of the field’s most prestigious honors.
Mark J. Schiefsky, a Classics professor who knew Murdoch as a colleague but also as a thesis advisor, said that he saw Murdoch for the last time earlier last week at a departmental meeting, during which Murdoch had been deciding what to do with the collection of former Harvard professor George Sarton’s papers and books.
Schiefsky said that during one of his first visits to the history of science department, he decided to take a peek at the graduate seminar bibliographies on display and had been amazed at the “range of sources” Murdoch had collected.
As a student interested in ancient Greek medicine, Schiefsky said that he “knew immediately that this was the person to be working with.”
After earning his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin, Murdoch taught at Harvard from 1957 until 1960, when he left for a three-year stint at Princeton University. When he returned to Harvard, he became the chair of the History of Science department, a position he held twice in his career.
“He is a welcoming, modest, nice person,” Schiefsky said. “When he starts to actually talk about stuff, you realize that there’s a tremendous amount of knowledge there.”
Schiefsky, who became a full professor in 2007, said he learned many valuable lessons about teaching after teaming up with Murdoch and Barry C. Mazur to offer a seminar on Archimedes, a course Murdoch taught every other year since 1963.
“I learned how one should really try to let students come up with a lot in these seminars rather than trying to give them too much,” Schiefsky said. “[Murdoch] had a very good way of eliciting responses from the class rather than bombarding the class with his own knowledge.”
For Schiefsky and members of the history of science department, Murdoch’s death was a shock.
“It was quite a sudden thing,” Schiefsky said. “He loved his life, being active in the University, teaching, researching, being a good citizen. He never wanted to retire. In the end, he didn’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man who appeared to be unaffiliated with Harvard University died Saturday after fatally shooting himself on the top step of Memorial Church.
The Harvard University and Cambridge Police Departments, responding to a call about the shooting, discovered a body with a self-inflicted gunshot wound lying outside Memorial Church, according to a HUPD community advisory.
The incident took place around 10:50 a.m. on Saturday, according to CPD spokesman Daniel M. Riviello.
At that time, a tour group posing for a photo was standing on the steps of Memorial Church facing Tercentenary Theatre. When the man shot himself, the people on the steps took off running across the grass, according to Jorge A. Araya Amador ’14, who was walking by Emerson Hall at the time.
Just after 11 a.m., at least 10 officers had responded, marking off sections of the eastern half of Harvard Yard with police tape.
Cambridge Fire and Rescue pronounced the individual dead on the scene. HUPD and the Middlesex District Attorney’s office declined to provide the man’s name.
Katherine C. Mentzinger ’14, who saw the tourists from her friend’s window, said that the members of the tour group who had been near the scene of the incident were taken aside to be questioned by police. Many of the individuals were crying, she said.
“From my friend’s window, I could see him in a pool of blood,” Mentzinger said.
Thayer resident Nathaniel J. Miller ’14 said that people in his dorm were “shaken a little bit, but no one [was] too hysterical.”
The incident occurred during Yom Kippur services in Memorial Church. Service attendees who exited the church at around 12:30 p.m. said that they had not heard anything about the shooting that had occurred just a few feet outside.
Two police officers entered the church toward the beginning of services, but there was no sense of alarm or panic, said Lindsay K. Berger, a Harvard Kennedy School student who was in Memorial Church observing the holiday. Several attendees were informed of the news by Crimson reporters inquiring about the incident.
College administrators—including Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, and Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison—were on the scene throughout much of the day.
At first, police closed off only the grassy area of the yard, allowing bystanders to walk along the pathways near University Hall, Widener Library, and Sever Hall. But as the day progressed, the perimeter grew until several gates on Mass. Ave. and Quincy St. were closed and the entirety of Tercentenary Theatre was cordoned off with yellow tape.
While police stood watch over the body in Tercentenary Theatre, tour groups and pedestrians continued to pass through the other side of Harvard Yard as usual.
At some point in the afternoon, authorities removed the body, and a man with a yellow cleaning cart showed up to clean off the granite.
By 3:45 p.m., the police tape had been taken down, and tourists resumed posing and taking photographs in front of Memorial Church. A damp spot remained near the area where the man had fallen.
Sometime between Saturday and Sunday afternoon, a single bouquet of red and orange roses was placed where the body had lain. A sealed letter lay next to the bouquet with the words “To my friend” written in neat cursive on the front.

If you still haven’t made up your mind on which classes to take, keep in mind that the deadline to add or drop a course without paying a fee is today.
Don’t worry, though. If you're on the fence about a class, you can still tinker around with your schedule until Oct. 4, although you’ll have to pay a $10 fee.
You can pick up change-of-course forms at your resident dean's office, the Freshman Dean’s Office, or the Registrar’s Office. They require signatures from your academic adviser and your resident dean, and if you're doing anything besides dropping a course, the instructor of your class will have to sign the form too.
So if you want to make a switch while not spending that hard-earned dough, make sure to get those forms signed soon.

While 21,704 fans filled Harvard Stadium to cheer the Crimson football team to a 34-6 win over Holy Cross on Saturday night, one famous alumnus got a bird’s-eye view.
Actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69—who played on the offensive line in Harvard’s famous 29-29 “win” over Yale in 1968—appeared in the press box in the second half and stayed there until close to the end of the blowout.
Jones, who was a first-team All-Ivy selection as a senior, kept it low-key in the press box, mainly chatting about the Crimson squad and the strength of the Ivy League with athletic director Bob Scalise. He also good-naturedly shook hands with a few of the coaches who came over to introduce themselves.
Although the Oscar winner is most famous for his roles in films like Men In Black, No Country for Old Men, and The Fugitive, Jones also was featured in the 2008 documentary Harvard Beats Yale 29-29, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the famous tie.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten more savvy—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
The Harvard football night game got plenty of press for the quality of play from the boys in Crimson. Senior Andrew Hatch and freshman David Mothander earned player and rookie of the week nods, respectively, and the 34-6 drubbing of Holy Cross appeared to stem from the home team’s all-around solid play. But there was one man who wasn’t ready to give Harvard all the credit. Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore largely attributed the lopsided score to the Crusaders’ deficiencies in this edition of Sound Off.
What Gilmore said: “We went against a very good football team that did execute. I’m looking at what Harvard did in all three phases of the game, and nothing they did surprised me. I thought we were ready for what they did, we just didn’t play well enough…I would say 95-plus percent [of the Crimson’s defensive schemes] were things we had prepared for, and we should have been able to execute better.”
What Gilmore means: To be fair, the coach did concede that Harvard played a fundamentally sound football game. But Gilmore was undoubtedly giving the Crimson a little verbal jab when he implied that the team’s game plan was unimaginative. Apparently, Hatch’s nearly flawless first-half passing was only the result of poor play on the part of the Crusader defense and had nothing to do with offensive coordinator Joel Lamb tailoring the scheme to the quarterback’s strong arm. The Harvard defense’s ability to totally eliminate the run must have been a fluke as well.
What Gilmore said: “The one [third down play] that really stands out, we had the quarterback wrapped up in the backfield for a sack and we can’t bring him down. And that’s not a physical thing, it’s a mental thing…I mean we had him tackled from behind, we just have to wrap up and pull him down. Instead we tried to yank him down and he slips out of it.”
What Gilmore means: Here the coach is referring to a crucial third-and-long near the end of the first half, when Hatch was nearly brought down by a crashing Holy Cross defensive line, only to escape and sprint to the left sideline for a 17-yard first-down scamper. Frankly, Gilmore’s spot-on with this assessment. Hatch, who did display excellent running ability on 11 attempts throughout the game, still had no right to escape the would-be sack. When defensive linemen get a hold of a quarterback’s jersey, the play should be over, and Gilmore’s frustration was more than justified. Nonetheless, playmakers always give defenses fits, and it seems that we may see more of the same from Hatch throughout the year.
What Gilmore said: “[The Crimson is] a very good football program right now. I’ve been dealing with Harvard for a long time, and they’ve had a long tradition of that.”
What Gilmore means: After being pushed for much of the interview on the Crimson’s strengths, Gilmore eventually decided to stop stonewalling the media. After a few curt responses, the coach conceded that Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s program might have earned some of the attention it has received following a decade of high-quality football. Although it’s easy to criticize Gilmore for withholding credit for much of the press conference, he is not the first coach to focus on what his team must do to improve.

As Harvard students, the two things we enjoy most are learning and free stuff. But with everything happening all at once both on campus and in the Boston area, it's easy to go through the year as overwhelmed as a freshman during Opening Days.
So we decided to give you the heads-up on two free events at museums in the area—just in case you wanted to add a little downtime to your iCal.
College Night at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston
Sept. 23, 7 to 11 p.m.
 
The Museum of Fine Arts is always free if you present a student ID, but on Thursday, the museum is throwing a party for college students. Start your raging early that night with free live music, food, dancing, and prizes.
For more info about the party as well as the Museum of Fine Arts' exhibits (so you can pretend you actually visited the art museum itself), click here.
Free College Open House at the New England Aquarium
Oct. 6, 5:30 to 9:30 p.m.
The New England Aquarium is holding a special free night for college students, with local vendors and free access to a 3-D IMAX movie.
“The Aquarium's turtles, sharks, penguins and seals are perfect conversation starters to see new faces and have fun with other Boston-area college students,” read the open house’s Facebook event listing.
We think it's a great opportunity to make friends with the sea animals themselves, because at least they won't cringe and swim away when you say you are from Harvard. Either way, it’s a great way to introduce yourself to one of the best aquariums in the country.

After capturing the top spot on U.S. News and World Report’s 2011 ranking of national universities but taking second to the University of Cambridge on the QS World University Rankings, Fair Harvard has again come out on top in this year’s Times Higher Education World University Rankings.
 
California Institute of Technology rose from the tenth spot all the way to number two, and MIT rose six spots to number three. Rounding out the top five were Stanford and Princeton, followed by a tie for sixth place between Oxford and Cambridge.
 
The other Ivies did not fare as well as Harvard in The Times’ rankings. Yale placed the best at number ten. Cornell, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania managed to make it into the top 20 at 14, 18, and 19, respectively. Brown came in at 55, and Dartmouth barely made it within the top 100 by placing at 99.
 
A full list can be found here, but all we have to say is, here’s to being back on top.
