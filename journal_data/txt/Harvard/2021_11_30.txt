After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Halloween just around the corner, Boston University’s Wheelock Family Theatre held a Costume Thrift Sale on Oct. 23 to help people find pieces for costumes or simply pick out thrifted clothing. The costume sale was one of the first in-person community events the theatre has held this year, and for many attendees, it marked a turning point in their engagement with the fine arts since the onset of the pandemic.
Jenna M. Corcoran is the Wheelock Family Theatre’s Marketing Specialist and one of the lead organizers of the event. Having joined the Theatre right before the pandemic, her role changed dramatically as theaters across the world had to shut down or transition their productions to a virtual landscape.
“Changing to a virtual world was a lot of work in my area, which is something I’m grateful for because it allowed me to explore a lot of different areas that I probably wouldn't have necessarily been able to do,” Corcoran said. “I got to explore more video content, ways to make theater accessible virtually, and then hopefully carry that into our in-person programming as well.”
Preparations for the sale began over the summer, with the Theatre combing through their vast costume collection to put up hundreds of items for sale — everything from vintage sweaters to fairy wands to mouse ears. The costume sale was part of the Theatre’s larger effort to reevaluate the organization’s activities as a whole while reconnecting with the Boston community as in-person programming is set to return in the spring.
Situated near several other universities in Boston, the lobby of the Wheelock Family Theatre, lined with racks of clothing and people trying on different pieces, became a meeting space for many young adults passionate about both thrifting and pursuing the fine arts in academic or professional settings.
“Ever since coming across on social media the whole issue with fast fashion and the fashion industry, and realizing that buying secondhand or at least very consciously looking at what brands have as their morals, principles, and ethics, I really shifted to basically only thrifting all that I own,” Julia H. Weinstock, a student at Emerson College, said.
For students who began or finished their studies in the arts during the pandemic, the challenges of being involved in the arts in a limited environment brought frustration but also a greater sense of appreciation for discoveries that arose out of isolation. Many thrifters shared experiences of lessons learned from the pandemic.
“[With music video production], I thought you had to start with a big company, but you can literally just DM people on Instagram and ask if you can edit their videos,” said Reagan A. Finch, a student at Emerson College studying film. “I realized that I don't need the connections I thought I did and the pandemic taught me that because we were all so isolated.”
“I think it’s really important that the arts keep happening, and the pandemic has shown that more than ever,” Micah J. Blasko, who was at the costume sale. “When people can't interact with other people in-person, they turn to art and the Internet and I think that’s a really great platform for artists. Art’s important, and it connects us.”
As progress in vaccination moves forward, many fine arts programs — from theater to music — have begun transitioning to in-person events. For many young actors, though, the lingering effects from being in isolation remain as actors return back to the black box.
“I'm in a production right now, and we're also hesitant to touch each other: There’s so much more formality with even just grabbing someone's hand,” said Weinstock, who is studying acting. “So much of acting and creating a show and the staging is working on instincts and seeing what comes out, and now I’m instinctually hesitant to go out and grab someone.”
The Wheelock Family Theatre’s first two productions will take place in-person in the spring of 2022 — “The Wizard of Oz” (Feb. 11–March 6) and “Make Way for Ducklings” (May 6–29). But theaters across the country bringing their productions to virtual platforms is still not a thing of the past just yet.
“We've already started exploring [a hybrid theater model], doing a combination of virtual playbills and in person playbills,” Corcoran said. “That's something that we're bringing with us into this new world, where we're going to be incorporating more of that virtual landscape as we go.” Beyond the stage, events like the Wheelock Family Theatre’s Costume Sale are fostering discussions and communities centered around what the future of performing arts will hold.

The ubiquity of classics like “Dancing Queen” or “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!” makes it easy to forget 39 years have passed since ABBA broke up. And yet, their music remains just as inescapable; the trademark catchiness of the group’s songs has made them a party favorite and ensured their continued popularity. It’s difficult to add a new album on top of an intimately familiar canon of discography that, to generations of fans, appears untouchable. But that’s what the group did on Nov. 5 with the release of “Voyage.” The title might evoke “Arrival,” but unlike the 1976 cult classic, the new album doesn’t offer the same energetic, captivating melodies. “Voyage” seems like a natural progression of the 1981 “The Visitors” — a more mature, stylistically diverse album, but one without the disco appeal of ABBA’s greatest hits.
Variety is the defining feature of “Voyage,” apparent from the get-go, best exemplified by “I Still Have Faith In You.” The album’s opening track, released as a single back in September, is already a sharp break from ABBA’s usual genre-mixing repertoire. At the beginning, the song is a slow-paced, nostalgic ballad with a dreamlike quality, reminiscent of Madonna’s version of “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina.” But as the lyrics refocus from the bittersweet past and doubts toward optimism for the present, the track turns into an energetic celebration of victory with synthesizer and electric guitar. The energy and the instruments carry on to “Keep an Eye on Dan,” an engrossing, almost-rock piece with a strong rhythm.
The album ends on a similarly high note. “Ode to Freedom” is as unusual for ABBA as it is fitting. The magnificent, orchestral closing piece — perhaps a bit too closely copying Tchaikovsky’s waltz from “Swan Lake” — is an inspired reflection on the artists’ relationship with their past work. The last song not only closes the album but also forces a reflection on ABBA’s career. The voices, older and mature but still full of passion, further reinforce that theme.
Unfortunately, the album’s stylistic diversity doesn’t always pay off. “I Can Be That Woman,” a slow ballad, feels like a ABBA rendition of a Dolly Parton song — but with none of the country singer’s appeal. Already suffering from an uninspired tune, the track suffers odd pacing that only makes things worse. Added to that, the lyrics not only fit the meter poorly, but — perhaps fittingly for a Swedish band — seem to be a textbook example of Stockholm syndrome, as the protagonist blames herself for her breakup and vows to change. Strangely, this ballad can’t even hold the title for the album’s most bizarre addition. That dubious distinction belongs to “Little Things,” an unabashed Christmas song with pronounced piano instrumentation that manages to be simultaneously completely out of character for ABBA and present little but blandness.
Granted, some of the more “traditional” songs, such as “Bumblebee” and “When You Danced With Me,” prove duller than their modern counterparts. But ABBA of 2021 is still more than capable of delivering the good old tunes that fans are used to. “Voyage” offers songs that are simply, unmistakably ABBA, with catchy choruses, disco tunes, and the marked contrast between joyous melodies and more somber lyrics.
“Don’t Shut Me Down” is the perfect example. It feels as if it belonged on “Voulez-vous” or “The Visitors,” recorded four decades ago by an ABBA in their prime, and should have been played alongside classics such as “Super Trouper” for years. The lyrics, telling the story of a woman confronting her partner, are acting in unison with the music, highlighting all the accusatory moments and bursting with joyful energy as the protagonist asserts her strength and resilience. The chorus is extremely catchy, the melody forceful and upbeat. And perhaps most importantly for a group famous for disco music: It seems made for dancing.
“Voyage” cannot be snuck between “Super Trouper” and “The Visitors” without anyone noticing. The influence of the four-decade long hiatus is clear. It’s not just more of the same catchy music that fits one mould. With more mature voices and a willingness to break with the familiar, ABBA manages to deliver an album that doesn’t simply capitalize on nostalgia, but rather boldly showcases the group’s skills while remaining true to self.

In a cold indifferent universe, it’s comforting to know that there’s a little pocket of happiness called “Licorice Pizza.” Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming-of-age comedy takes viewers on a dream-like romp around the San Fernando Valley in 1970s Los Angeles. Equal parts funny and endearing, “Licorice Pizza” is about finding love in the unlikeliest of places. It’s about wanting to grow up, only to find yourself lost once you get there. Most of all, it’s a love letter to Hollywood — an ode to the insecurities of growing up in a town where everybody knows exactly what they want to do next.
Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman, son of the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and Alana Kane (Alana Haim, from the band Haim) are two misfits stuck between adolescence and adulthood. Gary is 15 going on 16 and Alana is 25 going on, well, older. They’re an odd pair, but they share an instant connection. They say that their relationship is “not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing,” and yet they find themselves drawn to each other like a yoyo on the end of a string.
At one point, Alana asks her sister “do you think it’s weird that I hang out with Gary and his friends all the time?” Audiences probably wonder the same at first, but at the end of the day, it’s a pretty simple proposition. Gary acts like he has everything figured out, and Alana acts like she’s too cool to hang out with him. But really, they’re just two people who need someone to give them validation — and who happen to find that support in each other.
On one hand, Gary can’t wait to grow up and find a niche for himself in Los Angeles. He’s a young man who has grown out of his short career as a child actor and is on the prowl for the next big thing — starting three separate businesses over the course of the film. Suffice to say, Gary isn’t doing too shabbily for a 15 year-old, but behind his confident handshake and self-assured salesman talk is a character seeking approval — for someone to acknowledge that he’s gone far.
On the other hand, Alana needs time to slow down so she can figure out where she wants her life to go. We first meet her as a photographer’s assistant for a high school yearbook, and the film sees her try out many different roles: Gary’s business partner, an actress, and a campaign staffer. Through all these changes, Gary’s wide-eyed adoration for Alana remains unwavering, but it’s in Alana’s quiet moments of reflection that we see all the nuances and insecurities in their friendship. Anderson wrote “Licorice Pizza” with Haim in mind, and in a stunning debut performance, she more than lives up to that calling. She brings a magnetic screen presence to her namesake character, and her natural, affable charm is easily the brightest spot in an already luminous film.
Anderson lets his characters bounce around from one episodic misadventure to the next, crashing into historical LA figures along the way. For instance, after a botched waterbed delivery for deranged film producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper), Gary and Alana make a run for it — driving their truck backwards downhill on an empty tank. This loose plot structure makes it feel like fate is willing Gary and Alana together. After Alana’s many failed attempts at romance, where a B-tier LA celebrity uses her as an accessory, she always finds Gary there to help her back up. And in all of Gary’s attempts to find someone, well, closer to his age, he never finds anyone as supportive as Alana. Gary and Alana are constantly running — away from the chaotic world around them — and into one another’s arms.
What helps this relationship fly is the film’s beautiful attention to period detail, from gorgeous production design to a catchy soundtrack. “Licorice Pizza” also boasts beautiful cinematography — shot on 35mm film, it really feels like we’re peering into the ‘70s through rose-tinted glasses. Fans of Anderson’s “Boogie Nights” and “Magnolia” will also delight in his stunning tracking shots — like a one-take opening dolly that effectively captures Gary’s instant admiration for Alana.
“Licorice Pizza” is a rare glimpse of genuine delight from Anderson, a director best known for his complex studies on twisted characters. Who would’ve known that Paul Thomas Anderson knows how to be happy? In a celebrated filmography, “Licorice Pizza” is far and away Anderson’s most personal, endearing film. Gary and Alana’s deep friendship-slash-unconsummated-relationship says: In a world where nothing else makes sense, it’s about the comfort of knowing that someone is there who cares about you. Because when all is said and done, no matter the age, we’re all just searching for a little acceptance and understanding.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first episode of Apple TV+’s new dark comedy “The Shrink Next Door” provided a captivating start to the season. The star-studded series follows Martin “Marty” Markowitz (Will Ferrell) as he grapples with anxiety and is encouraged by his sister Phyllis Shapiro (Kathryn Hahn) to start seeing therapist Dr. Isaac “Ike” Herschkopf (Paul Rudd).
Marty’s journey is based on real-life events in which a therapist took over the life of one of his patients. Even without prior knowledge of the story, the seeds of manipulation are clearly planted in this premiere, and scenes that bookend the episode foreshadow the decades-long relationship between Marty and Ike going awry.
Both Ferrell and Rudd showcase the range of their acting skills in this premiere. Despite making a name for himself in comedy, Ferrell steps brilliantly into the more serious role of the wounded protagonist. He brings his trademark Buddy the Elf-style innocence to this gentle character with low self-esteem and a striking Bob Ross resemblance. Ferrell radiates kindness as Marty, embodying a character who’s willing to sacrifice his own wellbeing for the comfort of others.
Most importantly, Ferrell’s portrayal of anxiety is more realistic than the common misrepresentations that pervade television and film. His panic attacks are recognizable but don’t become a public spectacle, and he alleviates them through breathing exercises and words of reassurance behind closed doors. Too often, mental illnesses are depicted as either insignificant character quirks or extreme impairments that seem to detract from the character’s humanity. Marty’s anxiety falls somewhere on the middle of this spectrum, respected as an issue that needs to be addressed without becoming his only personality trait.
In stark contrast to his past performances as the likeable Ant-Man, Mike Hannigan on “Friends,” or Josh in “Clueless,” Rudd’s character Ike exudes arrogance and superficiality. While he seems to be helping Marty, subtleties like a smirk, a glance, or the employment of a slightly patronizing tone suggest that he has ulterior motives. When he tells Marty, “I’m not gonna let anyone use you,” the look in his eyes says otherwise. Who knew that Rudd could make such a good villain?
The premiere is also beautifully shot, creating a compelling visual tone. 1980s New York and the colorful fabrics company where Marty works provide a vibrant background for an otherwise dark storyline. The cinematography effectively deepens the audience’s connection to the characters; for instance, close-up shots make Marty’s panic attacks feel more intimate and tense. Side-by-side shots of Ike and Marty during their time together illustrate the contrast between them: Though Marty is much taller, Ike walks with swagger while Marty steps gingerly and avoids eye contact. The costume department, led by Helen Huang, also curated seasonal outfits that belong on everyone’s fall Pinterest boards: The pieces are perfectly period-appropriate, from Marty’s peacoat to Ike’s leather jacket and wire-rimmed glasses.
In future episodes, though, the show could play more thematically between light and dark moments — although marketed as a dark comedy, the comedic moments fall short in the shadow of the ominous narrative. Moments like Ike playing basketball in a sweater vest and sweatpants or pretending to be a lawyer in front of Marty’s ex-girlfriend should be hilarious, but the obvious undertone of manipulation makes it hard to laugh. The scenes at the beginning and end of the show only make things more bleak, depicting Marty destroying items on a property that seems to belong to Ike.
If the rest of the series follows the tone of the premiere, viewers are in for one wild ride. Each episode will reveal more about the therapist-patient relationship that turns sour. With decades of events to unpack, the show is destined to thrill.
While “The Shrink Next Door” is based on a true story that makes for good television, the show does run the risk of turning people off from therapy. Hopefully, the series will continue to make careful choices in its depiction of mental health and emphasize the uniqueness of Marty’s situation. If done right, the show has the potential to expose audiences to authentic mental health struggles and encourage those seeking help to make the same choice as Marty and find a therapist — as long as that therapist isn’t Ike Herschkopf.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few years ago, I came across a cryptic black and white screen print on canvas by Black expressionist painter Jean-Michel Basquiat. Through the dark, organized mess of that print, I found in Basquait a refreshing departure from the religious paintings of the Baroque period I was used to analyzing in my art history courses. Most of all, I loved the way his art used street and neo-expressionist aesthetics to challenge classism and racism, all the while encouraging people to reflect on their own morality. His focus on identity and culture made clear to me his views on how art should be appreciated: with special attention paid to its context, to what it could represent beyond and in spite of its monetary value.
To me, Basquiat’s art and the complex themes it explored resisted commodification, and thus existed in tension with the artist’s legacy, as Basquait’s imagery and ideas have since become a kind of status symbol after his death, reserved for those who could afford his pieces. As I continue to observe his motif-filled creations, I wonder: Can commodifying art, specifically art that represents marginalized voices, ever be a means to a revolutionary end? Or does commodification wrongly promote Black artists in spaces that contradict the themes of their art? Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s new roles as ambassadors to Tiffany and Co. — announced in part by a photoshoot the couple had in front of a Basquiat painting — beg answers to these questions.
This year, Tiffany and Co. have been noticeably rebranding in an attempt to garner a new generation of loyal customers. With campaigns like “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany’s” that boldly appeal to younger audiences with younger models and edgier photoshoots, Tiffany’s has been embracing this marketing strategy headfirst.
On Sept. 14, Beyoncé graced her fans’ Instagram feeds with a two-minute-long video of her and Jay-Z’s “About Love” campaign with Tiffany and Co., officially launching the Carters’ ambassadorship to the luxury jewelry brand. Set to Beyoncé’s cover of Henry Mancini’s “Moon River,” this montage of affectionate scenes features shots of the couple in Givenchy around a piano, in front of a rare Basquiat painting, with Beyoncé wearing the iconic 128.54 carat Tiffany yellow diamond around her neck. The couple’s ambassadorship feels like more than just a run-of-the-mill rebranding.
It is no surprise that the Carters were chosen to epitomize the brand moving forward. They, like Tiffany’s, are well-known pop culture icons, both modern and timeless. Their image allows Tiffany and Co. to engage with a new audience, and the campaign’s focus on their love story maintains the romantic charm famously associated with the brand. Beyoncé and Jay-Z built their brands on hip-hop and R&B in the Black community of the 2000s. Their music and business decisions have historically been unapologetically pro-Black and appreciated by marginalized communities (communities not often associated with high-end jewelry brands). Whether Tiffany’s is attempting to appeal to the Carters’ fanbase, their fame, or both, is uncertain.
The irony of the Carters posing in front of a private collection Basquiat is evident: For Tiffany and Co.’s campaign, which does not mention the significance of the painting, the Basquiat is used as a status symbol. In fact, the company’s vice president Alexandre Arnault explained in an interview that the piece was chosen for its color, which resembles the classic Tiffany’s blue. He implies that Equals Pi is an homage to the brand: “We know he loved New York, and that he loved luxury and he loved jewelry." This feels forced for many reasons, namely Basquiat’s rejection of marginalization and classism. It is an interpretation of Basquiat’s art that lacks context, going against the introspection he aimed to evoke in his audience.
Similarly, the use of Beyoncé and Jay-Z to represent Tiffany and Co., without any reference to the couple’s pro-Black politics, neglects the couple’s significance to marginalized communities. In the Tiffany shoot, the Carters are merely billionaires in love, and their privilege drains Basquiat’s art and the cultural significance attached to it of its meaning — and its color.
This irony is exalted by the Tiffany Diamond itself. The diamond, having only been worn by Audrey Hepburn, Mrs. E. Sheldon Whitehouse, and Lady Gaga since its discovery, has a prestigious reputation of its own. It was shaped by Tiffany and Co. jewelers upon its excavation in Kimberly, South Africa in 1877. Though its acquisition was not necessarily associated with a war zone, it is widely believed to fit the description of a blood diamond because it was mined in South Africa during the country’s colonization. According to the company, the diamond is “a symbol of the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship established with the founding of Tiffany and Co. in 1837.” Since then, Beyoncé has only just become the first Black person chosen to bear this symbol, yet the campaign features no acknowledgment of this significance, nor of the role that race relations might have played in the diamond’s acquisition. Instead, the Carters’ love life is the focal point.
As implied by its title, “About Love,” the campaign uses the couple’s alluring love to promote Tiffany and Co. Nowhere does it promise to deliver a strong political or cultural message, but the brand’s largely white history makes the campaign feel inherently subversive. This fact is overlooked by the brand and the celebrities featured in it alike. It seems obvious that the campaign would have benefitted from more context about the artists, the Basquiat, and the Tiffany Diamond. Reflection on any of these details would have left it up to consumers to appreciate the campaign’s use of Black artistry through a more relevant, refreshing lens. Most importantly, the inspiring pro-Black ventures that have gotten Beyoncé and Jay-Z their iconic status would’ve been illuminated and uplifted rather than commodified and exploited.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ 60th animated film, “Encanto,” represents family — not only for its audience, but for its animators as well. The film, which premiered in theaters on Nov. 24, tells the story of Mirabel, a young girl who fights to save her family and home’s magic.
In a virtual webinar on Friday, Nov. 12, animators Rebecca Perez Stodolny and Jorge E. Ruiz Cano, along with production manager Natalia Adame Mendoza, discussed their experience working at Walt Disney Animation Studios on their newest film, “Encanto.” Stodolny studied computer animation and has worked on a variety of films like “Bolt” and Dreamworks’ “How To Train Your Dragon.” Cano studied Media Art & Design and has worked at Disney for almost 10 years.
Both Stodolny and Cano shared how they were always inspired by Disney throughout their childhoods and careers.
“There’s never been a time in my life that Disney wasn’t a part of,” Stodolny said before elaborating on the role of the message in Disney’s “Zootopia” in inspiring her to be a part of this industry.
Cano also discussed animation as a universal language for storytelling and cited Aladdin as his inspiration:
“I got lost in the storytelling,” Cano said.
Stodolny and Cano shared several of the guiding questions behind “Encanto”: “How do you tell a story with a large family?” and “How well does our family truly know us?” Family is very important in Latin American culture and Stodolny and Cano discussed Colombia, specifically, as inspiration for the film because of the country’s ties to magical realism. They played a featurette documenting Byron Howard, Jared Wright, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and other members of the team traveling to Colombia to gather information and inspiration for the film, documenting the architecture they saw, places they visited, and music they heard. They drew inspiration from stories of areas of heightened spirituality and natural beauty, called “encantos.” These encantos inspired the concept of Mirabel’s magical house which gives her family powers. These powers reflect the character’s role in the family, like Mirabel’s mom’s ability to heal people through her cooking.
Stodolny and Cano also discussed family, in particular, their “familia” — a group of artists and studio employees that got together, shared stories, and consulted on the film, reviewing every version of the film and script.
“It was surreal to be conversing with Byron and Jared over three years ago and them being curious about it,” Cano shared. “It’s amazing being a guardian of the culture.” Cano and Stodolny found their time being a part of the familia very rewarding.
“The fact that the studio themselves wanted to hear from people like us felt very empowering,” Stodolny said.
Natalia also emphasized how close the familia had gotten.
“I’ve worked with you for the past year and it’s always a treat to listen to your stories,” she said.
Disney is no stranger to producing films with powerful messages behind them, and “Encanto” follows in the lineage of films like “Zootopia,” “Raya and the Last Dragon,” and “Big Hero 6.” Storytelling is a large part of animation, and when asked about how complicated themes should be presented to a wide audience, Stodolny and Cano emphasized the question of who you want to reach, which can inform what compromises to make.
As Latin American people working on this film, Cano and Stodolny found certain aspects of “Encanto” especially creatively fulfilling. Cano talked about the dances and rhythms, along with the importance of capturing the “flow” in Latin dancing and making the performances believable. “It was really gratifying just to see the team focusing on mi gente,” Cano said.
Stodolny found that the intimate conversations between Mirabel and her grandmother were particularly meaningful to her, but she believes they will be relatable to people regardless of their background. “It’s about families. It’s about you and your abuela, your grandmother,” she said. Differing perspectives on growing up are represented in the film, and Stodolny explained that it was something they wanted to make sure to capture as well.
The making of “Encanto” has spanned several years, and the Covid-19 pandemic certainly didn’t speed up the process. When asked about challenges in their careers, Stodolny and Cano both discussed working virtually. “Encanto” is the second animated film Disney has produced virtually. Stodolny explained the importance of being nimble and making things work. Cano seconded the value of problem solving and being open to tackling difficulties while still being passionate about your work.
“It’s easy to complain, but we chose this,” he said.
Stodolny, Cano, and Mendoza’s dedication to telling the story of “Encanto” was evident from their enthusiastic accounts of working on the film despite facing many obstacles.

Nov. 5 marked the one year anniversary of one of this era’s most terrible, ridiculous and wonderful phenomena: Destiel.
“Destiel” is the ship name for two “Supernatural” characters: demon-hunter Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) and angel Castiel (Misha Collins). Marked by longing glances, tender touches, and the willingness to do anything for each other, the pair muddle through the show’s many seasons and multiple apocalypses in a purportedly straight, platonic and heterosexual way. Despite clear mishandling on the part of the showrunners, many of the show’s viewers grow deeply attached to the possibility of their romantic relationship.
As a show, “Supernatural” features no shortage of homophobia and misogyny. For example, there are almost no compelling female characters; all of the interesting and multifaceted characters are men and, as a result, all of the complex and layered relationships are between those men. Inevitably, the tenderness and closeness of these relationships become homoerotic in the eyes of viewers, yet the writers continued to insist that everyone must be straight. Despite this, “Supernatural” had a cult following of fans, many of whom were particularly invested in the primary ship, Destiel. People waited years for any glimmer of hope that their dreams might be realised.
After all, “Supernatural” had been growing in popularity since it first aired in 2005 and after Castiel’s introduction in 2008 people have been shipping him with Dean with increasing fervor. As a show, “Supernatural” is a beast, having run longer than most middle-schoolers have been alive despite a wild variation in quality that meant viewership was rarely consistent. In fact, a lot of continuing interest in the show could be directly attributed to Destiel rather than any of the main plot.
Despite years of controversy among the fandom and actors, as the writers of “Supernatural” came to the end of this mammoth of a series, they had a decision to make about how to end the famous relationship between Castiel and Dean. They could have done nothing, and ended the show as it had always been. Instead, they chose one of the only directions that would make fans even angrier — adhering to the “bury your gays” trope. Even fans who had long given up on the show flocked to watch Destiel’s love confession. In an earlier episode, Castiel had made a deal that as soon as he experienced true happiness he would be dragged off to a hell stand-in for eternal torment.
Then, in episode 18 of season 15, “Despair,” the confession finally happened. As a tearful Castiel proclaimed his love, Dean faced him confused, eventually blurting out a “What are you talking about, man?” Even as Castiel said the words central to every rom-com — “I love you” — Dean had little to no reaction other than looking vaguely sad when Castiel was dragged away to death. Despite Castiel immediately being punished for admitting he loved another man, and Dean not actually verbally reciprocating his feelings, Destiel was finally canon. Well, kind of. The mishandling of their relationship was so wild that it caused an uproar.
Viewership for “Supernatural” had been declining for several seasons, but the landmark event that was the confirmation of Destiel renewed interest in the ship, if not the show as a whole. Shockingly, less than a week after the finale, there was even more Destiel craziness. It turned out Castiel and Dean were actually mutually in love — but only in Spanish. In the Spanish dub, after Castiel said “Te amo,” Dean replied “Yo a ti, Cas,” effectively telling Castiel that he felt the same way. Destiel was unequivocally real. Nevermind that it was only in Spanish, and that one of the characters was immediately dragged away to his death.
Destiel (mostly) becoming canon was a cultural phenomenon that has continued to endure (a causality has even been posited between Supernatural’s terrible writing and Georgia going blue and securing the result of the 2020 election). Despite the incompetence shown by many of the people who worked on “Supernatural,” when it came to establishing this relationship, the hilarity of the show’s plot development deserves to be marked at its anniversary.

This article contains spoilers for the “Downton Abbey” movie.
After six seasons, one movie, two companion books, and numerous accolades, audiences may wonder whether there is any story left to tell in the world of “Downton Abbey.” The show, produced by Julian Fellowes, follows a 20th-century English aristocratic family and the affairs of their estate. The teaser trailer released for the franchise’s upcoming sequel movie proves that there absolutely are stories at Downton Abbey still untold.
This first trailer for the latest installment in the “Downton Abbey” canon, aptly titled “Downton Abbey 2: A New Era,” picks up after the first movie and takes the characters in new directions. The movie seems to explore the themes of change and adaptability that characterized the later seasons of the TV series and the first movie, as the aristocratic world that the characters inhabit must evolve to keep up with the modernizing world.
The trailer opens with a classic shot of the iconic Yorkshire estate that is Downton Abbey — actually shot at Highclere Castle in Hampshire, England. Our first look at the nobility who star in the movie comes as familiar figures in sophisticated attire walk across the lawn parasols in hand: Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), Lord Hexham (Harry Hadden-Paton), Lord Grantham’s cousin Lady Rosamund (Samantha Bond), and another unidentified woman.
The next few shots reveal the return of more characters in the next few shots: the matriarch of the family, Dowager Countess Violet of Grantham, played by the venerable Dame Maggie Smith, and the two sisters, Edith and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), both through several scenes in the familiar mahogany panels and rich tapestries of Downton Abbey’s library. We get an adorable image of Lord Robert Crawley of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) hugging his grandchild Sybbie, who has gotten a bit older. One of the enjoyable aspects of the show has been watching the Downton children grow up, and the glimpses of them in the trailer indicate that they may be playing a larger role in the story, especially since they are the future heirs to Downton.
Next, we see a painted portrait of a striking young Lady Violet, which the retired butler Carson (Jim Carter) looks upon with surprise and interest. The Dowager begins describing some part of her ever-mysterious past, of which the series has only given us tantalizing glimpses, much to the curiosity of the viewers and other characters in the show.
Then she says the line that is the crux of the trailer: “I have come into the possession of a villa in the south of France.” This line, analogous to “The Queen and King are coming to Downton” from the first movie, reveals the film’s main plot, which will center around the family inheriting another estate and dealing with the trials and tribulations that come with this new change. This development will allow the characters to continue evolving into stewards of their aristocratic world while providing new challenges and opportunities for the non-aristocratic part of the cast.
We get a view of the villa itself, an elegant marble mansion amid a lush landscape dotted with palms, interspersed with shots of the family exploring the estate, various members of the Downton staff, and a sweet moment as Anna (Joanne Froggatt) and Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle) hold their child.
We also get a shot of the Downton family posing for wedding photos with Tom Branson (Allen Leech) and Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton) and her mother Maud (Imelda Staunton), and later we see a scene of their marriage as guests shower flowers over a joyful kiss between Tom and Lucy. While Lucy and Tom are a wonderful match, and a much better alternative to his previous romantic pursuits (excluding Lady Sybil, of course), fans may feel that their storyline, which was entirely introduced in the previous movie, was a bit rushed, especially compared to the slow-burn romance between Tom and Lady Sybil. The writers clearly want to give Tom a happy ending with a kind and relatable partner, and viewers will likely be glad to see that he has fully healed and moved on. Perhaps this movie will allow the Tom-Lucy storyline to become more fleshed-out as their relationship progresses.
Next appears a mysterious lady (played by Laura Haddock) with white-blonde hair, red lipstick, and an icy blue dress who enters Downton with purposeful strides. Could she be a potential antagonist? Possibly another claimant to the French estate? Her appearance in the trailer is minimal yet impactful to viewers through her presence and sense of purpose. Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) follows her into the main hall of Downton, and we see he is continuing to serve as butler to Downton. Viewers will also stand to expect more development for his complex storyline as he learns to accept his sexuality and possibly pursue the romantic interest that the first film hinted at.
We get another snapshot of Edith and her husband Bertie dancing in a ballroom scene that is hopefully one of many dashing ballroom scenes that viewers will witness. In the previous film, Edith revealed to an overjoyed Bertie that she was pregnant, so this film will hopefully advance their storyline and continue building their relationship. We also see Lord and Lady Grantham cruising through a beautiful coastal bay amid another picturesque shot of the villa, and an evening ball beside a pillared mansion lit from within. The next scenes feature a singer dressed in a fashionable gown and headdress, and a shot of Lady Isobel (Penelope Wilton) descending a sweeping double staircase with salmon-pink walls and palms highly evocative of a tropical paradise.
The penultimate scene in the trailer is of the beloved Carson making a witty remark to his friend and partner Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan): “The British are coming.” Perhaps this indicates a future conflict between the denizens of Downton and the presumably French previous owners of the newly acquired villa.
The final scene is a charming, quintessential exchange — the family, dressed in glamorous evening attire in the finery of their sitting room, exchange witty remarks and amused glances as a jazzy rendition of the theme music plays in the background.
“Downton Abbey” is about change and legacy, embracing the new while adapting the traditions of old for the modern world. The movie itself is certainly about progress; the title is “A New Era,” and its premise invites many changes into the characters’ lives and futures. As the characters start to navigate an increasingly modernized world, fans will likely witness this new plot as both a way to strengthen the Downton estate and another opportunity for the cast to confront the changes of the modern world.
Fans of the show will be excited for what is shaping up to be a triumphant return to these characters’ lives. The movie will likely serve the same purpose as the last movie did; an extension of the characters’ storylines and a satisfying conclusion to the Downton Abbey canon that still opens new avenues for future stories.
“Downton Abbey 2: A New Era” will be released in theaters this March. Watch the trailer here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Citizens Bank Opera House witnessed a magical performance of Mikko Nissinen’s “The Nutcracker” on Nov. 26. Not only was the show a comeback of a seasonal favorite just in time for the holidays, but it also marked the Boston Ballet’s first return to live performances since March 2020. The season premiere didn’t disappoint, pushing the musicality and theatricality of ballet to the max to render the performance as family-friendly as possible.
The first act was all about the sound of the holidays, featuring Paul Craig’s sweeping “Arrival of Drosselmeier” and Chisako Oga as the beloved Clara’s entrance to the light tune of “The Christmas Tree,” adorned by a fluttering blue bow kept in constant flight. The production’s Clara was perfectly cast — Oga remained graceful and fluid the entire time the demanding spotlight trailed her. A majority of the moments in Clara’s solos were made truly special by music director Mischa Santora’s conducting. The theme of each melody shifted to accommodate her emotions — from her dismay as the wooden nutcracker is broken by Fritz, to her jubilation when Drosselmeier fixes the nutcracker — every flicker of emotion registered thanks to the quality of feeling and unison emotional shifts santora successfully executed.
The stage effects also heightened the emotional stakes of the pivotal moments in the plot. When Drosslemeier left the stage, for example, the music went minor to convey Clara’s sadness. To accompany that minor shift, the lighting dimmed very slowly and redirected her attention to the Christmas tree, under which the toy Nutcracker was placed, two beams of spotlight shining on his armor as Clara’s dream brought him to life. The stage also shifted following that thematic transition, with the Christmas tree vanishing off the stage as a bigger one appeared in its place. The green and blue lights flickered as well, signifying the Nutcracker’s momentous awakening in the form of Paul Arrais.
The transition between each scene was executed seamlessly, and each prop seemed to be constantly in motion and keeping up with the lively pace of the music. Boston Ballet’s usage of props was not only technically impressive, but a powerful vehicle for imbuing humor into the classic show. The Harlequin Doll springing to life, the brooding Bear breakdancing, and the disjointed movements of the Ballerina Doll as she gets hauled offstage all created delightful moments of comic relief. Even the quirky steps of the fretting Governess (Ekaterine Chubinidze) in between scenes helps facilitate the lighthearted mood.
The second act was characterized by the aesthetic of the tale. From the moment the curtain went up, something magical shifted in the air, painting the whole landscape a shade of dream-like pink. Here, the amazing architectural design of the backdrop told its own story. This dreamlike stage transported the audience into The Kingdom of Sweets, where the Sugar Plum Attendants’ beautiful pink tutus blended with the blue-tinged background of the clouds and the pearly white gates of the Sugar Plum Fairy’s (Viktorina Kapitonova) castle. The costumes only got more grand with each scene. Sparkling details in the Dew Drop’s (Ji Young Chae) bejeweled corset reflected off the white columns and the celestial backdrop, truly dazzling the audience.
On the performance side, crowd favorites of the second act had to be soloists Chrystyn Fentroy and Patric Palkens, who were featured in the Arabian Coffee and Russian Troika respectively. Fentroy evoked a collective gasp from the audience as she hopped into a split lift, the beautiful jewels of her turban dazzling up high under the chandeliers to the rattling maracas. Likewise, Palkens garnered whistling cheers as he executed the technically challenging 540 and double tour jumps.
The integrated sound effects were also crucial to the mood setting for each scene. The Snow King and Queen (Lia Cirio and Patrick Yocum) took the stage to the strumming of the harp, the modulations of the xylophone arpeggio seamlessly harmonizing like their teamwork in the pas de deux. The twinkle of the triangle kept tempo for the Lead Flowers in the Viennese “Waltz of the Flowers,” rising from pliés with the swells of crescendo. However, with Santora conducting the Tchaikovsky score so perfectly, the principal dancers had some difficulty with matching that energy at times. A few pivotal moments in the music of the second act, especially in the Sugar Plum Fairy’s solo and the Waltz of the Flowers, were left empty in the choreography. In moments like these, the choreography wasn't fully emotionally unveiled, preventing the audience from connecting with the scene every now and again.
Despite these minor difficulties, the show’s return to the stage was as triumphant as audiences could hope for. The first act is all about the love for family. The second expresses Boston Ballet’s love for dance. All the stuff in between is sprinkled with a little bit of musical magic as Santora invites Tchaikovsky into the theater. What more can one ask for in a holiday performance?

Taylor Swift’s re-recorded album “Red (Taylor’s Version)” was just the tip of an iceberg of new content. Along with the “All Too Well” short film, Swift has also released a music video for “I Bet You Think About Me,” directed by actress Blake Lively.
The video opens with a groom, played by Mile Teller, practicing his wedding vows. “I will never forget the first time that I met you,” Swift sings. The line is a poetic beginning to a song about an ex-partner who can’t forget the narrator. Suddenly, the groom sees Swift in the mirror instead of himself. His distress is emblematic of the song’s title — he’s clearly still thinking about Swift despite his imminent nuptials.
Set at an all-white wedding, the video goes on to present Swift in mostly monochromatic red outfits, in contrast to the wedding guests, bride and groom, and decorations. Notwithstanding the symbolic connection to the album’s title,
Swift’s behavior might give the color choice a deeper meaning.
The singer takes a chunk out of the wedding cake, knocks over the cake topper, sits at the kids table and entertains the children, eats the olives out of other people’s drinks, and switches out white roses for red ones. She’s a strong presence at the wedding, acting childish and drinking, without a care in the world. Red, traditionally a color of passion, energy, and action, seems like an apt choice to match her actions. The lyrics, like “Mr. Superior Thinkin’,” support the idea that Swift was infantilized and felt separate from the world of her ex. Her mischievous actions seem to indicate a rebellion against that perception of herself.
In the one scene where she isn’t wearing red, Swift is in a white ballgown and dances with the groom. The bridge plays right before, ending with the line: “The the love that you’re lookin’ for is the love that you had.” They dance in a projector-like beam of light, the groom perhaps realizing that this relationship was right for him all along. Swift’s dress, along with the flowers and background, then turns bright red and she picks up a guitar. She steps into her own and grows beyond the person she was in her past relationship. Her “concert” at the end exudes confidence and self-assurance. He may be thinking about her, but she’s definitely not thinking about him.
Fans have also speculated that the song may be symbolic of her struggle with owning her music. The masters of her first six albums were purchased by Scooter Braun from Scott Borchetta in 2019 against the wishes of the artist herself. Braun and Borchetta were “controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them,” Swift said in a blog post on her Tumblr. All of her antics, like teaching the children at the wedding to crank up the middle finger and ruining a wedding cake, could be interpreted as one big “Take that!” to Braun and Borchetta. Swift has re-released two of her past six albums and has built up a fan base dedicated enough to only listen to the re-recorded albums.
This video is likely the first in a series of music videos to be released by Swift. She’s committed to putting out the content and songs her fans want to listen to and see. “I get to do things I know they wish I would have done the first time,” Swift said in an SNL interview about re-recording her music.
The music video for “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)” tells more than just the story of an old relationship. Whether it’s a reflection of her growth or a dig at those who’ve wronged her, the music video sends a bold, almost “reputation”-like, message. Swift has moved on — but you’re probably still thinking about her.

The holiday season can feel like a slap in the face if you’re not expecting it. One moment you’re peacefully eating turkey and stuffing with your family, and the next you’re bombarded by the inescapable red and green month-long purchasing frenzy called Christmas.
It’s understandable if people are not ready for that yet. Maybe some are disillusioned by the commercialism. Maybe students want to focus on their studies for a few more weeks. Or maybe they don’t celebrate at all, or just want to be the Grinch at their holiday parties this year. Whatever the reason, non-observers deserve music this month that isn’t Leroy Anderson’s “Sleigh Ride” or Sergei Prokofiev’s “Troika.”
Holiday season or not, look outside, and the weather is unequivocal. It’s windy, frosty, and stormy, and it calls for winter-appropriate music. Luckily, this playlist of icy music will have listeners shivering in no time. It’s available to listen to here. 
“November Woods” by Arnold Bax (1917)
Bax was a master of mood-music, writing several nature-inspired tone poems around the time of World War I. You’ll find yourself far from Christmas cheer here, as Bax and his windy writing leave you out in the winter cold for 20 minutes. For a brief moment, we find ourselves in a warmer place, only for the storm to rage once again.
Serenade from “The Snowman,” by Erich Korngold (1910)
The ballet “Der Schneemann” (“The Snowman”) was Korngold’s first major work as a child prodigy, completed at age 11. In the story, a musician buys his love a life-size statue of Santa Claus, but a group of children prevent him from delivering the gift by throwing snowballs at him and building a snowman outside the woman’s door. Maybe this short love song will fill you with the ballet’s Christmas antagonism too.
Symphony No. 4, by Gustav Mahler (1900)
Mahler edited this symphony’s scherzo several times, changing it again and again to make the instrumentation icier. He called for the violin soloist to retune their strings for a harsher, more piercing sound. The music is inspired by an image of Death playing his fiddle, so it’s clear that this shivery, ghostly music is sure to quickly ruin any Christmas gathering.
“Winter” from “The Four Seasons,” by Antonio Vivaldi (1720)
Now three hundred years old, Vivaldi’s revolutionary “Four Seasons” still holds its own as an effective description of winter. It’s no surprise that it was the blueprint for innumerable classical compositions that take nature as inspiration. In this movement, you’ll hear teeth chattering, foot stomping, and shivering as a winter storm rages outside.
“Invierno Porteño” from “Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas,” by Astor Piazzolla (1969)
The Argentinian Piazzolla wrote his “Four Seasons of Buenos Aires” as a tango-driven response to Vivaldi, which is why it’s next on this playlist. In “Buenos Aires Winter,” listen carefully and you’ll hear some direct quotes from the Vivaldi woven into the dance as you experience a winter in the Southern hemisphere.
Symphony No. 7, “Sinfonia antartica” by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1952)
That’s not a typo — Vaughan Williams’ seventh symphony, inspired by music he wrote for the 1947 film “Scott of the Antarctic,” is titled “Sinfonia antartica.” You’ll hear the sublime scenery of Antarctica in the first movement, from siren-like wind, to crystalline lakes, to mighty ice shelves. What better place to hide from Santa than on the polar opposite region of his lair?
“Snowdrops” by Johann Strauss II (1854)
Ask someone to think of a wintry waltz and they might come up with Émile Waldteufel’s “Skaters’ Waltz.” Much less famous, though just as good, is this Strauss waltz named for a winter-blooming flower whose blooms are reminiscent of miniature snowballs. Dance along as Strauss, the “Waltz King,” paints a post-Christmas Viennese winter.
Symphony No. 1, “Winter Daydreams,” by P. I. Tchaikovsky (1866)
Though you might be more familiar with Tchaikovsky’s later symphonies, his first is a programmatic gem of the repertoire. The second movement, titled “Land of Desolation, Land of Mists,” develops a single theme for more than 10 minutes before a tortuous climax. The Christmas cynic will surely hear a wrathful North Pole in this movement.
“Ciel d’Hiver” by Kaija Saariaho (2013)
Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho has several works that deal with space, astronomy, and mythology. “Ciel d’Hiver” (“Winter Sky”) comes from her 2002 symphony “Orion,” in which Orion the active mortal hunter is contrasted with Orion the static constellation. As Orion’s constellation again becomes visible to us in the Northern Hemisphere this month, this piece looks up at him.

This review contains spoilers for “The Mandalorian.”
The latest piece of Star Wars live-action canon has just dropped a new trailer. “The Book of Boba Fett,” a spin-off of 2019’s critically-acclaimed “The Mandalorian,” has had fans eagerly waiting since the big reveal in the latter show’s finale post-credit scene. Luckily for us, Disney has decided to continue in the creative direction of “The Mandalorian,” exploring other stories in the vast Star Wars universe and diversifying away from the Skywalker-Palpatine storyline which has dominated three trilogies.
Following the events of Star Wars Episode V, Boba was assumed to be dead after Han Solo struck his jetpack with a vibro-ax, flinging him into the sarlacc pit. Season Two of “The Mandalorian,” however, showed that Boba somehow survived that impossible ordeal, even aiding the titular Mandalorian through several escapades. Hopefully, this upcoming show will reveal just how Boba escaped the infamous sarlacc where one would be “slowly digested over a thousand years.”
This trailer opens with the archetypical Star Wars shot of a desert planet, which is quickly revealed to be Tatooine, signified by a scuttling B’omarr monk in the foreground and what was formerly Jabba’s palace in the background. The B’omarr monks, a religious cult group that believes in removing one’s brain from the physical body in order to reach enlightenment, were the original residents of the palace, before being supplanted by Jabba. However, as the show takes place six years after “The Empire Strikes Back,” Jabba has long been dead. This is important to keep in mind for later.
In the next scene, Boba Fett dons his sleek, battle-worn Mandalorian armor with its characteristic green paint job. Here, as in “The Mandalorian,” Boba is played by Temuera Morrison, who also played Boba’s father, Jango, and every clone trooper in the prequels. He brings an old, gruff, forceful, and weathered energy to the show.
In the next clips, we see glimpses of Fennec Shand, Boba’s number two, played by Ming-Na Wen, who is perhaps best known for voicing the cultural icon and badass, main character in “Mulan.” It therefore goes without saying that Wen will bring a distinct charisma and strength to the role of Fennec. Fennec, recall, was fatally shot during the events of “The Mandalorian” Season Two, but had her life saved by Boba Fett through the use of cybernetics. In return, Fennec pledges herself to serve Boba. In this upcoming show, we will likely see her right by Boba’s side as he navigates his newfound cause.
What is this cause? The trailer’s next shots provide some insight into Boba’s aims and desires, setting up the plot for the season to come. “The Mandalorian” left off with Boba Fett shooting Jabba’s main minion in the head. This bossman, Bib Fortuna, had asserted control over Jabba’s empire after his death, but by season’s end Boba is the one sitting in Jabba’s throne. “The Book of Boba Fett” will be the continuation of those efforts. As depicted in the trailer, Boba is now trying to rebuild Jabba’s vast criminal network. Importantly, instead of fear, Boba claims he wants to rule with respect. In one scene, he assembles all of Jabba’s former captains, asking for cooperation instead of infighting and claiming that this approach will make everyone rich. In another scene, however, Boba strongly implies that he will feed those captains to wild animals for their “insolence.” Clearly, Boba wants to fill in the power vacuum left in the wake of Jabba’s death — and do it differently, through respect and mutual cooperation. However, at the same time, Boba can’t help but fall into some of the same tactics brutally deployed by Jabba.
With this exciting peek into what’s to come, only time will tell if Boba Fett can deliver on everything he has promised. Luckily for him, this show serves as the product (and perhaps continuation) of his transition from unforgivable villain who tried to kill Han Solo in the original trilogy to likeable antihero who saved Baby Yoda. Now, for fans and casual watchers alike, Boba Fett posits an exciting new development in the expansion of the canonical Star Wars universe.
“The Book of Boba Fett” hits Disney Plus on Dec. 29. You can watch the trailer here.

The release of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” along with the recent “All Too Well” short film directed by Taylor Swift have taken the internet by storm over the past few weeks. As one of the most well-known artists in the music industry for over a decade, Taylor Swift has amassed a wide and loyal fan base spanning generations from Gen X-ers to Gen Z-ers. Her re-release of the album Red included a 10-minute re-recording of the critically-acclaimed track “All Too Well,” which fans have long speculated is about Swift’s relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010 — a speculation Swift’s new music video has only fueled.
It’s no surprise, then, that social media timelines everywhere have been flooded with fans’ reactions to the 10-minute version of “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” which have included people’s mostly negative thoughts on the role they believe Jake Gyllenhaal played in the saga.
On Twitter, user @pxchxcxx wrote, “i am convinced Jake Gyllenhaal hired 21k people or made 21k accounts to dislike Taylor Swift’s All Too Well short film.” Another user, @thinkersersi said “jake gyllenhaal prepared for his role as manipulative villain “mysterio” in spiderman: far from home by gaslighting Taylor Swift in 2012.” The Jake Gyllenhaal negativity runs so deep that people use it as a benchmark for evaluating their significant others: User @CourtneyCaruso3 tweeted about“The feminine urge to force him to watch Taylor Swift’s short film and make him give me his full opinion about Jake Gyllenhaal.”
Fans have also gone to TikTok to express their reinvigorated dislike of the actor and Swift ex via short skits and reactions to meme compilations. User @marystoes on TikTok, for example, posted a video reacting to memes about the difficult time Jake Gyllenhaal’s publicist and his girlfriend must be having due to the song’s extended release. A sound asking people to “name a celebrity you hate” with the response “Jake Gyllenhaal” has similarly skyrocketed to fame, and has been used in over 12 thousand videos, as of this writing. Some of these videos have between 100 and 300,000 views.
Even TikTok’s brand accounts have gotten in on the action. The Sour Patch TikTok account, for example, commented on Taylor Swift’s Nov. 12 “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)” announcement, “WHERE IS JAKE. BRING HIM TO ME.”
Brands have been quick to adopt social media as a means of advertising by participating in pop culture in the past, but hating on Jake Gyllenhaal has taken it to a whole other level, with brands publicly, and humorously, denouncing the celebrity.
The Jake Gyllenhaal hate may seem like just another internet trend, but interspersed between the “point of view: you’re Jake Gyllenhaal’s publicist” TikToks and tweets about fans asking for Swift’s scarf back are glimpses of the hate to come for another one of Taylor Swift’s exes: John Mayer. Fans have speculated that Taylor Swift’s future re-releases will be songs and albums about him, like Speak Now, so he’ll likely face the same, if not more, internet backlash than what Jake Gyllenhaal is enduring.
Still, there has been some push back against the slander of Swift’s ex-boyfriends. Many have cited the incredibly damaging aspect of these comments on the celebrity’s mental health and the extremes fans will go to be “supportive” of their faves. One user on Twitter, @heavenslt, brought up the damage that comments like “I hope you die” can do to celebrities, who are real people and who can actually see those messages. “I can’t stand them harassing people anymore,” they wrote.
Vogue Magazine’s Emma Spector also brought up in an article the fact that focusing on Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriends isn’t really the point of her music.
It’s hard to deny that the internet’s support of Taylor Swift is stronger than ever, and sometimes that support takes the form of hating on her exes, the speculated subjects of her music. While it seems like the particular past lover the internet picks to (metaphorically and socially) rip apart will change with each coming release, the broader wave of support for Swift that manifests as these anti-Jake Gyllenhaal comments doesn’t seem to be dying down soon.

For the 2021-2022 academic year, the Harvard University Committee on the Arts has commissioned six pieces of art to promote the visibility and importance of art within the community. According to the committee, the commissions aim to promote energizing and thought-provoking questions and act as collaborative partnerships between artists and the Harvard community.
“In 2008 the task force on the arts released a report which called for the university to make the arts more central to the cognitive life of the university,” said Robin Kelsey, the Dean of Arts and Humanities and Shirley Carter Burden Professor of Photography in an interview with the Harvard Crimson. “It’s very exciting for me.”
The commissioned works span a variety of artistic disciplines, from sculpture to theater to dance. Composer, vocalist, music director, and producer Tariq Al-Sabir, for example, is collaborating on a piece with Claire Chase, Harvard Professor of the Practice of Music, that will premiere on Dec. 2.
Al-Sabir aims to shape his composition around the specific members of Harvard’s New Music Ensemble and their individual styles. “I’m really writing with and in reaction to the ensemble, just learning about who the actual members are, how they place, what they place, and how their creative styles are,” he said in an interview.
Al Sabir also aimed for a highly dynamic creative process while working, providing the students with more of a guide that “leaves lots of room for improv” and teaches them to put something of themselves into the work.
“I do give them a written piece of music, but it’s left pretty open ended in terms of interpretation and what they can do with their own opinions,” he said of the process. “It’s about being present and kind of surrendering to the circumstances to create something beautiful.”
Nailah Randall-Bellinger — a dance educator, scholar, and choreographer who has been teaching for over 35 years — shaped the choreography of and spearheaded “Initiation– In Love Solidarity.” The piece explores the Middle Passage and the fight against “thingification,” to quote Randall-Bellinger. It additionally aims to investigate how the African diaspora connects with their ancestors and takes back their identity.
“What I’m looking at is how we reclaim our identity after being stripped of who we really were, how we were dehumanized, and how we, as the great Aimé Césaire says, became ‘thingificationed,’” said Randall-Bellinger.
“I was interested in how we, as African diasporic people, were able to work through all of that and reclaim our true identity. It’s about transformation. It’s about reclamation of identity. It’s about ownership. It’s about kinship. It’s about forming alliances through joy,” she added.
Like Al-Sabir, Randall-Bellinger’s creative process was heavily based upon the voices of her dancers.
“If you listen to some of the words spoken in the live performance, it’s through the journaling,” Randall-Bellinger revealed. “All of that helped build the skeleton of the work. Through the collaboration of the dancers, we were able to put flesh on the skeleton.”
Moreover, Randall-Bellinger aimed for the dancers to do more than simply execute her choreography or provide inspiration via journaling, pushing them instead to the forefront of the work by using their own panting and breathing as the audio for their dancing. “You get to hear gasping, gasping for air, gasping not to drown.”
Development occurred even up until the final performance. “Last week, we were like, ‘What do you feel about where we are right now? What do you feel about this idea of water? The idea of cowrie shells?’” she said. “The whole process was a continual refining, which correlates to how Africans in the diaspora have had to survive.”
The live dance was immediately followed by a dance film thematically connected to the Middle Passage choreography, featuring spoken word, cowrie shells, and wide shots of the dancers in ethereal white dresses dancing in the water of beaches.
“There’s two parts that echo back and forth,” Randall-Bellinger explained. “My vision was to speak to the ancestors, to bring those sea water spirits to the forefront, to honor them, to talk about what it feels like to have gone through the Middle Passage in memory, even if not in the visceral experience.”
These two commissions, along with the other four, ultimately promote art’s prominence on campus, stresses Kelsey.
“I find the campus is so enlivened by the kinds of art installations that we have been able to commission over the years. I hope our students find these commissions to be thought provoking as well.”

Jeon Somi, otherwise known only as Somi, has been on the rise for the past few years with hit singles like “DUMB DUMB” and “Birthday,” which have reached over 100 and 97 million views, respectively. The singer originally debuted in 2016 with the K-pop girl group I.O.I. and launched her solo career in 2019 with one of Korea’s most renowned entertainment companies –– YG Entertainment. She became an immediate success. In a break from the cute, schoolgirl persona that she took on during her I.O.I. phase, Somi’s solo debut, her song “Birthday,” instead depicts a more serious and badass version of her. The music video for her latest single “XOXO” also presents her in this more rebellious light.
Like in her other music videos, the vibrant color scheme and playful graphics of “XOXO” instantly grab the attention of viewers. Somi enters the scene with a heartbroken look on her face after she learns her boyfriend has cheated on her with his close friend. But as the music starts, the singer suddenly takes on an indifferent front as she sings, “The half I gave you is mine now / Don’t call me a bitch / Your girl, she’s the bitch.”
Unlike her other more light-hearted singles, “XOXO” speaks to Somi’s vengeful side that arises from an ex-boyfriend’s betrayal. In Somi’s unique style, “XOXO” has a pop cadence with some hip-hop inflections, targeting a more mainstream audience. However, unlike her past work, “XOXO” also has a slower tempo, reflecting her ostensibly heartbroken state.
Throughout the video, Somi continually enacts her vengeance, breaking into and trashing her ex’s house, chasing his car and blowing it up, tying him up and hitting him with tennis balls, and even blowing up his house. This ex, who appears in her previous music video “DUMB DUMB,” is wearing a dog suit throughout the “XOXO” music video, which seems to represent his animal-like foolishness. His true identity is irrelevant as his cheating actions alone reveal his playboy nature. In fact, viewers are only made aware that he is the same person as Somi’s crush in the “DUMB DUMB” video when he removes the dog mask at the very end of the video.
Interestingly, Somi’s father, Matthew Douma, also makes an appearance in “XOXO” as a sheriff. Somi has long made apparent her close relationship with her father, who has also acted in several Korean variety shows and dramas. Their intimate relationship as a father-daughter duo further adds to the relatable appeal of “XOXO.”
The set, costume design, and videography of “XOXO,” though aesthetically pleasing, are quite similar to other K-pop music videos in theme and style. Oversized, brightly-colored outfits and various outbursts of anger in the form of explosions and vandalization speak to Somi’s raging sentiments towards her ex, but the precise and mesmerizing choreography are commonplace among the K-pop scene. Still, it is hard to deny the high-quality and hypnotic charisma of the music video. The intentionality of the set design and storyline fit perfectly with Somi’s emotional state, and serve as a cathartic outlet for many who may be feeling similarly heartbroken. Somi’s “XOXO” is a must-listen, as millions of fans around the world have already discovered — and the video is worth a watch too.

With the arrival of the annual Ghibli Fest, a beloved set of Studio Ghibli films are back in theaters this winter — indulging millions of fans in their trademark wonder and nostalgia. Many movie-goers, fooled by Ghibli’s mild G or PG ratings and family-friendly image, dismiss Ghibli’s works as simple feel-good movies. After all, how much harm could a talking frog, giant baby, or a set of googly-eyed dust bunnies do? At first glance, “Spirited Away” appears to be a typical coming-of-age adventure — but Hayao Miyazaki’s work is never that clear-cut. Instead, “Spirited Away” is a meticulously-crafted criticism of Westernization and capitalism, a story advocating for a restoration of and respect for the traditional rather than being caught up in a, in contrast to the common modern blind dive for growth and advancement.
The movie opens with Chihiro, the 10-year-old protagonist, sulking in the backseat of a car about moving from the city to the countryside. The story takes a fantastical turn when the road leads them to a fathomless tunnel, beyond which lies a dangerous spirit world. There, every child’s nightmare materializes: Chihiro’s parents turn into pigs upon devouring the food of the spirits. There is no longer a man who boasts that money is a cure-all (“Don’t worry, you’ve got Daddy here. He’s got credit cards and cash.”) — only a helpless pig with no knowledge of having ever been human. The lighting of the scene then quickly darkens, stripping away the security from both parents and daylight from the vulnerable child.
Rendered parentless in an instant, Chihiro has no choice but to go to Yubaba, the big boss of the spirits’ bathhouse, and practically beg for employment with her and her parents’ life on the line. The power dynamic between the two characters is not unlike one of a robber baroness and a worker, an allusion to one of many moral failures of capitalism: child labor. The bright colors and glitzy interior of Yubaba’s office serve as a visual representation of the corruption that happens within. The dominance of new Western capitalist ideals over traditional Japanese values is also revealed in the clothes the characters wear: Chihiro and other bathhouse workers wear simple traditional Japanese tasuki and kimono while the big boss, Yubaba, drapes herself with lavish European dress and jewelry.
Chihiro is not the only victim of the capitalist and highly-industrialized spirit world. Kamaji’s boiler room, a poorly lit and musty basement strongly reminiscent of a sweatshop, is entirely sourced by susuwatari: human-turned-Soots that are enslaved to work for their lives. Overworked, mistreated, and replaceable, susuwatari are just animated renditions of miserable factory workers — the ugly underside of the magnificent bathhouse driven by abusive capitalism.
Any car enthusiast will be able to tell that Chihiro’s family rides a 1996 Audi A4 Quattro, a luxurious imported car considered a status good in Japan. It’s cool to see a real-life brand on screen, but the car is more than just a vehicle for the kind of hyperrealism Ghibli is known for: it is an important plot device that reveals the socio-economic status of the Ogino’s. The main traumatic turn of the story is that the Ogino family is relegated from a wealthy middle class to helpless pigs, not to mention a child laborer, as a metaphor for Japan’s moral and economic decay following the influx of western capitalism.
The spirit world is crowded by architectures that resemble those of the Meiji era, combining both traditional Japanese and Western styles. Indeed, the spirit world is staged in the Meiji era (1868 to 1912), the period when Japan broke out of isolation and became receptive to Western influences. This aesthetic choice is in sync with other references to emerging industrialization such as the train noise that unfittingly arises from a tranquil field to the dark boiler room with tiny laborers. Through these architectural and historical elements, Miyazaki wittily illustrates Japan’s devaluation of cultural identity and morality for the sake of the expediency that can be bought with Westernization.
"Spirited Away" is not a story that pits good against evil or involves change for the better. Instead, the story is driven by multidimensional characters who seek to rectify their or others' mistakes from the past, not to beat a villain. Consider that even Yubaba has a "good" side: being an affectionate mother and a passionate business woman. Miyazaki has said, "Yubaba is putting all her efforts to protect the bathhouse. She is not a villain." Just as Chihiro's kindness to a stranger evokes unintentional consequences and Haku loses his identity from humans destroying the Kohaku River, no character is entirely at fault for the conflicts that arise. That's why the resolution of the story is restoring what used to be, rather than pushing for growth and advancement.
The most clear example of this is how that resolution is achieved: Chihiro restores humanity to her parents through physical labor, and the witch's seal is restored to Zeniba to lift her curse from Haku. While rectifying others’ failures is a charitable act, it is still a sacrifice on Chihiro's end. The theme of restoration holds for Haku as well, who rediscovers his name and past with Chihiro's help. In the process, he simply regains a sense of who he used to be, and this proves to be enough — he can now liberate himself from Yubaba's enslaving contract. “If you completely forget your name, you’ll never find your way home,” he says at the beginning of the film. No-Face is a more literal example. The greed and materialism of the bathhouse shape him into a monster, but he returns to his normal innocuous self the moment he steps out. This “return to normal” development in each character reflects the importance of retaining one’s identity over external factors like social status, wealth, and the gluttonous desires intensified by capitalism.
At the end of the movie, Chihiro and her parents, now oblivious of their journey in the spirit world, walk out of the tunnel. This scene is a complete mirror image of when they first entered the tunnel. Every motion and spoken word is a replay of the beginning, reinforcing the idea that nothing has changed, at least externally, since the outset of their journey. For everything that happened in the spirit world, there is no repentance for the things that happened in the spirit world; instead, life goes unapologetically back to the way it was, past misdeeds left unacknowledged.
Throughout the work, Miyazaki has left shiny pebbles of hints that, once seen, can’t be unseen. The movies entrust their viewers — regardless of age — with an extraordinary amount of responsibility in spotting and putting these clues together into a merciless exposé of the world. Perhaps by doing so, Studio Ghibli hopes to inspire not only wonder, but awareness and action in their global audience.

“Realizing that music held a special power to make people feel seen and feel emotionally comforted was really inspiring to me,” said Nivi Ravi ‘21, a musician and singer who used her time on campus to fuse classical music with her love of neuroscience and education. Currently, Ravi is on tour for a new opera called “Iphigenia.”
Ravi was born and raised in the Chicago area before moving to New York for high school. Her path to music began at the young age of four years old when she became determined to play the violin.
“I think my initial interest in classical music, through playing the violin for so long, really drew me towards classical voice and opera,” Ravi said. Yet the shift to singing was also fortuitous. A music teacher pulled aside Ravi and her mother and told her to take singing lessons. “She saw something in me, some potential, and I think that was what pushed me and my family to consider taking voice lessons.” It was in these middle school classes that Ravi’s love of singing began.
At Harvard, Ravi combined her musical prowess with her other academic interests though a joint concentration in Neuroscience and Music, along with a secondary in Educational Studies. Ravi had been intrigued by music’s potential to heal before entering college, playing at monthly concerts in a local nursing home. Ravi wanted to learn more through her undergraduate studies. “What is the connection between music and memory? How are we able to cognitively process music, emotionally process music?”
Ravi pursued research during her time on campus, working with the Gaab Lab, a group that studies developmental cognitive neuroscience at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, to examine the relationship between music exposure on brain structure development and learning in young children.
Ravi was even more deeply involved in the arts while on campus and gushes even now about her experiences. Throughout her undergraduate career, she played violin with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and sang with Harvard College Opera and Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum. Moreover, Ravi played integral roles in student leadership, becoming the president of Collegium her senior year. She even organized recitals with the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. “I still consider that to be the center of my undergraduate arts experience,” she said. Ravi was also the recipient of the Louise Donovan Award, which recognizes the “unsung heroes” who direct art productions to success.
Serving as president of Collegium, Ravi noted, was the culmination of her artistic career in college. “That was the most demanding and rewarding experience of my undergraduate career,” she said. “It’s hard to be the president of a 501(c)(3) during any given year, but especially during a year in the pandemic for a choral organization.” Ravi had to adapt to the pandemic, orchestrating remote choral practices and managing thousands of audio recordings to produce virtual performances.
Ravi lauded her many mentors that aided her musical journey in college, many of whom she is still in close contact with. In particular, she noted the support of Andrew G. Clark, the Director of Choral Activities and Senior Lecturer on Music at Harvard University and conductor of Collegium. “I think I wouldn’t be the artist and leader that I am today without Andy,” she said. Ravi also praised Carolyn Abbate, a Harvard music professor. “I’ve never felt so seen by a professor in terms of my academic output in relation to music, and she is someone who inspires me on an everyday basis,” Ravi said. “I think she really inspired my pursuit of musicology and my understanding of music beyond what's written on the page, the role of music and a cultural context and just what it means to be performing music beyond the sound.”
But Esperanza Spalding, Harvard Professor of the Practice of Music and a performer-composer whom NPR has called “the 21st century’s jazz genius,” was perhaps the most important figure for Ravi’s trajectory after graduation.
“She has opened so many doors for me, but she has been such a supportive, encouraging, almost motherly figure in my life,” Ravi said.
When Spalding coincidentally attended a Morris Robinson Master Class at which Ravi was performing, she approached Ravi and asked her to help develop a new opera. That opera, “Iphigenia,” premiered on Nov. 12 at Cutler Majestic Theater in Boston. Ravi is currently on tour as a member of the cast. She plays Iphigenia the Younger, one of six manifestations of the character within the opera.
“It was really just a special experience to share a brand new opera with the world with my family and friends, an opera that tells the story of a female sacrifice that feels alive and present today,” Ravi said.
Ravi’s performance in “Iphigenia” is a continuation of previous passions and her work on campus. After touring with “Iphigenia,” Ravi plans on exploring the opera productions of the world via her Booth Fellowship. “My spring is going to be traveling the world studying opera through a musicological and performance perspective.”

Inside a T station, nearly anything goes: shirtless men doing flips from the subway poles, angry evangelical preachers passing out pamphlets, intoxicated college students holding in various bodily fluids at once, people risking their lives to sprint across tracks just to make their commutes on time, and, of course, rats. For a storyteller in need of inspiration, then, Boston’s public transportation system is a setting with nearly infinite possibilities that grants any writer powerful artistic license.
As such, “T: An MBTA Musical,” running every first and third Friday through December at The Rockwell, is based on a golden premise. Staged mere feet from the Davis Square T stop, the goofy and spirited show follows three 20-somethings navigating the maddening inconveniences of the MBTA and teaming up to bring down the institution from within, a journey marketed as “part love story, part melodrama, part scavenger hunt — but mostly underground.” Unfortunately, despite its potential and the abundance of energy from its cast and band, the end product fails to live up to three out of four of those key descriptors (though it is, admittedly, staged underground in the basement of the Rockwell). Even in such a surreal and unpredictable location as the T — the ultimate suspender of disbelief — the plot veers into baffling and, many times, unnecessarily sexual directions. Despite their best efforts, the actors’ enthusiasm cannot steer it back on track.
The musical’s three protagonists, Alice, John, and Michelle, have all been harboring personal vendettas against the accursed MBTA when they happen upon a mysterious treasure map that might lead to the transport authority’s darkest secrets. Their mad dash across various T lines to evade the MBTA cops doubles as a metaphorical journey of self-discovery, even if the specifics of the narrative become increasingly contrived and off-putting. Alice, for instance, comes from a long line of MBTA criminals who have a habit of punching T workers, a bizarre family legacy she’s trying to escape. With an incredibly minimal set of some chairs and painted signs, the actors’ performances as they run around the theater and interact with the crowd, as well as the sound cues of familiar subway noises and P.A. system, go a long way to invoke the claustrophobic, frenetic vibes of the T. A special shout-out is in order to the show’s ensemble, who seemed to be having the times of their lives every time they were on stage, and to composer Melissa Carubia for a score full of some serious earworms and impressively intricate melodies.
At its best moments, the show reads like a love letter to the Boston area, celebrating the chaos but also undeniable charm of many of its signature subway stations. The scene set at the Kenmore stop, where the trio encounters a crowd of drunk and boisterous Bostonians fresh from Fenway Park, for example, strikes the perfect balance between this affection for and mockery of the city’s culture. Even if the characters’ motivations for embarking on their subterranean scavenger hunt are murky and the payoff ultimately unsatisfying, the clues and riddles they discover along the way help pique the audience’s interest and keep them engaged.
In many ways, the T and its authorities make the perfect antagonists: Who doesn’t love to complain about the massive delay times, occasionally rude employees, and constant construction that haunt Boston’s public transportation? The animosity, however, is directed not at bureaucrats or government officials who leave the oldest subway system in the Western hemisphere poorly funded and run-down, but rather at the MBTA workers themselves, to such an extent that it often feels like the writers are punching down. Yes, taking the T often sucks, but basically every MBTA employee featured in the show is either a total buffoon, bumbling around like one of the Three Stooges, or a vindictive monster out to get the passengers, such as a banshee-like bus driver. By the end, in a moment of sudden self-awareness, the three protagonists realize they really ought to own up to their personal problems, rather than treating the T workers as the ultimate scapegoat. Yet, their last-minute epiphany that “we are all the T” doesn’t counteract all the insults hurled at the employees who have to put up with passengers like Michelle, Alice, and John’s nonsense on a daily basis.
Equally disappointing is the handling of Michelle’s character and her ham-fisted “romance” with John, the frat-boy with a secret “heart of gold.” The self-proclaimed “Queen of One Night Stands,” Michelle tries to distance herself from her promiscuous image while constantly navigating the wandering eyes of creepy men, including supposed “good guy” John. Early in the show, Michelle refuses to show an embarrassing, probably explicit video from her camera roll, much to pushy, insistent John’s annoyance. In a complete invasion of privacy, he steals her phone to discover that the video is actually her doing a comedy routine, a side of her personality she has tried to suppress. Still, the audience is supposed to continue rooting for this icky relationship.
There are probably few places less erotic than a dingy subway car, likely covered in urine and just about every bacterial strain known to mankind. Yet it seems the characters all gulped down a dozen oysters each before boarding a T car pumped with a continual supply of pheromones given how provocative the storyline becomes by the end. At the climax (no pun intended) of the performance, the three leads quite literally have a threesome in the subway car while singing about the need “to come together,” all as a desperate act of retaliation against the MBTA that keeps “f*cking them over.” If that sounds completely heavy-handed and out-of-left-field within this review, it was even more dumbfounding and confusing within the actual context of the show.
All that being said, it’s hard to deny the entertainment value of this bonkers musical. It’s the type of performance that genuinely needs to be seen to be believed. There was never a dull moment in this romp, particularly during the catchy, choreographed group numbers. However, much like a street musician down in a subway station singing really loudly and out of tune, “T: An MBTA Musical” often felt jaw-dropping and hilarious for all the wrong reasons.

Sony Pictures released the first poster for “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” which is set to be released on Dec. 17. While the first trailer for this highly anticipated film reveals very little, the poster revealed to fans that the emergence of a multiverse can be expected.
The poster shows the mechanical arms of Doctor Octopus, who will be played by Alfred Molina reprising his role from Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man 2.” The poster also displays clouds of sand behind Spider-Man hinting at the reappearance of Sandman — in “Spider-Man 3.”
Spider-Man poses underneath lightning bolts that are striking down through the sky, implying that Electro will appear in the movie. Electro (Jamie Foxx) was the villain who appeared in “The Amazing Spider-Man 2.” Additionally, while an appearance by the Green Goblin in the film was hinted at by the green grenade rolling] on the ground in the trailer, his role is confirmed with his explicit presence in the background of the poster.
As seen in the trailer, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) will also be involved with the plot of the film, though] it is still unclear if this movie will foreshadow some themes that will arise in the upcoming “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” premiering in 2022.
While the poster does confirm the appearance of four villains in the upcoming film, it does not reveal too much information about the plot of the movie itself. Myriads of rumors are circulating about characters that are hypothesized to be in the movie. The appearance of these villains from the previous Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films suggests that they will both return as Spider-Man in the upcoming film. Sadly, however, Tom Holland has hinted that fans should not get their hopes up yet.
“People don’t believe me when I say that [Maguire and Garfield] are not coming back, but people are going to have to believe me at some point,” said Tom Holland in an interview with Total Film. “It means a lot to me. The first time you see Doc and the rest of the characters that come back, it’s so exciting and it’s such a huge moment in cinematic history. It’s three generations coming together.”
Marvel could have given fans all of the information they are going to get before the movie hits theaters, and this is okay! It’s understandable for Marvel to purposely be vague in their promotions, as they slowly drop hints about the upcoming multiverse — from the reveal of the tear in the sacred timeline in the Disney+ show “Loki” to the reveal that Venom is in the MCU from the recent “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” film. Marvel’s purposeful ambiguity means the reveal of characters from other Spider-Man universes is of great significance for the future of the MCU. Interestingly, it has also been revealed that Marvel’s decision to withhold the information about the movie might be strategic, as this movie marks a departure from previous films in the Spider-Man franchise.
“What people will be really surprised about is that it’s not fun, this film,” said Tom Holland in the interview with Total Film. “It’s dark and it’s sad, and it’s going to be really affecting. You’re going to see characters that you love go through things that you would never wish for them to go through.”
While the expected casting of Maguire and Garfield has not been confirmed yet, it has also not been disproven. So keep your fingers crossed, Marvel fans, and get ready to be transported into the multiple universes of your favorite neighborhood Spider-Man.

Sofia Coppola was destined to be a part of Hollywood. The director, screenwriter, and producer is the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, the director of “The Godfather” trilogy, and Eleanor Coppola, documentary filmmaker. Not unlike the Corleone family, the Coppolas are powerful and dynastic in their own right. Perhaps her astute connections to Hollywood are best illustrated through the Coppola family’s six-month quarantine at their Napa Valley estate where three generations of Coppola’s watched each other’s films.
While Sofia Coppola may have gotten her start in Hollywood through nepotism, she has established a unique and talented voice of her own since then. Though she boasts a diverse filmography, it is clear that Coppola’s upbringing defines her cinematic perspective, and her films explore shared themes: the mundane aspects of the celebrity, concurring feelings of isolation and invasiveness, and the relationship between father and daughter.
Coppola was first thrust into the spotlight by her father. Following Winona Ryder’s sudden departure from the role of Mary Corleone during the filming of “The Godfather Part III,” Francis Ford Coppola enlisted a then 18-year-old Sofia Coppola to fill the role. However, Coppola never aspired to be an actress; in describing her motivation for filling the role, Coppola has said, “It seemed like he was under a lot of pressure and I was helping out.” Sofia Coppola’s part was terribly received, with several critics scapegoating her role for issues with the overall film.
Following this controversial acting experience, however, Coppola had no shortage of alternative venues to experiment in. Through her family’s connections, Sofia Coppola had the freedom to try a variety of fields: she starred in a Madonna music video, attempted modelling and photography, and even designed a Japanese clothing line. However, the pivotal moment in her career came when Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore recommended that she read “The Virgin Suicides” by Jeffrey Eugenides, which she eventually adapted into her first feature film as director.
“I just feel like I have a feminine point of view and I’m happy to put that out there,” Coppola has said. Certainly in “The Virgin Suicides” (1999) Coppola captures the haziness of distant memories and the idealism of teenage romantic affection. Though the film revolves around the alluring and enigmatic Lisbon sisters, it is told from the outsider perspective of the neighborhood boys. With an intrigue that borders on obsession, the boys attempt in vain to understand the Lisbon sisters and the complexity of female adolescence. The film is gruesome and features the premeditated suicide of all the Lisbon sisters. Nevertheless, “The Virgin Suicides” is a love letter to female adolescence. Coppola manages to capture the warm intimacy between the Lisbon sisters through a pastel color palette and handheld videography.
“The Virgin Suicides” marked the emergence of Sofia Coppola’s individual artistic voice, but the film would not have been possible without Francis Ford Coppola’s assistance. In the film, the younger Coppola uses a cool filter to create an oppressive foreboding atmosphere. This same technique is a Francis Ford Coppola staple, most notably used in his 1983 film “Rumble Fish.” Additionally, the elder Coppola also produced the movie under his own company, American Zoetrope.
In later films, Sofia Coppola managed to establish an identity even more her own. However, her lifelong proximity to Hollywood still looms large in her perspective as a director.
Fame’s paradoxical sensation of isolation and invasiveness are illustrated in Coppola’s 2003 film “Lost in Translation,” which centers around Bob Harris, a movie star in the twilight of his career, spending time in Japan while in between movies. As a celebrity, Harris inevitably lives with a compromised sense of privacy. Yet, being in a foriegn country, Harris is disoriented and lonely.
Once again, Coppola focused on themes of the celebrity experience in her 2010 film “Somewhere,” which follows a celebrity on the rise. However, rather than exploring the more glamorous aspects of celebrity life, Coppola hones in on the mundane, centering the movie around the relationship between the protagonist and his eleven-year-old daughter and the passionless vices he relies on to pass the time.
Coppola is undeniably at the forefront of female directors in Hollywood. In 2003, she was the first female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for “Lost in Translation.” In 2017, Coppola’s film “The Beguiled” made her the second female to win Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. However, because of her filial ties, Coppola’s success should not necessarily be used as a metric of progress for women in the film industry.
Currently, Coppola is shifting her direction toward television. In a partnership with Apple and A24, Coppola will be creating an episodic television series for Edith Warton’s novel “The Custom of the Country.” Fans look forward to seeing how she will translate her signature themes and styles to the small screen.

“The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim” and its steady stream of re-releases has been such a prominent subject of memes that its developer itself joked about a “very special” edition on Amazon Alexa, pagers and smart fridges in a video featuring Keegan-Michael Key. But with last week’s new edition, it’s worth putting the memes aside, and taking a look back at the game as it celebrates its 10th anniversary.
The fifth Elder Scrolls game is set in the imperial province of Skyrim, 200 years after the events of the last installment, “Oblivion.” The Empire has been in a continuous decline for the past two centuries, and the discontent caused a local noble to revolt, prompting a civil war.
The player character is mistaken for a rebel and destined for execution. As they are about to be beheaded, a dragon appears, marking the return of the legendary creatures. The protagonist — revealed to be the last in the long line of “Dragonborns,” heroes with a mortal body, but dragon soul — is the only one who can save the world.
The clichéd story of yet another “Chosen One,” while decent, was certainly not the selling point when the game came out, but it didn’t need to be. Back in 2011, the flashy premieres such as “Dragon Age II,” “Star Wars: The Old Republic,” or “The Witcher 2” had one thing in common: a more or less linear story. But Bethesda, the game’s developer, was a trendsetting pioneer of open-world role-playing games, and Skyrim was its tour de force.
Nonlinearity seems like the standard nowadays. But even though the past decade has seen a proliferation of sandboxes, Skyrim’s world continues to stand out.
The game is not a new “Assassin’s Creed.” It’s not an empty — if visually impressive — world. “Skyrim” is lively, and it continues to impress with the sheer number and variety of mysteries, lore and carefully designed locations at every step. From dwarven ruins and ancient tombs, to ice caves and vampire lairs, the dungeons offer hours of meaningful adventures with their standalone quests. The environment aboveground is just as diverse, with rugged mountaintops, tundra and taiga hiding over 600 locations ranging from towns, forts, and watermills to dragon lairs, shrines, and necromancer hideouts.
But should the Dragonborn become bored with accidentally stopping a revenge-bent necromancer from unleashing a horde of undead against the Empire or solving the mystery of an abandoned lighthouse-turned house whose residents mysteriously vanished when aimlessly wandering, there’s plenty more to explore. Skyrim offers a surprising amount of structure in an open world with more than half a dozen side quest lines and two major expansions. The game’s factions and their plotlines are as extensive as the main story. Be it through crafting a plot to assassinate the emperor with the Dark Brotherhood, joining a pack of werewolves or a clan of vampires or endangering — and saving — the world with a college of mages, Skyrim offers hours of engrossing stories and chances to explore different styles of gameplay.
It would be disingenuous to say that a decade-old game looks as good as it has at its release. The graphics are by no means antiquated or off-putting, but the quality of textures and the length of rendering is not up to par anymore. The game’s physics leave much to be desired. The interactions with water look dated, and those with the environment are limited. While somewhat redeemed by its variety, the game’s fighting system is underwhelming, essentially constrained to attacks with the right mouse button and occasional blocks, if the protagonist uses a melee weapon or a shield. It seems simplistic even by 2011 standards, when compared to contemporary games like “The Witcher 2.”
The mechanical inadequacies can be blamed on the engine, but the game’s Creation Engine is also what has ensured Skyrim’s longevity. Unlike the previous two installments, which used the 1997 Gamebryo, the Creation Engine was brand new at the time of the game’s release, designed specifically with Bethesda’s future RPGs in mind. In an updated version, the Creation Engine is still used for the studio’s upcoming titles. Perhaps more importantly, it’s easy to work with even for an amateur. Thanks to that fact, Skyrim is one of the most frequently modded games, with over 60,000 mod submissions. More importantly, the engine’s simplicity has allowed the community to fix the notoriously buggy game.
Skyrim has clearly aged both in terms of its visuals and its mechanics. But the richness of the world and its story ensure Skyrim’s longevity and continued appeal.

This year’s Astroworld Festival was a horrific disaster, claiming the lives of 10 people and injuring hundreds more. Much controversy now surrounds the concert’s execution — critics have accused organizers of bungled planning and set-up, failing to heed warnings from officials, and creating a general air of chaos that led to a preventable tragedy. Many articles have since criticized the lack of safety precautions surrounding crowd control at concerts. This piece, however, will focus specifically on Travis Scott’s past concert conduct. While it’s extremely unfortunate that this concert unfolded the way it did, the tragic incident at this year’s Astroworld was the deadly culmination of a history of dangerous behavior by Scott at his concerts.
Travis Scott is known for bringing a distinctive, undeniable energy to a crowd. Observers (i.e. teenagers on Urban Dictionary) have coined it the La Flame effect, a well-researched phenomenon that has been documented in at least two YouTube compilation videos. Essentially, crowds tend to become particularly frenzied and manic whenever Scott appears onstage, even when he’s not the headlining act. Given his electrifying aura, it may seem like Scott isn’t really at fault for his concerts being injury-prone. But that line of reasoning doesn’t hold true. The problem here is that Scott actively incites this environment at concerts.
At Travis Scott concerts, extreme moshing, stage-diving, and crowd-surfing are the norm. Scott once ordered a fan to jump from a second-story balcony to surf the crowd. He was later sued by another fan for causing his paralysis after jumping from that same balcony.
If that is the Scott-mandated protocol, then the Scott-mandated ideology would be “raging.” Raging, of course, refers to intense substance-fueled partying. In a 2015 interview with GQ, Scott detailed the tenets of this ideology: making concerts feel like wrestling matches, consuming drugs and alcohol “to get you lit,” camping out and partying until the sun comes up, stopping only when you’re “f-cking throwing up.” As a consequence, Travis Scott concerts are unbelievably energetic and lively. They are also, however, extremely physical and sometimes dangerous. But that’s exactly how Scott wants them. Perhaps most damning is a two-liner from his 2018 track “Stargazing,” where Scott brags, “And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries / I got 'em stage diving' out the nosebleeds.”
Even more importantly, Scott has had several incidents specifically related to crowd surges in the past.
In 2015, at Lollapalooza, Scott instructed fans to jump over the barricades and storm the stage, causing a stampede. He was arrested and charged for disorderly conduct.
Then, in 2017, Scott again instructed fans to rush the stage, causing a crowd wave that injured several people. He was arrested this time too, getting hit with charges of inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, and endangering the welfare of a minor.
Now, in 2021, a similar stampede was formed, except this time it turned deadly. And while the impetus for the crowd surge has not yet been identified, Scott has demonstrated with considerable historical precedent that this is an essential part of the environment he promotes.
Scott, to his credit, has improved since these previous incidents. At this most recent Astroworld, he reportedly paused the concert three or four times for safety reasons, breaks which all lasted at least several seconds. But it clearly wasn’t enough. Let’s compare that reaction to some of Scott’s contemporaries.
At Rolling Loud in 2019, ASAP Rocky faced a similarly moshing audience. But when the crowd started surging and fans started falling down, Rocky stopped the show and commanded the audience to help people get back onto their feet.
Logic, at a Houston concert in 2017, saw fans having a seizure, so he parted the crowd like the Red Sea in order to create a path for paramedics. Afterwards, he reminded the audience about the importance of their safety.
Even Lil Pump, of all rappers, at just eighteen years of age, displayed more maturity in a crisis situation than thirty-year-old Scott. At Wireless Festival in 2018, Pump stopped the concert and called out impassionedly for paramedics upon noticing a fan having a seizure. After checking in on the fan and ensuring their condition was stable, Pump pleaded with his audience to drink water for their safety.
Travis Scott, on the other hand, clearly still has work to do. In cultivating this rowdy, uncontrollable, and frankly feral environment, Scott deserves at least some of the responsibility for failing to maintain a degree of audience safety. It’s rare that another rapper or artist has managed to consistently engender violent stampeding; they’re usually the ones that stop such surges from materializing.
The Astroworld Festival this year had several things wrong with it aside from its headlining act. But it is unquestionable that Travis Scott needs to become more aware of his audiences and make a real effort towards promoting a safer and less violent setting at concerts.

Christina Todesco’s set for “The Sound Inside” consists of a near-empty platform adorned with only two black chairs and a small dining table. The simple space plays host to 90 minutes of painstakingly intimate and powerful theater. Written by prolific playwright Adam Rapp, the play premiered in 2018 at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and opened at New York’s Studio 54 a year later. After a successful three-month run there, the production earned six Tony Award nominations and one win, which Mary-Louise Parker scored for best actress in a play. This fall, the play came to the Boston Center for the Arts thanks to a Speakeasy stage production helmed by director and Elliot Norton award recipient Bryn Boice.
The play follows the formation of a relationship between Yale creative arts professor Bella Baird, portrayed by Jennifer Rohn, and Yale freshman Christopher Dunn, portrayed by Nathan Malin. The pair play off of the space well; the two doorways add to the dynamics of the stage and allude vaguely to the outside world beyond the doors, while the reflective black backdrops reinforce the isolating nature of the show.
The bare-bones set and absence of other actors or special effects, aside from some stunning lighting by Devorah Kengmana, allow the audience to focus entirely on the two characters. As a consequence, Rohn and Malin must connect with their audience in order to engage them in the production. It is up to them to transform the stage from a professor’s office into a restaurant or living room with nothing but the positionality of the set pieces and the actors’ demeanor.
Rohn’s Bella is a recluse who at times can verge on pretentious in her poetic monologues, while Malin’s Christopher is impulsive, rude, and appears to lack any social awareness. However, Rohn and Malin play off of each other beautifully. It’s a testament to their skill as performers that they’re able to invite their audience to care about two characters that should otherwise be insufferable. Both characters’ propensities for creative writing provide an occasion for the script’s vivid and enrapturing language.
The combination of the actors’ own chemistry and Rapp’s skillful dialogue creates a deeply touching and devastating story, punctuated by moments of humor and at times extreme discomfort. The shocking end of the show feels earned, and the fallout is appropriately gut-wrenching. The show reminds its audience how powerful some of the relationships formed on a college campus are, and yet how isolating those elite spheres can be, a sentiment especially resonant with college students following the pandemic.

You can never know just what to expect from an improv show — after all, each show from the same cast will, by definition, be unique, shaped by the audience and the mood of that night. As an audience member, one just hopes for a good dose of laughter. But based on their performance on Nov. 18, ImprovBoston, performing on Thursday nights out of the Rockwell Theater in Davis Square, delivers a high-energy evening that manages to wring at least a few laughs from each audience member, even though the show does not quite manage to pack a punch the whole way through.
ImprovBoston’s cast of six hits the ground running with a quick introduction to the concept of improv comedy before soliciting audience suggestions and diving into a mixture of short- and long-form improv. Alongside the performers on stage are a keyboardist providing musical accompaniment and a technical team for sound and lighting who must adapt on the fly to shape the trajectory of the performance. The cast members deftly incorporate audience suggestions and clearly have good chemistry, diving into scenes about Chuck-E-Cheese locations in volcanoes and schemes to flush cats down toilets. The zany situational humor may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but the constant momentum means there are enough styles of jokes to cover all the bases.
The cast is at its best when it leans into the musical element of the show. For starters, the keyboard player’s nonstop accompaniment during the two-hour show is a highlight, both adapting to the shifting tones of each scene and guiding the narrative shifts. Occasionally, cast members also burst into full musical numbers, coming up with lyrics to match the keyboard melody. Even in the comedic context, all the performers are strong vocalists, and certain songs — like a full musical number about cats in the sewer system — could have believably been written and practiced in advance.
On the other hand, the technical components are one of the weaker components of the experience. There seemed to be several hiccups with the lighting, and though they did not impede the overall experience significantly, they undercut the production’s professionalism.
Still, the cast provides polish where the technicians fall short. The performers’ skill comes through with the development of comedic ideas and callbacks over the course of the show. One of the most exciting parts of an improv show is when a joke surprises the audience with an interesting take on a previous scene, and the ImprovBoston cast crafts several of those moments by carrying multiple themes from the beginning to the end of the show. This particularly made the latter half of the performance memorable, but after two hours even the best jokes get old. The show gets less snappy as certain scenes drag on longer than they should have. The format does not include enough new structures or twists to keep the audience engaged the entire time. But the production ends on a strong note with a final game relying heavily on audience suggestions, suggesting that perhaps more games and structure could help keep things moving.
ImprovBoston may not be a groundbreaking comedic revelation, but the personable and talented cast can nevertheless provide something fresh to boost energy and laughter on a Thursday evening.

“Initiation— In Love Solidarity,” the newest work from Harvard Dance Center’s Fall 2021 Artist-in-Residence Nailah Randall-Bellinger, concluded its series of live performances and film screenings on Nov. 13 in front of a packed audience at the Harvard Dance Center. Both the short dance film and its live performance component explored the topics of the Middle Passage and the African diaspora, with a specific focus on African women. Throughout the live performance, which took place on a stage featuring nothing but three black benches, several female dancers moved as though they were in extreme pain, with some even choosing to scream. This dancing was occasionally accompanied by spoken-word journal entries composed by the dancers themselves over the six-month course of the show’s creation.
However, despite the depiction of pain, this work’s main focus was not grief. Instead, it chose to emphasize a much more hopeful dimension of the African diaspora in a modern context: reclamation.
When asked to provide her own description of the work’s purpose, Randall Bellinger said in an interview with the Crimson: it was “reidentifying who we are on our own terms.”
Indeed, this theme of the African diaspora taking back their power infused every part of the work, from the setting to the props. The film, for instance, was shot at various locations throughout New England with historical connections to the transatlantic slave trade and emancipation, such as Ogunquit Beach in Maine, where slave ships docked in the eighteenth century. By placing dancers in settings that once perpetuated the systematic oppression and enslavement of African people, Randall-Bellinger emphasized her liberating message of reclamation.
The most prominent recurring symbol in both the live performance and film were the small white cowrie shells that the dancers took from a basin and spread about their arms, as if washing themselves with water. In the discussion portion following the dance, Randall-Bellinger — wearing cowrie shell earrings herself — explained that these shells were used as a type of currency to purchase enslaved people.
“The cowrie shell became a focal point to ‘this is how we were sold into slavery,’ but at the same time, reclaiming it.”
Cinematographer Christina Belinsky was also present at the post-dance discussion[ was the cinematographer for the film portion of the work. Belinsky responded to several questions about the practical difficulties related to shooting the film in natural locations such as the Maine beach, as well as more technical questions about the use of the film’s many unique editing tactics.
“The wonderful honor of being the cinematographer was bringing Nailah’s vision to life in a way that feels visceral and immersive,” Belinsky said. “In a way that feels like you are not just a spectator of the piece but you are actually a part of the piece.”
When asked about the most impactful part of the piece, Tarikh Campbell, an attendee and hip-hop instructor at the Harvard Dance Center, said, “For me, it was just the realization of how much of the piece, both visually in terms of cinematography, choices down to details, and accessories and such just all connected.”
While this was the last scheduled showing of “Initiation— In Love Solidarity,” the piece and its message of reclamation clearly had a wide-reaching impact on both its creators and audiences alike.
As audience member Gail Grove said, “When they spoke about the sea spirits and they danced in the water and on the beach, that was very emotional for me.”

Back when he was 19 years of age, Julius Jones — now 41 years old — was accused of first-degree murder, and later sentenced to death. After 22 years, Jones has continued to maintain his innocence, and amid a myriad of other injustices, his alibi was never properly considered in his trial. Against this backdrop, Jones’s 2002 sentence was followed by years of protest and emphatic calls to prevent his execution — but it was only this past month that these calls were finally heard: On Thursday, Nov. 18, Governor J. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma commuted Jones’s death sentence to life imprisonment.
Just hours before Jones’s scheduled execution at 4 p.m., Gov. Stitt gave word of this decision. In its wake, Jones’s supporters at the Oklahoma Capitol erupted into joy, having reached the apex of an uphill, extended battle for Jones’ life.
This fight extended for far longer than it should have, leaving iterations of emotional strain and exhaustion in its wake. Even still, it could have been so much worse: Julius Jones could have died on that fateful day — but today, he’s alive. And for that, we’re grateful.
Vitally, at the heart of Gov. Stitt’s decision to commute Jones’s death was an impressively loud chorus of student activism. The week of Jones’s scheduled execution, students across Oklahoma City, with the support of Oklahoma City Public Schools, led statewide walk-outs, urging Gov. Stitt to halt the execution.
These bold strokes of student involvement came at the close of an arduous campaign — joined by conservatives, celebrities, and Christian leaders alike — garnering support for Jones’s cause. The likes of Kim Kardashian West and NBA superstar Russell Westbrook, alongside the American Conservative Union’s chairman, Matt Schlapp, and the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s executive director, Timothy Head, all campaigned on Jones’s behalf. This diverse mosaic of characters — further charged by the energy of young students — is a remarkable demonstration of unlikely allies coalescing in pursuit of a common cause. Inevitably, this union should beckon all of us to consider how we might build coalitions across political and personal differences as we work towards such worthwhile goals.
The central role of students in the final days of this fight is also remarkably telling. When it comes to protests, our nation’s youth always seem to find a way to get involved, and — with the compassion and conviction they exhibit — to unfailingly make waves upon doing so. Recent history serves as a powerful reminder of this reality: After the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., students from Stoneman Douglas High School led protests for gun control. Ultimately, their energies rippled throughout the nation and were propagated by student allies across the United States. This dynamic, with youthful energy fueling societal change, follows a much deeper history — one that extends not only across time periods, but also across borders: In South Africa, public school students in Soweto, South Africa, valiantly protested apartheid. In Iran, more than 10,000 students protested a police raid at the University of Tehran. More recently, students have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement through their protests across the United States and in cities around the world. Here at Harvard, hundreds of fossil fuel divestment protesters stormed the field at Harvard-Yale Game back in 2019, continuing a long trend of Harvard student activism on campus.
The high school students who took charge in Oklahoma just a few weeks ago deserve to be celebrated amid this legion of heroes. Without them, Julius Jones may have died.
We want to live in a world where the burden of our political madness and darkest social problems does not have to lie on the shoulders of teenage activists who should be able to enjoy a more carefree adolescence; yet in absence of our own action and that of our government, we applaud their much-needed efforts. It’s time that all of us learn from these high schoolers and pick up the mantle ourselves.
If we are to be successful in the pursuit of this goal, we must build bridges across the cultural, political, and racial gaps that so easily divide us — just like those who joined the campaign for the commuting of Mr. Jones’s sentence. If we want change in today’s polarized political climate, we must cast away our differences. We must build coalitions with those whom we don’t always see eye-to-eye with; and work to see each other as allies. From there, we must be willing, eager, and able to unite.

After spending much of the Covid year reading memoirs, I pitched this column with the simple thought that we could all, someday, be inspired to write memoirs of our own. You don’t have to be famous, renowned or anything like that. You don’t have to be a writer, or even think of yourself as someone who is crafty with words. I believe people should write more about themselves. Everyone has their own story, but too many of them go unwritten, unappreciated, unsavored.
Starting in September, together we’ve explored quite a few memoirs through this column, and I’ve tried my best to give my personal spin on what each of them has meant to me.
We talked about chess and how it can teach us to find the new in the old. I shared my perspective on what mentorship means to me, and how mentors can be found all around us. Through the simple metaphor of running, we saw how our lives are full of unexpected intersections and combinations that are truly invaluable. We examined the fascinating relationship between teaching and learning, and how through both, the unusual can become the usual. We learned about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia’s unlikely friendship, and the strength of finding our voice and our words. And, most recently, I reminisced fondly on some of my earliest musical memories and realized how vital such formative moments are in making us who we become.
It’s hard to believe, but we’ve reached that final stage of the fall semester. The post-Harvard-Yale Game (Go Crimson!), post-Thanksgiving part where final projects, papers, and exams pile on relentlessly and without respite until, all of a sudden, it’s winter break. Maybe more than a few performances for student groups and house formals are marking up your calendar as well this time of year.
So, fittingly, this column also meets its denouement.
There’s one more message that I think runs through all the (perhaps seemingly independent) ideas we’ve talked about together. And that is to savor the moment we are in. Was it John Lennon who once sang, “Life is what happens to you when you’re busy making other plans?”
Life happens when, from a game of chess, we make a new friend, or renew an old friendship. Life happens when, one day, you meet someone who shares a part of their story with you, and they become an irreplaceable mentor. Life happens when you stumble across an unexpected intersection or fusion of ideas, and it brings out entirely new meaning by creating something that is greater than the sum of its parts. I think you can see where I’m going with this.
Life happens at Harvard, when we, in the middle of the juggling act of academics, social and extracurricular life, find a way to savor the opportunities and blessings we have.
I’m in my senior year, and I am forced to think — nay worry — more and more about what lies ahead, what I will do, where and who I will be, after graduation. I’m sure my fellow seniors feel the same. But aren’t we all going through a transition of some kind constantly? Time ensures that we are constantly experiencing the end of one thing, just to give way to the beginning of the next. Our minds are perennially occupied by preparing for this next thing — planning, rehearsing, practicing. It can be challenging to fight this urge, but life happens when we can be fully present to our current time, place, and circumstance.
We often hear of the prudence of planning ahead. We also learn of the virtues of looking back, of learning from the past. Savoring the moment is the thing right in between those two. It happens in the millisecond, blink-of-an-eye moments that we’re all living and experiencing all the time, yet that can pass us by so easily. It’s not about the future, or the past, but the present.
I really hope we can savor our present. It will only make our memories crisper when we, one day, sit down to write them.

UPDATED: November 30, 2021 at 10:15 p.m.
A Note from the Editorial Board: The following piece includes discussion of severe mental health struggles and suicide. We’ve compiled a few resources that might be useful to any readers in need of help or support. Please make sure to take care of yourselves — seeking help is always worthwhile.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a certified listener, call 1-800-273-8255.
If you are enrolled, Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services offers no-cost support, including Urgent Care appointments at (617) 495-2042.
For international students, here’s a list of some internationally available support hotlines that might be helpful.
A laptop, a notebook, a couple of pens, a water bottle. The contents of our backpacks are probably quite similar for the most part. But we each carry very different things, too. These are the things no one can see. Maybe they’re hidden between the pages of a textbook, or wrapped around a pencil. They’re our stories and memories, expectations and regrets. We carry worries and doubts and things we can’t take out, even if we wanted to. The things that aren’t things occupy the most space. But zipped up tightly behind us, no one might ever know what’s really inside.
Last month in Harvard Yard, 1,000 backpacks covered the grass, symbolizing the average annual number of college students lost to suicide. With an accompanying image and written memorial of its former owner, each backpack, now empty, told the story of the young life that was. As a part of the mental health organization Active Minds’ initiative “Send Silence Packing,” the display was a thought-provoking monument to the loads that became too heavy.
“To end the silence that surrounds mental health and suicide” was the objective of the display — a valiant goal in itself. But on our campus, it proved to be a brief — almost imperceptible — pause in silence rather than an end to it. We breezed past each backpack, each story, and each life quickly. As a community, we didn’t stop to acknowledge their gravity. Even if my sample size was small, I never heard so much as a conversation about it in the dining hall. And less than a month out, the Yard long cleared of the backpacks, it’s as if nothing ever happened. Our collective reaction was disturbing because we barely reacted.
This gesture of solidarity was initially promising on the College’s part. Harvard’s treatment of suicide on campus has been historically problematic due to a lack of transparency. Underreported suicide rates and a lawsuit in which Harvard was ordered to disclose data on the matter have fostered the lurking sense that something is very much amiss. Inadequate transparency is not only deeply unsettling, but it also deters students from seeking help in the competitive environment in which aversion to seeking any help is already so strong. With this most recent display proving to be one of performativity rather than progress, the ensuing lack of dialogue exposed an alarming lack of compassion, and this kind of neglect poses a serious threat.
Especially post-pandemic, our campus is facing distress. This summer, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services introduced a 24/7 support line, and this fall, the number of calls has been overwhelming. This fact alone clearly indicates that our campus is in a precarious position.
In part, this is because our mental health services are notoriously inaccessible. Whether that’s due to its being understaffed or overbooked, students have reported waiting weeks to months for an appointment. We can’t afford to let those who are reaching for help wait. Inaccessibility only perpetuates the destructive, subconscious narrative that we shouldn’t need or can’t get help at all.
The other component of this crisis, which is perhaps even more troubling than a lack of resources, is that no matter how much we promote seeking help or talk about the importance of mental health, we never really address it. As a community, we are committed to countless other worthy causes from the graduate student union to fossil fuel divestment. Why, then, when we’re faced with the fragility of each other's lives, can we only spare less than 24 hours? How, with a clear conscience, do we slap a bandaid over pain?
Ultimately, the College’s lack of dialogue points to a more troubling systemic behavior: tunnel vision. We emulate the example the College sets. If it trivializes mental health (even if, and especially if, it says it’s not doing so), we will, too. On campus, we learn quickly and in unspoken terms that the more emotionally detached we become, the more we can get done. The less will get in our way. If we can turn a blind eye to each other’s problems, to our own struggles — if we can even become numb to the loss of life, apparently — very little is left to hold us back. The unceasing success machine that is Harvard will keep on cranking.
I don’t expect the College to end our struggles with mental health altogether. What I ask of it, though, as well as of our community, is very simply to show that we all actually care. That we care that every one of us is carrying things we cannot see. We will, of course, continue guarding our bags, keeping them close to us, and zipping them up tight. But what we really need to know is that when they get a little too heavy, we’ll have a place to safely set them down — at least until we’re feeling strong enough again to pick them back up.

Derrick L. Neal, a Texas health administrator with more than 30 years of experience in public health, has been selected as Cambridge’s new chief public health officer, the city announced last week.
As chief public health officer, Neal will oversee the Cambridge City Public Health Department, a nationally accredited department with the goal of promoting the health of Cambridge residents through “services, information, policies, and regulations,” per the department’s website.
“As the department helps the city recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Neal will work to improve operations and processes,” the Cambridge Public Health Department wrote in a Nov. 22 press release. “He will also expand the department's important work addressing the issues of inclusion and health equity, as well as the social determinants of health in the community.”
Before coming to Cambridge, Neal worked in public health and municipal government in Texas. He holds a master’s degree from the University of Illinois, Springfield, and most recently served as the executive director of the Williamson County and Cities Health District in Round Rock, Texas.
Before that, Neal worked as the director of the Victoria County Public Health Department, the director of the Abilene-Taylor County Public Health District, an administration and special projects manager in the Houston Public Works and Engineering Department, and the administrative supervisor for Houston’s Health and Human Services Department.
Neal is “extremely accomplished and enthusiastic,” Assaad J. Sayah, the Cambridge commissioner of public health, said in the press release.
“Throughout his career, Mr. Neal has demonstrated exceptional leadership ability, community engagement and collaboration, and competency managing local, state, and federal public health services and mandates in large public health departments,” he added.
Neal will fill the position left vacant by Claude A. Jacob, who left Cambridge to head the public health department in San Antonio. Jacob, who held the position since 2007, largely oversaw the city’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, dealing with challenges such as vaccine shortages and outlining the city’s reopening schedule. 
Last Monday, the City Council unanimously welcomed Neal to his new position in the Cambridge Public Health Department in a resolution sponsored by Councilor E. Denise Simmons.
Neal was selected for the role in Cambridge after a nationwide search, according to the resolution.
In the resolution, the council wished Neal “great success in this new role” that he will officially begin next week.
“I look forward to having Mr. Neal as a key member of the City’s team,” Cambridge City Manager Louise A. DePasquale said in the press release. “I am confident that under his leadership, our nationally accredited public health department will continue to excel and meet the evolving public health needs of our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A committee within Harvard’s Office of Undergraduate Education is developing a proposal to introduce double concentrations at the College, which it hopes to submit to a faculty vote in spring 2022.
The office established a subcommittee in September to develop the proposal. Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh heads the subcommittee, which is part of the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy.
Currently, undergraduates may only pursue joint concentrations, in which students pursue work in two departments and write a thesis that integrates the methods of the two fields. In 2019, the educational policy committee formed a separate subcommittee to study joint concentrations in response to “concerns” from students and faculty about the current system.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, incoming president of the Undergraduate Council, said he believes allowing double concentrations will encourage more students to pursue varied academic interests.
Cheng, who is a joint concentrator in History and Mathematics, said the Mathematics department does not require him to write a thesis, which allowed him the flexibility “to explore two fields [he finds] interesting.” The History department requires concentrators to complete a thesis to be eligible for departmental honors.
“It attracts people who might otherwise not major in math but could benefit from practical grounding,” he said. “I would not have pursued a joint concentration if I had to write a joint thesis.”
Katherine E. Powers, associate director of undergraduate studies in Psychology, wrote in an email that the possibility of double concentrations without a combined thesis would be “very appealing to students.”
“One of the reasons that Psychology doesn't participate in joint concentrations is because of the difficulty that writing a joint thesis can pose for students,” Powers wrote. “A framework that allows students to explore their academic interests in depth while accounting for some of the challenges associated with joint concentrations seems very reasonable to consider."
Boaz Barak, co-director of undergraduate studies in Computer Science, wrote that though he is waiting to learn the details of the proposal, the Computer Science department overall “support[s] offering students more options” by removing the joint thesis requirement.
“We have seen many beautiful theses that combine computer science with a host of other concentrations, including the humanities,” Barak wrote. “But it's always best if students write a thesis because they are intellectually motivated to do so, rather than because they need to satisfy some requirement.”
Karin I. Oberg, director of undergraduate studies in Astronomy, said most Astronomy concentrators also pursue a joint concentration but in “nearby science areas such as physics and [Earth and Planetary Sciences]” due to the thesis requirement.
“I imagine that by allowing the option of dual concentrations we would see a more diverse set of concentration pairings,” Oberg wrote. “This to me seems completely in line with Harvard’s mission to provide a broad liberal arts education.”
Derek Miller, associate director of undergraduate studies in the English department, said while he is open to double concentrations, some faculty have previously raised concerns on the issue.
“We're all wary of the effects of the rising baseline of expectations and the pressure that puts on students,” Miller said. “We don't want an institution where everyone thinks that the default is that you do two concentrations.”
“That would be a bad outcome emotionally for our students and intellectually for them, and for concentrations, who had students sort of slogging through a second thing because they felt they had to,” he added.
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed that the subcommittee is working to establish a proposal for double concentrations.
“This issue is deeply important to both our students and faculty, and as such the [Educational Policy Committee] is engaged,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 2, 2021 at 2:20 p.m.
William F. Lee ’72, who holds the top post on the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — is set to leave the board in June after 12 years.
Lee, who ascended to become the Corporation’s senior fellow in 2014, will be the second head of the body to depart due to its 12-year term limit — a reform announced shortly after he joined the group as a general member in 2010. His predecessor, Robert D. Reischauer ’63, agreed to step down at 12 years after those reforms were implemented during his tenure.
Lee, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, said in an interview Monday that the process to pick his successor is ongoing.
“I’ll be participating in the process, but it needs to be a recommendation that comes from a broader group of folks than just me,” Lee said.
He said the selection process will include other Corporation members and University leaders. The Corporation itself will ultimately vote on its new senior fellow, a move Lee expects to occur before he departs.
Senior fellow is the top position on the Corporation — a 12-member body formally known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College that holds fiduciary responsibility over the University’s finances and operations.
The body instituted a sweeping set of governance reforms in 2010 that grew its membership from six to 12 and established six-year terms and a two-term limit. Lee said Tuesday he was a proponent of the reforms and plans to follow the rules they set.
“To have been one of the people to help implement the governance reforms and to have the governance reforms include term limits, I think it would be a little awkward for me to stay beyond the end of my term limit,” he said.
The reforms also changed the post of senior fellow into an elected position. Previously, the member of the body with the longest tenure was recognized as the senior fellow. Lee, who was the first person elected to head the Corporation, is now its longest-serving member.
Lee said Monday the next senior fellow could come from inside or outside the Corporation’s ranks — “like the Supreme Court.”
“After the governance reforms were implemented — and term-limits were implemented — there has been sort of a constant refreshing of the Corporation over the period of the last decade, with some people going off, some new people coming on,” he said. “Because we had that process, we are constantly in the process of reviewing potential candidates for the Corporation.”
Looking to next semester, Lee said the Corporation’s top priority will be to continue the University’s safe transition back to in-person operations.
“The most important short term responsibility is the public health and safety of the University community,” he said. “In some sense, the Corporation’s job is to ensure that the University has great students, great faculty, and provide a sound financial and physical platform for all of you to do the great work you do."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Selimzhan Chalyshkan ’23 thinks about his childhood friend Aknazar “Adam” Kazhymurat ’23, he recalls the memories they made together attending Science Olympiad competitions years before arriving at Harvard.
“He was passionate about everything he was talking about back then,” Chalyshkan said. “Every time someone would go to the Olympiad, we’d cheer for each other.”
​​Chalyshkan remembered Kazhymurat as a constant in his life. They attended the same middle and high schools in their home country of Kazakhstan before arriving together at Harvard for their first semester of college — on the same flight. ​​Chalyshkan also said he fondly looks back on their pre-college experiences, which were marked by encouragement rather than competition.
“That was a very important time period in my life,” Chalyshkan said. “Knowing that I have Aknazar, who believed in me and my abilities and supported me.”
Kazhymurat died earlier this month while on leave from Harvard in Kazakhstan. Friends and mentors of Kazhymurat remembered him as a brilliant and kindhearted individual with a passion for his studies.
Before arriving at Harvard, Kazhymurat graduated from the Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Physics and Mathematics in Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan and Kazhymurat’s hometown. The president of Kazakhstan congratulated Kazhymurat on his acceptance to Harvard, according to a 2018 article on the school’s website. Kazhymurat said at the time that he planned to practice science in Kazakhstan after college.
Chalyshkan described Kazhymurat as “very, very kind” and “really hardworking.”
“Everyone thought that he was genius and stuff, but he would always say that he’s not — that it’s a result of hard work,” Chalyshkan said.
But even when Kazhymurat faced pressing deadlines at Harvard, Chalyshkan said he would always take time to talk to his friends.
“I would go to his dorm room and we’d start talking, even though both of us have something due tonight or the next day,” Chalyshkan said. “We’d continue talking until like midnight.”
“He knew so much stuff,” he added. “He could talk about just anything, and that was always so cool.”
Rachel Murray-Crawford, Kazhymurat’s freshman-year proctor, wrote in an email that Kazhymurat was an exceptionally kind and generous person.
“Aknazar was so kind to every single person in our entryway,” she wrote. “He stopped by nearly every study break to say hi. Even if he couldn’t stay too long, he always made an effort to show-up with a wave and smile.”
“I think it’s worth highlighting that Aknazar was the type of person to loan their shirt for somebody else, even if he didn’t have another for himself,” she added.
Murray-Crawford also wrote that she remembers Kazhymurat’s love for his family.
“He spoke so highly of his father and brother. When everybody was asked to leave campus due to COVID 19, I had a check-in with Aknazar,” she wrote. “While he was sad to leave Harvard, he told me he was most excited to go hug his brother and that embracing him was a moment he had longed for throughout the semester.”
Others who knew Kazhymurat said they remember his intellectual prowess and deep love of learning.
Claudia Quevedo-Webb, who taught Kazhymurat’s Spanish 15: “Intensive Beginning Spanish: Special Course” section during his freshman year, described him as “very curious.”
“He was one of those students who is actually really interested in what he’s studying and he wants to ask a lot of questions and always keeps you on your feet,” she said. “Whether it was a question of teaching some grammar or culture, he was always really interested in knowing the ins and outs of it.”
David R. “Dave” De Remer ’03, who conducted Kazhymurat’s admissions interview for Harvard, said Kazhymurat was “brilliant, warm, and witty.”
“What stands out to me about Aknazar is the kind of pure joy and love he had for mathematics and academic study,” he said. “He also really, really loved to share this with his classmates as well, so you see this in how he organized math circles at his own high school and also created this infrastructure to help further students study beyond their own school curriculums.”
De Remer said Kazhymurat had a “sincere desire to give back” and expand access to higher education in Kazakhstan.
“We’ve lost this opportunity to see how he would have grown,” he said. “He’s already surely left a legacy in terms of showing other students in this area what's possible.”
Kazhymurat spent the summer before his senior year of high school conducting research at MIT.
MIT professor Paul Seidel, his faculty supervisor, wrote in an emailed statement that he was impressed by Kazhymurat’s diverse knowledge of mathematics.
“When I first met Aknazar, I was immediately struck by how up-to-date he was on [current] developments in geometry and mathematical physics,” he wrote. “Mathematics has a tradition of talent developing very early, but Aknazar stood out by the fact that his interests spanned several subjects.”
Kazhymurat’s project report “reads entirely like a product of a fully trained mathematician, including in the broad range of literature that is used,” Seidel added.
Seidel also wrote that Kazhymurat skillfully navigated his position as both a high school student and scientist.
“Aknazar looked to be very comfortable with his role of being still a high school student and yet already a member of the scientific community,” he wrote. “I was looking forward to meeting him at conferences for decades to come, and seeing which of many directions of research he would ultimately choose to pursue.”
“It is deeply sad that this must now remain in the realm of the imagination,” Seidel added.
​​Chalyshkan said he will miss his friend’s presence in his life.
“Every time, I would think that, ‘Oh, well, there’s some other [time together] awaiting us in the future. Something will just happen and then we will end up doing that thing together again,’” he said. “Knowing that he’s not around, it’s so weird and I still haven’t processed that.”

In March 2020, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine went fully remote; all students were sent home, and the Harvard Dental Clinic — where students typically hone their skills working with patients — was shut down except for emergency care.
“We went from a full clinic and then to a hard stop: 100 miles per hour to zero,” said German O. Gallucci, chair of the restorative dentistry and biomaterials sciences department.
With the shutdown, third- and fourth-year dental students — whose curriculum is based on clinical practice and experience — were cut off from seeing patients. While fourth-year students had completed most of their requirements, third-year students in the Class of 2021 faced the challenge of meeting their graduation and competency standards despite reduced clinical availability, according to Sang E. Park, HSDM’s associate dean for dental education.
“I have to say that it was the most challenging class — the Class of 2021 — that I had to be graduating on time in my 20 years of being dental faculty,” Park said.
Despite this, every member of the Class of 2021 graduated on time or early, a feat the school’s dean, William V. Giannobile, credits to faculty members going above and beyond to help students complete their requirements.
“What the faculty did is they ‘sacrificed’ their faculty practice time to open up the clinics to the students,” he said in an October interview. “And then they worked three nights per week, and also on Saturdays, to provide that education.”
Members of the Class of 2021 said in interviews they were initially worried about the sudden discontinuation of their clinical education, but impressed with how the school responded — first, by adapting its curriculum to online for the first few months of the pandemic, and later gradually returning students to clinical practice in person.
“I’m so glad I went to a school like Harvard where, honestly, they cared so much about helping us graduate,” said Ashiana Jivraj, a 2021 HSDM graduate who was a third-year student when she was sent home.
Russell H. Taylor, a lecturer in restorative dentistry and biomaterials sciences, acknowledged that providing remote instruction in a particularly hands-on field such as dentistry was challenging.
“There’s a lot of skills that you need to practice and you need to do under supervision when you’re starting out, because it is a very hands-on and a very visual profession, too,” he said. “There’s a lot of tactile, visual things that you can’t just assign a reading for, necessarily.”
Designing a virtual curriculum that made the best use of students’ and faculty members’ time, while ensuring that students could meet dental competency standards during the shutdown, was “like solving a big puzzle,” according to Park.
“It has offered an opportunity for us to be innovative — ranging from digital learning, reorganization of content delivery, and restructur[ing] of the curricular timeline,” she said.
For the first time, the school introduced teledentistry, in which students helped screen patients, triage, and provide them dental advice virtually, according to Park.
Patient case presentations including grand rounds — in which complex cases are presented to a large audience of dentists and students — and case review seminars also took place virtually, she added.
“Even though they weren’t direct, hands-on clinical experiences for the students, we were trying to really maximize the time that we had to learn remotely,” Park said.
“It cannot replace direct patient care, but it can complement the way that we provide patient care,” she added.
Neil T. Griseto, an instructor in restorative dentistry and biomaterials sciences, said the pandemic allowed the Dental School to re-examine its curriculum and reintroduce prior teaching techniques.
“We used older teaching methods — classical teaching methods for hand skills like waxing — and we reintroduced that in the curriculum,” he said.
Faculty sent instruments to students at home and asked students to record themselves using them. Faculty then assessed students’ performance through self-evaluation and photos, Griseto said.
“Those are the things that I think really benefited me and my education, but maybe that we hadn’t been teaching for some time,” he added. “They had fallen out of favor as methods for teaching.”
Park also noted that the emergent situation brought on by the pandemic allowed for efficient review and revision of the school’s curriculum that would normally have taken a longer time to enact.
“It has offered a chance for us to review the curriculum and the program comprehensively in a very short amount of time,” she said.
Some faculty provided additional research opportunities and study groups to further supplement students’ remote learning experience.
Hiroe B. Ohyama, a professor of restorative dentistry and biomaterials sciences, said she recruited students to conduct research with her during the shutdown and helped them publish their work.
Through the HSDM Aesthetics Society — a co-curricular organization — Taylor said he worked with students to create roughly 20 virtual lectures on topics ranging from basic dental fillings to the proper use of dental equipment.
When Kasey D. Ha, a 2021 HSDM graduate, returned to the Dental School in July 2020, she said she was afraid to go back into the clinic, given that nobody had been vaccinated, and she would have to do procedures up close on unmasked patients.
“It was really scary at first, I’ll be honest, to go back to clinic,” she said. “The patient is sitting right in front of you without a mask on and you’re just immersed in that for a few hours, so it was really scary.”
Taylor said the initial return was “very stressful” for faculty as well.
“Early on, there was a New York Times article talking about how dentistry and hygiene was the most at-risk of all professions because essentially we sit there aerosolized in a patient’s mouth,” he said. “People were really on edge. We had really strict PPE protocol. We were being tested very frequently.”
The school provided students with embroidered face shields, gowns, and eye protection, and made sure they were sterilizing their N-95s after each use, Ha said.
Griseto noted that the school had been stockpiling N-95 masks starting in February 2020, anticipating the pandemic would ramp up and personal protective equipment would run out.
“Because we’re small, we had enough PPE to keep the place going,” he said.
The school also changed all the filters in the building and implemented additional equipment like vacuums and aerosol scavenging devices, according to Griseto.
“When I look back on it now, there were some things that we did that probably weren’t necessary,” he said. “But the measures that we took were ultimately very successful, because we didn’t have any transmissions. As far as I’m aware, we still don’t have any documented transmission of Covid-19 in the building.”
In accordance with the public health guidelines, the Dental Clinic also operated at 50 percent capacity through May 2021.
Ha said this helped protect patients — in normal times, patients are only separated by a four- to five-foot wall — but also forced students to prioritize the limited time they had to practice in the clinic.
“Even though we weren’t in clinic as often, I think it made each clinic experience more important to us,” she said. “Because we knew that we were so limited in time, it made us very efficient with everything that we were doing.”
Ohyama, the professor, said she also noticed students were more focused in clinic because they knew they had reduced time to practice.
“They were very focused. I think the mindset was different from the students’ side and from the faculty also — this is the only time we have to teach, and the other way, like a student[’s perspective], this was the only time I can come and practice,” she said.
Despite the abrupt changes to HSDM’s curriculum and clinical experiences, every student in the predoctoral and the advanced graduate programs in the Classes of 2020 and 2021 graduated on time, according to Park.
“Not only that, for the DMD program — that’s our predoctoral program — we’ve had a 100 percent pass rate — first time pass rate — for the National Board Dental Examination,” Park added.
Students and faculty alike credited the individualized mentorship and collaboration promoted within the Dental School during the pandemic for ensuring students’ continuity of education.
Jivraj, one of the 2021 HSDM graduates, said faculty — especially full-time professors — “just truly stood up” in providing support and guidance “day and night.”
“There was a professor who I remember had put down his daughter to go to bed, and he got on the phone,” Jivraj said. “He was sitting on his porch so that he wouldn’t wake up his kid, just so that we could talk about cases, but also how we were going to meet all of our prosthodontic requirements and how he was going to help the fourth- and third-years graduates.”
Aram Kim, a professor of restorative dentistry and biomaterials sciences, said she and other faculty members were constantly available to provide students with both academic and emotional support on an individual basis.
“This was a very stressful time, and with a lot of meetings being virtual and a lot of content being virtual, there was a lot of loss of human connection,” Kim said. “We have a weekly check-in with the students to listen to their needs, and what they have to say, how we can get through this together, how we can help them maximize our situation, how we can better help them get ready for the next step.”
“I absolutely commend all of our students for their passion and resilience, because I cannot imagine myself getting through dental school during a pandemic,” she added.
The pandemic also strengthened relations and teamwork within the student body, Ha said. She noted that students in the school — which is Harvard’s smallest — are already tight-knit, but the pandemic brought them together in a shared struggle toward graduating.
“Given the difficult Covid situation and limited capacity, because we’re such a tight cohort, everyone was willing to help each other out,” Ha said. “People are willing to share materials, lab time, clinic time — I think it was really important for us to have such a tight cohort in order to all help each other graduate.”
Daniel M. Roistacher, a 2021 HSDM graduate, said he believed the school implemented necessary changes to the curriculum and clinical experiences in order to maintain quality instruction.
“I feel like we’ve achieved the proper dental education that we set out to achieve — I think that’s quite remarkable,” Roistacher said. “I think that speaks to the resilience of our class as a whole, as well as the efforts of the school.”

We can all agree that daylight savings is screwed up — after that time change, I literally don’t see the sun on some days by the time I’m done with class. But we need to fight back and show it who’s boss. A Vitamin D-deficiency can’t be the only thing we are getting. So, here are a couple of things that you can do to take advantage of the night!
Seize more sleep or study time
A classic response would be to either call it a day and finally catch up on all the sleep that Harvard has been preventing you from getting. Or, maybe you’re so behind on your work that now you have more time to study. If neither of these options feels like something you would do, we hate to break it to ya, but you’ve been deprived of a proper college experience. Seek help?
Make LiGhT
If you refuse to accept that the sun sets so early and are adamant about having your daily dose of light in your life, then you can try to make your OWN light. We stan being the light in your own life. For one, you can buy a SAD lamp to simulate sunlight, and even try to get a spray tan while you’re at it. Did someone say a hot girl winter? Alternatively, start a bonfire with all your homework and papers past. Harvard Yard would be the perfect place to begin this cathartic journey.
Start your passion project
It’s time to finally get started on that weird project you’ve been wanting to start — whether it’s working on that super unique start-up idea of yours or finally putting an end to the rat infestation on campus. Choose your passion!
Become nocturnal 
The night is longer now anyway, so might as well become nocturnal. There are so many options here: joining Remy in his midnight rendezvous, completing one of the notorious Harvard traditions, or having deep late night conversations with questionable strangers. The night is your oyster!
We can’t let the early sunset take our life away. The night is young, we’re in college, it’s time to live it up before that reality check hits.
