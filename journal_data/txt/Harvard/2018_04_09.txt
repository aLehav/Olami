After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I. A rose is a rose is a rose.
My issue with The New York Times’s “Modern Love” segment is that too many stories either don’t qualify as modern or don’t qualify as love. Modern stories present love as partially formed, never finished, and awkwardly hinted at. Love stories deal with old topics like illness, loss, and sex. Which, perhaps, is the point.
I also say nothing new by calling Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince a love story, but when I first read it at sixteen I felt cut. On the drive back home after taking the SAT, I told my dad about this chapter that stayed in my head like a pop song. A little prince of a little planet loved a little rose, I said. The little rose was angry at the little prince because he loved her so much he smothered her. She told him to leave, and when he left, he entered a rose garden. Each rose was identical to his little rose. His little rose was common, but he’d been too kind to know before. So the little prince cried because his little rose didn’t know either. I told my dad that sometimes I felt like both the rose and the prince, and he laughed, easy as the day. He told me I didn’t have to worry about it if I didn’t want to, and I said sure. Then we turned on the radio and parked in my garage.
II. Music activates the same part of the brain as sex.
A friend once asked me if I thought love existed outside of logic. I didn’t know much about either—love or logic—but I answered with this question: How much of what I know about love is what I know about music?
If I were to give a personal award to the most influential celebrity couple of my teenage-dom, it would go to PartyNextDoor and Kehlani, both less than five years older than me. PartyNextDoor is a trap singer from outside of Toronto, best described as Rihanna’s alter-ego who penned both “Work” and “Sex With Me” from her album “Anti.” Kehlani is an R&B singer from Oakland who got nominated for a Grammy for her first album, her first try. They never admitted to dating, but their work intertwines like hands. In Kehlani’s song “FWU” from 2014, she states, “He fucking with me cause I’m loyal”; in PartyNextDoor’s song “FWU” from the same year, he states, “I’m still tryna fuck, with you.” PartyNextDoor has a well-known affinity for Oakland, singing in “Muse,” “Bad bitches from Oakland / She could be a model”; Kehlani sings in response, “Said it’s something about my city... / Oakland girls so damn hood but we’re so damn pretty” in “Runnin’.” When they supposedly broke up in 2015, PartyNextDoor released a freestyle named after Kehlani, then re-titled it to “Things & Such.” In her song “Piece of Mind” released Jan. 2017, Kehlani says “You said yourself, you made me who I am / You told me that after you, I would never love again”; in his song “Peace of Mind” released in June, PartyNextDoor says, “When it feel this good, you better keep it.”
Kehlani has called PartyNextDoor the biggest heartbreak of her life. She went on to date basketball player Kyrie Irving, then attempted suicide after PartyNextDoor posted a picture of her in his bed on Instagram, suggesting she had cheated on Irving (PartyNextDoor, of course, commented about this in “Problems & Selfless,” stating “You would kill yourself, O.D., and blame it on love”). The story, when it surfaced, shocked me. I was a huge PartyNextDoor fan; he oozed machismo. He sang like the way people I knew I wanted to be. Kehlani had a sweet voice; her songs struck me as feel-good. After the incident, PartyNextDoor’s music turned so depressive it felt like part of a recipe for insanity (“braggadocious to blues,” he said in an interview with Rolling Stone). Kehlani’s newest album seemed over-confident, less narrative-driven. We can never know, as consumers, what love felt like to them, but we can pick up their pieces. One thing is for sure—you will never fully understand one’s sound without understanding the other’s.
III. When good Americans die, they go to Paris.
Last May, I left for Paris and stayed two months in the apartment of a woman from Cameroon whose husband was in the hospital for cancer. In her presence, I pretended I was more Chinese than I was because she loved her homeland and wished her children spoke her mother tongue. I lived in her daughter’s room, so in a way, I was her daughter those two long months. Without language or friends, I spent much of my time talking with her about life and work, of Cameroon and China, of her husband and my father, of her and my mother—as if the past could turn itself alive before us. I was surprised by how aged, how present her love was for him, even if I had not met him yet. She cooked steak with lots of red the way he liked it, picked his favorite goat cheese from the shop next door. She once told me he loved jazz.
When he came back from the hospital in July, I realized the enervation I felt the previous days had been, in some ways, my sensing of her apprehension. They spent most nights quiet in front of the TV set. Their interactions looked quotidian but were filled with a thick air I couldn’t penetrate.
He passed away soon after I left. I realize now that I had witnessed a final stage of their relationship. I like to think that in their silence they were negotiating, for the last time, a future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, we’ve encountered countless programs, activities, and events designed to improve the student experience. Most of these programs involve food in some form or another. From berry-themed study breaks to brain break, it’s clear that the way to a Harvard student’s heart is through their stomach. With this in mind, we appreciate the opportunity that the College’s successful Classroom to Table program has given us, allowing us to meet professors in an intimate, comfortable, and delicious setting. We commend the College for establishing the program, as it has been a sterling success in getting undergraduates to engage with professors in a meaningful way, paving the way for solid, lasting relationships.
With its skyrocketing popularity, it is no surprise the initiative has recently seen budget constraints—as it is, the program reached its funding limit this past week and as a result closed its reservation form well before the end of the term. While it is unfortunate that the program ended early, this course of action demonstrates that it is generally difficult to find and keep track of funding for the Classroom to Table program. Therefore, in order to prevent a similar mid-semester shutdown in the future, we support the new restrictions the program has instituted capping the number of meals each student can have to two per term instead of four. We further support the continued implementation of the $30 spending limit per student at every Classroom to Table meal. Every student ought to have to opportunity to have a meal with a professor in the setting that Classroom to Table provides, and the funds garnered from these particular restrictions are entirely necessary to foster this equity.
Budget cuts and added limitations, however, cannot resolve the entirety of the Classroom to Table program’s financial woes. Indeed, the program is in need of more new funding. Fortunately, many groups around the College have the resources to take action to aid this valuable and necessary program. For example, the Undergraduate Council could consider providing funds to bolster the program. It is true that the Council has undertaken similar initiatives to Classroom to Table specifically in order to address the “barriers” that exist in the program, such as students themselves having to schedule outings themselves instead of having pre-set dinners to choose from. Nevertheless, helping to defray some of the Classroom to Table program’s costs would go a long way to provide students who prefer a dining program that offers more agency and free choice than the UC’s with a viable alternative. We thus hope the Council considers this course of action in future.
Overall, we find Classroom to Table to be a wonderful Harvard tradition, and we would be disheartened if financial reasons caused the College to end it entirely. Thus, we support the recent addition of restrictions with the hope that in the long term, the program is able to find new sources and continue to enrich our minds and our stomachs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1983, I filed a formal complaint against Harvard University to ensure that the professor who harassed me would never physically or mentally harm another member of the educational community. I refused to sign any settlement at all until former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky agreed to certain conditions including (but not limited to) the Faculty Council’s development of “procedures appropriate to dealing with abuses of authority involving sexual pressure.”
Almost four decades later, it is evident that the procedures and penalties operative today have not worked—something which I have joined the women who have come forth with accusations of harassment before and after my case in trying to change. But this should not be our task; it is the responsibility of the Harvard administration to acknowledge that the system to prevent harassment and sexual assault is inadequate, and thus actively seek informed and independent outside assistance for remedies.
The gravity of the administration’s failure over decades should not be underestimated. In 1983, I specifically warned that this professor was a “repeater.” I reported that, to my direct knowledge, this professor had already harassed at least two students and one other assistant professor, which two of these women confirmed. I also reported that this professor had retaliated against an undergraduate who had fled his advances; the grade on her senior honors thesis was subsequently changed by a fair outside reviewer.
Still, I could not be more shocked to learn the extent to which this professor’s conduct was permitted to continue over the years. The fact that I was able to rebuild my career should not diminish in any way the distress my parents, students, professors, friends, family and I endured in order to secure the hard-fought safeguards won from Harvard in 1983. Because I did not want any other woman to experience what I had, I reported harassment and fought Harvard’s insufficient response. The protections achieved were supposed to shield potential victims from future harm.
Instead, Harvard’s administration sent a very different signal. The central office established to handle such complaints was dismantled after my departure, and procedures were later put in place that actively discouraged victims. Moreover, the harasser was visibly and effectively enabled. Although finding this professor “wholly responsible” for abuse of power, subsequent administrations at Harvard disregarded his past behavior and further empowered him by promoting him up to the level of vice provost for international affairs and eventually accepting a prize in his honor. It is sickening to me that had successive administrations and many of this professor’s colleagues acted differently, perhaps no other student, staff or untenured professor would have had to experience the acute betrayal of trust represented by sexual harassment at one’s own university.
Today, the current administration claims that it did not know about this behavior. How can this be? Many professors in the Government Department (both in 1983 and today) and countless others throughout the University knew about this well-publicized case, which appeared in the national media at the time. All that had to be done was Google his name. Instead, it fell to students over the years to warn each other not to be left alone with their own professor. Regardless of whether this administration knew or simply should have known about his abuse of power over decades, all students, staff and young faculty have a right to be protected in their own educational community.
On Feb. 27, the day the Chronicle of Higher Education published its article revealing details of my case and multiple new targets of harassment, I emailed University President Drew G. Faust some of the language in my 1983 agreement, reporting the guarantee of his dismissal should a recurrence occur. I subsequently re-sent this same language from my agreement to the Chair of the Government Department, asking her to forward it to the Dean of the Faculty and to President Faust. But to date, I only have received a letter from the president's office, which advised me that my name was given to the Title IX office. I have heard nothing further from the administration or the Title IX office.
Let me be clear: While I applaud the announced decision of the FAS to forward this issue to Title IX and I have always recognized the need to protect the due process of all concerned, the documents I hold are directly relevant to the choice of appropriate sanctions for repeated harassment and the full and fair investigation the University has promised to conduct. But the lack of a timely response to victims, the kicking of responsibility from one office or person to another, and the unclear notion of what constitutes a complaint or what protections exist for victims taking the risk to come forward creates the distinct impression of a policy of deliberate delay, indifference and/or “circling the wagons.” It also creates the false impression that this is an “exceptional case” even though “repeaters” are often the norm and other cases are known to exist at Harvard. Words alone cannot change this.
Thus, as 14 other women have written (without yet receiving any response from the Provost), more timely and appropriate actions must be combined with the specific efforts of the administration if what seems to be decades of harassment are to be changed. If the professor involved is not brought before the Harvard Corporation for dismissal and given other meaningful sanctions, what Harvard professor will ever be meaningfully sanctioned? This is a necessary, clear benchmark and deterrent for future cases. In addition, “make whole” remedies should be offered to all women who suffered from this situation, regardless of their status at the time.
Furthermore, neither the Government Department nor Harvard University itself can or should investigate itself. It is not alone in this respect. No university should claim special status above the corporate world, police departments, Hollywood, or any other major institution with a “climate problem”—as Michigan State’s terrible example has shown. A full and fair investigation of how decades of harassment could occur, even in the context of well-publicized prior notice, requires a fully autonomous and independent investigator or independent commission—with specific expertise in rooting out sexual harassment in employment and education. The recommendations that ensue should then be implemented.
Only these combined actions can begin to transform Harvard’s permissive climate of harassment and sexual assault into an exemplary zero-tolerance model of “best practices,” which ensure equal educational opportunities for all.
Terry L. Karl is a professor of political science at Stanford University. She and at least 17 other women have publicly accused Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment over three decades.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Hillel hosted a Seder last week meant to publicly oppose Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza, though student organizers complained of some “censorship” from Hillel administrators.
The Seder—a ceremonial service and meal that takes place at the start of the Jewish holiday of Passover—was run by student group Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance. The event was intended to honor what organizers called the Palestinian victims of the Israeli government’s policies.
Noah R. Wagner ’18, who helped organize the Seder, said the holiday afforded an opportunity to address what can be a touchy subject for many Jews. Harvard Hillel is the only nationally affiliated college Hillel chapter to allow an anti-occupation seder this year, according to Helene Lovett ’19, another organizer. Swarthmore College’s chapter held a similar event, but their chapter disaffiliated from the national organization, Hillel International, in 2015 after objections to the chapter’s Israel-Palestine events.
“I think that often our Jewish communities sort of turn away from asking difficult questions and discussing painful truths about the occupation,” Wagner said.  “I think we wanted to approach the issue with a lot of care and thought and compassion at a holiday that is very much about human dignity and freedom for all.”
Israeli settlement in the West Bank and Gaza began in 1967, when the Israeli army took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt, respectively.  The Israeli government and many of its supporters dispute the use of the term "occupation," however, contending the designation disregards the Jewish people’s historic ties to the land.
In Dec. 2017, President Donald Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, prompting criticisms from international leaders and reversing seven decades of U.S. policy precedent. Trump’s decision received much criticism from those who view the West Bank as occupied by Israeli forces.
Organizers of Thursday’s Seder said they had to contend with strict standards mandated by Hillel International, an umbrella organization that supports more than 500 Hillels—centers for Jewish students—at college campuses around the world.
Hillel International’s “standards of partnership,” implemented in 2010, state the organization—presumably including its chapters—will not “partner with, house, or host” groups or speakers that “delegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel” or “support boycott, divestment from, or sanctions” against Israel.
“We had to be really deliberate, make a really deliberate, conscious effort to ensure that all of the programming was in line with Hillel’s ‘standards of partnership,’” Wagner said.  “That meant, for instance, omitting two poems that our Palestinian peers had submitted when we asked them for content for our Haggadah, our program, at the request of Hillel.”
“It also means contending with the discomfort and really alienation and silencing that is the experience of Palestinian students and students who do Palestinian organizing on campus who have historically been excluded from Hillel,” Wagner added.
Harvard Hillel Executive Director Jonah C. Steinberg wrote in an emailed statement that his staff worked closely with student organizers of the Seder to formulate a program that fit within Hillel’s guidelines.
“One of three poems suggested shortly before the Seder by Palestinian guests (after the 'Haggadah' for the program was already printed) was chosen for inclusion,” Steinberg added.  “The students' decision to hold this program within Harvard Hillel and in coherence with Harvard Hillel's commitment regarding Israel was the students' own, as was their decision to seek guidance in doing so.”
Steinberg sent an email to all members of Hillel ahead of the Seder affirming Hillel is a “pluralistic Jewish community.”
“The range of pro-Israel views within our walls is very much like the diversity within the Jewish politics of Israel itself,” he wrote.
Participants in Thursday’s Seder have faced harsh criticism from some Jewish leaders.  Adam Milstein, a prominent Israeli-American real estate developer and philanthropist, called attendees of the Seder “self hating Jews” in a tweet he posted in late March.
Lovett praised Harvard Hillel for allowing the Seder to take place, despite some students’ frustration with what they called “censorship.”
“We want to be clear, we feel very lucky and supportive that Harvard Hillel decided to let us have the Seder,” Lovett said. “Harvard Hillel is a leader on the national stage in taking that step and hopefully inspires other Jewish institutions and local Hillels to do that in the future.”
Last week’s Seder was also meant to honor various civil rights movements including the push for LGBT rights, for racial justice, and for the rights of immigrants and refugees, according to Wagner. Wagner said attendees poured a ceremonial cup of wine for these three movements, along with Palestinian liberation.
The event came just days after tensions flared up on the Gaza-Israeli border, with Israeli troops killing at least 17 Palestinians and wounding hundreds more during a demonstration calling for the right of return for Palestinian refugees.  The Israeli government has repeatedly justified its use of force, arguing that protesters were rolling burning tires and throwing stones at Israeli soldiers.
Wagner and Lovett were arrested last week at the Israeli Consulate in Boston during a protest against Israel’s presence in Gaza and its use of force against Palestinians, according to Lovett.
“I think that only reaffirms our commitment to these issues,” Lovett said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Allstonians are looking to restore a roadside strip of green land near Interstate 90 with the help of Harvard and state funding after a similar attempt a decade ago failed to take root.
Friends of the Lincoln Street Green Strip—a group dedicated to the strip’s restoration—received $4,000 from the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund last year to create a master plan. The group is currently seeking community feedback.
Residents call the Lincoln Street Green Strip a “gateway” to a residential portion of North Allston. During the previous restoration attempt, residents received several grants, including one from the New England Foundation for the Arts in 2006. In spring 2008, landscapers took down the chain-link fence, removed some weeds, and installed steel ornaments on the strip.
But Jason Desrosier, manager at the Allston-Brighton Community Development Corporation, said those initial efforts are not sufficient to create a long-term green space.
“I think the issue the first time was that the roots weren’t coming out, and the roots weren’t properly taken care of, so the plants came back,” he said.
Allstonian Richard  Rogers said he also believes the previous project lacked lasting power. He and his wife, Victoria Stock, are spearheading the latest restoration effort, focused on eradicating invasive species, replanting sustainable trees, and eliminating litter on the strip.
“There was a lot of excavation, they did a lot of work, but the strip has literally never been touched again except for maybe two times a year,” Rogers said. “I think after all those grants were awarded, there were various parties that were involved that made an early exit.”
Rogers added he believes the previous attempt fell short because it miscalculated the amount of planters needed for the land and failed to replant any trees after removing all the invasive species.
“Those propagate through the neighborhood,” Rogers said. “That area is the source of the invasives in the neighborhood, and those go in and damage the foundations of the houses around.”
Desrosier said he sees opportunities for the Allston-Brighton Community Development Corporation to support the project.
“We haven’t had that conversation yet, but I think there’s some opportunity for us to do some neighborhood cleanup day or something during the summer months or after the project is done,” he said. “We’ll work as collaboratively as possible or as needed.”
After the group finalizes its master plan, Friends for the Lincoln Street Green Strip hopes to apply for funding from the Community Preservation Act in September.
The Community Preservation Act—which Boston approved in Nov. 2016—mandates a surcharge on property tax to support various community improvement projects. In 2018, the city started using community preservation funds to support historic preservation, affordable housing, and parks and open space.
Thadine Brown, director of Boston's Community Preservation program, said the committee has just received its first round of grant applications, and is looking forward to supporting community projects.
“Our committee is fairly new, so I can’t say that it’ll accept all projects,” Brown said. “We may take a variety of projects in different neighborhoods, because we want to make sure we’re tailoring all neighborhoods through the city of Boston.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said the time felt “right” to step down from his position in an interview last week.
Smith first announced his resignation—ending nearly 11 years as dean—last month in an email to FAS affiliates. He wrote that he will step down once President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow appoints a new FAS Dean. Bacow officially launched the search for Smith’s successor last month and is currently seeking input from FAS affiliates.
Smith’s announcement comes on the heels of University President Drew G. Faust’s decision to resign in June. In the interview last week, he said the presidential transition gave him time to reflect and prompted him to think about what he would like to do in the years going forward.
“It just felt like the right time for me. You know, these offices are very closely linked,” Smith said of the University president and FAS dean offices.
At the most recent Faculty meeting, many professors and administrators lauded Smith  for his accomplishments as dean, at one point giving him a standing ovation. Since Smith's resignation announcement, professors have praised his leadership during the financial crisis of 2008 as well as his involvement in initiatives like the development of the new Allston campus and the undergraduate House renewal project.
Smith said efforts to improve the FAS tenure track experience, to increase diversity on campus, and House renewal—a billion dollar project to renovate Harvard’s undergraduate residences—formed some of the most personally meaningful projects he worked on as dean.
He noted that some faculty members who earned tenure during his deanship have already risen to leadership roles in research and administration. Before the introduction of the tenure track in the early 2000s, FAS placed less emphasis on internal hiring and cultivating talent at the assistant and associate professor levels.
“We've brought in some tremendous young people doing incredible work across a variety of different disciplines, I think they are future leaders for us,” Smith said.
While the search for his successor continues, Smith said he will continue to work on ongoing initiatives including the University’s capital campaign, slated to wrap up in June.
“I keep doing this job because it needs to get done, so I will help out where the faculty or some of my colleagues here in University Hall want my help. We're still pushing, for example, to get to the end of the campaign. I'm still out there fundraising, still doing the job,” Smith said.
FAS passed its overall $2.5 billion capital campaign goal in 2016, and the College recently reached its financial aid goal.
Bacow announced a 13- member search committee for the new FAS dean in an email he sent to FAS affiliates last week.
Smith said he was “rightfully” not a part of the search but would help the new dean transition into the role.
“I am in the process of making sure the important kind of activities taking place in FAS do continue,” Smith said. “That'll be easier to know when I finally do know who the next person will be, and help update him or her to take over, not just what they want to do, but some of the things the faculty have said are important for us to continue doing in the future.”
Looking forward, Smith said he’s spoken with “his mentors” about next steps after he steps down from his position as dean.
“I still have things I would like to do with my life that I enjoy,” Smith said.
Smith, a Computer Science professor, mentioned he is looking forward to returning to teaching in the classroom. But he said he has no specific plans beyond that.
At least one thing about his future is certain, however—Smith will not be attending the monthly meetings of the Faculty for a while.
“I get a little time off, so I will be taking time off,” he said.

Jorge P. Lemann ’61, a Brazilian investor who numbers among the richest people in the world, recently made a donation to Harvard in order to support classes in entrepreneurship and engineering.
Lemann’s gift, announced Wednesday in The Harvard Gazette, will allow professors from the College, Harvard Business School, and the School for Engineering and Applied Sciences to work together to create new pilot courses. To a similar end, the donation—the exact amount of which remains undisclosed—endows a new professorship aimed at developing classes with a focus on entrepreneurship.
“I’m proud to help Harvard students from all areas of the globe learn how to be future entrepreneurs,” Lemann said to the Gazette, a publication run by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. “Business and innovation is what makes the world such a dynamic place, and I am excited to see what Harvard students will accomplish next.”
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said Lemann’s contribution will be especially beneficial to the University given growing interest in engineering disciplines and the upcoming expansion of SEAS into Allston.
“The future prosperity of our society depends on innovation and entrepreneurship, which will likely blossom in the boundaries between traditional disciplines,” wrote Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb in an emailed statement. “Jorge Lemann’s gift will promote the related skills in Harvard's students and make it easier for them to become the future leaders of progress.”
Paul B. Bottino, executive director of innovation education at SEAS, said Lemann’s contribution will advance the University’s ongoing efforts in the area of technology-based entrepreneurship. He cited the Harvard College Innovation Challenge, the formation of the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard, and the Harvard Innovation Labs as examples.
“Mr. Lemann’s gift promises to be a step-change advancement in our innovation and entrepreneurship education efforts!  Since we initiated Harvard’s undergraduate I&E education in 2000 with the creation of TECH and ES139 (Innovation in Science and Engineering), we’ve consistently been building out resources and courses for undergraduates,” Bottino wrote in an emailed statement.
Lemann is a perennial Harvard donor. This donation marks the latest in a series of gifts to the University through the Lemann Foundation, which provides financial aid to students from Brazil.
The Foundation also initiated the Brazil Research Fund, which finances research endeavors between Brazilian and Harvard professors, particularly those related to education.

Harvard's new covered baseball and softball hitting pavilion—originally slated to open in mid-March—will now instead open at least a month late near the end of April, a delay at least one student-athlete called disappointing.
Three weeks after the facility was supposed to be ready to welcome teams returning from spring break, the pavilion's metal frame and roof stand nearly completed to the left-field side of O’Donnell Field, accompanied by a smattering of construction vehicles and equipment.  The fences depicted in initial renderings of the facility and the turf ground cover are yet to be installed.
Inclement weather set back the construction of the facility by a few weeks, according to College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. Goldman wrote in an email that the facility will open in late April.
“We look forward to opening the new hitting facility adjacent to the baseball and softball fields later this month,” Goldman wrote. “The three-season, covered facility will provide greater opportunity for our teams to practice hitting and pitching during inclement weather.”
Some members of Harvard's baseball and softball teams said they were unaware of the revised timeline for the facility’s opening. Hunter B. Bigge ’20, a pitcher for the baseball team, said the delay—coupled with recent storms—has limited the team’s ability to practice.
“Our hitting facility that’s supposed to go up keeps getting delayed and delayed and delayed,” Bigge said. “This past week we didn’t really have anywhere to practice. We had to go on the indoor track in like 30-minute bunches at a time.”
Softball captain Kaitlyn L. Schiffhauer ’19 said her team has also had to practice on the indoor track this spring. She added the softball team has used the indoor track during inclement weather for years.
“Having to practice indoors has always been an adjustment we make during our season,” Schiffhauer said. “The track and field team has been wonderfully accommodating to us, and we have some cages installed inside there that we have used for a number of years.”
While the indoor track facility gives the teams room to practice, Bigge said the space places limitations on their drills the baseball team would not face in the new facility.
“There was snow on our field, the facility wasn’t ready, the bubble’s down—so, it’s always a weird week after spring break,” Bigge said. “We really need this facility to be able to do the bare minimum.”

UPDATED: April 24, 2018 at 6:45 p.m.
MIT, Stanford, and every member of the Ivy League, with the exception of Yale, set record-low rates for admission to the Class of 2022.
Out of the group of 10 schools, Stanford was the most selective, with an admissions rate of 4.3 percent. For the fifth year in a row, Stanford had a lower rate than Harvard, which accepted 4.59 percent of students who applied—marking the first time the College has ever dipped below 5 percent.
Admissions rates at Harvard and at universities throughout the country have been trending downward in recent application cycles. Harvard’s overall and early acceptance rates have decreased each year for the past five years. Rates have similarly decreased at Stanford, Princeton, Penn, and Columbia over the past five years. Yale—which increased the size of its incoming freshman classes beginning with the Class of 2021—saw its acceptance rate rise to 6.9 percent after the school began admitting more students last year, though its acceptance rate dropped again to 6.31 this admissions cycle.
College consultant Steven R. Goodman attributed these highly selective colleges’ plummeting admissions rates to a recent focus on recruiting a broader pool of students, as well as to applicants’ decisions to apply to a greater number of schools.
“I think the key is recruiting, recruiting, and recruiting. And the more students who are recruited to be in the applicant pool, the lower the acceptance percentages are going to be,” Goodman said.
Goodman added that “the numbers rule everything” in light of this shift and said he doesn’t expect the admissions rates to hit a floor.
Trends in early action and early decision rates varied. Neither Stanford nor Columbia released early-action or early-decision data; however, every other school except Harvard saw its early-admission rate decrease.  With a  14.5 percent early action acceptance rate, Harvard stayed consistent with last year’s rate.
Phil Trout, the former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling and a college counselor at Minnetonka High School, said he advises students to apply early to Harvard and similar schools only if they are at the top of the students’ lists. He noted the considerable difference in these colleges’ early and regular admissions rates.
“The statistics are pretty stark if you are on my side of the desk, as a high school counselor, we tell students, or we ask students, ‘Is Harvard on your list, or is Harvard at the top of your list?’” Trout said. “Because a student who applies early action has more than a 15 percent chance of being accepted, a student who applies regular this year and others—2 percent? 2.5 percent?”
Despite the record-low admissions rates for much-coveted spots at these colleges, Goodman said students can find transformative post-secondary scholastic success wherever they matriculate.
“I think increasingly students are finding that when they get to wherever they want to go to, that they can have powerful experiences with their roommate, they can have powerful experiences with faculty members, they can have powerful experiences extracurricularly,” Goodman said.
Six of 10 provided data about the ethnic and racial make-up of their admitted classes; at least 50 percent of admitted students identify as minorities. Cornell had the greatest proportion of minority admits, coming in at 54 percent. Approximately 52 percent of Harvard’s admits to the Class of 2022 are minorities. Columbia, MIT, Stanford, and Yale did not publicize racial demographics data for their admitted classes.
First-generation students made up between 13 and 18.3 percent of admitted classes at the seven schools which provided that statistic. Stanford attracted the greatest proportion of first-generation students. Columbia, MIT, and Yale did not provide data on first-generation admits.
International student admit rates were comparable among the universities which provided that data. International students ranged from the 9 percent of the admit pool at Cornell to 12 percent of the pools at Harvard and Princeton.
Admitted students at all four-year undergraduate institutions have until May 1 to make their final college selections.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research held a day-long symposium to reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and legacy, 50 years after his assassination.
The event comprised three panels titled “Transformations and Reflections,” “Social Justice: Changing the World,” and “Civil Rights: Looking Back, Moving Forward.” The 15 panelists, each experts in their fields, discussed topics ranging from King’s philosophy to the status of black America today. Students from the Harvard Black Men’s Forum, the Association of Black Harvard Women, and the Harvard Black Student Alliance served as moderators.
In opening remarks, African and African American Studies Department Chair Lawrence D. Bobo and University Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. commended what they called progress towards racial equality achieved in the years since King’s time. Gates also serves as director of the Hutchins Center.
The two speakers also said that, despite these steps forward, many obstacles still stand in the way of racial equality. Citing ongoing economic and social injustices, Bobo and Gates asserted King’s mission is far from complete. Both said they hoped the symposium would inspire continued activism.
“I hope it is dedicated to King’s fervent pursuit of justice and moral courage in the face of resistance and doubt,” Bobo said.
African and African American Studies assistant professor Brandon M. Terry ’05 stressed the importance of discussing King’s legacy.
“Anybody who cares about overcoming injustice and the future of democracy, the ideal of equality—there's just no way around wrestling with what he's left,” Terry said.
Executive Director of the Hutchins Center Abby Wolf said she hopes the symposium will teach attendees about King’s indomitable spirit.
“King, even though there were junctures where he didn't know which way to go, he just kept going and kept figuring out a path, and I think given our current climate, there's a lot of despair and frustration and feeling like we're not getting out of this very well,” she said.
Near the end of the event, University Professor Danielle S. Allen, who chaired the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, delivered the keynote address, speaking to an audience of around 200. She covered a range of subjects linking King’s activism to campus culture.
“Students don't serve a role on very many committees, their voices don't enter into the decision making processes,” Allen said. “This speaks to the issue of how you bring in everybody.”
She concluded by directly addressing the students in attendance.
“The revolutionary architecture was done by 30 year olds. We forget that because the paintings always have white wigs,” Allen said. “So I'm always saying to my students, 'Ok people—it's you guys!'”
Allen, in an interview before the event, emphasized the importance of a shared understanding of history when working to achieve progress.
“My experience is that every new generation of young students, white students in particular, always I have to teach the history again. We shouldn't have to teach the history again, we should get to a place where we all recognize that this is our shared history,” she said.
Hasani A. Hayden ’19, a member of Harvard’s Black Men’s Forum, moderated the panel titled “Civil Rights: Looking Back, Moving Forward.”
“Those discussions aren't solely for our membership, they're for the entire Harvard community,” he said.
Jose R. Martinez Jr. ’21 said he left the keynote address feeling empowered to make social change.

When School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Frank J. Doyle III was asked how Harvard's engineering program stacks up against Stanford’s, he laughed.
“It’s a never-ending comparison,” Doyle said, chuckling.
The two universities, boasting widely different cultures and environments, are constantly juxtaposed.  Every year, journalists and college consultants ritually seek out each school’s updated U.S. News and World Report ranking. The lucky few who earn acceptance to both institutions beleaguer popular forum websites like Quora and College Confidential with anxious posts as the May commitment date approaches.
Some, though, refuse to make the comparison at all. Both institutions’ computer science and engineering faculty decline to definitively rank their respective programs.
“I’m not a rah-rah kinda person; I’m happy to say what I think makes our program very good. I don’t want to get into comparisons with other institutions,” said Alex Aiken, chair of Stanford’s Computer Science Department.
“Well, I won't make a comparison to Stanford,” agreed Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of the College and a professor in Harvard’s Computer Science Department.
As an institution, Harvard had a head start.
The Lawrence Scientific School, established to educate undergraduates in science and engineering, was founded in in 1847 courtesy of a $50,000 gift from its namesake, Abbott Lawrence.  The school was arguably unappreciated in its time; former University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, comparing the idea of an undergraduate scientific school to “the story of an ugly duckling” in an 1869 Atlantic article.
Fifty-nine more years would pass before Harvard added engineering to the college’s curriculum via the 1906 merger of the Lawrence School and the College.
Stanford offered engineering from its inception in 1891. Out of the 15 members of Stanford’s inaugural faculty, five were engineering professors, according to Stanford’s engineering website.  In the university’s first class, engineering enrollees made up 141 out of a total of 559 undergraduate students.
Stanford sits in the heart of the Silicon Valley, surrounded by tech giants including Apple, located in neighboring Cupertino, and both Facebook and Google, located in nearby Menlo Park and Mountain View, respectively.  Common lore dictates that Stanford’s rise closely paralleled Silicon Valley’s own ascent to national and industrial prominence.
“It’s a unique physical situation being in Silicon Valley, so, Stanford has a long history with Silicon Valley and I think it’s no secret that it helped foster the rise of Silicon Valley,” Aiken said.
“There’s been a lot of back and forth with the industry and the people in the area for a very long time,” he said. “That’s actually a big part of the success of the place, is that informal and both formal help that we get from local industry.”
In 1974, when companies like Apple and Oracle’s were in their infancies, Stanford had 157 engineering professors and 433 undergraduates in its engineering program.  Twelve years later, in 1986, Stanford’s engineering program had grown to 214 engineering professors and 665 undergraduates.
The faculty, too, has deep ties to the Silicon Valley. Stanford’s former president John L. Hennessy, who is often referred to as “godfather of the Silicon Valley,” currently serves as board chairman for Alphabet, Inc., Google’s parent firm, and dozens of his colleagues have played instrumental roles in developing foundational internet technologies.
The University's engineering program, by contrast, has long been wedded to something entirely different—Harvard’s liberal arts tradition.
“I think we need to be cognizant that we really have a fundamentally different kind of program from many of those places.  And... the hallmarks that differentiate us, I would argue, are first, our embedding in a liberal arts foundation,” Doyle said. “You know, when we became a school ten years ago, we did not divorce away and create a separate undergraduate body.”
According to Christopher M. Madl ’12, a former engineering sciences concentrator and current postdoctoral fellow at Stanford, the opportunity to pursue broad interests comprised a highlight of his experience studying engineering at Harvard.
“I think those are some of the courses I most enjoyed as a Harvard undergrad, beyond the sciences courses were some of these humanities courses I took, and I think that is certainly a strength that could be matched at some place like Stanford that is a very broad university,” Madl said.
Since its 2007 restructuring, SEAS has nonetheless pushed for the kind of industry ties and start-up culture prominent at peer engineering schools like Stanford's.  In 2011, the University established the glass-encased Innovation Lab to help facilitate the entrepreneurial visions of its students and faculty.
In a recent interview, Doyle identified increasing connections with the private sector as a top priority during his tenure and noted he recently hired a staffer to manage the school’s corporate outreach.
Harvard trails Stanford in terms of total concentrators and faculty members in the engineering school by a significant margin. When comparing similar concentrations—Harvard parlance for major—between the schools, there is only one concentration in which Harvard's enrollees slightly outnumber Stanford's: Environmental Science and Engineering.
Out of the top five Stanford undergraduate majors in 2017—Computer Science, Human Biology, Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Science, Technology and Society—three fall under the university’s engineering program.
A larger faculty, according to Aiken, leads to a broader teaching capability, especially in computer science.
“The thing about Stanford is that we’re a big enough department to cover the whole spectrum,” Aiken said.
Rapid growth, though, also presents challenges for faculty-student advising. Stanford’s Computer Science program, for instance, has over 663 degree candidates and 122 affiliated faculty, resulting in a faculty to student ratio that is higher than Stanford’s average 4:1 ratio.
“It’s a real challenge, the growth in the number of students has outstripped our traditional advising mechanisms, there’s no question about that,” Aiken said. “This is actually something we are currently working on, we’re currently revising our advising structure and thinking about how to improve it, you know, for the future.”
Some affiliated with SEAS, on the other hand, see the school's nimble size as an advantage. While computer science is the second most popular concentration at Harvard, it boasts half as many undergraduates as Stanford’s program. Enrollment for the remaining SEAS concentrations, with the exception of Applied Mathematics, is limited to double digits.
This small scale, Harvard faculty argue, allows students more hands-on opportunities and individualized experiences.
“If you look at the course catalog, at some our engineering courses, two-thirds of them have a hands-on component," Doyle said. "I would challenge folks looking at our peers or our competitors to find a place that, in our sort of research standing, in our sort of superlative academic archives here, that offers that kind of intimate hands on opportunity."
"It’s hard to do at a big scale, it really is hard to do,” Doyle said.
The small feel, Lewis said, is also consistent with Harvard’s outlook on undergraduate education.
“This is actually consistent with everything else at Harvard, the Classics Department is smaller than other great classics departments, the Math Department is smaller than many other places with great math departments,” Lewis said. “Every individual department of course thinks it should be twice the size that it is, but the sort of Harvard philosophy is sort of have everything be small and excellent.”
“I think students tend not to get lost or isolated intellectually here at SEAS,” Lewis added.
Faculty at both institutions said they anticipate room for growth.
“I haven’t noticed any systemic flaws that I have goals of correcting at some point in the near future.  I’m sure they’ll come up as I continue to familiarize myself,” said Eric A. Appel, a material sciences and engineering assistant professor at Stanford.
Aiken pointed out, though, that they would be cautious about introducing any sudden changes to the university’s already well-established programs.
“One thing, it’s difficult to fiddle with pieces of the culture of a place and say I’m gonna improve this aspect or change this one little thing, they kinda come as packages, and so that’s what makes it hard to say, well, just because we like this one aspect of another place, that adopting that might mean a lot of other changes that we wouldn’t like,” Aiken said. “I think it’s good that there’s a lot of variation in the ways places are set up and that they emphasize different things, that doesn’t mean that we necessarily want to be like other places.”
SEAS, according to Doyle, will seek to emulate its peers’ strengths as it readies for an ambitious expansion.
“Look, we don’t want to have our head under a basket and ignore any pioneering or innovative or technological advances that others happen to beat us to,” Doyle said. “Or if they see it first, we need to learn from that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has accepted a proposal to research the establishment of a multicultural center on campus, Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis announced at Sunday’s Undergraduate Council meeting.
But it will likely be a while before any physical structure is built—if one is ever built.
Khurana’s decision means the College will soon move to create a working group—comprising students and administrators—that will study possible ways to address students’ concerns about inclusion and belonging. The group's establishment kickstarts a process both administrators and student leaders have acknowledged could span years.
Davis told UC representatives that Khurana showed “great interest” in the proposal for action submitted by leaders of the Multicultural Center Coalition, a UC group advocating for the construction of such a center. Khurana will now begin setting out a “charge” for the working group, which will convene in early fall 2018, Davis said.
Though the coalition has argued for the erection of a physical space for students of all backgrounds, Davis cautioned that the findings of the working group should dictate the best ways to move forward.
“I’m reticent to call it a multicultural center because again, we don’t know what the needs are, we don’t know how whatever needs there are will be met,” Davis said. “What I think we need is something that is Harvard-specific that will meet the needs of Harvard students today and Harvard students going forward for the next 50 years.”
“I don’t know what that will look like,” he added.
Winthrop House Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said students have approached him asking for a timetable for the proposed multicultural center.
“When can students expect roughly for this to become a reality?” Bonsall asked. “At the end of the day, the only question they really care about is when it’s going to be available to them.”
Davis said he could not give an exact answer.
“I can’t even begin to project,” Davis said.  “If the work goes forward as the policy proposal calls for it to, we’re looking at two years of work before we would even conceive of even breaking ground on something.”
“I’m hopeful that it... will be before I retire,” Davis added to a few laughs.
The push for a multicultural center on campus has been a long and fraught struggle, with efforts dating back almost half a century.
When student groups submitted a proposal for a multicultural center in 1995, then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III struck it down, arguing the establishment of such a space would divide the student body.
On Sunday, Dunster House Representative Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 asked Davis if this renewed push would end the same way as previous efforts.
“The Dean of the College is behind it, so I think that will make the difference,” Davis said.
Davis further cautioned UC representatives about possible barriers to construction. Even if the working group ultimately decides that a physical multicultural center is the best solution, Davis said, outside forces could pose obstacles down the road.
“The Cambridge Historical Society has a say in everything and that, sometimes, could be the biggest obstacle to any work that’s being done anywhere on campus,” he said. “Once you get people unaffiliated with the University involved in these conversations, all bets are off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 11, 2018 at 2:00 a.m.
Harvard hosted its first-ever Israel Summit Sunday, bringing together affiliates from across the University to learn about all things Israel at the Charles Hotel.
The Israel Summit was “aimed at broadening all students’ horizons on Israel,” according to its website. The event featured speakers from multiple industries, ranging from public service and non-profits to tech and academia.
Notable speakers included University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who gave opening remarks, fashion designer Elie Tahari, former University President Lawrence H. Summers, political analyst and former presidential adviser David Gergen, NBA allstar Amar'e Stoudemrie, and Ron Prosor, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations.
Conference director Max W. August ’20 said the summit was meant to reach a new kind of audience and to encourage conversation about issues involving Israel.
“Issues around Israel are complex, and I think they’re often times misunderstood,” he said.
Attendees numbered over 400—in addition to thousands who watched online—and included student representatives from every Ivy League school, according to August.
August said the summit’s organizers—comprising a team of students from across campus—raised nearly $200,000 for the event, which was co-sponsored by Hillel International, the Paul E. Singer Foundation, and Birthright Israel Excel, in addition to several other organizations on and off campus.
The College Democrats, College Republicans, the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, and a number of other student associations from the University's different schools also threw their support behind the event.
August said these clubs'  support and help mitigated some of the challenges inherent in organizing something on the scale of the Summit for the first time.
The summit in part featured “Fireside Chats,” in which smaller groups of attendees chatted with speakers directly. The event also included a career fair during which attendees met with potential employers and non-governmental organizations working in Israel and other countries to discuss summer and post-graduation opportunities like jobs, trips, and fellowships. Career fair participants included Via, MassChallenge, and Fiverr.
Sivan Ya’ari, the founder of Innovation: Africa, a non-profit organization that aims to share novel Israeli technology in fields like renewable energy and water purification with African nations, said she participated in the summit to encourage students to become involved in issues related to Israel.
“The reason why I came was because many of the students here are the future leaders and I was a student when I started and I hope that some of what I said will inspire them to do the same,” Ya’ari said.
Jonah C. Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, praised students for their commitment to planning the summit.
“It goes to show that when students have an idea and if they stick to it, and really are committed to the vision of it, they’re able to raise the bar, and I’m just honored to be a part of it,” Steinberg said.
August said he hopes that the summit will continue on annual basis and that the footage of the summit, when released, will reach thousands of people.

A day after upsetting No. 1 Michigan in the NCBBA semifinal, Harvard Club Basketball (Crimson Classics) fell to Ohio State in the championship game 80-70 at South Bend, Ind.
The Crimson Classics earned a spot in the National Championship game after a 79-75 overtime upset against top-seeded Michigan. In that contest, freshman forward Paul Ramsey shot 12-for-15 from the field for a team-high 31 points. Three other members of the Classics scored in double-digits, including 19 points from freshman guard Soren McLeod.
Prior to that contest, No. 4 Harvard faced off against Ancient Eight foe Princeton, which was ranked as the No. 5 seed. The Crimson narrowly edged the Tigers, 90-89, with senior Ephraim Lavey and Ramsey combining for 50 points. Harvard shot 50 percent from the field in that game with five game triples.
In regular season play, the Classics finished 19-3 overall and earned their spot in the National Tournament as the New England Conference Champions. Coming into the tournament, Harvard had won seven straight including a 87-73 victory against New England South champions Holy Cross.
A back-and-forth affair in Sunday's final saw Ohio State carry a four-point lead into the second half. After the Buckeyes extended the lead to 47-40, the Crimson went on a 9-0 run to regain the lead. Ohio State responded with a run of its own and held a 58-52 lead with 12 minutes to play.
Numerous turnovers and poor interior defense saw Ohio State bring the lead to 10 with eight minutes to play. Despite a string of threes from Harvard that narrowed the game to six, the Crimson could not complete the comeback effort and will leave South Bend as the national runner-up. A relatively new team in the college club basketball landscape, the young Crimson team returns several current underclassmen heading into next season.
A more in-depth piece on the club basketball season to come soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


The Harvard men’s volleyball team continued its hot streak this weekend at the Malkin Athletic Center, with two crucial victories against EIVA opponents.
The Crimson (11-11, 10-2 EIVA) extended its winning streak to six games after securing a narrow victory over conference rival Princeton (10-14, 6-6) on Friday night and then a dominant win over the New Jersey Institute of Technology (7-16, 4-8) on Saturday afternoon.
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
The Crimson did not drop a single set as it rolled over NJIT on Saturday afternoon. On a day when the team honored its Class of 2018 in its last regular season home game, the victory was worth much more to the team than just conference standing.
“It was really fun,” senior blocker Riley Moore said. “Especially to win like that, having all four seniors out on the court, having a couple laughs. It was really just a cool way to end the season.”
After a dominant second set, Harvard seized momentum and took control of the game. The team rolled through the third set with confidence and smiles. The Crimson took the first point with a kill by senior setter Marko Kostich and never gave up the lead, winning the set, 25-15.
The third set was critical to the team’s mentality, as closing games has become a main focus as of late.
“I thought we finished really well,” Moore said. “We’ve been up 2-0 in our last two matches and then gone to five [sets]. It was really important that we come out and finish fast. 25-15 was a great way to do that.”
Before that, Harvard had taken the second set, 25-19. The margin was capped off by a service error by Highlanders freshman setter Zachary Hresko. The crowd proceeded to erupt in cheers, feeding off the team’s excitement and anticipation for a potential straight set victory.
“It was just fun,” Kostich said. “ It was a great way to finish.”
The first set involved more tension for the Crimson. An early 5-0 lead quickly vanished as NJIT came within two late in the set to make the the score 21-19. However, Harvard was able to close out the set with a final score of 25-21.
Saturday’s game marked six straight wins for the Crimson, after the team endured tough stretches earlier this season.
“Everyone’s fully invested,” Kostich said. “From freshman to seniors, they know that every practice we take extremely seriously. We work hard in the gym and off the court as well.”
Harvard is now playing with confidence, which can make it a dangerous team to face moving forward.
“It's been a mindset thing,” Moore said. “There are a lot of times we feel we’re not ready or that we don’t have it. This year the whole team is fully invested, and we know we can win this league. Everyone thinks that while we’re playing too.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
Earlier in the weekend, it took five sets to separate two Ivy rivals in a much tighter affair. Each team dominated consecutive sets with the Tigers entering the fifth set after two straight victories.
Princeton rode its momentum into this 5th set, building a 10-6 lead. The Crimson proceeded to take the next six out of seven, though, in a strong response. Harvard then went on to squeeze out the fifth set, 15-13.
The team was excited to leave the court with a victory, but was not happy about its inability to close out the contest after going up 2-0.
“I think it’s a thing you see in volleyball on and on again,” Kostich said. “ People mentally check out. They assume the third set is clutched and they stop playing. That happened to us, it just happened that we figured it out half-way through the fifth set. It wasn’t ideal, but a win is a win.”
The Crimson took the first two sets by a score of 25-15 and 25-21. Though it had the momentum, Princeton took the following sets 25-18 and 25-19, dominating in the blocks category.
“I think we got a little too comfortable,” Moore said. “ After winning the first two sets decisively, coming into the third we didn’t look ready to play. In the fourth they had a lot of momentum going, but we were able to rally together, bring a couple of great serves and kills and bring it back.”
The narrow victory on Friday showed both growth and ability that the team can rely on going forward.
“Last year we were 1-7 in five set matches” Moore said. “To able to go 2-0 [this year] and show some resilience, it was really cool.”

Entering Saturday’s matchup against No. 10 Cornell, the No. 19 Harvard men’s lacrosse team knew that if its defense could contain Jeff Teat, it stood a good chance of picking up a big road win. But limiting Teat, the Big Red’s star sophomore attackman who broke its freshman scoring record last season, is easier said than done.
The game hung in the balance for much of the first half, with the two teams trading goals in the second quarter. Teat’s strong play kept Cornell just a step ahead, as he scored or assisted on seven of his team’s eight goals in the half to stake the Big Red to 8-6 halftime lead.
After assisting on two more goals in the third quarter, Teat then scored his final goal with 12:51 remaining in the fourth, capping off a 4-0 run that put the game out of reach for the Crimson. By the time the dust settled, he had four goals and a career high eight assists, matching another career high with 12 total points.
Behind Teat’s strong play, Cornell (7-3, 3-1 Ivy) comfortably topped Harvard (7-3, 2-1 Ivy), 15-11, handing the visiting Crimson its first conference loss of the year. Harvard drops to the third spot in the conference, while the Big Red now sits second behind No. 3 Yale, which is still undefeated in the Ivy with a 4-0 record.
“We didn’t play our best game, by a long shot,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “Credit to Cornell, they played a very good game offensively, and really controlled things with their face-offs and time of possession.”
The Big Red certainly came out firing on Saturday, as a 4-0 run in the first quarter threatened to knock Harvard out of the game early on. Junior midfielder Jake McCulloch tallied two goals during the run, including the fourth with 2:30 remaining in the frame to push Cornell out to a 4-1 lead.
The Crimson responded well, however, scoring three unanswered goals to draw even midway through the second quarter. Two of the scores came in man-up opportunities, a positive for the Harvard all day as the team converted 5-of-7 total opportunities. But within minutes, the Big Red hit back with two goals of its own, taking a lead it would ultimately never relinquish.
Cornell’s play in the third quarter then broke the game open, as the home side collected nine ground balls to the Crimson’s two and dictated play throughout the 15 minutes. Sophomore face-off specialist Paul Rasimowicz won 3-of-4 face-offs in the period, part of a strong day overall in which he put up a 19-of-30 line at the X. Without the ball for much of the third, Harvard could only watch as the Big Red stretched its lead to 11-6.
“A frustrating part of the game for sure,” said Crimson captain and midfielder Sean Coleman. “We didn’t have the focus we needed for the whole 60 minutes, and they just wanted it on the ground more than us. That’s something we’re definitely going to look at and try to fix before next week’s game.”
On Harvard’s side, senior attackman Morgan Cheek once again put up a strong performance with two goals and three assists, while classmate Carney Mahon recorded his first hat trick. At the end of the day, however, it was not enough to keep up with a career day from Teat.
“He’s obviously a very good player with a great understanding of the game,” Coleman said. “We had a game plan for defending him heading in and we just didn’t execute it well enough. We could have limited the damage, and we really paid for not executing it.”
Teat’s performance put him at 65 points on the year, good for second in the nation behind Duke senior Justin Guterding, who has 68. Cheek is not far behind with 49 points, hovering near the top ten in the country.
The Crimson will need all it can get from Cheek and the other seniors on the team as they make the final pushes of their college career. The schedule certainly doesn’t get easier, as difficult road trips to Penn and Yale remain, along with a home tilt with Princeton.
“We’ve just got to continue doing what we do, making adjustments and having a good mentality,” Wojcik said. “Our guys will be focused when we get back on the field on Monday and we’ll fix what we need to fix before heading down to Penn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 This past weekend, the Crimson waves were bigger than the Big Red ones.
In a busy slate filled with competitive racing for all four of Harvard’s crews, the lightweight squad made an especially bold statement to begin its season. In temperatures bordering on nippy, the No. 4 ranked lightweight crew faced four ranked opponents over the weekend, coming to the line against No. 1 Cornell and No. 7 Penn on Saturday in Ithaca, N.Y., and No. 3 Columbia and No. 7 Georgetown on Sunday back home on the Charles River. Ultimately, the Crimson eased past all four opponents, including the Big Red, defending national champions and unbeaten in the dual season since 2016.
“With lightweight rowing, you never know what to expect going into the race, and this was our first debut in the league, so we just had trust within our training, with what we’re doing, going out and having the best race possible,” senior captain Andre Dupuis said. “We didn’t really know what to expect until we were in the race.”
The first varsity race on Saturday, stroked by junior David Wexner, was not a win by margins, as one would suspect when facing Cornell. The Crimson sped past both the Big Red and Quakers by more than nine seconds, finishing in 6:01.1 to Cornell’s 6:09.8 and Penn’s 6:16.4.
“We knew that Cornell was going to be very fast off the line and they were going to have a very aggressive race plan, so having a lot of confidence in ourselves as a boat, we decided that we were going to do the same thing,” said sophomore Hunter Wallace, who rowed in the first varsity eight. “We came off the line as fast as we could and saw that we were up a little bit. Fairly early in the race, we took a big push to really try to open up the margin between the Cornell boat, which was successful for us, and then the rest of the race was just finding a rhythm and making sure that we stayed as an aggressive pace, and in doing so, we were able to slowly make the margin bigger and bigger.
Harvard’s victory in this race was also echoed by wins in four other races, including 6:12.6 and 6:13.5 finishes in the second and third varsity races, stroked by junior Andrew Sterne and freshman Owen Niles respectively; both boats finished faster than Penn’s first varsity boat.
The lightweight crew carried the momentum of its victories in to Sunday against the Lions and Bulldogs. Unlike on Saturday, the first varsity boat battled with its opponents but eventually pulled away with a three second victory in 5:53.0 to Columbia’s 5:56.0 and Georgetown’s 6:06.5. Although the Lions captured the second varsity race by a second over the Harvard, the Crimson’s third varsity boat won its race 6:09.7.
Wallace said that the team made sure to bring the same intensity to their race on Sunday. He also stressed the importance of the team continuing to improve to match the progress of rival boats later in the season.
“The results of the racing this weekend were due to all the hard work our team has been putting in since the fall,” Wallace said. “So we’ve had a really good training plan laid out for us, and our team has really bought into what the coaches and the senior leadership have asked of us. We’ve really bought into the plan, and the results of this weekend were because we did all that starting in September.”
In other crew action over the weekend, the No. 13 Radcliffe heavyweight crew took to Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J. The team finished second in the morning in the Class of ‘75 Cup and third in the afternoon vying for the Class of ‘84 Plaque. Princeton rowed away with both events, winning every single race on the afternoon including 6:51.2 and 6:35.4 finishes in the first varsity events, beating the rest of the field by 10 and seven seconds respectively.
The No. 4 men’s heavyweight crew traveled to Providence, R.I., but fell to No. 6 Brown on the Seekonk River. The win gave the Bears the Stein Cup in a hotly contested first varsity race, in which the Brown’s 5:28.1 finish barely edged out the Crimson’s time of 5:29.9. Harvard did take the second, third, and fourth varsity races.
The No. 6 Radcliffe crew joined the heavyweights at Lake Carnegie to face off against No. 3 Princeton. The Tigers’ first varsity boat beat the Black and White’s by nearly 13 seconds enroute to a comfortable victory in 7:16.9. Radcliffe’s sole victory came in the third varsity eight.
The road ahead features many tough races for all four crews, opportunities to battle tough opponents and to shave off seconds. Dupuis’ sentiment moving forward embodies the continual effort for self-improvement.
“I think it’s pretty exciting,” Dupuis said. “I think we have some good, positive momentum going into the next few races. We never want to underestimate the other crews. We have some tough, tough races on the horizon, so we’re just taking it a race at a time, continuing to train hard throughout the coming weeks. We still have plenty of opportunities to prove ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard baseball has established itself as the “Bad Boys of the Ivy League,” perhaps the most fearsome team in the Ancient Eight is actually Crimson softball. Coach Jenny Allard’s squad (15-12, 8-4 Ivy) posted its second winning weekend in a row with a 2-1 series victory at Columbia (13-16, 6-6).
“This weekend was key because we were neck and neck with Columbia and knew that they would be a tough team to beat,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “So to come away winning the series really puts us in a good spot. It was also great to keep our momentum going from last weekend and we are really hitting our stride.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 1
A pair of dominant pitching performances and some clutch home runs late in the game powered Harvard to victory in the rubber match of the weekend series.
This game was initially a pitchers’ duel in which neither team got on the board until the fifth inning. Each team tacked on a run in the fifth, as Crimson co-captain and center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer knocked a sacrifice fly to center field and the Lions followed with a homer off the bat of junior Krystin Wong.
Harvard’s own power display was the key difference, however. In the top of the sixth, junior third baseman Erin Lockhart rocketed a line drive over the wall in left-center, and Rich provided the mirror image of Lockhart’s feat in the next inning, going deep to right-center on a line. Lockhart leads the team in long balls with four, while Rich is now one of five Crimson with two round-trippers.
“We knew what their pitchers were throwing and we knew what adjustments we had to make, so I think what really clicked toward the end of the game was executing those adjustments,” Rich said.
“Working the process enabled both Erin and Rhianna to put bat on ball and get two key monster hits,” junior Katie Duncan added.
Right-hander Sarah Smith rebounded nicely after conceding the home run to Wong. The junior retired nine of the next 10 batters en route to her third win of the season.
Sophomore Olivia Giaquinto earned the start in the circle, hurling 3.2 shutout innings. Smith came on in relief after Giaquinto had allowed two baserunners in a scoreless games in the bottom of the fourth. Smith escaped the jam and continued with three more innings of one-run ball. Combined, the pair of pitchers allowed just four hits and two walks on the afternoon.
COLUMBIA 6, HARVARD 1
Harvard’s lone loss of the weekend broke a four-game winning streak. The Crimson registered just three hits, all singles, in the defeat.
What was initially a close game became a blowout in the bottom of the fifth. Pairs of RBI singles and RBI doubles chased in five runs for Columbia. Harvard was unable to answer in its remaining chances at the plate, falling victim to a double play in the top of the sixth and being set down in order in the final frame.
The Crimson started off well, plating a run in the first inning. The top of the order set the table for senior right fielder Alexa Altchek, who dumped a single into right field to score co-captain and left fielder Maddy Kaplan from second base. The Lions quickly fought back, however, tying the game on a second-inning sacrifice fly before exploding for five runs in the fifth.
Smith impressed in the circle, starting the game and pitching the first three innings while only allowing one run. The junior now leads the pitching staff in ERA with a 2.65 mark.
Junior second baseman Meagan Lantz went two-for-three on stolen bases on the weekend, including a steal in this loss. Lantz is second in the Ivy League with 12 thefts.
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 4
While Harvard sandwiched a victory between two losses against Cornell, its reversed its fortunes against its most recent New York foe. And it did so in dramatic fashion.
After squandering a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the sixth, the Crimson faced a 4-2 deficit heading into its last chance at the plate.
“Columbia has some big power hitters so it was no surprise that they were hitting the ball hard and scoring runs,” Rich said. “We knew we had to keep scoring offensively regardless of that inning, but I do think it sparked us offensively to realize that we needed to get those runs back. It gave us a sense of urgency.”
Schiffhauer led off the inning with a two-base error. Back-to-back singles from Rich and Kaplan scored two runs to tie the game at four apiece.
Harvard’s momentum faltered, however, as Columbia pitcher Madison Canby settled down and retired the next two batters. With two outs, Altchek pulled a pitch down the left-field line to score Kaplan from second with the go-ahead run.
Because Harvard was the visitor, it still had to preserve its newfound lead in the bottom of the seventh. Starter Katie Duncan snapped right back from allowing four runs—just one of which was earned—in the previous inning. The junior set down the Lions in order with a groundout, a flyout, and a lineout. The Crimson’s triumph marked Duncan’s 10th win of the season.
“After Columbia got four runs I think we did a good job as a team staying confident and focusing in on each and every play, not trying to do too much and really focusing on what each and every one of us could do in any given situation,” Duncan said.
Kaplan extended her hitting streak to 13 games in the victory. Overall, the senior is hitting .427/.472/.549 with just four strikeouts and a team-leading mark of 23 runs batted in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As senior starting pitcher Noah Zavolas said, it’s nice to finally be able to sleep in your own bed for a weekend.
After 23 games on the road, the Harvard baseball team (12-14, 3-3 Ivy League) finally returned home last weekend, playing games at O’Donnell Field in Cambridge for the first time in 2018.
The home confines and a bleacher full of Crimson fans must have done good things for the players, as Harvard took a series from Penn for the first time since 2010.
The Crimson won two of three against the Quakers (8-17-1, 3-5-1), putting on both pitching and hitting clinics in Saturday’s doubleheader before narrowly missing out on the sweep on Sunday afternoon. These results bring Harvard to a 12-14 overall mark and a 3-3 Ivy record.
Zavolas was the lynchpin for Harvard in the series-opener, tossing 7.0 innings of one-run ball in a 5-2 win. The Crimson followed that up with an offensive explosion, putting up a couple of crooked numbers in a 14-5 nightcap triumph. The next day, Penn struck back in the series-closer, preventing a sweep by scrapping out a 6-5 victory.
“We always prep here during the fall, in the bubble in the winter, and being able to actually sleep in your own bed for a weekend is always a leg up,” Zavolas said.
Harvard won’t be back home again until April 21, when it takes on Brown in Ancient Eight action.
PENN 6, HARVARD 5
Baseball can become a game of responses, but for the Crimson on a bright and blustery Sunday afternoon, the late-inning response simply wasn’t there. The Quakers held on to a 6-5 victory after taking the decisive lead on a late 2-RBI single.
After taking a 2-0 lead on junior first baseman Patrick McColl’s two-run first-inning dinger, Harvard gave it away as Penn crossed the plate four times in the fourth. The Crimson immediately struck back, scoring three in the bottom half of the frame to reclaim a 5-4 lead.
Despite striking out the side, sophomore third baseman/pitcher Hunter Bigge allowed the Quakers’ decisive runs in the eighth. Bigge got the hard-luck loss after giving up two earned runs and striking out eight in 4.2 innings of relief.
Harvard was sloppy in the field, committing five errors on the day.
“Errors are going to happen,” Bigge said. “At the end of the day, if I located some pitches better, those [errors] wouldn’t have mattered that much. Errors are part of the game of baseball and we’re going to practice our fielding and get better.”
Junior center fielder Ben Skinner went 4-for-5 at the dish, upping his season average to .343. A constant threat on the bases, the leadoff man swiped his team-leading ninth stolen base of the season.
Sophomore shortstop Chad Minato and freshman outfielder Tommy Seidl both collected RBIs in the fourth, the latter driving in his first runs of his rookie season on a two-out, two-run single.
Freshman two-way player Buddy Hayward got the start on the mound and went 3.2 innings, giving up four earned runs while striking out five. The rookie, already garnering Ivy League attention, has a 5.76 ERA and is second on the team with a 10.08 K/9.
HARVARD 14, PENN 5
Scoring 14 times on just 12 hits, the Crimson cracked the nightcap of Saturday’s doubleheader open early, putting up eight runs in the second before piling on a five-spot in the fourth.
Crooked innings were common for Harvard all weekend. The runs came in bunches—the Crimson only posted a single one-run inning in the series.
“For us, hitting is really contagious,” Zavolas said. “When the top of the lineup, or even the middle or bottom of the lineup sets the table, then we can push them around, and it really helps us get going.”
Spotted a huge lead, junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson had no problem keeping the Quakers at bay, giving up one earned run in 5.2 innings of work. Three bullpen relievers helped solidify a 14-5 win.
Senior left fielder Austin Black led the offensive charge, knocking in a career-high five runs on two hits. Skinner once again continued to get on base, posting his first of two 4-of-5 games with a RBI and a run scored. Bigge, playing at the hot corner on defense, went 2-for-3 and hit the first home run of his career, a two-run shot to left that also scored Black.
“I saw a fastball inside…I was looking to get something to hit out over the plate, probably hit a sac fly out there, and luckily I got all of it,” Bigge said. “It felt good to kind of get into one.”
Designated hitter P.J. Robinson, after his heroics in the Beanpot semifinal against B.C., posted another big day, going 2-for-3 with two walks, three runs scored, three RBIs, and a solo shot late. Robinson’s slugging percentage has been slowly creeping up and now sits at a team-leading .478 on the year.
HARVARD 5, PENN 2
Harvard was especially efficient with its hitting in the series-opener, scoring five runs on just six hits and one walk. All five runs came in yet another crooked-number third inning in which 10 Crimson batters stepped to the plate.
With his team unable to get consistent scoring going, Zavolas put the team on his shoulders, throwing 76 of his 106 pitches for strikes in a seven-inning, scoreless performance that scattered seven hits and KO’d six Penn batsmen. Sophomore Kieran Shaw closed out the game with a six-out save to preserve the win.
“It felt really good, especially being able to come out here and pitch here at home for the first time in awhile,” Zavolas said. “It was nice because we can see the family and the home crowd as well.”
Zavolas now leads the Harvard squad with 39.0 innings of work and a 3-1 win-loss record as a starter.
Quakers senior lefty Gabe Kleiman worked a complete-game, six-hit, five-earned run effort, but still dropped the game to move to 0-5.
Bigge got the third-inning rally started with a leadoff single, which was followed by a Minato walk and a two-out McColl RBI single to score both runners.
Sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson, Robinson, senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg, and Black kept the merry-go-round going with five straight singles and walks. By the time Bigge came back up to fly out and end the inning, the Crimson had scored five in the blink of an eye to take a 5-1 lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a difficult start to the spring season at the Furman Invitational two weeks back, the Harvard Men’s golf swapped South Carolina for New Jersey, stumbling to a seventh-place finish at the Princeton Invitational, though the team’s performance did improve.
All Ivy rivals but Dartmouth travelled to North Jersey with Yale eventually grabbing the No. 1 spot on the second and final day of competition. The Bulldogs seem to be the Crimson’s greatest obstacle standing in the way of an unprecedented conference three-peat. Yale finished sixth at Furman, impressive given the nationally ranked powerhouses the team were competing against. Harvard finished 15th that weekend.
Penn finished as the runner-up, placing three strokes behind the Bulldogs, while Cornell and Princeton tied for fourth at +8. Harvard beat out Columbia and Brown (both +25), but will have to improve upon its score of +15 in the coming weeks.
The Crimson finished the first day of competition, moved to Friday from Saturday, in ninth. With inclement weather on the horizon, the tournament was changed to Friday and Saturday meaning that the players were denied the usual practice round. These circumstances, coupled with frigid temperatures, meant the first round would be crucial.
Penn got off to the hot start, shooting -1. Day two was another story however, with the Quakers shooting six over to slip behind a strong second half performance from Yale. The Crimson was able to climb up from ninth to seventh on the last day, and though the team is not thrilled with the weekend’s performance, the tournament did show a marked improvement from Furman.
In particular, freshman Grant Fairbairn shone among the crowd. The California native capped off an impressive weekend, moving up 17 spots after a strong round on Saturday where he shot -2. He would finish tied for fifth out of a total of 69 golfers, with an overall even score.
“I think the biggest part to the success I had this weekend was staying patient on the course,” Fairbairn said. “The course in general is pretty score-able, but it can be frustrating if birdies aren't coming. On Saturday I was hitting the ball really well, but dropped two shots early in the round. I hung in, regrouped, and kept trusting my process. After getting myself back to even par, I caught some good breaks and rolled with the momentum.”
Barring Fairbairn, the team performance was solid with room for improvement. However, there is little panic surrounding the team.
“This weekend we played at a much higher level than in South Carolina," junior Aurian Capart said. "We were focusing on our own games, rather than the score card. The guys did well this weekend."
With more practice, better scores are expected and this weekend served as a useful stepping stone for what is to come at the business end of the season, which is just two weeks away.
What is perhaps strange about the nature of the Ivy League is that the league championship is really where a season will be won or lost. What happens before that, though significant in terms of national ranking, is essentially preparation.
The real battle is 14 days away in Elverson, Pennsylvania where the Crimson will determine its season’s success. The team has the opportunity to make history, but it will only happen if Harvard is at its best.

Study breaks—the brief respite we get from the living hell that is Harvard mid-week. Don’t get us wrong, we love our proctors, PAFs, and tutors, but “Quaker Oats Rager!!” study breaks just aren’t what the people want. It's the end of the semester, and they're probably just running really low on cute ideas, which they all wasted in the first few weeks when they were trying to impress you. Luckily, Flyby has a few ideas for kick-butt study breaks that’ll make everyone in your entryway (except for that one kid who’s always high-strung because he’s in HCCG) happy!
Burn Book(s) Study Break
Angry about a grade on an exam? Quiz? Homework Assignment? Furious over your TF? Section Leader? Professor? Host a fun study break in the great outdoors by making a bonfire and burning the textbooks of all those classes you hate when the semester’s over! At the same time, upgrade scrapbooking by creating a Burn Book (Mean Girls-style) with all the dirty, awful things you think about your professors and TFs.
Nap Time Study Break
Calling sleep-deprived Harvard students: have your PAF’s bust out the pillows and blankets and let your entryway catch some zzzs. Just be sure to wake them up to finish that essay they haven’t started.
Potluck Study Break
Get the whole entryway involved in this study break! By having everyone bring their own special food and drink to share, you can create a beautiful assortment of half-eaten Dorito bags and Cheez-it boxes, as well as whatever obscure, crappy seltzer bottles have been hiding underneath the bed of your entryway-mates for the past few weeks. Enjoy!
Kumbaya Study Break
Whenever you go home for break, some of your odd relatives may warn you of indoctrination screaming, “Those liberals at Harvard! All they do is sit around and sing kumbaya! They know nothing!”
Prove them right.
Meryl Streep Study Break
If you don’t love Meryl Streep get the f off my article.
Titanic-themed Study Break
Going to Harvard is basically the equivalent of drowning in a cold, harsh, unforgiving environment that will swallow you up if you let it, so you might as well have a study break commemorating that.
“Lookin’ Like a Snack” Study Break
Tell everyone (and I mean everyone) to break out their sexiest outfits for the study break to end all study breaks. S&M M&Ms, Three-way Musketeers, Butterfingers, and, for the more vanilla crowd, Hershey’s Kisses. Need I say more?
