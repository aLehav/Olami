After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 6, voters will flock to the polls to determine the future of transgender rights in Massachusetts. Ballot Question 3 asks voters whether they are in favor of state-level anti-discrimination legislation that allows transgender people to exist freely in public spaces. Should this law be repealed with a “No” vote, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals will return to living in a greater state of limbo. The repeal of this legislation will trigger cascading effects including transgender people’s abilities to safely access gendered facilities.
Simply put, this is a civil rights issue. That this question even will appear on the ballot speaks volumes about the extent to which we are willing to forego the rights of our community members to protect our misinformed sense of comfort. The initiative to vote no on 3 is another example of leveraging scare tactics to deny the rights of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. As Massachusetts will likely set precedent other states will look to, the onus is on Massachusetts voters to uphold the civil liberties of transgender individuals.
Opponents to the legislation cite the ability for cisgender men to abuse the law’s protections to enter women’s restrooms and sexually harass women. No on 3 advocacy group Keep MA Safe’s rhetoric and ad campaign prey on this type of fear-mongering in hopes of advancing its agenda. This narrative, however, is based on lies. In cities and states that have implemented nondiscrimination laws, police departments have reported no increase in public safety altercations. Therefore, we must not conflate transgender protections to endangering cisgender women; the two are not correlated. We should not vote as if they are.
Further, legislation that protects the lives of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals is a necessity. Violence against transgender people is on the rise, especially for transgender women of color. Repealing this legislation only perpetuates this violence by denying the humanity of transgender individuals. The transgender community should not to justify its existence to the voters. True allyship exists in stepping up and fighting for the rights of communities that are underrepresented and under scrutiny for merely living. The fight for BGLTQ equality is far from over — we call on everyone, and particularly cisgender queer people and people who adopt the title of “feminist.” to stand up against hate towards the transgender community. Liberation for one is inherently linked to liberation for all.
Due to how Massachusetts conducts referenda, a yes vote will maintain the current legislation that ensures protections for transgender individuals, while a No vote will strip it away. We urge voters to select the former. The stakes for Question 3 could not be higher, and voters must take a stand for transgender rights.
Ultimately, we, the people, have the opportunity to support the existing legislation. President Donald Trump’s administration’s attempt to forego science and redefine gender as immutable underscores the importance of voicing our support for the transgender community. Transgender identities should not be a matter of debate. Question 3 attempts to politicize their experiences, and we must unequivocally condemn this behavior.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sep. 6, 1972, Munich Olympic Games correspondent James K. “Jim” McKay looked at the television camera and solemnly pronounced, “Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight.” All 11 Israeli Olympic athletes who were kidnapped by Black September, a Palestinian terrorist organization, had been confirmed killed.
I have thought of that moment frequently during the last few days.
The parallels to the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh are striking. Eleven people died in both attacks. Equally poignantly, both attacks yielded victims who had themselves lived through the era of the Holocaust.
Perhaps most importantly, both were culminations of hateful rhetoric gone unchecked. Anyone monitoring the rhetoric of Palestinian militants and their German Nazi allies, or of the Pittsburgh shooter (whose name deserves no further mention), knows that they were steeped in virulent anti-Semitism.
In response to these events and other incidents of hate around the country, the time has come for Harvard University to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism.
The regulation and constriction of hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric is not a merely an academic issue. Hate speech has real consequences, and finding a solution for the metastasizing trend of anti-Semitic rhetoric toward Jewish people and Jewish institutions in the United States and abroad has become vital.
Anti-Semitism is on the march in the Western world. Just this week, an executive at Campbell’s Soup was ushered out for tweeting that Jewish philanthropist George Soros was responsible for the large group of refugees currently traveling to America’s southern border. This was not an isolated incident. The seeds of this conspiracy — that Jews seek to centralize money and power to undermine Western civilization — harken back to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a famous anti-Semitic text, and before.
The omnipresence of this problem today is not unique to the US nor to the right wing. For example, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party has openly defended anti-Semites and has made many anti-Semitic statements himself. He even laid a wreath at a memorial for members of Black September, the very same organization behind the Munich attacks.
How do we shape the rhetoric of our community to be inclusive and safe for all its members? Writing in 1982, former University President Derek C. Bok noted that, “At a time of such dissatisfaction and concern over the level of ethical behavior in the society… educational institutions [should] consider how they might use their strategic position to encourage students to think more deeply about ethical issues and strengthen their power of moral reasoning.”
For students to contemplate ethics, they must feel safe on their campus, and that their serious moral inquiries will not be derailed by fanaticism and hate. As hate speech permeates our national conversation, leading universities have the opportunity to stand up as a bulwark against terrorizing rhetoric.
The Harvard community came together on Sunday evening to honor the memories of the eleven people who were murdered in Pittsburgh, and to give solace to those who fear the spreading divisiveness and hate in our country. University President Lawrence S. Bacow spoke eloquently: “We can do more than simply comfort each other,” he said. “We can vote for those who would bring us together as opposed to those who would divide us.”
President Bacow is correct, but voting is not enough. Punching a ballot annually is insufficient. We must start with common-sense policies right here in our very own university. We must define anti-Semitism.
I offer the definition put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”
While Harvard would be the first nationally-regarded university to adopt such a resolution, it would be far from the first public entity to take such a step. Among many international bodies, it is the definition used by the State Department.
In 2016, the University of California published a document called “The Statement of Principles Against Intolerance,” in which it noted that, “Anti-Semitism, anti-semitic forms of anti-Zionism and other forms of discrimination have no place at the University of California.” Harvard should take a similar step.
Jewish congregations customarily split the old testament into weekly portions to be read on the Sabbath. This week’s Torah portion begins with Abraham wishing to bury the matriarch Sarah in a place of honor. He refuses a gifted burial plot, insisting on paying for the land he wishes to use. If he pays for the land, then it is his, the logic goes. Then he can guarantee that it is cared for properly.
This is the story that will be read next Saturday in synagogues across the world, including in the shell-shocked Jewish community of Pittsburgh. It is a story about the value of taking ownership of the community you wish to build, and the legacy you wish to leave behind, rather than merely deferring to the status quo.
In the spirit of Abraham, we must resist the urge to simply accept our reality. We must work to ensure that the University community we call home today, and the communities we call home in the future, are truly our own. To ensure the safety of our friends and family members, we must demand that all hate speech, including hateful anti-Semitic rhetoric, be recognized for what it is and condemned.
Jews and good people around the world mourned the victims in the aftermath of both the Munich massacre and the Pittsburgh shooting. But our next step matters. We must rise to prevent these tragedies from repeating. Our first step should be to adopt a clear definition of anti-Semitism for the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A memo leaked last week to the New York Times states that the Department of Health and Human Services wants to create a legal definition of sex under Title IX as “a person’s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.” This new biological definition of sex erases the existence of the over 1.4 million transgender people in America whose gender does not normatively align with the sex they were assigned at birth.
The potential repercussions for the implementation of this memo are devastating. According to CNN, “such a definition could exclude transgender people from existing federal civil rights protections in education, employment and access to health care.”
This memo is not an isolated move to deny trans Americans their rights. For over a year and a half now, the Trump administration has worked relentlessly to roll back civil rights protections for trans people. Examples include in February 2017 when the Departments of Justice and Education withdrew 2016 guidance on how schools must protect trans students under Title IX, in Dec. 2017, when staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were told to avoid use of the word “transgender” in official documents, in March 2018, when the Trump administration declared a ban on trans people serving in the military, and in May 2018, when the Department of Justice announced an official policy of placing trans people in federal prisons that match their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender.
Trans rights are being threatened not just on a federal level, but on the state level as well. For Massachusetts’ 2018 midterm elections, there’s a question on the ballot to repeal a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accomodations. A "Yes" on Question 3 would keep the law in place while a "No" vote would repeal it.
I urge all registered voters in Massachusetts to make their voices heard and vote Yes to protect trans Americans from discrimination.
Opponents to this anti-discrimination law often cite fears of increased sexual harassment and assault in bathrooms by men pretending to be women. However, the Williams Institute, a UCLA Law School think tank specializing in sexual orientation and gender identity, found no link between the 2016 passage of the Massachusetts nondiscrimination public accommodations law and the “number or frequency of criminal incidents in restrooms, locker rooms or changing rooms.” Over 300 of the nation’s leading sexual assault and domestic violence prevention organizations released a statement in support of nondiscrimination laws that allow trans people to use the restroom that matches their gender. In the statement, these organizations explained that trans people already face high rates of sexual assault, and that laws forcing them into public spaces that do not match their gender will only exacerbate this and make an already vulnerable population even more susceptible to assault. Thus, the claim that discriminating against trans people will make our communities safer is nothing more than fear-mongering to excuse hate.
For those of us who can vote in Massachusetts, show your support for trans Americans by voting yes on 3 on Nov. 6. Beyond voting, you can get involved through volunteering your time and donating your money to the Yes on 3 campaign. See which canvassing and phone bank events are happening near you. There are multiple events happening in Cambridge, such as the GOTV from Nov. 3 to 6, and the Public Education Phone Banks on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.
Even after election day, there are ways ways you can get involved to protect the rights of trans Americans. Organizations like the National Center for Transgender Equality, Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, Trans Women of Color Collective, Trans Lifeline, Trans Student Educational Resources, Sylvia Rivera Law Project, Gender Spectrum, and Transgender Law Center advocate for trans people. They are all accepting donations, some are looking for volunteers, and others have specific actions outlined on their websites that supporters can follow.
In this political climate, trans rights are under constant attack. The leaked memo and ballot question on trans nondiscrimination are just two examples in a long line of discriminatory policies that deny trans people the right to exist. We must be vigilant today, tomorrow, on Nov. 6, and every day to help defend trans existence. Whatever resources you have, whether that be access to voting, money, time, emotional energy, or anything else, use them to further trans equality and thriving.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ninety percent of Harvard Kennedy School students are registered on the voting platform TurboVote, the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation announced last week.
The high voter registration comes as the Kennedy School has been pushing a new University-wide initiative, dubbed the Harvard Votes Challenge. Created by Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20 and Derek Paulhus ’19, the Harvard Votes Challenge is a student-run initiative aimed at increasing voter and civic engagement across the University. With a coalition leader at each of the schools, the program is able to reach undergraduate and graduate students alike.
“We came together because we saw a really awesome movement happening around the country where youth were getting more involved, and they seemed to actually be making a difference,” Landis said. “We saw polling numbers come out of the IOP which showed youth were more excited about this upcoming midterm than they had been about previous midterms.”
The Institute of Politics released new survey results from their biannual national youth poll on Monday that found 40 percent of surveyed respondents indicated that they were likely to vote in the midterm elections next week.
At Harvard, each school provides various avenues for students to register to vote. In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, undergraduates at the College can register to vote using the TurboVote platform during the annual check-in process at the start of the semester.
Participating in TurboVote, though, is not the same as actually registering to vote. Students who participate in TurboVote must still send their completed voter registration form after it arrives in the mail.
Landis said the Kennedy School has relied on connections among students themselves, fostered by the small sizes of cohorts, to encourage voting.
“There are about 500 students who are eligible to vote at the Kennedy School, so it’s a much smaller cohort than we have at the College,” Landis said.
Though specific voter turnout rates for eligible HKS students have not been calculated before, there are unique challenges to voting as a Kennedy School student that may contribute to a low turnout. Kathryn A. Sikkink, a professor of human rights policy and a faculty cosponsor for the Harvard Votes Challenge, said one challenge for registering Kennedy School students to vote is that they only participate in degree programs for one or two years.
“On one hand they’re more interested, and on the other hand it’s more difficult because they’re here for such a short time,” Sikkink said. “If they need to switch their registration, they have added burden.”
Teresa Acuña, an associate director at the Ash Center, said the Harvard Votes initiative at the Kennedy School focused on “the institutional buy-in around the culture of voting.”
For previous elections, work encouraging voter turnout was largely relegated to HKS student groups like the Republican Caucus or Democratic Caucus. This year, Acuña said new students completing registration checklists were asked if they would like to register to vote through TurboVote. Voting reminders were also included on the financial aid website and the admissions blog, she said.
This fall, many people across the University — from its top brass to student groups — have made a concerted push to encourage voting in the midterm elections. In his address to newly minted freshmen at the College, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said registering to vote was the students’ first “homework assignment.”
Sikkink said she hoped civic engagement would increase at Harvard in the near future. Only 23.6 percent of Harvard students University-wide voted in the 2014 midterm elections, so Sikkink said the 90 percent registration statistic is something to be optimistic about.
“It would be really exciting to see a Harvard student voter turnout that surpassed our turnout in the presidential election,” she said.

On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of protestors gathered near Boston City Hall Plaza to rally for transgender rights in Massachusetts.
The event was organized by the Yes on 3 Coalition, which is supported by a number of transgender rights activist groups, national businesses, and local government leaders.
The rally was organized following a New York Times report on a Trump administration memo that argued in favor of defining gender solely on the basis of genitalia at birth.
Throughout the rally, local community members, including Jackie Rae — a 20-year-old songwriter from Virginia and a Berklee College of Music student — performed music sets and poetry.
As rally attendees listened to musicians and speakers, around 10 counter-protesters from the local chapter of the right-wing organization Resist Marxism made an appearance at the nearby Government Center station, holding a large banner with a crossed-out swastika.
Resist Marxism, a far-right group founded in 2017 by Kyle Chapman, bills itself as an organization that “defends the Constitution against violent extremists and the Regressive Left.” The Boston chapter of Resist Marxism previously organized the “Defend the 2nd Amendment rally,” held in Boston on March 24.
Amid rally attendees’ chants of “Nazis go home! Trans rights now!” (above), members of Resist Marxism asserted that they are not “Nazis.” Organizers said that they were there to express support for President Donald Trump and oppose legislation that would allow people to use the restroom corresponding to their gender identity (below).
As tensions flared, members of the Boston Police department and several rally organizers formed a barricade around the Resist Marxism members to separate the crowds.
This didn’t prevent transgender rights activists and Resist Marxism members from exchanging obscenities across the barrier.
As the two groups clashed, the rest of the rally continued. Eventually, both groups dispersed, and organizers called for the attendees to vote yes on Question Three of Massachusetts’ voting ballot. The proposal would maintain federally mandated protections for transgender people in public. Attendees also called for the Bureau of Prisons in the U.S. Department of Justice to assign prisoners to facilities in line with their self-identified gender, for transgender people to be allowed to serve in the military and all forms of public service, and for the Department of Education to protect transgender students from discrimination through its Title IX authority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
State-specific voting procedures, missing ballots, and voter identification policies are plaguing some undergraduates hoping to vote absentee in the Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Of approximately 100 undergraduates interviewed by The Crimson, about 10 students said they faced hurdles when attempting to vote absentee.
The United States' election system "presents a lot of challenges because every single state does voting differently,” said Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20, co-founder of the Harvard Votes Challenge, a campus initiative to maximize student turnout at the polls.
“So in a place like Harvard, where it’s extraordinarily diverse and students come from all over the country, students have to grapple with the fact that every single student may have a different procedure,” Landis said.
Cory A. Ransom ’19 said she encountered additional paperwork when trying to cast a ballot in her hometown district in New Jersey. Ransom attributed her frustration to a recently passed voting measure, which requires that voters who received mail-in ballots in the 2016 election continue to receive them at the same location unless they opt out.
Ransom said her local officials directed her to a form she had already completed.
“It was super frustrating and extra taxing,” she said.
Other students struggled to even receive their ballots at their College addresses. Sarah N. King ’21 said her ballot was sent to her home in Florida instead of Cambridge. King said that while her local election commissioner reassured her that the ballot was sent to both her Florida and College addresses, she has yet to find a ballot in her Harvard mailbox.
Madison L. Fabber ’22, who is from Tennessee, encountered administrative obstacles after trying to request her ballot online this fall.
Fabber said she was told by her local county election commission that, in lieu of registering to vote in person, she could have the Cambridge Election Commission fax her driver’s license to them to verify her identity. She made this request at the Cambridge Election Commission and encountered confused employees.
“They were like, ‘We’ve never had to do this before,’” Fabber said. “You have to jump through hoops because it seemed like they really didn’t want you to vote absentee. I don’t know. It just seems kind of like voter disenfranchisement. Like a wild goose chase.”
Maya L. Grimes ’19, said she thought Georgia’s requirement for “adequate postage” on mail-in ballots was unclear.
“The postage requirements are pretty ambiguous,” Grimes said.
Harvard has witnessed several efforts in recent years to help students facing such problems procure student absentee ballots. In 2016, the Registrar’s Office and Institute of Politics partnered with TurboVote, a program designed to streamline the voter registration process. The Harvard Votes Challenge began this fall.
Landis urged students struggling to procure absentee ballots to contact their election office.
“Most students, once they've [voted] once, they usually recognize that this [voting] isn't so bad, and they're able to do it the next time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least one high-profile paper authored by a former Harvard Medical School professor has been formally retracted and a federally funded clinical trial put on hold after the School publicly called for the retraction of 31 of the researcher’s papers two weeks ago.
The professor, Piero Anversa, held a joint appointment between the Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital before his departure in December 2015.
Anversa’s research on cardiac stem cells has been the subject of controversy for over a decade. After other researchers struggled to replicate his claim that it was possible to regenerate cardiac muscle cells in adults, the University and the Hospital opened a formal investigation into his laboratory’s work in 2014, ultimately concluding that several of his publications contained “falsified and/or fabricated data.” Last April, Brigham and Women’s agreed to pay $10 million to settle fraud allegations filed by the Department of Justice over Anversa’s federally funded work.
The paper — in which members of Anversa’s laboratory claimed to have discovered stem cells in human lung tissue — was retracted by the New England Journal of Medicine on Oct. 19. The journal’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey M. Drazen, wrote in the retraction notice that several of Anversa’s co-authors had contacted the journal to ask for the move after Harvard and Brigham and Women’s investigation concluded data presented in the paper had been manipulated.
The journal also issued an “expression of concern” for two more of Anversa’s papers, noting “evidence consistent with fabrication of data and image manipulation.”
The retractions prompted the National Institutes of Health to pause an ongoing heart study based on Anversa’s work, known as CONCERT-HF.
“Recent calls for the retraction of journal articles in related fields of cell therapy research have raised concerns about the scientific foundations of this trial,” the research agency wrote in a statement Monday.
The CONCERT-HF trial is sponsored by the University of Texas Health Center in Houston, according to a federal database. It is based at several medical centers across the country.
Lemuel A. Moye, the University of Texas professor leading the trial, could not be reached for comment.
The latest retractions are not the first ones issued for Anversa’s research: in 2014, as allegations of research misconduct surfaced, the journal Circulation retracted one of his papers, and The Lancet issued an “expression of concern” about another.
Anversa has denied responsibility for the manipulated data in his studies. In a statement to the New York Times, lawyers for Anversa and Annarosa Leri, who worked in the former’s laboratory, wrote that another lab member was at fault.
“Neither Dr. Anversa nor Dr. Leri ever altered or changed images or data at any time,” the statement read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Tuesday morning reception, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 celebrated this year’s recipients of the high-profile Yidan Prize, Northwestern Statistics and Education Professor Larry V. Hedges and MIT Engineering and Computer Science Professor Anant Agarwal, who co-founded and serves as CEO of edX.
The Yidan Prize, founded by Chinese billionaire and Tencent co-founder Charles Chen Yidan in 2016, consists of two $3.9 million awards given annually for excellence in education research and education development.
At the nearly three hour long press event, which was held at the Cambridge Courtyard Marriott Hotel ballroom, Agarwal and Hedges spoke about their work and plans for the future. MIT President L. Rafael Reif and MIT Computer Science Professor Victor Zue also spoke at the event attended primarily by journalists, some of whom came from as far as Argentina, Colombia, Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain.
In a presentation at the event, Hedges discussed his work as a statistician working with meta-analysis to develop new approaches and solutions to educational problems.
“I saw the value of developing more rigorous methods for synthesizing research results across studies, and these methods led to the development of a small branch of statistics that’s usually called meta-analysis,” Hedges said.
“It shifted attention from single studies, you know the dramatic single study, to the idea that we should look at the entire corpus of relevant [research].” he said.
During his remarks, Agarwal talked about edX’s mission and the impact he sees it having on the future of education.
“Our goal at edX is to see whether we can put the true meaning to the word education as a human right where everyone has access to it like the air we breath,” he said. “Our mission is to use digital technology to see if we can enable education, a high quality education, for everyone everywhere.”
When asked later what he plans to do with the roughly $1.9 million research grant that comes with the prize, Agarwal said that he wants to expand access to affordable undergraduate education.
“We are looking to launch a micro-bachelors program, which are modular programs at the undergraduate level, which will enable us to truly transform education all over the world, increasing affordable access in countries like the U.S., increasing quality access and simply access to education in the developing world,” he said.
Garber’s remarks, which closed the event, focused on his relationship with Agarwal, who worked with Harvard to develop edX, a virtual education platform, in 2012.
“When Harvard and MIT began meeting to think about creating edX, we always had in mind that Anant would be the person to take edX forward,” Garber said. “In every way, Anant has rewarded our faith in him. ”
The Yidan Prizes will be officially awarded at a ceremony in Hong Kong on Dec. 9. Past winners of the prize include Stanford Psychology Professor Carol S. Dweck and Colombian sociologist Vicky Colbert, who founded and directs the educational organization Fundación Escuela Nueva.
Correction: Oct. 31, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Yidan Prizes will be officially awarded at a ceremony in Hong Kong on Dec. 10. In fact, the prizes will be awarded at a ceremony held Dec. 9.

Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai will receive the Harvard Kennedy School’s 2018 Gleitsman Award, the school announced Tuesday.
According to a press release, the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership bestows the annual Gleitsman Award to “an individual or team whose leadership in social action has improved quality of life.”
Yousafzai has been an advocate for girls’ education ever since the Taliban attempted to assassinate her at age 15 in retaliation for a critical blog she wrote about living in Taliban-controlled Pakistan. Shortly after this attempt on her life, Yousafzai founded a non-profit called the Malala Fund, which supports girls’ education, with her father.
In 2014, at age 17, she became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting education for girls across the world. She is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize, following the 1979 physics laureate Abdus Salam.
“Malala speaks powerfully to the strength and perseverance of women and girls who are oppressed,” David R. Gergen, the director of the Center for Public Leadership, said in the release. “Her remarkable story has inspired girls — and boys as well — to follow in her footsteps and has activated a generation of practitioners and legislators who are fighting for equality in their own communities.”
The award is named for Alan L. Gleitsman, a former entrepreneur, philanthropist, and major donor to the Center for Public Leadership. In 2007, Gleitsman gave HKS $20 million to endow the Gleitsman Program in Leadership for Social Change at the school to train students in social entrepreneurship and activism.
“Alan Gleitsman, whose philanthropy made this award possible, believed in individuals whose vision inspired others to confront injustice,” Gergen said in the release. “He was an ardent supporter of Harvard Kennedy School’s efforts to cultivate the world’s youngest changemakers and would be so pleased by today’s announcement.”
Yousafzai will receive the award and the $125,000 prize at a ceremony on Dec. 6 at the Kennedy School. According to the release, the ceremony will also include a conversation with Yousafzai moderated by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha J. Power, who is a professor of global leadership and public policy at HKS.
This award is not Yousafzai’s first from Harvard. She received the Harvard Foundation’s Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award in September 2013. The Foundation gives the humanitarian award annually in honor of the life and work of Reverend Peter J. Gomes, the longtime Memorial Church minister who died in 2011.
Previous winners of the Gleitsman Award include former South African president Nelson Mandela, U.S. Representative and civil rights leader John Lewis, and women’s rights activist Gloria Steinem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent twin emails Tuesday afternoon announcing that Dudley House — which currently serves both graduate students and undergraduates — will split those functions beginning in July.
Administrators plan to separate Harvard’s “13th House” into two distinct organizations, per Khurana’s email. One — dubbed the “Dudley Community” — will serve undergraduates living outside the 12 upperclassman residential Houses, College students living in the Dudley Co-Op, visiting students, and students living on campus during the summer. The other will serve GSAS students.
Graduate students have been involved with Dudley House since 1991. Their inclusion stemmed from a period of activism in the late 1980s; at the time, graduate students led by Garth O. McCavana — the current GSAS dean of student affairs and then-Graduate Student Council vice president — successfully pushed for a dedicated building, cafe, and library. Bearing pins that read “A Place of Our Own,” they eventually staked their claim to Lehman Hall in the southwest corner of Harvard Yard.
Tuesday’s announcement furthers that goal. Beginning this summer, Lehman Hall will be converted into a student center dedicated solely to GSAS students — not, as before, to both GSAS and College students. Khurana wrote in his message that GSAS plans to establish a separate intramural sports league for grad students, among a series of other changes aimed at improving graduate student life in Dudley.
In the past, some masters and doctoral students have complained their time at Harvard is marred by loneliness. In her message to GSAS affiliates, Dench wrote she hopes the change will further grad students’ ability to build community outside their degree program.
“Since Dudley House broadened its mission to include GSAS students in 1991, thousands of students have benefited from intellectual and social activities organized by their peers,” she added in an emailed statement. “We now have the opportunity to enhance these opportunities, enabling our students to make life outside the library or lab a priority.”
In addition to the break between GSAS and the College, Khurana and Dench announced they plan to update the two groups’ advising systems. Current Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen Hogle announced earlier this year they plan to step down in 2019 — a move Dench wrote prompted GSAS and College administrators to consider changes to the House’s structure.
GSAS plans to begin searching for an administrative director to oversee the revamped House. Dench wrote she plans to solicit student feedback to inform the search, both from the current Graduate Student Council leadership and grad students more broadly.
The Dudley Community, which will only serve undergraduates, will no longer have a faculty dean. Instead, College administrators will appoint a “faculty fellow” to advise them.
Correction: Oct. 31, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Garth O. McCavana served as Graduate Student Council president. In fact, he served as vice president.
Clarification: Oct. 31, 2018
A previous headline accompanying this article stated that Dudley House had "kicked out" undergraduates. To clarify, though undergraduates will no longer be alloted space in Lehman Hall (the physical location of Dudley House in Harvard Yard), they will still be affiliated with the House. The headline has been updated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow may not be sitting in court as Harvard defends its race-conscious admissions policies, but he receives updates about trial proceedings each day, he said in an interview Tuesday — and he remains confident the University will win at trial's end.
Bacow said his “daily summary” comes from University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83, who has sat in on court proceedings on a near-daily basis as the trial in the high-profile lawsuit enters its third week of litigation.
The suit, brought by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, charges that the College rejects deserving Asian-American applicants in favor of less qualified applicants of other races. Harvard has repeatedly and unequivocally denied all allegations of discrimination.
In a September interview before the trial kicked off, Bacow asserted he believed Harvard would prevail in district court, though he did not discuss what might happen after trial judge Allison D. Burroughs delivers her ruling. He reiterated that message Tuesday.
“One should never predict if you’re winning or losing at any moment in the trial. For example, I don’t know what went on today, but I’m still confident that we will win in the trial court because I think we have the law on our side, we have the facts on our side, and that is a good place to start,” he said.
No matter how the trial ends, experts have said the disappointed party is likely to appeal — and that a cascading series of appeals could bring the case before the Supreme Court. If it reaches the nation's highest and newly conservative court, things probably won't go Harvard's way — possibly ushering in the end of affirmative action in the United States.
The trial, which began on Oct. 15, has revealed a number of previously little-known facts about Harvard admissions — including how the school favors applicants linked to top donors or alumni. Asked whether he has ever stepped in to give a boost to any particular candidate, Bacow made clear Tuesday that neither he nor any of his predecessors have ever intervened in the College’s admissions process.
“There is a Chinese wall between the president’s office and admissions,” Bacow said. “If you intervene once, everybody will think that you are the functional Dean of Admissions at Harvard and I have a hard enough job without trying to do that.”
Bacow also said he he does not know what percentage of Harvard’s annual haul of donations come from people whose children have applied to the school.
“I honestly don’t know the answer to that and, even if I did, I probably couldn’t say it right now given that the case is in trial,” Bacow said.
Bacow added, however, that Harvard admissions officers considers many aspects of a candidate’s background, including possible connections to the University. He insisted that all admitted high schoolers are qualified to take a spot at the College.
“We do pay attention, as the case has demonstrated, to students whose families have had deep ties to Harvard as well,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean we accept anybody who we think is — we don’t accept anybody that we think is not worthy of admission to Harvard.”
Bacow held true to an earlier vow that he would refrain from commenting on the intricacies of the trial while the case remains in litigation. He noted on Tuesday that there are "limits" to what he can say about the lawsuit.
He declined to answer questions asking whether he thinks the College’s current admissions process makes sense as it stands or whether legacy students should receive more or less of a boost.
He also did not answer a question asking whether he has received any complaints following recent revelations detailing how donations can influence the admissions proces.
And he declined to answer a question asking whether Harvard should strive to make its student body better reflect the socioeconomic makeup of the United States. In his court testimony last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana admitted Harvard skews wealthy — and said he is okay with that.
Bacow acknowledged that, as a “factual matter,” Harvard's socioeconomic makeup does not match that of the nation, but said: “Rare is the college comparable to ours where it does.”
Bacow also spoke about the College’s “generous” financial aid program, which provides full financial aid to all families who make under $65,000 in annual income. Roughly 20 percent of Harvard enrollees pay nothing toward the cost of tuition.
“We’ve worked really hard at Harvard to make this place affordable to students regardless of the ability of their families to pay. For one in five students who come to Harvard, their families pay nothing as a result of the financial aid initiative,” Bacow said. “It’s important to us that any student who gets into Harvard can come here regardless of their financial circumstances.”
A week before the trial began, Bacow sent an email to students and alumni warning that the trial could forge rifts among Harvard affiliates and declared he respects “diversity of opinion” surrounding the case.
Bacow said the school’s Academic Council — a body consisting of deans, vice presidents, and members of the Provost’s office — has discussed how to maintain “civil discourse” about the lawsuit across campus.
“As I said in my message to the community, we were a community before the trial occurred. We’re going to be a community after this trial is over. What kind of community depends upon how we treat each other,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though former University President Drew G. Faust has yet to come to Harvard’s defense in the ongoing admissions trial, another former Ivy League president took the stand Tuesday to argue in favor of giving preferential treatment to wealthy and well-connected applicants in the admissions process.
Ruth J. Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University and the former president of Brown University, defended Harvard’s practice of giving “tips” — meaning an extra boost — to legacies, students linked to top donors, children of faculty and staff, and both recruited and non-recruited athletes.
Simmons said alumni of elite universities can have a strong positive impact on their institutions, making it “important” to give an extra nudge to legacy applicants. At Harvard, the legacy admit rate is five times that seen by non-legacies.
“It is entirely appropriate for them to believe that it would be wonderful if their children could also enjoy the same benefits that they enjoyed as students,” Simmons said of alumni of Ivy League institutions. “We’ve been made stronger by benefit of that [alumni] involvement... one way for us to signal how important that is to us is that we consider their children in the context of our admissions process.”
Under cross-examination, Simmons conceded that she believed fewer people would donate to Harvard if the school eliminated its legacy preference.
Simmons insisted, however, that an applicant who is not qualified would “never” be admitted simply because of his or her legacy status, noting it would be “highly unethical to admit students who you don’t believe will thrive.”
Nonetheless, an email exchange between Harvard administrators presented in court on Oct. 19 seems to suggest less-qualified legacy applicants sometimes do make it to Cambridge. In one of the emails, Harvard's director of admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70 described an applicant — whom she identified as a black legacy — as a “terrible case,” admitted “entirely for contingent reasons.”
Harvard lawyer Seth P. Waxman ’73 also questioned Simmons about the tip given to the children of donors. Internal emails filed in court show that Harvard favors those who fund it; in one case, an admit’s relations seemed to promise to fund a new building around the same time the high schooler won a spot at the College.
Simmons defended the practice, saying that donor gifts and support allow private institutions to “not just survive, but become stronger in every era.”
Simmons said that unqualified applicants are “never ever” admitted because of a large donation and that such a practice would be “completely inappropriate.”
While Harvard’s admission of legacies and the children of donors has drawn scrutiny during the trial, directly at stake is its race-conscious admissions policies — anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions charges that the University discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
Simmons, the first black president of an Ivy League institution, spent much of her testimony asserting the importance of diversity in higher education. At times, she cited her own experiences.
“It’s very hard for me to overstate my conviction about the benefits that flow from all of these areas to a diverse undergraduate student body. I know something about a lack of diversity in one’s education,” Simmons said. “I know what it was like to walk down the streets where random people attacked us or issued slurs.”
Simmons also defended the special consideration Harvard gives other groups of applicants including the children of faculty and staff. She said elite universities are always competing for the best faculty, so giving professors' children a tip is a needed recruiting tool.
Things lightened up slightly in the courtroom during a later discussion about student-athletes. For a moment, school rivalries surfaced in a courtroom in which more than a few lawyers and witnesses boast degrees from Ivy League institutions.
“We are an athletic league. How are we going to field teams to play each other if we don’t admit athletes for those teams?” Simmons said. “A lot of people outside the Ivy League believe we’re not serious when it comes to athletics, but that’s because they’ve never sat at a table of Ivy League presidents fighting about athletics.”
“When Brown beat Harvard, it was a holiday. So these are serious matters,” Simmons continued, prompting laughter from several lawyers and trial attendees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Red Sox clinched the 2018 World Series in Los Angeles this weekend, Dartmouth football may be the next New England sports team to bring home a championship. With a 24-17 victory over Harvard on Saturday, the Big Green moves to 7-0 on the year with a 4-0 mark in the Ivy League. Its largest test of the fall comes next weekend when it travels to Princeton to match up with the Tigers, who have an identical record.
The Crimson now sits at 3-4 on the year, with three losses coming in league play. Clearly, the team is in a rebuilding stage, but it is showing signs of competition with the conference’s juggernauts. Its losses by eight and seven points to Princeton and Dartmouth, respectively, represent the slimmest margins by which both of the league’s undefeated teams have won this season.
RUNNING AGROUND
Facing near-freezing temperatures and wet conditions at Memorial Field in Hanover, N.H., Harvard opted to maintain its balanced offense in lieu of concentrating on the ground game. However, expected mistakes arose due to the combination of adverse weather and a formidable Big Green defense.
The Crimson fumbled five times, and four of those times the ball changed hands. The first was recovered by quarterback Tom Stewart for a loss of seven during the visitors’ second drive of the game, which resulted in a punt. The next three giveaways were significant, as they all happened in Dartmouth territory.
The second of this trio proved most costly for Harvard. Facing a 14-0 first quarter deficit, the Crimson opened the second having entered the red zone. The first snap of the period saw running back B.J. Watson gain seven yards to creep up to the hosts’ 13. Then, Stewart targeted Watson on a pass out to his right. Watson cut up to the eight, but that was as far as he would advance, as Bun Straton and Jack Traynor teamed up to force and recover a fumble.
In all, Harvard put up just 142 rushing yards, significantly lower than its average of 218.7 through the first six games. Perhaps surprisingly, it was the quarterback and receiving corps who kept the Crimson in contention on Saturday. Stewart managed a 57.1 completion percentage and threw for 270 yards without an interception. For the third straight week, the team was without Justice Shelton-Mosley — who is shelved for the season with a leg injury — so Stewart spread out his targets, hitting three receivers for over 40 yards apiece.
Stewart was also the team’s most effective ball-carrier when forced to run. Dealing with a wet football, several times it appeared as though Stewart had no choice but to scramble, but he successfully rushed for 76 yards on 11 attempts, including a 22-yard touchdown dash.
“When it’s really hard to run the ball that’s when you have to be a balanced offense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We always talk about having the ability to run or throw in any situation. I thought Tommy, our staff, and our kids did a really good job against a really outstanding defense that was number one in the nation in total defense.”
RUNNING WILD
Unlike the Crimson, the Big Green did not face any difficulty establishing its ground attack. As it had done all season, Dartmouth allowed a combination of traditional running back Rashaad Cooper and wildcat quarterback Jared Gerbino to go to work against the opposing front seven. And as the pair had done all season, they accumulated a staggering rushing total — this time, an even 300 yards and a touchdown apiece.
The Big Green appeared to telegraph its offensive game plan from the get-go, as the team posted a shocking three passing yards in the first half. The nation’s leading offense in terms of completion percentage and QBR completed just four of 11 attempts in the air all game.
“You get into the second level and nobody wants to tackle a 235-pound guy [Gerbino] with that head of steam,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “The balance aspect of it, we didn’t throw the ball well. Harvard against the pass has had some issues, and we just did not throw the ball well. It’s cold, it’s wet, it’s raining, and we’re on the sideline for an extended period of time. That got us a little bit out of sync.”
The threat of a long pass kept Harvard’s defense at bay and allowed the Cooper-Gerbino duo to go to work, though. One play halfway through the third quarter demonstrated the Big Green’s ability to sneak a long ball past an unsuspecting defense.
With traditional quarterback Derek Kyler already having completed one pass during the drive and Dartmouth having switched in Gerbino, the Crimson was likely gearing up for a smashmouth rushing attack. Gerbino obliged on his first play, as he was grounded for a loss of one. However, as he took the next snap, the junior went deep to Robbie Mangas for a 30-yard gain. The drive resulted in a missed field goal, but it served to demonstrate the Big Green’s ability to deviate from its run game in situations in which Harvard expended more defensive resources preparing for a carry.
“Number one, they have an outstanding offensive line,” Murphy said. “Number two, you still have to play assignment football because they’re going spin motion, he can hand it off, he can keep it. You still have to defend the pass on the back end, and the combination of those things for any wildcat quarterback, especially someone as good as he is, it’s challenging.”
COMEBACK KIDS
Four times this season, Harvard has made some form of a comeback. Only once has its effort succeeded, and in that case the situation was avoidable — the Crimson gave up a 16-point lead to Holy Cross at Harvard Stadium and had to march downfield for a game-winning field goal.
The other three comeback bids have been against ranked opponents. First, Harvard erased a 16-3 halftime lead in favor of Rhode Island, only to lose by a tally of 23-16. Last week, the Crimson twice eliminated two-possession leads by Princeton, but it was unable to cobble together a final push to down the Tigers. Finally, this past weekend Harvard was shut out, 21-0, in the first half, only to outscore Dartmouth, 17-3, in the second.
There are positives and negatives to be gleaned from this trend — namely, that the Crimson is able to hang with nationally ranked programs in an abnormally difficult schedule and that there is still work to be done to capitalize on opportunities that would shave down large first-half deficits.
“Boy, our kids just fight and fight and fight and fight, and that’s how I judge a team,” Murphy said. “Our kids have just given us everything they’ve had. Because of that, we’ve never been out of a game, right down to the wire every game this year, so I feel really bad for our kids but I feel really proud of their effort.”

Highs are in the 50s on this spooky Halloween day. You laugh, thinking, "It's not even November 1st! I have months before I need to worry about pulling my snowboots out of storage. But Boston winter is coming. If this ominous statement conjures up a mental picture anything short of a snowpocalypse, you’re in for a rude awakening. You could have been at sunny Stanford, but instead you chose Harvard, and here, when it snows, it blizzards. Though the weather is still fairly nice, proper planning is essential to survival through long winters nights. Relax, my fair weather friends. Here are a couple of ways to stay warm all winter long. It is NEVER too early to prepare.
Layer Like You Mean It
This is not about looking cool. This is about survival. It’s time to break out that long underwear (think leggings and a long sleeve) to wear underneath anything. Though the additional layer may seem suffocating underneath your skinny jeans, come any walk that requires more than 30 seconds of exposure, you’ll be thankful for the additional warmth. Good layers will be wool or synthetic, and absolutely not cotton.
Cover Your Head
Qualities of a good hat: covers your ears, thick, cute, covers your ears. Did I mention it should cover your ears? A great thing about cold, windy climates is that the wind will make it feel 10 to 20 degrees colder, which will make your ears feel like they’re going to freeze off. You could also consider investing in a face cover, or a really big scarf you can cover your nose with.
A Good Jacket
A denim jacket will not cut it. Think puffer, wool duster, anything you might wear to go to Siberia for winter break. It should have a pockets to hide your hands in and a collar, because winter is the one time popping your collar doesn’t make you a total douchebag. If you’re feeling risky, hold off until black Friday, but just know that come December you’ll be wanting a serious coat.
Waterproof Shoes
Waterproof? But I thought there were sidewalks? Winter in the northeast isn’t just cold, it’s slushy. There’s this super fun thing called freezing rain which will permeate all but the toughest shoes. If you happen to have class on a snowy day, good luck keeping your suede boots dry. Also, make sure your shoes have some sort of grip on the bottom, or you’ll be sliding — think ice skating —around campus for three months.
Hot Coffee/ Hot Chocolate
Warm your insides to warm your outside. Spend some of your board plus in the name of keeping all ten fingers (and using Daddy Harvard’s free money), and walk around with a warm beverage all winter. Hand Warmers are a less tasty, albeit equally effective, measure.
Winter doesn’t have to be a terrible season. Sure, its cold, but it’s also the one season where you can always justify staying in and eating cookies in bed. But snow will be here soon, so don’t walk, run and buy those winter layers.
