After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 30, NY rapper Lil Tjay released the music video for his latest song, “Losses.”
With the first note of the song’s despondent melody, the video cuts to a shot of Lil Tjay sitting on the hood of an expensive-looking sedan in front of a storefront lit by warm yellow and orange neon lights. It is night. With each ensuing note, the video cuts to a new scene of Lil Tjay enjoying himself at a party or strolling with his affectionate girlfriend; all appears to be well and good in the young rapper’s life.
This notion is dispelled as the beat drops and Lil Tjay begins to sing the first chorus, with the storefront shot now alternating with shots that tell a story more reflective of the themes of loss and hardship that characterize the song. Lil Tjay is seen walking happily with his girlfriend and texting his friends to make plans. His friends are then shown arriving before they all jump in his G-Wagen, and the shots continue to cycle rather quickly. At this point, well into the first verse, there is a noticeable shift towards cooler, more melancholy green-blue lighting, a change that becomes more pronounced as the song progresses.
As Lil Tjay nears the end of the first verse, he and his friends, now driving in the G-Wagen, are forced into an alley by masked rivals on motorcycles. In the storefront scenes, still spliced into the story, the young rapper begins to grow more pensive and quietly emotional — he is even at points shown with his head down deep in thought, not even singing. His eyes reveal fatigue and pain as he laments all the “goddamn losses” that he’s taken on his path to success.
In the alleyway, Lil Tjay is forced out of the SUV at gunpoint, but his friend draws his own pistol on the adversaries, and a standoff ensues. As the chorus of the song plays, the lack of a drumbeat adds to the tension and expectant stillness of the scene, and the melody foreshadows the tragedy to come. The standoff continues into the second verse, but the tension eventually reaches a boiling point, and the guns go off moments before Lil Tjay switches up the flow and the drums kick back in.
Lil Tjay and his friends then make their escape to an apartment lit in teal. Here, shots of the young rapper scrambling to help his wounded friend — his shirt now being used as an improvised tourniquet, his friends desperate and arguing about what to do next — alternate with those showing him rapping forcefully, almost cathartically, in front of a mirror.
As the outro begins to play, Lil Tjay seems to lose energy and hope and looks almost defeated as he continues to sing to himself in front of the mirror, before a newsreel about the shooting is shown on screen. The song fades out as Lil Tjay is arrested for the events of the previous night; it seems no amount of success can amend the losses he is still forced to face.

“AOC kinda sus.”
This statement epitomizes the social, viral, and political milieu currently surrounding Generation Z like no other. When it’s your first time playing the immensely popular video game “Among Us,” let alone your first time assuming the role of the notorious “Imposter,” it’s hard not to be suspect. But U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fared well in her first game before being ejected off a digital spaceship and into internet stardom, marking a rare instance in which a politician harnessed youth platforms and tools to advance a cause without coming across as decidedly “sus.”
After tweeting her intention to play “Among Us” to the tune of nearly 400,000 likes Ocasio-Cortez proceeded to set up an account on Twitch, the leading streaming service for video games. The following day, Ocasio-Cortez joined other Twitch stars for several hours to encourage increased voter turnout and, well, have a good time — her electioneering taking the form of banter and finger-pointing in virtual town halls. A typical Tuesday evening for your average United States Representative.
Not including the audiences of fellow streamers, Ocasio-Cortez’s stream drew more than 430,000 concurrent viewers and nearly five million total views over the course of three and a half hours. Ocasio-Cortez now lays claim to the fifth-most watched individual stream in Twitch’s history, joining an elite company of streamers on the platform. (Whether the quality of AOC’s discussion rivals that of Ninja’s with Drake is a highly contested topic among political commentators.)
A democratic socialist from New York, Ocasio-Cortez has risen to prominence as the voice of a politically-dismayed youth and “the de facto spokeswoman for the historically diverse 2018 midterm class.” The youngest woman ever elected to Congress, Ocasio-Cortez’s departure from the traditional congressional demographic and clashes with older Democrats and Republicans alike have cemented her status as a champion of progressive politics. Bestowed with the endearing title “AOC,” the Representative has garnered a mythic status among Gen Z-ers.
Ocasio-Cortez’s online presence and know-how has certainly aided her in the popularity contest with the nation’s youth. Even in her first attempt playing “Among Us” — a game in which Crewmates aboard a spaceship must work together to uncover one or more Imposters, whose goal is to avoid suspicion while covertly eliminating everyone else — Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated considerable proficiency, employing such youthful vernacular as “sus” and “marinate” in playful conversation with her fellow streamers. Launched in 2018 to meager reception, Among Us recently became a quarantine must-play — downloads rose approximately 600% late this summer as people grew tired of baking sourdough and sought respite in interstellar gaslighting.
Ocasio-Cortez’s online celebrity is unparalleled and unprecedented among today’s politicians. Many don’t know how to act on this stage — how to ride the fleeting waves of internet virality, capturing the snowballing attentions of millions with short attention spans. Even Bernie Sanders, a popular figure with Gen Z in his own right, could only amass a paltry 150,000 Twitch subscribers to Ocasio-Cortez’s 700,000. And when politicians attempt to enter adolescent spheres, even in ways as innocuous as being relatable on social media, it usually doesn’t go over quite well. Think Hillary Clinton asserting her hip-ness by posting a Mannequin Challenge on Twitter. Think John Delaney proving he’s your average Joe by posting a workout video to the same platform, jumping in silence for a full minute. And remember Ted Cruz challenging Jimmy Kimmel to basketball one-on-one — you guessed it — on Twitter? Surely, these digital moments made you want to race to the polls.

Yet Ocasio-Cortez engaged with youth skillfully, and her goal of getting out the vote seemed to work: her stream was the “#1 driver of traffic” to the website IWillVote.com during its duration. For the first time in a while, it seemed as though we could laugh with and not laugh at politicians dipping their toes in this unfamiliar virtual world — a world Generation Z has, until now, considered a bastion impenetrable to the pandering of technologically illiterate campaigners. To see normal people (or just young people) take on important political work and do so with grace was refreshing. Hopefully, the day will come once again when a politician seizes the reigns of the elusive beast of internet-stardom to foster genuine engagement with civic duty instead of making a laughing stock of themselves. Until then, we’ll all just be chillin’ in Cedar Rapids.

Life is a little tough right now. What with surviving midterms, the plague, a growing climate catastrophe, and the narrowly averted collapse of our democracy, everyone needs a moment to take a breath, maybe cry a little, and feel at peace. This playlist of comforting songs is meant to create that space. Think of it as a warm hug. As long as we can’t be together, the Arts Board might as well send one to you sonically.
“Chicago” by Sufjan Stevens
This indie folk song from the early aughts serves as a reminder of the impermanence of life’s problems. Violin-heavy and dripping with forgiveness, “Chicago” delivers comfort in the same way a good cry does.
“Slow Burn” by Kacey Musgraves
This hazy ballad from country singer Kacey Musgraves has the exact same energy as taking a much-needed nap in a sunny room. “I’m gonna do it my way. It’ll be alright,” Kacey sings. In a year that can feel like a setback, the reminder to take a breath and let things unfurl on their own is a welcome message.
“seven” by Taylor Swift
“seven,” Swift’s nostalgic song about childhood friends, is like looking out a window on a rainy day, perhaps with a photo album in hand. It's melancholy, but in a cozy way.
“I Like Giants” by Kimya Dawson
Armed with a ukulele, Kimya Dawson delivers a light tune about feeling at one with the universe. Just the lyric “I am grounded / I am humbled / I am one with everything” is an instant stress reliever.
“This Will Be Our Year” by The Zombies
Hey, 2020 is almost over. Maybe 2021 will be our year. Indulge in that optimistic hope with this 1968 classic that assures, “All your worry days are gone.”
“Clay Pigeons” by Michael Cera
That’s right, indie darling Michael Cera has a music career — that very fact itself a comfort. Cera’s cover of this Blaze Foley original gives off serious rambling-man vibes, and what could be more comforting than boarding a train and riding far away from life’s problems?
“Sunflower” by Rex Orange County
Nothing is more soothing than the sweet woozy tones of bedroom pop. Backed by lo-fi beats and the bright jazzy sounds of a trumpet, Rex Orange County lets us know that “You don't have to feel this emptiness.”
“Self” by Noname
The opening track of Noname’s album “Room 25” is not only an immediate confidence boost, but it also includes the line “My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism” which, no matter how bad things are, is guaranteed to bring cheer to the listener.
“Amigas Cheetahs” by The Cheetah Girls
This song, the closing number of the most comforting movie of all time, “Cheetah Girls 2”, features Spanish guitar riffs and a beautiful message about international friendship. For those who are currently separated from their friends, the reminder that “Nothing is ever gonna come between us” is comforting beyond measure and serves as the perfect end to this (hopefully) reassuring list of songs.

It’s been a tough year to be a Harry Potter fan. Over the summer, author J.K. Rowling faced vehement criticism for expressing beliefs widely considered to be transphobic. This past spring, cell phone footage appeared to show “Fantastic Beasts” star Ezra Miller choking a fan. And now, just this past week, Johnny Depp resigned from the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise upon request from Warner Bros. Depp portrayed chief antagonist Gellert Grindelwald in the series’s first two installments.
This development comes as a result of Depp losing a court case against the British tabloid The Sun. Depp sued the paper for libel after they published a story in 2018 calling him a “wife-beater” and demanding that he be removed from the “Fantastic Beasts” films due to his alleged abuse of ex-wife Amber Heard.
Depp was married to Heard, an actress and activist, for less than two years. At the end of their relationship, Heard obtained a temporary restraining order and accused Depp of physically, emotionally, and verbally abusing her, often while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The pair settled their divorce out of court in 2017.
The libel trial against “The Sun” took place this past summer, and brought to light many graphic details from Heard and Depp’s marriage. Both parties accused the other of abuse while largely denying the other’s allegations.
On Nov. 2, a judge ultimately ruled that Heard “was the victim of sustained and multiple assaults by Mr Depp,” and accepted that Depp “put her in fear of her life.”
Depp continues to strongly maintain his innocence. “The surreal judgement of the court in the U.K. will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal,” he wrote in a statement on social media on Nov. 6. “My resolve remains strong and I intended to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.”
Harriet Wistrich, director of the Center for Women’s Justice, commented on the trial’s result in an email to the New York Times. “We hope the outcome of this case will serve as a warning to wealthy men who seek to use the courts to silence women who speak out about abuse,” she wrote.
The legal battles between Depp and Heard are not over yet. In addition to his intended appeal, Depp has also sued Heard for defamation in response to a Washington Post op-ed in which Heard wrote about speaking up against sexual violence.
Fans had been protesting Depp’s casting in the “Fantastic Beasts” films since Heard’s allegations first came to light. In 2017, Depp was defended by Rowling and director David Yates. “I can only tell you about the man I see every day,” said Yates to Entertainment Weekly. “He’s full of decency and kindness, and that’s all I see.” Rowling, Yates, and any other members of the “Fantastic Beasts” team have yet to comment on Depp’s removal from the franchise.
The currently untitled “Fantastic Beasts 3” has already begun filming. Warner Bros. confirmed that the release will be delayed until summer 2022, and that the critical role of Grindelwald will be recast. Depp is certainly an iconic actor who brought his unique style to Grindelwald; whether or not his interpretation will be maintained remains to be seen. Mads Mikkelson (“Hannibal,” “Doctor Strange”) is reportedly in talks to take over the role.
The “Fantastic Beasts” films have been described as “the world’s most problematic movie franchise.” Conversations about how much to separate the art from the artist are sure to — and should — continue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drakeo the Ruler was released from prison on Nov. 4 following a tumultuous legal battle with Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Before his arrest in 2017, he was one of the fastest rising artists out of L.A. He has spent the past three years in custody.
In 2019, Drakeo was acquitted of a murder charge related to a 2016 shooting. During the trial, eye witnesses testified that Drakeo was not the shooter. According to testimony, he hid upon hearing the shots, in fear that he was the one being attacked. The jury found him not guilty.
Despite being cleared of all wrongdoing, Drakeo was held for another year behind bars as Lacey refiled the same charges claiming his rap group, the Stinc Team, was in fact a gang. Lacey even attempted to use his song lyrics as evidence against him.
Drakeo finally caught a break when Lacey lost reelection this week to challenger George Gascón. After a single day of trial, a plea deal was brokered and Drakeo was set free. Reporter Jeff Weiss, who has covered the entirety of Drakeo’s case, said on Twitter that Lacey’s removal was instrumental in reaching a deal.
To celebrate his long-awaited release, here is a list of Drakeo the Ruler’s top five songs.
5. “Quit Rappin”
“Quit Rappin” appears on the album “Thank You For Using GTL,” which Drakeo recorded from prison this year with help from producer JoogSzn. Rapping through a jail phone, Drakeo communicates an infectious swagger. On the chorus of the track, Drakeo brags: “I tried to tell my wrist it should quit dancin’ / The lights came on it went chimpanzee.” The song and the album as a whole speak to Drakeo’s unwavering commitment to his craft and perseverance in the face of his frustrating and unjust incarceration. It also proves that even while behind bars, Drakeo can still out-rap most others in the game.
4. “Musty Freestyle [feat. OhGeesy]”
Released as a single in 2018, “Musty Freestyle” showcases Drakeo’s trademark breezy flow and top-tier rhyming. The track uses the beat to “Musty,” off the 2017 Shoreline Mafia mixtape “ShorelineDoThatShit,'' and features a snippet of member OhGeesy’s verse. Matching the high energy of the original Shoreline version of the track, Drakeo shows off his lyrical talent: “I got Bally, I got Louis, I ain't really into Prada / Split medulla oblongatas, a couple way from a father.” Although the song is one of his lesser known works, it’s also one of his best. A version of the track was featured on the debut album from Shoreline Mafia this year.
3. “Out the Slums (Remix) [feat. Danny Brown & 03 Greedo]”
A remix of a song from his 2017 album “Cold Devil,” “Out the Slums (Remix)“ sees Drakeo match wits with rap legend Danny Brown to produce an infinitely replayable classic. The song was remixed and released this year while Drakeo was imprisoned. The track features a solid outing from Drakeo’s longtime affiliate, Watts rapper 03 Greedo, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018. Along with close collaborators Shoreline Mafia, Drakeo and Greedo have become pillars of the L.A. rap scene. Drakeo and Greedo’s respective arrests were devastating to the development of the current West Coast sound. For an artist as big as Brown to add his talents to this track is a validation of the pair’s hard work and contributions to the game.
2. “Ion Rap Beef [feat. 03 Greedo]”
A track off his 2020 compilation album “Free Drakeo,” “Ion Rap Beef” is Drakeo’s protest against his unfair legal treatment and a message to Lacey. Drakeo speaks directly on the prosecution’s targeted use of his song lyrics in his trial: “Judging by my case files, I’m obsessed with rifles.” He also addresses his mistreatment by the media and his prosecutors: “They gon' have to find a suitable picture for Fox 11.” Greedo nicely compliments Drakeo’s biting remarks with a leaping autotune verse that closes out the track. Featuring stellar production from JoogSzn and an incredibly smooth flow from Drakeo, the track ranks high within his discography.
Like “Out the Slums,” the song got the remix treatment this year, with a rare feature from underground rap hero Earl Sweatshirt. On the remix version of the song, Earl states his support for Drakeo: “F*ck the DA, Free the Ruler.”
1. “Flu Flamming”
Another cut off “Cold Devil,” “Flu Flamming” is perhaps Drakeo’s most famous song. It also happens to be his best. The track features one of the most unique opening verses of any rap song released in the last five years. The combination of Drakeo’s relaxed, continuous flow and his impressive wordsmithing has defined the new era of West Coast rap. The “Flu Flamming” music video released by the World Star Hip-Hop YouTube channel in 2018 has almost six million views. After Drakeo was locked up, several other rappers began to co-opt his rap style and sound. Now that Drakeo is free, L.A. rap is sure to reach new heights.

If these last few days have demonstrated anything, it’s this: Elections are stressful. But just how stressful are they really? And how does this stress affect our health? In the months leading up to the 2016 election, David R. Williams — a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health — worked with colleagues from across the nation to gather data and investigate the tangible effects of election-related stress. Their research found that participants faced 60 percent increased risk of hospitalization for heart attacks or strokes in the two days following the 2016 presidential election. FM spoke to Williams about his past research and his hypotheses for how health and stress might intersect in the wake of the 2020 election. This interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
FM: What made you interested in studying the connections between sociopolitical events and healthcare?
DRW: I’ve been known for trying to capture and measure types of stressful life experiences that cause challenges for individuals but often are not included in the standard measures of stress. There’s a scale I developed called the Everyday Discrimination Scale that is now the most widely used measure to capture racial discrimination in health studies globally, and it reflects my commited interest in trying to capture the stress of racial discrimination, which at the time I developed it in the nineties, was not something that was routinely collected. Similarly, it was clear from the research done by the American Psychological Association that Americans were stressed by the election, but there wasn’t much effort to understand what the health consequences were.
FM: How do you think things have changed between the 2016 election and now? Do you expect something similar could be happening right now in the aftermath of last week’s presidential election? 
DRW: We really don’t know the answer. However, the American Psychological Association does these national surveys of the stress levels of the American population [during election cycles], and they did one back in 2016 where they found that 52 percent of Americans said that they were stressed by the election. They did one more recently just before this current election and they found that 68 percent of Americans in 2020 said they were stressed by the presidential election.
I think this election cycle’s long wait of 96 hours before the results and considerable debate can lead to stress for some adults in the U.S. In our [2016] analysis, we assumed that Donald Trump’s win came quickly that night. That could have been an acute stressful event, so you would see things like a heart attack or stroke. That’s why we explicitly looked at what happened in the two days after the election, compared to the two days before. The stress linked to the election this time is less of an acute stress and is more of a chronic ongoing stress. There may be health consequences, but maybe now they’ll be depression, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. That’s all a hypothesis though.
FM: How has this election cycle affected you personally?
DRW: I worry about the disregard for science and getting the facts right. It’s a little distressing to see us not taking science more seriously and utilizing all of the information we have to save lives.
FM: If you had to give people recommendations about handling their stress, especially during an election, what is something that you might share?
DRW: I don’t think that many healthcare providers who have patients with underlying risk factors for heart disease and stroke think that a very competitive election cycle is a time where they can give their patients advice and go the extra mile to discuss how their patients are feeling. I think for the average person there is also a take-home message here of taking good care of ourselves, even as you struggle with the larger political issues.
FM: How has your academic work and research affected your own perceptions and the way you move through the world now?
DRW: The similarity across contexts is one thing I find really really striking. I think there’s a reciprocal effect. Some of the questions that I asked are driven by my own interest. Questions of social inequality are central to my work, and the more deeply I delve into social inequality, the more I find there is out there to understand. Probably the biggest thing that has changed from when I started my career looking at social inequality is how income, education, occupational status, place, race, and ethnicity, racism, and discrimination affected health. I was very very focused on the patterns that were evident in the United States. I am much more globally focused now.

“Novel” describes The Novel Kitchen in multiple ways: its location, its menu, and especially its birth amid a pandemic.
The no-cook eatery — it will only serve prepared, rather than cooked, food — is set to open this month in the Brookline Booksmith, a bookstore expanding into a neighboring storefront. Restaurant owner Jenn Mason hopes to allow diners to enjoy their food regardless of the restrictions posed by COVID-19.
When Brookline Booksmith began its plans for a restaurant in their expanded space, many members of the local food scene pointed them to Mason. The bookstore reached out to her with an offer to spearhead the project.
Mason said yes on two conditions. Already the owner of two cheese shops in the Boston area and an online cheese delivery service, she wanted to “use [her] wheelhouse.” First, it would have to be a no-cook restaurant. Mason’s experience in the industry involves sourcing rather than cooking food, so the new eatery would prepare foods that didn’t require ovens or grills, like cheese plates. Second, it would have to be “experiential.”
“We want you to feel the comfort and the love that you feel and have been feeling for 57 years here at [Brookline] Booksmith,” Mason says, describing the experience she hopes diners will have. “It’s another place where you can come in safely — and after this [pandemic], just happily come in — and feel like the eating experience is as special as the shopping experience and the discovery that happens in Booksmith.”
Bookstore owner Lisa Gozashti also sees The Novel Kitchen as an extension of theBrookline Booksmith’s community feel. “We love that [The Novel Kitchen] provid[es] another form of home for all of our patrons,” she says. “We always think of ourselves as providing refuge — a literary refuge — and they’re supplementing that with food and drink.”
Although the pandemic has hurt the food industry, Mason is not worried about The Novel Kitchen’s ability to open and be successful. “It’s not retrofitted [for the pandemic] — it was built for this,” Mason says. “We jokingly call it the COVID Cafe.” Barriers between tables — bookshelves, of course — were installed with plexiglass dividers, and the register was built with a plexiglass shield. For now, the restaurant’s 45-person capacity has been reduced to 16 to maintain social distancing.
The Novel Kitchen also hopes to elevate takeout-style food and make it an experience diners look forward to rather than tolerate.
Regardless of whether diners eat in the restaurant or at home, all food will be served in to-go containers to keep the experience consistent. Instead of dignified goblets as wine glasses, Mason chose casual cups called Spanish bodega glasses to complement the relaxed feel of eating from a take-out container in a restaurant.
She designed a rotating menu to keep customers intrigued. “It should feel similar every time you come in, but also part of the similarity should be that something new has changed,” Mason says.
As a no-cook restaurant, that menu is divided into snacks and small plates. The small plates currently include a salmon plate, cheese plate, and mezze plate, and the snacks include treats like chocolates, marinated feta, and the Brookline Booksmith cookie, a cardamom and vanilla cookie designed specifically for the bookstore. Some menu items are customer favorites from Mason’s cheese shops, while others are entirely new.
Locally sourcing menu items is important to Mason, a small business owner heavily connected to local vendors. The mezze plate features hummus from Boston-based brand Just Hummus, and its snacks include chocolates from another local brand, Chocolate Therapy. “These are really fantastic people, and I like what they do,” she says. “The customer wins because there’'s something fun that’'s going to come out of it for them.”
Mason imagines joint events with Brookline Booksmith in the future. The bookstore often hosts authors at the nearby Coolidge Corner Theatre. The Novel Kitchen hopes to offer smaller, more intimate gatherings with those authors before or after their larger presentations. Mason says that the combination of books with food and drink will hopefully add something to the audience experience. For the near future, The Novel Kitchen is considering virtual events instead.
The Novel Kitchen will continue to evolve once it opens. “We’re giving our staff a lot of leeway to experiment and try things and get back to us,” Mason says. Based on what customers respond to, both menu items and the frequency of their rotation are subject to change.
The Novel Kitchen strives to be true to its name: a place where customers can come for an ever-changing selection of food presented in an unconventional format. “If you [are] the kind of person who’s like, ‘What's new today?’ […] There’ll be something new for you to try every week,” Mason says. “It’s like a great big experiment.”

They are biologists and chemists, doctors and architects, physicists and engineers — and they are founders, too. In a society where speed is of the essence, their startups are tackling large, urgent problems that quick fixes can’t solve.
MIT-led venture firm The Engine was conceived in 2016 as a response to a troubling trend in the scientific landscape: Technologies with enormous long-term potential were being ignored in favor of those that could reach the market on a shorter timeline. In the past five years The Engine has raised $435 million in two funding rounds, the most recent of which concluded last month. MIT, the lead investor, contributed $35 million; Harvard, joining for the first time, chipped in $25 million. The money has offered much-welcomed support to select companies involved in “Tough Tech,” a term The Engine CEO and Managing Partner Katie W. Rae describes in an email as “scientific or engineering breakthroughs that have potential for big impact and [to] solve large problems in the world — often based on years of research in academia, though not required, and often have some element of physicality to them.”
“[They’re] the reason I’m so excited to go to work every morning,” Rae says of the 27 companies that currently make up The Engine’s portfolio. She divides them into three general categories: “climate change, human health, and advanced computing.” Each company receives around one to five million dollars in seed funding, and perhaps more importantly, enters into a partnership with The Engine.
The Engine sports a dedicated team of advisors, most with sector-specific expertise, to help its startups with critical early-stage decisions. The venture also owns a building on Mass. Ave where companies can perform their cutting-edge research — a key ingredient in the Tough Tech recipe, as Rae notes, since the industry “often require[s] a lot of resource intensive laboratory equipment and space.” The current setup allows companies to “scale rapidly” without needing to worry about physical limitations. Still, The Engine has plans for a new 200,000-square-foot building able to accommodate 100 companies; it’s expected to be fully operational in 2022.
Despite being a firm that Rae says is looking to “radically transform entire industries,” The Engine stays in touch with its Cambridge roots. A majority of its portfolio companies were founded at MIT or Harvard, a fact that, according to Rae, has been instrumental to their success: “Many of the Tough Tech companies we back have academic founders or employees that still have ties to the labs, so proximity to that world is really key as they get going,” she says. In addition, The Engine team is involved with campus events at both universities, having sent guest speakers to the Harvard MBA program and the Harvard Energy & Environmental Club.
Powered by The Engine, a number of portfolio companies have made considerable progress toward their goals, and a closer look at them reveals a set of unique solutions.
Humans produce many different kinds of waste, but Nour B. Sharara, a Biobot Analytics business development team member, is talking about the kind that gets flushed down the toilet. She calls Biobot a “wastewater analytics company” whose goal is to detect and analyze biological indicators of human health in sewage. “Human waste is gold,” she says, before describing how substances can take different pathways through the body: “For opioids, it’s excreted in urine. For SARS-CoV-2, the virus that gives COVID-19, it’s excreted in stool.”
Biobot has, over the last few years, blossomed into an essential resource for communities grappling with public health crises. Sharara says the team’s early research was related to opioids, which meant visiting dozens of local manholes to collect water samples. Now, their main focus is COVID-19, and the company receives its samples from wastewater treatment plants across the country. As of late May, Biobot had mapped COVID-19 trends in 43 states and provinces, accounting for 13 percent of the U.S. population.
While Biobot’s testing cannot specify which individuals are infected with the coronavirus, it can provide early information to help cities plan their defense. “We have limited resources that we need to deploy smartly,” Sharara says — one of the most important resources being individual access to testing. She explains that SARS-CoV-2 is a “leading indicator,” meaning that cases will spike approximately a week after an uptick is detected in wastewater. This early warning gives city officials ample time to alert hospitals and introduce safety measures.
Since the start of the pandemic, Biobot’s team has approximately tripled in size, and demand for its services has grown even faster. Sharara says that The Engine’s support has been crucial in this transformative time, allowing Biobot to quickly pivot its focus to COVID-19 research and scale its operations; additionally, the industry expertise at The Engine has helped Biobot work more seamlessly with local governments. Biobot scientists no longer map out all the sewage drains in a city, but they still enjoy celebrating #ManholeMonday on social media.
Mori, another company in The Engine’s portfolio, deals with a different kind of human waste. The startup has developed a way to increase the shelf life of perishable foods, thus reducing the amount of food we throw out. Its technology takes the form of a coating made from fibroin, a protein found in silk — the scientific name of the silkworm is Bombyx mori.
Vice President of Business Development Christina M. Belsito says that the protein has been used for years in the medical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries, but Mori’s application of it to the food industry is something new. The product takes the form of a soluble powder which, when dissolved in water, can be used to bathe or spray food products, creating an invisible, protective layer that is around 10 microns thick. This layer, Belsito says, counters the “three major reasons that food goes bad” — gas exchange, dehydration, and bacterial growth. What differentiates Mori’s product from other food preservation technologies is its versatility: It has successfully been used to treat whole and cut produce, meat and seafood, and many packaged foods.
There is luxury-grade silk, and there are lower grades of silk. By using the latter — after all, only the protein matters, not the fiber quality — Mori is able to achieve “very low cost raw material inputs,” according to Belsito, making its product “a cost effective tool for our customers.” At the moment, the startup is piloting its product with processing and food packing companies across the country; a commercial rollout is expected in 2021. Mori has weathered the pandemic well, not only because the startup is still in its pre-commercial phase, but also because the pandemic has made its “value proposition stand out all the more.” Belsito describes how some food suppliers did not even harvest their crop this year due to a sharp decrease in demand from restaurants — Mori’s product might have prevented the crops from going to waste.
Spun out of a Harvard chemistry lab, Zapata Computing is a leader in quantum computing software. Co-founder and IP Coordinator Jonny P. Olson calls the startup a “quantum software company, in contrast to a quantum hardware company, meaning we don’t build any quantum computers.” Instead, Zapata is trying to program them: a “very non-trivial” task, as Olson puts it, in large part because current quantum computers boast a myriad of architectures and each runs on firm-specific software. This makes the quantum scientist’s job difficult, and it’s where the Zapata team saw an opportunity to break through.
As opposed to any normal (classical) computer, in which bits can be either zero or one, a quantum computer works via superposition, meaning that a quantum bit (a.k.a. “qubit”) can take on any value between zero and one. Olson offers a compass analogy: “You can go north, or you can go west...but you can also go northwest; you can go in a direction that is both zero and one at the same time.” Confusing, perhaps, but powerful. For instance, the equations of chemical reactions are far too complex for a classical computer to simulate completely. On a quantum computer, however, Olson says “you can encode the chemistry into the qubits themselves,” leading to massive improvements in speed and accuracy. Other applications come in the field of optimization problems, whether that means determining the most cost-effective postal delivery route or designing a high-performance airplane wing.
Although quantum computers are still years away from becoming a scientific mainstay, Zapata’s first product — a software called Orquestra — will help ensure the transition is a smooth one. Orquestra takes care of the enormous “learning overhead” that comes with using quantum technology; it provides workflows for project organization, as well as pre-prepared machine learning algorithms.
As for the future, Olson observes that progress in quantum computing has been faster than anyone expected. “My advisor during my Ph.D. [was] telling me there’s a 50 percent chance we’ll have 50 qubits in 50 years,” he says. “And suddenly, here we are, companies [are] building a chip and testing a chip that is 50 qubits already — it hasn’t even been five years.”
When two atoms combine to form one, they release a tremendous amount of energy; this process, known as nuclear fusion, requires temperatures and pressures similar to those found in the sun. Commonwealth Fusion Systems is building a machine called a tokamak to replicate these conditions on Earth, and then to harness the resulting energy from fusion. As CFS CEO Bob T. Mumgaard describes in an email, “The world needs a fundamentally new source of clean energy that will power people to better lives and combat climate change on a timeline that makes a difference.”
No fusion reactor has ever before produced more energy than it began with, which means that SPARC, the CFS tokamak currently in the works, is set to be the first reactor to achieve “net energy.” According to Mumgaard, SPARC uses magnets made from “high temperature superconductors” to “confine a plasma in which fusion occurs.” This groundbreaking design “allow[s] for significantly stronger magnetic fields and, as a result, a smaller device that can be built much faster and less expensive than the traditional approach.” Construction on SPARC begins next spring and is expected to finish in 2025; Mumgaard says the final product “will fit on half a tennis court.” A series of seven papers published earlier this year proved the efficacy of CFS’s blueprint and are the first of their kind to originate from a private fusion company.
Though it will be a few years before SPARC is up and running, Mumgaard is already looking beyond that milestone. “We envision a world where fusion power plants are an option across the globe,” he says.

Abby R. Altman has a large tattoo on her wrist: the headstock of a guitar inked in black with a white P written in the center.
That symbol is the logo for Passim, an organization comprising Club Passim — a storied, nationally recognized folk music club — and the Passim School of Music. The school has offered classes, workshops, and private lessons to the Cambridge community for 20 years. All of its offerings have been virtual since March.
“Before, we’d never done anything but in person classes,” says Rachel T. Sumner, the coordinator of the Passim School of Music. She took on the position in May. In addition to planning classes, she has been managing the logistical work of adapting instruction and workshops to the virtual world.
Investing in the right technologies was a key first step. “[Quality] became an issue. We invested in a few pro Zoom accounts, which really helped bring the professionalism up,” she says.
But for ensemble classes — a fixture of Passim’s community-oriented mission — problems loomed. In particular, Sumner references the lag on Zoom that makes ensemble play “nearly impossible.”
Other aspects of music education can also be lost in translation. Lindsay M. Straw, a performer and former instructor at Passim, shares a downside to the spatial separation imposed by the pandemic. “I can’t physically tell them, ‘Oh, your finger is in the wrong place, let me move it for you.’ Or I can’t help you assess the best way to hold the instrument,” she says.
Beyond the constraints of remote teaching, epidemiological and electoral anxieties have also permeated music learning, says Janet D. Feld, an instructor who just celebrated her twentieth year with Passim.
“I’ve had students say to me, ‘I thought I would be practicing so much more, because I’m home all of the time, but I’m not.’ And I’ve talked to them about this. I always say to them, ‘You have to be nice to my students,’” she chuckles. “I always recommend that you don’t get stressed about your stress reduction activities.”
But online music learning offers some surprising silver linings. All the instructors emphasized the increased accessibility of online learning: This year, Passim welcomed students from Alaska, North Carolina, California, and Connecticut. “People who wouldn’'t normally be able to make in-person lessons — older folks who can’t necessarily make the drive and park in Harvard Square — can commit to logging onto their computers,” Sumner says.
Instructors have figured out ways to optimize Zoom for virtual music teaching — they can screen share sheet music and record classes for students’ future use. “I can hold my hands and guitar up close to the camera and demonstrate certain things,” Feld says. She hopes further tech innovations will alleviate the difficulties of playing in ensembles on Zoom. “I’ve heard there’s software being developed to sync sound. Whoever creates that successfully first — they’re gonna be like the new Amazon,” she says, laughing.
Feld also explains some of the positive social effects of going virtual. Some of her students feel more comfortable signing up for online classes because they can now mute themselves. “It was a lovely surprise for me. People feel a lot less self-conscious during class because they’re muted,” she says. “My students in some cases are progressing faster than they were in in-person classes.”
Brian T. Cummings, a 67-year-old student who has been taking classes at Passim for roughly ten years, has experienced this benefit firsthand. “You don’t have to worry about anyone else hearing what you’re singing or playing,” he says. “So there is an odd sense of freedom that comes from knowing that no one is going to judge you and you can push yourself more if you want to.”
Feld believes that the pandemic has brought more people into music, citing slightly higher enrollment rates. When she asks students what inspired them to register, a number of them answer, “I’m home all the time, and I’ve had this guitar sitting in my closet for years. I’ve always wanted to play, and now seems like the perfect time.”
All Passim instructors are also performers, and the gig economy has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. In response, Passim created the Passim Emergency Artist Relief Fund to help offset lost earnings for musicians who rely on gig performances to make ends meet.
“It was day two of having been shut down, and the staff was spitballing: What can we do to help our community? What is a concrete way to focus on our artists?” Altman remembers. She and Matt W. Smith, the managing director at Club Passim, say they have raised more than $140,000 in donations and distributed it to hundreds of local artists.
Straw, a bluegrass and Celtic music artist, says performing mostly virtually has also allowed her more freedom in her performances.. Recently, she’s been streaming concerts on YouTube and Twitch. As a result, she feels a push to be less “traditional” and more “original” in her music.
“Gigs meant I was playing music for other people, for weddings and things like that. This time has given us the option to think more about what we want to be making, for ourselves,” she says. “I like when other people get weird and try new things. Being online, there’s no more ‘this is a bar gig and we have to play fun bar music’ — everyone gets to be a bit more creative.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coronavirus pandemic has been nothing short of a call to action for many. Students, teachers, and administrators are all doing their part in the fight against COVID-19. This effort extends beyond Harvard’s campus to Surprise Valley, Calif., where co-captain Caroline Noble of the Radcliffe Women’s Heavyweight Crew team is doing her part.
For the past three years, Noble has contributed to the Radcliffe squad on and off the water. One of Noble’s favorite Radcliffe memories on the water was rowing six-seat in the Club Eight at Head of the Charles her sophomore fall. But the San Anselmo, Calif., native’s career has been anything but smooth.
Noble was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in high school. She has spent several years battling chronic illness, fatigue, and a weak immune system due to the Epstein-Barr virus. And in the fall of her first year with the Crimson, Noble developed an abscess in her tonsils. After flying home to California and undergoing surgery, Noble ended up missing five weeks of her first semester.
“At that point, I realized I need to take care of my health first,” Noble said. “I really prioritized looking at ways I could be healthy. That included cleaning out my diet [and] my lifestyle… Since then, I’ve been really into all aspects of holistic health.”
Noble is one of many varsity athletes this semester who made the difficult decision to take a leave of absence from the college and their respective sports. She and fellow co-captain Samantha Sarafin of Lancaster, Mass., were “so excited to cultivate [a] sense of community and resilience on our team” during what was to be the 2020-2021 season. But although she misses her teammates, coaches, and Weld Boathouse, Noble “knew there was something more [she] could do to contribute [to the fight against COVID-19].” The Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology (HDRB) concentrator was inspired to take a leave of absence to pursue an opportunity that would allow her to do just that.
“I heard this podcast that mentioned a new movement of farmers who are focused on healing their soil in order to increase productivity, help the Earth, and help their crops,” Noble explained. “I googled it and found a list of farms that were doing this in California.”
Located in beautiful Surprise Valley, Calif., Bidwell Canyon Farm and its dedication to regenerative land management resonated with Noble. In exchange for housing and farm-fresh food, the Radcliffe co-captain is working for and learning from the farm’s owners during her leave of absence from the college.
The work ethic of a Radcliffe rower has translated into Noble’s day-to-day activities on the farm. Throughout the harvesting season, Noble and other Bidwell Canyon employees harvest and process farm-fresh fruits and vegetables.
“I have a whole new appreciation for salad,” said co-captain Noble while laughing. “You pick it leaf by leaf — at least for spring mix or spinach.”
And most important to Noble, the Bidwell Canyon Farm attends a farmer’s market every Saturday to distribute organic produce to the community. The owners of Bidwell Canyon Farm advocate for greater accessibility to farm-fresh, organic, and local food as an instrument to improve public health. Using government-issued vouchers, low income and underprivileged members of the community can enjoy the deliciously healthy food that Caroline Noble has played a part in harvesting.
“I know firsthand that how you eat impacts your immune system,” Noble said. “It impacts your ability to fight illness. I believe to my core that changing people’s diets will help with this pandemic.”
Although the rower turned organic farmer will eventually have to transition back from farm-fresh and local vegetables to Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS), her out-of-the-box experience has been eye-opening and has made Noble one of many Harvard student-athletes contributing to the fight against COVID-19.
“It’s daunting to feel like we are powerless, but we are not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Jaren Zinn ‘21, it is all about maximizing the opportunities that he has. That is why the 6’4” right-handed pitcher is taking a leave of absence this semester, choosing instead to live and train in Allston, Mass., with a few of his teammates. Zinn hopes that by focusing on baseball this semester, he can make the most of his remaining two years of eligibility with Harvard Baseball.
“The plan, assuming we have a spring season, coming into the fall, was I would enroll in Spring 2021 and then Spring 2022 and I would get two more seasons at Harvard. I’d get to have an in-season semester in both of my remaining academic semesters,” he explained.
Zinn saw his junior season as the opportunity to prove himself to professional scouts and gain valuable college pitching experience. Before Harvard, Zinn was an outfielder at Georgetown Day School, so it was not until college that he began to transition full-time into a pitcher. Due to a slew of injuries, along with the fact that there were 11 seniors on the 2019 team that won the Ivy League championship, he has pitched only 4.1 innings thus far in his Harvard career. He currently throws a four-seam fastball that sits between 90 and 95 miles per hour and a sinking curveball that averages 78 miles per hour.
Zinn started off the 2020 season pitching well, with a 3.86 earned run average in 2.1 innings, including a scoreless outing on March 6 against Fairfield University. However, his streak was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He took the hiatus as an opportunity to improve his game, knowing that, due to missing his entire sophomore season with injuries, he had two more seasons to impress professional scouts.
“In a funny way, I do think coronavirus has helped me with baseball,” he said. “There’s just this year-long block where the focus has been solely on development. So I gained a couple of miles per hour in [velocity] since coming home in March, and I was able to pretty much lift throughout the shutdown because I borrowed weights from my trainer at home. So, in a way, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to work hard and get better.”
That mentality has extended into this semester. Zinn has been living with teammates, including Tommy Seidl ‘21 and Buddy Mrowka ‘21, Harvard Baseball’s captain. He has also been training with Cressey Sports Performance, a gym based in Hudson, Mass., that trains MLB stars like former Cleveland Indians ace Corey Kluber and New York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton. The roommates frequently throw together at a local softball field with some other teammates in the area.
“It’s been an absolute blast getting to be around my teammates again,” Mrowka said. “We hadn’t seen each other in a few months, so being in the same house as these guys has been a lot of fun. And then on the training front, it’s been a high-energy atmosphere. We’ve also been pushing each other to be more committed, disciplined, and hardworking in ways that only your teammates can. I think it has really helped everyone in the house.”
They have also gotten the chance to participate in workouts this fall with other college players from Dartmouth and UMass. Zinn has relished the opportunity to throw to live hitters, pitching each Friday in a series of loosely-organized scrimmages. Scouts have frequently shown up to the New England Baseball Complex in Northborough, Mass., to watch the training sessions.
Even though Zinn is not enrolled this semester, he has been doing research with a Boston College professor and participating in Harvard Business School’s CORe program, which involves a series of online classes in financial accounting, economics for managers, and business analytics. Meanwhile, both Seidl and Mrowka have been taking classes. Nonetheless, all of the roommates have found ample time to focus on baseball.
“It’s been up to us to create our own schedule as opposed to having team lifts at consistent times with everyone else throughout the week, so we’ve been able to work out a little bit more and play a little bit more than we normally would have,” Seidl said. “I feel like I’m busy. We are pretty busy.”
Off the field and outside the classroom, Zinn, Seidl, and Mrowka have continued to strengthen their friendships, build deep camaraderie, and deepen trust that each of them describes as crucial aspects of Harvard Baseball.
“I don’t think there’s ever been a day where I’ve been in a locker room and not laughed,” Mrowka said.
“In the locker room before the game, with everyone joking around, that’s the stuff that’s special about college athletics. [It’s] the people,” Zinn added.
Seidl, a 6’1” outfielder from Wellesley, Mass., credits the locker room bonding as an important reason for the success of the 2019 team that went 27-16 (14-7 Ivy League) and claimed the Ivy League championship.
“I think the chemistry is what allows the talent to actually take place,” he said. “But talent isn’t much unless those guys are able to play at the best of their abilities, and I think the chemistry is what allowed those guys to play free and get everything they could out of those seasons.”
While the Ivy League has not yet made a decision on whether or not there will be a season in Spring 2021, the daily training and bonding will make Zinn, Seidl, and Mrowka as prepared as can be if there is one. The Ivy League has delayed the start of any spring sports to at least the end of February, and 2020-21 winter sports have been canceled, but the prospects of a spring season at some point in 2021 are still on the table. Because the 2020 season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard is still the defending Ivy League champion. Mrowka, a 5’11” infielder who contributed seven RBIs in the championship-winning 2019 season, cited the potential to retain the crown as one of the team’s primary motivations.
“There’s going to be a time where I’m going to be playing baseball again, but we don’t really know when that’s going to be,” Siedl said. “But I’ll need to be ready and all that’s going to matter is how I perform then and how we perform then. That’s what keeps me motivated. There will come a time that we will play again, and I’m going to be ready.”
