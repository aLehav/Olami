After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew both competed in Worcester, Mass. on Sunday for the EARC Sprints championship. While the heavyweights were defeated in the first varsity race, they came away with a freshman eight title and an overall team win.  The lightweights secured the varsity title for the second year in a row and placed second as a team.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavyweights secured their 32nd Rowe Cup for overall team performance due to their success on the water this weekend. The freshman eight placed first in both its heat and the grand final. In the final race, the Crimson took an early lead but Northeastern continued to push them to the finish. Harvard edged out the Huskies by 2.2 seconds, completing the course in 6:02.621.
“The races went great for the freshmen,” said captain Michael DiSanto, seven seat of the first varsity boat. “That was really good to see because they are a good group of guys and it is their first year here. The future of the program is in good hands with them.”
The first varsity race proved to be a heated contest between Brown and the Crimson in the final stretches. Harvard had the lead at the halfway point, but the Bears were able to pull ahead at the end of the race and finish less than a second in front of the Crimson.  This second place finish was the varsity’s first loss of the season.
“We felt that we had a good race,” DiSanto said. “There is nothing more that we could have done differently.  It is frustrating, but you can’t be too down about it. It is tough to lose, but if you are going to lose that is how it should be done.”
The second varsity eight also had a close second place finish behind Wisconsin.  The third varsity eight and second freshman eight both finished third in 6:14.856 and 6:47.721, respectively.  The fourth varsity boat edged out Brown by just over two seconds to win its race.
The heavyweights’ next challenge is the Harvard-Yale Regatta in two weeks before they compete at IRA National Championships.
“We are going to train hard,” DiSanto said. “We want to get faster. That is the mentality of everyone in the program.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
With two straight first-place finishes, both in the heat and the grand final, the No. 1 lightweights' first varsity eight secured the EARC Sprints title. Harvard repeated its victory from last year to record its 26th Sprints championship.
In the morning heat, the Crimson faced tough competitors Princeton, Yale, Navy and Penn. Harvard edged out Princeton by 2.088 seconds, and then had to prepare itself for the final race.
“We knew we had to do two things today: win the heat and then the final,” said senior Angela Chang, coxswain of the first varsity eight. “Right after the heat we were just trying to recover as quickly as possible. The turnaround was pretty short so it was important that everyone stay focused to get ready for the big event of the day.”
Once again, the Crimson crew was slated to race Ivy League rivals Princeton and Yale.  The first varsity eight had defeated both schools at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton regatta, their final, and most heated, dual race of the season.
“I am really proud that we were able to stay composed going to the starting line, especially in a championship race," Chang said. "There is a lot of adrenaline rush and a lot of high emotion, but we were able to execute our race plan.”
Harvard took the lead early on in the race and held on to win in 6:22.510, defeating Dartmouth by a margin of 2.2 seconds.
“We had a headwind that picked up for our race, the last race of the day,” said senior Tim Moore, six seat of the first varsity eight. “All credit is due to Dartmouth and Princeton and the rest of the crews for pushing us all the way down the course. We never felt comfortable with our lead. Under tough conditions it was good to see us maintain our cool and come away with a win.”
The second freshman eight also had a successful outing, winning the grand final race in 6:33.407.  The second varsity placed fourth in its heat and then went on to edge out Georgetown by less than a second to take the petite final race.
In the first freshman eight race, the Crimson faced off against Yale and Princeton. The Harvard crew placed third, 1.3 seconds behind the Tigers. The third varsity boat finished in second behind Cornell in their grand final race.
“I was really pleased with how we rowed and coming away with a win always feels good, but we have more work to do yet,” Moore said. “We are eager for these next three weeks of more training. We still have a really important race ahead of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite increased public discussion in recent weeks over the possibility of introducing a postseason tournament to Ancient Eight men’s and women’s basketball, the Ivy League athletic directors have blocked proposed plans for a four-team playoff, instead voting to maintain the league’s current system for crowning a conference champion.
“After careful consideration of these proposals, the athletics directors decided that our current method of determining the Ivy League Champion and our automatic bid recipient to the NCAA Championship is the best model moving forward," Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris said in a statement last week.
In April, Ivy League coaches put forward a proposal for a four-team playoff, a plan that would end the league’s practice of crowning a champion based on which team has the best record at the end of the double round-robin regular season. This season, the Crimson men’s basketball team claimed the Ivy title while the women finished in second place to Princeton and played in the Women's National Invitation Tournament.
The Ivy League is the only current Division I conference that does not determine its men’s and women’s March Madness bids by postseason tournaments.
The implementation of a playoff system has been discussed among Ivy officials before. According to Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, the possibility has been brought up time and time again during the 30 years she has served as coach.
“Some of the coaches on the women’s side have been fighting for that ad nauseam,” Delaney-Smith said.“We have exhausted every argument.”
This time though, things seemed different.
For one, the creation of postseason contests in the past decade in other Ivy sports, including lacrosse and softball, has increased the strength of the basketball coaches’ arguments with league officials. In addition, more of the coaches of the men’s basketball teams have thrown their support behind a tournament.
In the past, the men’s programs at traditional Ivy standouts Penn and Princeton have opposed the plan, according to Delaney-Smith. In the past few years, the increased strength of the league—in part due to the Crimson’s emergence as a basketball powerhouse—has created a new culture in Ivy League basketball, encouraging the men’s coaches to come out full force in support of a tournament.
In April, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker told the Crimson he sees the advantages of a tournament for the league.
“I have been in favor of ways for us to increase our brand of Ivy League basketball for the future,” he said. ”I have been in favor of ways for us to increase our brand of Ivy League basketball for the future.”
Even with their backing, the coaches’ proposal was shot down once again at the annual athletic directors’ meeting in Red Bank, N.J.
In a statement released by his school at the time of the proposal, Penn Athletic Director Steve Bilsky foreshadowed the plan’s demise.
“Over the years there has been wide-ranging discussion on the merits of a men's basketball tournament,” Bilsky said. “There are many philosophical, as well as logistical, issues and challenges to consider. In my opinion, to date the reasons not to have a tournament have been much more compelling than the reasons to sponsor one.”
Response to the potential plan, along with its demise last week, has been relatively mixed.
In April, Brandyn Curry '13, a guard for the Harvard men’s basketball team,  tweeted his agreement with Bilsky’s position.
“Honestly I think the way the ivy does it Is how every conference should,” Curry wrote.
But Delaney-Smith expressed her disappointment in the rejection of the plan.
“It’s unfortunate that we are one of the few leagues in the country that doesn’t have a tournament,” Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I love tournaments. The tournament experience is wonderful for student-athletes, everyone loves it.”

While recovering from knee surgery may have required Jeremy Lin ’10 to sit out the NBA playoffs, all is not lost for the Harvard alum this summer.
According to a report by NBC ProBasketballTalk’s Kurt Helin, Lin was named to the USA Select team, a group of about thirteen guys who scrimmage and work against the actual Olympic team during the latter’s training.
Lin is joined by those such as soon-to-be-announced Rookie of the Year Kyrie Irving, last year’s Rookie of the Year runner-up John Wall, and Bulls standout Taj Gibson.
The select team is considered to be those young players in the NBA who the Olympic coaching staff would like to observe for future consideration for the national team.
Though Lin’s Knicks could not defeat the Miami Heat in the first round of the postseason, Lin will have his own personal chance to battle a different heat when he travels to Las   Vegas this summer for training as one of the members of this select team.
