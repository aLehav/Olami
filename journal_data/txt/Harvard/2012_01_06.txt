After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two months after the beginning of its search for a new head football coach, Penn State has selected New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien to replace Joe Paterno as the head football coach at Penn State University, ESPN.com has reported.
Like Harvard coach Tim Murphy, who was rumored to be a favorite for the job earlier in the process, O’Brien has Ivy League connections, having played and coached at Brown.
With 19 years of coaching experience at both the collegiate and professional level, O’Brien is the third consecutive Penn State coach to have Brown affiliations. Paterno also suited up for the Bears between 1946 and 1949, and his predecessor, Rip Engle, coached Paterno at Brown.
O’Brien’s selection marks the end of a wild search that began following the Jerry Sandusky scandal and Paterno’s subsequent dismissal. Murphy—known for his historic success on the field and his clean track record off of it—was almost immediately named as a favorite, with one betting site even giving the 18-year Crimson coach 4-1 odds of nabbing the post.
Yet throughout the process, Murphy insisted that Penn State never contacted him, a claim corroborated by Russ Rose, the Penn State women’s volleyball coach and a member of the six-person search committee. Recently, Murphy disappeared from any rumors and was replaced by many others, including Boise State coach Chris Petersen and O’Brien.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a historic run in non-conference play, the Harvard men’s basketball team (12-2) is set to begin its quest for its first ever outright Ivy League title when Dartmouth (3-12) visits Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday.
The Crimson enters league play coming off its second defeat of the season, a road loss to Fordham that will likely knock Harvard out of the Top 25.  But rather than lamenting the loss, the Crimson is hoping to bring a renewed focus into its Ancient Eight schedule.
“I’m never proud of losses,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.  “But … sometimes these things can be a blessing in disguise if you handle it, use it, and channel it the right way. I’m confident in our leadership, and I’m hopeful our team will respond to the loss and see if we can get better from it.”
Co-captain Oliver McNally echoed his coach’s sentiments and believes Harvard must focus on itself rather than on the rest of the Ivy League and nation.
“We’re not going to be ranked next week, and that’s never a good thing, but everyone knows we need to get back to square one,” the senior said.  “I think we have done that the past couple of days.”
The Crimson will begin by focusing on its offense, which struggled to score against Fordham’s strong zone defense.
“Our defense has won games for us this season and won us a championship down in the Bahamas,” Amaker said. “We haven’t clicked yet offensively … and if we get into an offensive groove with how we’ve done defensively, I think we have the chance to be a special team.”
On Saturday afternoon, the Crimson will get a chance to connect all facets of its game against a Big Green team that has struggled to perform consistently all season.
Despite some strong individual performances from junior R.J. Griffin and freshman Gabas Maldunas, Dartmouth is currently riding a five-game losing streak in which the Big Green has let four halftime leads slip away.  Dartmouth has also failed to win close contests—dropping eight games by six or fewer points this season—and road games—going 1-9 away from Hanover.
But the Big Green should not be overlooked. When Dartmouth visited Lavietes Pavilion last season, the Big Green took a six-point lead into halftime before the Crimson closed the game on a 33-18 run. With the memory of last year’s matchup in mind, the Crimson is making sure it doesn’t take its visitors lightly.
“Dartmouth is a team that has been very good against us,” Amaker said. “We have a lot of respect for any team in our league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ready or not, the real season begins now.
 
The 14-game tournament that is the Ivy League regular season tips off on Saturday, with the No. 21 Harvard men’s basketball team (12-2) taking on Dartmouth (3-12) at Lavietes Pavilion at 2:00 p.m.
 
After surging through most of its non-conference schedule, the Crimson hit its first real bump in the road when it lost at Fordham on Tuesday night, the only blemish on its schedule thus far other than a respectable loss at No. 8 UConn.
 
Though the defeat to the Rams exposed a number of Harvard’s weaknesses, the Crimson cannot afford many slip-ups against any of its Ancient Eight opponents.
 
With no postseason tournament in the Ivy League, the conference’s representative in the Big Dance is determined by the team with the best regular season league record. That means each contest is as important as any other, and every game—as Harvard learned after losing at Yale by a point last season—can have major postseason implications.
 
“You can’t get any game back in the Ivy League,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “We know that. I’ve got to do a better job getting the point across to all the younger guys.”
 
This year, the road to March Madness should be even tougher for the Crimson, which learned Tuesday night that with its Top-25 ranking and all the national media attention also comes a major target on its back. Playing on the road is always difficult in college basketball, but it should be even more so this year for Harvard, which will be traveling to its rivals’ gyms as a favorite that the home fans will be hungry to see upset.
 
And in conference play, there are no guarantees, as then-No. 22 Cornell learned in 2010, when it lost by 15 at Penn—which to that point was 3-16—in front of a rowdy crowd at the Palestra.
 
But the Crimson gets to start things off at the comforts of home, where it holds the nation’s ninth-longest home winning streak at a program-record 21 games, against one of the worst statistical teams in the country.
 
The Big Green has an R.P.I. of 341—fifth poorest in the nation out of 345 Division I programs—and the squad’s 58.6 points per game average ranks 327th. Dartmouth’s only wins this season have come against Elon, a 1-13 Bryant squad, and Division III Alaska-Anchorage.
 
That being said, the Crimson is not taking anyone lightly. Last year, the Big Green—which finished 5-23 overall and 1-13 in the conference—gave Harvard a major scare at Lavietes, holding a 12-point second-half lead before the Crimson rallied to pull ahead and eventually win by nine.
 
In this season’s contest, McNally emphasized the necessity of starting quickly, something that Harvard has not been able to doing of late.
 
“We got lucky in a couple games,” the guard said. “We came back against BC and pulled it out against St. Joe’s after being down behind early. We can’t keep living like that. We used to be a team that got a lot of quick starts, and we haven’t been doing that. We’ve got to get back to doing whatever that was.”
 
Big Green guard R.J. Griffin had 20 points in last year’s near-upset, and this season the junior enters as his squad’s leading scorer at 9.9 points per game. Freshman forward Gabas Maldunas has contributed 9.1 points and 6.8 rebounds, while talented senior guard Jabari Trotter averages 8.1 points. Wings David Rufful, Jvonte Brooks, and John Golden also average over six points per contest.
 
That type of multifaceted offensive attack is what Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker believes is the strength of his squad, and something the Crimson needs to return to.
 
“We have to have balance,” Amaker said. “When we’re not shooting the ball well from the perimeter, it’s not going to help [co-captain] Keith Wright on the inside. ... [But] if someone is not having an opportunity, that’s not the worst thing in the world for us because others are going to have opportunities and those are the things we’re going to cash in on.”
 
Though the Fordham loss might have been seen as representing a wake-up call for a team with aspirations greater than simply winning the Ancient Eight, Amaker said he hoped his team was beyond the need for such losses.
 
“[That game was] not indicative of who we are,” Amaker said. “We’ve played a tremendous non-conference schedule and we were fairly successful throughout. [Dartmouth] is up next, and hopefully we can be prepared for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A goal and an assist from both senior forward Alex Killorn and junior defenseman Danny Biega helped the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-4-5, 3-3-3 ECAC) come back to tie divisional foe No. 14 Union (9-5-6, 3-2-3) on Friday night in Schenectady, N.Y.
Shortly after the puck dropped to open the contest, the Dutchmen took control. Union second-line right-winger Wayne Simpson scored the first goal of the game just 1:05 in.
The rest of the period also belonged to the Dutchmen, which outshot the visitors, 13-4. In one six-minute interval, the hosts fired off a streak of 16 unanswered attempts directed towards the net. But the Crimson managed to keep Union off the scoreboard for the rest of the period, thanks in part to freshman goaltender Steve Michalek, who finished with 33 saves on the night, including three in overtime. The 36 shots Michalek faced is near the most he has seen all season.
“I knew that the story on Union is that they like to throw the puck on the net every chance they get,” Michalek said. “I knew that I had to just get ready for that and be able to control my rebounds. The defense did a good job of denying those second chances, so we stuck to our defensive game plan pretty well, and it worked out.”
Both teams’ power plays sparked offense in the second period. Harvard’s first taste of success came four minutes in on a puck put on net from the circle by junior forward Alex Fallstrom. The assists on the equalizer were credited to Killorn and junior forward Marshall Everson.
Union responded, and the Dutchmen’s first line and defensive pairing struck twice while on the ice together, with a goal each from Mat Bodie and Daniel Carr.
Like in many of its previous contests, Harvard found itself down late. Trailing at the end of the second period, 3-1, the Crimson was not deterred.
“[Donato] came in between the second and third period and really got us going,” Fallstrom said. “He emphasized the importance of this game and made some really good points.”
And Harvard fought back, riding another power-play goal. This one came off the stick of a red-hot Killorn, who has tallied nine goals and nine assists in 13 games this season. The redirection was the result of a quick feed by Biega, who went on to knot the score at three apiece seven minutes into the period.
Biega’s goal would prove to be the decisive one, as neither team would convert on its other opportunities. In the tame five-minute overtime period, the Crimson would fail to record a shot on goal.
“We came out a bit flat,” Fallstrom said. “But we made a really strong comeback, which I think shows how strong the [team’s] character is. I’m really impressed with the overall effort after the first half of the game.”
Overall, Harvard was outshot, 36-26. While Union went a respectable 2-for-4 on its power play, the Crimson converted on both of its opportunities to improve its power-play percentage to a nation-best 34.4, with an even more impressive 35.6 percent in conference games.
“It looked like they had the slight edge,” Michalek said. “But during the game, there were times that we really dominated them.”
The draw moves Harvard into a four-way tie for fourth place in the ECAC standings behind only Cornell, Colgate, and Quinnipiac.
After nearly a month recess from league play, the Crimson picked up right where it left off. Harvard has now been awarded at least a point against five of its last six league opponents, posting a 3-1-2 record over this span.
The game between the two squads provided a taste for what is to come on one of the biggest stages of each team’s respective seasons. The next battle between the two will take place on Jan. 13 at Fenway Park, where the Crimson will host the tenth-ever outdoor collegiate hockey matchup.
“Really big game; that’s going to be fun,” Fallstrom said of next week’s Fenway showdown. “Now we really know what we are up against. We know that they have one of the best teams in our league, and I think this game shows that we are going to be able to play with them, and we are going to be able to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a three-game winning streak coming into Princeton’s Baker Rink, the No. 8 Harvard women's ice hockey team  failed to extend its run, falling to the Tigers, 3-0, in a Friday night ECAC matchup in Princeton, N.J.
"We always get fired up to play Princeton, but it just didn't go our way tonight," captain Alisa Baumgartner said.  "Princeton is always a battle. They play hard, they skate fast.  Every time they see Harvard on their schedule, they get fired up to play us, so we have to bring it every single night."
The Tigers' (7-9-3, 6-6-1 ECAC) win was their first in a month, but it marked Princeton’s second straight win over the Crimson (9-5-0, 6-3-0).  Harvard has not topped the Tigers since the ECAC quarterfinal game in February of 2010.
The Crimson looked like it had drawn first blood just 49 seconds into the contest, but the score was rescinded when officials ruled that the puck had been kicked past the Tiger netminder. After that, the Harvard attack—which had scored eight goals three days earlier against Connecticut—never ignited and failed to score the rest of the way.
Both defenses limited the opposition during the majority of the first period.  Junior Laura Bellamy stopped eight shots throughout the frame—one during a Princeton power play—keeping up with Tiger senior Rachel Weber's eight stops.
The game remained tied at zero until Princeton sophomore Sally Butler put the Tigers up 1-0 with 1:28 left to play in the first frame.
"We can't use [the called-back goal] as an excuse," Baumgartner said.  "We had plenty of time to put the puck in the net.”
In the following period, although Harvard had two power plays, giving the team a chance to turn the game in its favor, the Princeton defense stayed strong.  The Tigers outshot the Crimson, 9-7, but both goaltenders kept sharp, blocking all shots fired and keeping the status quo.
Princeton's stingy defense held during the final frame, as Harvard only managed four shots on goal.  And the Tigers offense wasn’t finished yet, firing nine shots at Bellamy and scoring twice.
"All their chances came from mistakes that we had made," Baumgartner said.  "So we gave them all the opportunities and unfortunately they capitalized on them and made it 3-0."
Princeton’s second goal of the evening came early in the final period.  At the 3:06 mark, Butler once again snuck one past the Harvard defense and put the puck behind Bellamy, giving the hosts a two-goal lead.
The Crimson faced major disadvantages in the frame, racking up five penalties.  For the most part, Harvard's defense kept together, rendering most of the Tigers' hunts for points during power plays fruitless.  Princeton was only able to capitalize on the fourth power play of the period with a goal by senior Danielle DiCesare with just under seven minutes left to play.
"We have been working on the penalty kill and I think it went pretty well for us," sophomore Marissa Gedman said. "One of the best things we had last night was that even though we were down a goal and then two and three, we stayed positive and we didn't give up till the last buzzer.  It's good that our team sticks together when things aren't going as well."
With just 6:34 remaining in the game, Harvard wasn't able to make a comeback, giving the victory to the Tigers with a final score of 3-0.
"I think we got away from doing the little things right," Baumgartner said.  "That's something that Harvard hockey always does.  We take care of the fundamentals and we get the little things, the simple things, and I think...instead of Princeton beating us, we beat ourselves."
