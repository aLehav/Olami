After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States takes pride in its democratic system to the extent of feeling compelled to spread democracy across the world.  However, to be rightfully applied, democracy requires that the rights of the people to be assured.  Police officers ensure that the individuals abide by the law and that their rights are respected.  Yet sometimes, the rights of the people have to be protected from the protectors themselves.
The exclusionary rule, which bans the use of improperly obtained evidence in criminal trials, has been strongly asserted by the U.S. Supreme Court for nearly a century in order to make sure that police officers don’t disregard individuals’ rights while conducting an investigation.  But recently, in an unprecedented ruling, the Supreme Court decided in Herring v. United States that evidence obtained through police “negligence” is permissible in court. This creates a loophole in the exclusionary rule that is not acceptable.  The rules governing an investigation have to be well defined in order to respect people’s rights.  Allowing evidence obtained unlawfully due to negligence can create a gray area that will allow further intrusion of police officers into the lives of citizens.
The Court’s decision could give rise to a world in which policemen plead “negligent” as a cover-up for violations of individuals’ rights in a variety of circumstances.  For example, policemen might conduct unwarranted searches claiming that they forgot to file the warrant papers or that they thought they had a warrant even though insufficient evidence existed to obtain one.
In addition, the consequences of such a ruling will be felt disproportionately along the socioeconomic spectrum, as socioeconomically disadvantaged citizens are more likely to be harassed by police officers.  Racial minorities will likely suffer from increased mistreatment too.  Bearing in mind that these vulnerable groups often lack adequate legal defense and counsel, this ruling will cause many injustices.
Although more rigid application of the exclusionary rule might lead to some criminals escaping the hand of the law, this is a necessary sacrifice to create a fairer justice system for all.  Looking at the broader picture, enforcement of the exclusionary rule will lead to the protection of the privacy and rights of all citizens instead of making them vulnerable to the abuse of the authorities.
The Supreme Court has taken a dangerous decision by allowing evidence obtained illegally to be used in a trial. For a democracy to flourish, no one can be above the law. We would rather have police procedures follow strict and clear rules in order to ensure citizens’ rights and privacy than catch the occasional extra criminal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As most of the nation celebrated a hallmark of racial reconciliation on Tuesday, Oakland stood apart. For the past two weeks, the California city has been engulfed by racially tinged protests over the brutal New Years Day killing of 22-year old Oscar Grant III by transit officer Johannes Mehserle. Grant and a few friends were returning home from New Years Eve revelry, when they were stopped by Bay Area Rapid Transit Police for rowdy behavior.  As documented by several amateur cell phone videos, Grant, who was unarmed, appeared to act cooperatively. Mehserle, however, threw him facedown onto the ground, and straddled his back while another officer squatted near Grant’s neck. Mehserle then drew his gun and fired into Grant’s back.  The officer has resigned, but now faces murder charges to which he has pleaded not guilty.
Certainly, this specific incident should be condemned on all fronts. Grant’s shooting was unwarranted, and so were the transit officers’ hyper aggressive and disrespectful treatment of Grant and his cohorts throughout the episode. The fact that Grant was black and Mehserle is white has aggravated the charges of misconduct.
The shooting, however, should prompt police and law enforcement generally to reflect upon the culture of police and civilian relationships. Given the pervasiveness of police brutality, it is clear that something has gone awry in police culture. While we cannot speak to the effectiveness or quality of training that cops receive, these processes stand to be reevaluated in light of this incident. Citizens must be able to trust that the police will protect them while respecting their personal liberties. Stricter limitations and guidelines must be set in order to ensure that the police mistreat no one.
According to Justice Department statistics, cases in which law enforcement authorities have used excessive force or tactics to violate victim’s civil rights have increased 25 percent between fiscal years 2001 and 2007 —and the overwhelming majority of police brutality cases referred by investigators are never formally prosecuted.  The Oakland incident has engendered such protest because it confirms, with a live videotape, the suspicions many civilians have about the integrity of their police. This issue is salient around the country. Last year, New York City police officers frisked more than 500,000 people, although they arrested only 4 percent of them. Of those frisked, 80 percent were black or Latino. 
The imperative for restraint goes further than the obvious need for cops to take care with loaded guns. Brutality is not defined by a weapon but by a mentality; it can occur with a baton, Taser or even bare fists. The mistake is not in the specific physical harm done by the police, but by the general propensity to abuse these positions of power.
Police departments might need to make unprecedented changes in order to ensure the integrity of police protection. This may mean reducing the number of armed cops on the street, or reevaluating exactly which cops truly need guns to facilitate their duties. For example, in the Bay Area, transit police are employed to preserve the safety of transit riders.  In the majority of cases, a gun might not be needed to fulfill this objective, as shown by this recent incident, guns may counter that purpose. Departments could, alternatively, become more stringent about the police’s freedom to use lethal force. Drawing a gun should be a very last resort—a tactic used when an officer’s life is at stake and shooting would be the only sufficient defense.
Oscar Grant is not the first to die from police brutality, but his murder has made headlines as one of the best documented. We hope this attention can be channeled into constructive change.

Last Friday I attended a performance of my sister’s rock band at what I can only describe as an “alternative artspace” in Venice Beach, Calif., where the walls in the lobby were covered exclusively with posters and paintings of Barack Obama. In a place like Venice Beach where hardly a car drives by that doesn’t have a Yes We Can bumper sticker, the Obama motif is nothing new, but these depictions of the President-elect had an unmistakable messianic quality to them. 
To be sure, Obama as Messiah is not a new idea. His biggest champions as well as his fiercest critics have been encouraging the comparison since the early days of the primaries. The sentiment even reached beyond America’s borders—he was deemed “Der Weltpräsident” (the world president) by Der Spiegel, the German weekly news magazine—and if anything the Obama as Messiah image has only become more prevalent in the months since his election. He now enjoys an 83 percent approval rating, 22 and 15 percentage points higher than his two immediate predecessors, George Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively.  As throngs of supporters estimated at 1.8 million descended upon Washington, D.C. for the Second Coming (I count myself among their ranks), Obama as Messiah has reached a fever pitch. 
Yet, even while I am wholeheartedly caught up in Obamania, I nonetheless can’t help but think back to this fall, which I spent in Ashtabula County, Ohio, campaigning for Obama. I was a field organizer in the mostly rural townships in the southern part of the county where I spent my days knocking on the doors and calling the homes of undecided voters. My experience in the rural stretches of Ashtabula Country was that people weren’t seeing Obama in messianic terms. 
Ashtabula is in the northeastern corner of the state, between Cleveland and Erie, Penn., and it is perhaps Ohio’s most economically depressed county. The passing of a couple of months means another plant closing, families losing jobs and healthcare coverage. Homes everywhere are being foreclosed. The mall has almost as many empty storefronts as occupied ones. There is no Starbucks in Ashtabula. The home I lived in the first month I was there didn’t have cell phone reception, and many people in the southern half of the county—everything south of the 90 freeway—can’t get access to high speed Internet. 
The vast number of people I spoke to while canvassing the small towns, farms, and Amish communities of southern Ashtabula County just wanted answers to questions like, “How will I provide my family with healthcare if I lose my job?” and “Which of these candidates is going to bring jobs back to where I live?” The 100,000 or so residents were in a sense primed for Obama’s economic message, and this reflected in the fact that 56% voted him in. Still, at no point was messianic fervor in evidence in Ashtabula County. The voters in my county were more in a “show me the money” than a “the Second Coming is upon us” mode.
Race didn’t figure into the calculus very significantly. There was of course the occasional yahoo who chased me off his lawn accusing me of being a traitor to my race. (And I was once asked by an older couple who nevertheless assured me they were voting Democrat whether I was the “right color for that job” when I announced myself as an Obama campaign worker.) But for most people, questions about religion or race were largely overshadowed by economic considerations. 
Many Ashtabula voters were confirmed Clintonites who didn’t ask themselves whether the Black candidate was going to represent their interests as a white person. The question on their minds was whether the big city, Harvard educated lawyer shared and was willing to protect the values of a rural Ohioan. To them, Obama’s election wasn’t about members of the elite trying to chase the cowboys out of the White House. It was about what the Democrats can do for “me,” to restore security and maybe a little optimism to their sometimes hopeless lives. In exchange, they were willing to look past what many sensed was a values divide. The main appeal to the people of Ashtabula County was that electing Barack Obama would have a direct impact on their own lives. 
In short, Obama as messiah wasn’t in the air in Ashtabula. Indeed, for some, it was to the contrary. In the course of a Saturday afternoon spent canvassing Roaming Shores, a planned lakeside community, one of my volunteers came across a voter who, when prompted to for her preference among the candidates for President said, “Oh, don’t worry, I’m voting for Obama,” and enigmatically added, “but, you know…right?” Know what? “Well, that he’s the antichrist!” My dutiful volunteer, a regular churchgoer, had to ask: “How do you reconcile yourself to voting in the man you believe is Lucifer?” “Well, I’ve got to tell you that it was one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make, but when I saw McCain’s tax plan…”

Reading the obituaries of painter Andrew Wyeth after his death last Friday, I had a crisis of confidence.
The art establishment hated Wyeth for much of his career. He was a regionalist and a realist when the vogue was abstract expressionism, a plainspoken farmer among chain smoking wildmen. He was the country mouse; they were the city mice. He had nothing new to show them, and they had no time for him.
The thing was, though: everyone else loved him. Wyeth was the first artist to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and the farmhouse depicted in his most famous single work, “Christina’s World,” is the only building to make the National Register of Historic Places for being the subject of a painting. No one less infamous than Richard Nixon, toasting Wyeth at the White House, said that his paintings “captured the heart of America.” 
This is where I start to have problems.
I really believe—and heck, my column is premised on it—that there is such a thing as a national sensibility. This singular, essential taste guides our behavior not just where art and entertainment are concerned, but also in government, politics, law—in everything.
All the discord surrounding Wyeth made that seem a little foolish. Is it really possible to “capture the heart of America?” You can make the argument that, if anyone could, Wyeth did. He took for his subject none other than the great American landscape. His subjects were plainspoken farmers, windswept grasses, people who worked hard and took pride in sacrifice. You know, Amurricans.
But what about progress? What’s more American than that? Rob Storr, the dean of the Yale University School of Art, called Wyeth “anti-modern,” and the posthumous consensus is that he gave the “silent majority”  that were his fans the illusion of an America that no longer existed. Wyeth did his best-remembered work in the post-WWII 1940s, when America was just testing its strength as a world power. America had growing pains, and Wyeth was prescribing the opiate nostalgia.
I have to say, though, that I don’t just see nostalgia in Wyeth’s paintings. I happened to be in New York the day he died, and was able to spend a good, long time in front of “Christina’s World,” which the Museum of Modern Art has held since 1949. Christina was a real acquaintance of Wyeth’s, and following a childhood illness was paralyzed from the waist down. She refused to use a wheelchair, and instead grabbed and crawled her way through the physical and metaphoric world. In the painting we can see only her back, laid out on the yellow grasses, tending all the force of her mind and body toward the gray, dilapidated farmhouse at the top of the long hill. This is not an ideal of the way life once was, but rather, at least as I see it, a parable of just dealing with it, which Wyeth happened to set in the fields of Pennsylvania that he knew and loved.
Of all the comparisons between Wyeth and other regionalist/realists of the period—Winslow Homer, Norman Rockwell—the best is to Edward Hopper. As the abstract painter Mark Rothko put it, “Wyeth is about the pursuit of strangeness, but he is not whole, as Hopper is whole.” I can accept that Wyeth is perhaps not the best of his contemporaries. But that they passed him by entirely? Never.
I’m with Rothko on this one. Wyeth chose representation, Rothko chose abstraction, but at bottom their work expresses that common, shared experience of not really being sure what America is anymore.
Bear with me, but it took yesterday’s inauguration to cure me of my doubts once and for all. I grew up in Nebraska, where the prairies are broad and the minds are narrow. Or so I thought. My hometown, which comprises Nebraska Congressional District Two, split the state’s electoral votes for the first time, and gave one to Barack Obama, as blue a Democrat as ever dared to take on the Red Sea of the Midwest.
I won’t try to make a far-fetched analogy between Wyeth and Obama, but I will say that I am heartened by that one electoral vote. On Nov. 4, my hometown and I looked at America and picked Obama to lead it. Some might see America as a Wyeth painting, some might see it as Rothko, but in the end we all came to the same conclusion. Calling Wyeth “America’s painter” is a stretch, but whether his critics would agree or not, I am willing to grant him common footing with the most outré expressionist of his day. In other words, I’m back to believing.
Thank goodness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the January exam period draws to a close, many students are breathing sighs of relief at finishing their last ever post-winter break finals. Next year, Harvard will convert to a bi-semester calendar system, which moves exams to before the break, and therefore allows for a longer January vacation. Rationally, this should make me happy—there are plenty of good reasons to make the shift, and I benefit from these changes as much as anyone else. But as I begin to plan my final intersession, I can’t help but feel a little nostalgic.
Last year’s intersession remains one of my favorite Harvard memories. I went up to a friend’s house in Vermont with six other Harvard students, only one of whom I had previously met. After a week of toboggan races, barefoot ventures through the snow from the sauna to the ice pond, and impromptu guitar compositions by burning embers at twilight, I came out with a new group of friends I might never have met otherwise.
A prolonged winter break discourages these kinds of social activities. Under the current system, one can spend reading period at Harvard and a week-long intersession with friends; faced with a three-week long “J-term” in January, on the other hand, many students will likely pass both the two week winter break and the three week J-term at home.
There’s only so much time one can spend with family, though, and hanging out with friends from high school just makes one realize the toll time takes on old friendships. Realistically, the long break will mean a period of solitary confinement, spent glued to the television. For me, two weeks at home is enough—another minute in rural Concord, Massachusetts would make me implode. If I didn’t ever want to leave home, I would have gone to Williams.
	Harvard administrators suggest that the three weeks can be used to “encourage individual interests outside the University or provide enhanced educational opportunities such as study abroad, lab experiences, internships, and mini-courses.” But if one goal of the calendar reform was to decrease student stress levels, this is not the way to go about it.	
	Under the current calendar, for example, my break essentially begins at the culmination of fall classes and ends the first week of February, with just a few exams to interrupt my leisure. By allotting time for both studying and recreation, I can spend my never-ending reading period playing Halo until 5 a.m. on a weeknight and organizing epic games of snow football under dimly lit street lamps. Then I can look forward to an intersession of sledding down beautiful man-made jumps in Vermont.
	In contrast, the new calendar encourages students to compete for flash-in-the-pan job opportunities too short to do any real good. For those who have no desire to spend the break doing something careerist or academic—and I’d venture to guess I’m not the only one—three weeks in January is too long to spend on campus. The result is that people will be stuck spending the vacation’s entirety at home, watching the same episode of SportsCenter four times each morning, instead of reuniting with their Harvard friends for a week. Unforgettable breaks like mine are bound to become rarer.
	Certainly, I understand the necessity of the calendar alteration. Logistically, it allows students who don’t live 20 minutes away from campus to go home, and it ends the school year in early May, giving Harvard students a competitive advantage for summer jobs.
But come next year, as I’m shopping that dreaded Lit-C core, my mind will be less on Greek myths than on daydreams of my skis carving through fresh powder, during the intersession that could have been. Everybody should treasure this last intersession—I know I will.

A record-breaking number of more than 29,000 students have applied for spots in Harvard’s class of 2013, up about 5 percent from last year’s 27,462 applicants, the admissions office announced today. With an increase in applicants but the same number of spots available, this year’s admissions season is poised to be even more competitive than last year’s. 
“The admission rate will undoubtedly be lower,” said Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 in a phone interview yesterday. “We only have about 1,660 places in the freshman class. We know the Houses are full to capacity and there are no places to put students in the Yard. As last year, we will be conservative in April and take more students from the waitlist in case there is a significant jump in the yield.” 
Men make up 50.7 percent of applicants to the class of 2013 and women make up 49.3 percent. Applications have risen in greater Boston and the mid-Atlantic region, risen slightly in the South and West, and decreased slightly in the Northeast.
Other top universities expect an increase in applicants as well. The number of applications to Yale College is approaching 26,000, up from 22,817 applications last year, Dean of Admissions Jeff Brenzel told the Yale Daily News last week. Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania expect to report their applicant numbers later this week or early next week, according to deans of admission at both schools. The University of Virginia, who like Harvard eliminated early admission two years ago, received 21,750 applications, up 17 percent from last year, according to Senior Associate Dean of Admission Greg Roberts.  
There are several possible reasons for the increase in applicants, including last year’s expansion of financial aid and recruiting programs like the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. This year 78 percent of applicants will apply for financial aid, up 5 percent from last year. After last year’s elimination of early admissions, applications rose 20 percent, a possible result of the increased emphasis on recruiting during a time when admissions officers would have formerly been considering early admissions applications, according to the Harvard Gazette. 
One emphasis of recruiting efforts has been to sharpen the message that higher education is affordable for students from low-income backgrounds, said Fitzsimmons. Melanie B. Mueller '01, the director of HFAI, told the Gazette that the preliminary increase in African-American, Latino, and Asian-American applicants is partially due to the work of the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program. 
“Economic factors may affect demand greatly, and an increasing number of students in the next decade and beyond will come from less affluent families who will need to be encouraged to consider higher education,” Fitzsimmons told the Gazette. “Unless we are successful in reaching out to them, our nation will not realize its full potential.”  
Though Fitzsimmons said that the overall population of American high school seniors will vary relatively little in the next decade, he said that it is unclear how applicant trends will move in higher education in the future. 
“It depends on how severe the economic downturn is and whether or not that discourages students from applying especially from modest economic backgrounds,” Fitzsimmons said in a phone interview. “The question too is whether or not conditions in public schools across the country deteriorate because of continued budget cuts at state and local levels that could have a negative effect on students as they come through the pipeline. That will have an effect on whether students feel ready to apply and whether they even graduate.”
