After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks after a similar controversial plan was put forward in New York City, the city of Cambridge is considering a ban on large servings of sodas in city restaurants.
At Monday evening’s City Council meeting, Mayor Henrietta J. Davis proposed a resolution to investigate the possibility of limiting the size of sodas and other sugary drinks in local restaurants.
“This is motivated from a concern about health and children’s health,” said Davis, who has served as co-chair of the Cambridge Healthy Children Task Force since 1990.
“All this positive work can only go so far when the environment is filled with two size servings of soda,” Davis said.
The resolution recommends that the Cambridge Public Health Department examine whether or not a ban on large servings of soda would help to reduce obesity. In an emailed statement, the city’s Chief Public Health Officer Claude-Alix Jacob wrote that the department would have a decision ready by the fall.
Davis noted the similarities between this resolution and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s initiative to limit sodas over sixteen ounces, an act that has drawn accolades from Alec Baldwin and criticism from the New York State Restaurant Association, which labeled the act the “latest in a long list of anti-restaurant initiatives.”
Though Cambridge’s actions have only begun to attract public attention, both good and bad, the possibility of a ban did attract criticism from local restaurant employees.
“I agree that people shouldn’t drink 32 ounces of soda, but I think people should have the right to,” said Michael H. Cleland, general manager and owner of Harvard Square’s Au Bon Pain.
Al’s Harvard Square Cafe manager Carlos Chicas expressed similar concerns, saying that once people reach a certain age, they should be able to drink whatever they want.
Other restaurant employees were unsure as to how effective a ban on large servings would be.
Luiz Prado, manager of the burger restaurant b.good, noted that customers who do not purchase the chain’s 24-ounce soda typically refill their 16-ounce cups multiple times during the course of their meal.
“[People] usually refill it twice while eating and once before they go,” Prado said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sign encouraging construction workers to “Show Respect for Harvard” has been taken down following student protest. The sign was posted by Shawmut Design and Construction at the construction site on the Science Center plaza and contained both Shawmut and Harvard logos.
“When a concern was raised last week, Shawmut quickly removed the sign and will not be reposting it,” wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal in an email to the Crimson.
Neal also noted that the sign “has been used by Shawmut at construction projects at Harvard and other academic campuses for years without complaint.”
The text of the sign informed workers that they are “working within an operational environment on a world famous campus,” and asked them to “please display the highest level of respect for the students, faculty, and their campus at all times.”
The sign noted that this meant no swearing, “inappropriate comments,” smoking, as well as “zero(!) tolerance for drugs and/or alcohol.” Workers were also expected to keep noise as low as possible, not park on campus, and were instructed to not enter any other campus buildings.
Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14 called the sign “ridiculous” and said that it made her uncomfortable because it was “patronizing and patriarchal” towards the construction workers.
“It sets up Harvard as some sort of exceptional place where no one can swear because they are defiling the purity of Harvard,” said Korn, a Crimson editorial editor.
Avinaash Subramaniam ’14 said that he was “shocked” by the sign and that it held workers to a different standard than Harvard students.
“There are students who drink and smoke at Harvard and the final clubs blast music late at night,” he said. “How is it any less wrong when Harvard students do drugs?”
It is “not really called for” to assume the construction workers smoke and drink, he added.
Although the University did not put up the sign, Divinity School student Hanna L. Hofheinz said it bears equal responsibility for the sign’s message.
“I think that the sign was expressive of class and social dynamics that too often are part of the Harvard ethos,” she said. “I expect more from Harvard than to allow this type of statement to be its public face.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 23, 2012, at 10:15 p.m.
AMC Loews Harvard Square 5, the multiplex movie theater across the street from Harvard Yard, will permanently close its doors on Sunday, July 8.
Ryan Noonan, the director of public relations for AMC Theatres, wrote in an emailed statement that the theater will be sold as part of a continual effort to improve the quality of the AMC theater chain.
“We encourage AMC guests to visit our other nearby AMC locations, including AMC Boston Common 19, which is approximately five miles away,” Noonan said in his email.
In addition to new releases, the Harvard Square theater hosted a weekly showing of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” every Saturday at midnight.  This tradition has lasted since 1984, when the showings moved from the Exeter Street Theater in Boston to Cambridge.
If the theater played the cult classic horror musical every Saturday night, then it has shown the movie roughly 1,500 times over the past 28 years. Viewers have three more chances to see the spectacle, on June 23, June 30, and July 7.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she thought the theater's lack of parking hurt its business.
“It’s wonderful that we have a theater that people can walk to, but I don’t think the numbers are sufficient to support that kind of a theater,” Jillson said.
Though AMC Harvard Square was not part of the HSBA, Jillson said that once the property is sold, the HSBA will reach out to the new owners.
“We do not know who the new owners are, but we are confident that whatever they bring to the Square will be exciting and new,” Jillson said.
Starbucks employee Stacy Harkins said that she did not think the closing would affect the Starbucks location on Church Street, as the movie theater did not allow people to bring outside beverages.
“I only think that stuff impacts us when stuff like Harry Potter rolls out,” Harkins said.

The Hundred Acre Wood just got a little smaller. Last week, the Harvard community was rocked when the tree known simply as "Pooh's House" was chopped down just outside the Science Center, leaving nothing but a stump. The tree first gained notoriety after its base was decorated with a red door, along with a miniature awning and sign bearing the name of the famous cartoon bear.
 
Public backlash following the tree’s removal was intense.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO," John L. Pulice '15 eloquently offered in a Facebook post.
 
It is widely speculated that Piglet was heard in the distance faintly yelping "Oh, d-d-d-dear!"
 
Over the years, the tree had become a fixture of campus culture, and Pooh-mania predates the tree. A 1946 Crimson article even refers to the creation of a "Pooh Club," a name which I'm sure sounded more tasteful written down on paper than spoken out loud.
 
Over the past decade, the tree served as a source of joy through two dark times—the removal of hot breakfast from all upperclass Houses and the Occupy Harvard movement. Of course, as we know, one was an extremely unpopular act during its time which seemingly served no purpose for students, sparking widespread annoyance and frustration on campus. The other was the removal of hot breakfast.
 
Though viewed for perhaps just a few seconds each day, the tree always seemed to lift the spirits of people walking by. For students, it was a reminder of the joy and excitement of childhood. For children, it was much more than that. It was the wonder of a fairy tale come to life, something which most kids can only dream of. Now that wonder has been torn away from them. I can hear the disappointment in their voices as they ask, "Daddy, where'd Pooh's house go? Daddy, why did they take Pooh away from us?"
 
I don’t know, sweetheart. I just don’t know.
 
“Oh, bother.”
