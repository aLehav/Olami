After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coast may have been different, but the result was the same for Laurent Rivard.
After shooting a combined 8 of 16 from deep during the Harvard men’s basketball team’s visit to California last week, the junior co-captain continued to make it rain from beyond the arc at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday. Rivard went five of seven from three-point range, helping the Harvard men’s basketball team past Rice with a season-high 21 points.
After the Owls pulled within three, 13-10, less than seven minutes into the contest, Rivard played an instrumental role in the Crimson’s run. The junior put a stop to the Crimson’s 4:36 scoring drought, knocking down his first triple of the night with 10:52 to go. It wasn’t long before he added No. 2 and No. 3, as Rivard drilled back-to-back three-pointers less than three minutes later to extend Harvard’s lead to 14 with 8:30 to play.
In the first half alone Rivard recorded 15 points—more than he totaled in all but four games so far this season.
Before it was all said and done, the junior added one more triple to give him five on the day—matching a season high.
“We need him to shoot,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He has a green light, and he’s the only one on our team who has that.”
The Crimson’s leading returning scorer entering the 2012-13 season, Rivard struggled at times early this season. Through Harvard’s first 10 contests, Rivard was shooting 39.3 percent from deep—down from his clip of 41.0 percent a season ago—and averaging 2.4 made three-pointers per contest.
But in the Crimson’s past three contests, Rivard has shot a combined 13 of 23 (56.5 percent) from three-point range and is averaging 16.3 points per game.
The difference?
“Just focus,” Rivard said. “I work on it everyday in practice. It’s got to fall some day, you know?”
Rivard has also been putting up more attempts from beyond the arc in recent contests: In his four most recent matchups, Rivard is averaging 7.75 three-point attempts compared to 5.88 through the Crimson’s first nine games.
But according to Rivard, he has not made a conscious effort to increase his shot total.
“I haven’t tried harder; I’ve just been running the offense,” Rivard said. “Guys are doing a great job of finding me.”
FRESH FACES
Two Harvard players dressed for their first game in a Crimson uniform on Saturday.
Freshman Patrick Steeves, who suffered a foot injury before the start of the season, exchanged the suit he wore for the Crimson’s first 12 games for a Harvard jersey.
A 6’7” wing from Quebec, Steeves impressed at Harvard’s preseason intrasquad scrimmage—posting a game-high 14 points—before going down with an injury.
Steeves did not appear in Saturday’s contest.
“Hopefully we ease him into things as we go along,” Amaker said.
Sophomore walk-on Charlie Anastasi made his first appearance on the Harvard bench. Anastasi, a 6’6” forward, had been practicing with the Crimson, which was left with just six post players following the departures of forwards Ugo Okam and Jeff Georgatos from the team earlier this season. Anastasi also did not appear in Saturday’s contest.
“[Anastasi] been a terrific addition for us in our practices,” Amaker said. “He’s a tough kid; he’s worked hard. Our team really, really likes him. He’s fit in very well in our locker room. He’s earned the right now to be on our team and dress for our home games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After failing to break double digits in scoring on Friday against the Milwaukee Bucks, Jeremy Lin ’10 put up 20 points during Saturday night’s contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers (8-27).
On the way to a road victory, 112-104, the Houston Rockets guard also contributed four rebounds and five assists. In the win, the Rockets (20-14) retained their position as first among all teams in points per game, with 106.2, and extended their winning streak to four games.
Lin had a standout second quarter that saw him score 14 of his 20 points and drill all three of his attempts from behind the arc. Lin finished the game shooting 60 percent on treys, much better than the 26 percent he was shooting coming in. His performance helped the Rockets, who trailed 26-20 at the close of the first frame, regain the lead heading into the locker room.
“Sometimes all it takes is one and for me I’m glad I was able to get some to drop tonight,” Lin said in a postgame interview. “It felt good.”
A big fourth quarter from Houston’s James Harden, who had a team-high 29 points on the night and 16 in the final stanza, helped the Rockets to seal the win. Harden and Lin had to contend with the Cavaliers’ main scoring threat of Kyrie Irving, who finished with a game-high 30 points. Irving had eight turnovers, many of which were caused by defensive pressure from Harden and Lin.
“He’s a heckuva player,” Lin said of the Cleveland point guard. “I tried to make it difficult for him, but he’s one heckuva player and he’s tough to stop.”
With the win, Houston is now 14-2 versus the Eastern Conference. The Rockets remain in sixth place in the West, two games behind the Memphis Grizzlies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While your fall semester classes are now a distant memory, here’s an unfortunate newsflash to sap the last bit of holiday spirit from your break: Grades are up.  Instead of regretting your multiple choice answers on that make-or-break final, or waiting anxiously to see if your last class’ results are in, take a break from your Student Record to see if some of your favorite fall sports made the grade this semester.
Football: B+/A-
 The Crimson got off to a hot start, winning its first five games of the season by an average of 27 points. But then came the midterm exam at Princeton, where Harvard saw its nation-best 14-game win streak come to an end with a 39-34 loss to the Tigers. The Crimson bounced back with a win at Dartmouth though, and then followed that up by routing Columbia, 69-0.  But Harvard failed to deliver when it mattered the most, losing 30-21 at Penn in the de-facto Ivy League championship game. It wasn't last year’s Ivy League championship season, but even with some hiccups on the road, the Crimson turned in a season full of solid performances and ended its term with a climactic fourth quarter finish to beat out rival Yale in the final test of the semester.  It was valiant effort, even without the Ivy Champ rings to show for it.
Men’s Soccer: C
To say the men’s soccer team had a disappointing season would be a bit of an understatement.  The Crimson went a dismal 3-11-3 on the season and failed to pick up a win against a conference foe, going 0-6-1 in Ivy League play.  If anything though, it was a season of near misses.  The Crimson fell just one goal short in seven of its losses, and the team went into overtime six times, only to come out with three ties and three losses.  Here’s to hoping the men’s team makes the grade by the time next season rolls around.
Cross Country: A
An appearance at the NCAA Championships for the first time in nearly three decades capped what the director of Harvard Cross Country/Track called a “historic season” for the women’s team.  On the men’s side, the Crimson finished sixth in the Northeast regional, its best finish since 2006, and also sent two runners to NCAAs.
Women’s Volleyball: B
The Crimson got off to a sluggish start, losing its first three matchups, then had a five-game losing streak to finish its non-conference slate with a 2-8 record.  But Harvard picked up some steam in the second half of the semester, going 7-7 against Ivy opponents to finish fourth in the league and only two wins away from a second-place finish.  It was a bumpy start, but we all know the second half of the semester counts more than the first, and some fine finishes down the stretch helped salvage what could’ve been a down season.
Field Hockey: C+
The Crimson went 3-13 this year, and 1-6 against Ivy opponents.  It was a tough first year for head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden, as Harvard saw its season end with an eight-game losing streak.  The Crimson finished tied with Brown at the bottom of the Ivy League standings, a sizeable drop from last year’s fifth-place finish and 8-9 overall record.
Men’s Water Polo: B
It was a year of fresh faces and fresh talent for the men’s water polo team.  With the bulk of its roster comprised of freshmen and sophomores, the young team got off to sluggish start, going 3-5 in the opening weeks.  But the Crimson hit its stride in the middle of the season, riding a nine-game win streak.  Harvard finished off the year with a 15-19 record after some tough losses to top-ranked teams on a California road trip and some close losses to Northeast opponents late in the season.  Look for Harvard to come in strong next year, when the underclassmen have a full season of collegiate play under their belts (or speedos, so to speak).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While you may still be in holiday mode, Harvard athletes are in the midst of a busy January filled with plenty of activity. Read on for a preview of five upcoming games that are sure to be exciting and crucial to rest of the season.
5. Men’s Squash at Princeton
On January 13, the Harvard men’s squash team (6-0, 1-0 Ivy) will visit Princeton hoping to defeat the defending national champions. The Tigers dismantled Trinity College at last year’s CSA national tournament to break the Bantams 13-year long hold on the title. Princeton was also victorious against the Crimson last season, halting a 10-game win streak last January as the Tigers won, 5-4. One can expect an exciting match at the No. 1 position between Harvard junior Ali Farag and Princeton senior Todd Harrity. Farag captured the CSA individual title in 2012 while Harrity won it in 2011, becoming the first American in over 21 years to do so. This year, both teams enter the contest undefeated; only one squad can leave retaining a perfect record in this critical conference matchup.
4. Women’s Squash at Princeton
Last season, a showdown with Princeton saw the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team edge the Tigers, 5-4. The contest was one of just two 5-4 matches for the Crimson all season. On the verge of losing an undefeated record, then-freshman Haley Mendez was down, 2-0, in the No. 4 position but came from behind, taking the final three games to win the tie-breaking match. This year, Harvard (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) will arrive at Princeton Jan. 13 hoping to prevail once again over a talented Tigers squad led by co-captain Julie Cerullo, who is undefeated at the No. 1 position this season. Cerullo lost, 3-0, at No. 1 to then-freshman Amanda Sobhy last year and fell to her again in the national individual semifinals as Sohby ultimately took the top prize. During a November scrimmage, the Crimson yet again squeezed out a win over Princeton, 5-4. Can they do it again next week?
3. Women’s Basketball vs. Dartmouth
After going through an up-and-down slate of challenging non-conference opponents, the Harvard women’s basketball team will finally open Ivy League play at home against Dartmouth Jan. 12. The Crimson (9-5) is coming off two strong wins against Massachusetts and Rhode Island and a difficult tournament in San Diego, where it fell to Oklahoma State and SMU. Last year, Harvard downed the Big Green in both matchups. The first game saw then-sophomore Christine Clark notch her second career double-double with 17 points, including a perfect 7-for-7 at the charity stripe, and 10 rebounds as the Crimson won, 71-63. During the second meeting, Emma Golen notched a career-high 21 points as the team closed out the regular season with a victory, 74-69. Harvard would go on to win its first game in the WNIT in program history. This year’s squad has seen strong performances by Clark, the leading scorer with 16.6 points per game, and Golen, who stands atop the Ivy League in three-point percentage.
2. Men’s Hockey at Yale
Earlier this season, the Bulldogs came to Cambridge and dealt the Harvard men’s hockey team its first loss of the season, 5-1. Last season, the Crimson met Yale during the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament, dropping the first game but taking the next two to make it to the tourney finals. The Crimson (4-7-1, 3-5 ECAC), which hasn’t won a game since beating Cornell Nov. 16, will travel to New Haven Jan. 18 hoping to get back on track. The squad has been plagued by a lack of offensive pressure, converting on just five of its 49 power play attempts this season. On the other side, the Yale team (7-4-3, 3-3-1 ECAC) registers over 35 shots per game, six more than Harvard does. The game, which will be broadcast on NBC Sports Network, will be another important ECAC matchup. After recent conference losses to Princeton and Quinnipiac, the Crimson will look to regain momentum at the midway point of the season.
1. Men’s Basketball at Dartmouth
With 2011-2012 as a banner season in the history of Harvard basketball, all eyes are on this new Crimson team as it opens it Ivy League season in Hanover Jan. 12. The squad, which went 8-5 in non-conference play, has already topped major D1 teams California and Boston College thanks to major improvements by sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, who went from an average of 3.3 points per game last season to leading the Ivy League with 16.2 points per game this season, and the efforts of rookie point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers, who was named to the Bob Cousy Award watch list, ranks first in the Ivy League in assists and recorded his first career double-double Jan. 5 against Rice. The Crimson, which beat Dartmouth in both contests last season, will meet a Big Green team that has lost its last seven games and whose top two scorers both average under 11 points per game. Harvard will need to contain 6’9” sophomore forward Gabas Maldunas, who put up 15 points on the Crimson during their first meeting in 2012, as it seeks its first conference win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Crimson’s football season came to a close in November with a victory over Yale, senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk will suit up once again in a couple weeks, having accepted an invitation to play in the 2013 Senior Bowl. The event, which pits the nation’s top senior prospects against each other in a pre-draft showdown, will be held Jan. 26 at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama.
Juszczyk declined prior invitations to play in both the CDS All-Star Game and the East-West Shrine Game, both of which are also held in January.
Juszczyk was a key piece of the Crimson’s offense for all four of his years at Harvard. As a freshman, he appeared in all of the Crimson’s contests, recording 11 catches for 124 yards. Juszczyk was named honorable mention All-Ivy League the following year.
But his last two seasons for Harvard were particularly impressive. As a junior, Juszczyk recorded a league-best 37 receptions for 512 yards and was the recipient of the College Football Performance Award as the FCS’s best tight end. The two-time All-American finished his senior season with a team-high 52 receptions for 706 yards, including a season-best 15 catches and 192 yards in the Crimson’s contest against Princeton. Juszczyk averaged a team-best 70.6 yards per game and led the Harvard offense with eight touchdown receptions.
The Senior Bowl, which pits North against South, gives NFL coaches and executives the opportunity to watch the nation’s top prospects in action. Annually, 800 NFL coaches and general managers scout the practices and game, with entire NFL coaching staffs at the helm on both sides of the field. This year, head coach Dennis Allen and his Oakland Raiders staff will coach the North squad, while Detroit Lions head coach Jim Schwartz and his assistants will lead the South.
The Senior Bowl will be televised by NFL Network. Kickoff is set for 4:00pm EST.
