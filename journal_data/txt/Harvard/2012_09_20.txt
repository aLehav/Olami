After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You know what I noticed? Nobody panics when things go ‘according to plan.’ Even if the plan is horrifying. If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up, nobody panics because it's all part of the plan. But when I say that one little old mayor will die...well, then everyone loses their minds.”
These are the words spoken by the iconic comic book supervillain the Joker during a pivotal scene in the film “The Dark Knight.” The Joker soared to astronomical levels of popularity in 2008 thanks to Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the villain as well as the success of the film. But the Joker has more recently returned to infamy. On July 20, James Holmes, a psychologically disturbed college student, walked into a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” carrying four guns, a tear gas bomb, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. According to reports, he announced to the crowd, “I am the Joker,” and proceeded to wound 59 and kill 12 in a brutal massacre.
The shooting made headlines across the world. Naturally the incident became the conduit through which people expressed their opinions on American culture and society. Gun control law dominated opinion pages and debate floors as politicians scrambled to defend or attack America’s generally relaxed attitude towards the proliferations of guns. Violence in American films, television shows, and video games became a hot topic of discussion when the mother of a victim announced that she was going to sue the cinema where the shootings took place.
But the issues that came to light as a result of the tragedy are not as disturbing as the issues that did not. The shooting at the movie premiere was a prime example of how American culture revolves around “shock stories” which distract from real issues at hand or other newsworthy topics.
Did you know that 82 people were killed and 180 wounded by car bombs in Iraq on the same day as the shootings? It is highly unlikely that you did. After all, who wants to hear another report about the Iraq war? This eerily ties into the Joker’s analysis of how we ignore important issues because they go “according to plan” and instead turn our gaze to shocking, superficial news stories.
Many use the shootings to argue about problems in American society while completely missing the bigger picture. Twentieth Century Fox has started a fund to cover the medical bills of victims of the shootings, which is a nice gesture to the 71 people were injured or killed in the shootout. But why is there so little discourse on the way that the appalling state of the U.S. health care system makes such a fund more necessary than it would be elsewhere? How about the 8,755 who die from gun violence every year who do not have funds opened for them by well-endowed movie studios?
Barack Obama visited Aurora to express his condolences for the victims and their families. Did any high profile politicians visit Chicago, America’s most dangerous city, during Memorial Day Weekend, during which there were more than 40 shooting victims in 72 hours? Not a chance. Clearly, American society chooses to ignore rather than address problems if those problems occur too often. America does not care about the culture of gun violence in this country. America only cares when shootings happen during the premiere of a famous film.
It is easy to dismiss the Joker’s perspective as the deranged ramblings of a psychopathic madman. But doing so is an example of the way that American culture demonizes opinions that cut too close to the bone in order to shield itself from systemic social problems. Trying to understand what is at the root of many of American society’s problems does not make one an extremist or a radical. In no way do I wish to diminish or detract from the horrifying incidents in Aurora, but the manner in which we fail to pay attention to key underlying problems in American society thanks to our obsession with sensational news stories is worrying. Media outlets are partially to blame, as they mostly focus on “popular” news items in order to attract as much readership and views as possible. But they are only pandering to a terrifying aspect of American culture—that if enough “bad news” happens, it is not worth paying attention to. Sometimes, we should start paying attention to important, underlying issues, even if they are just “part of the plan.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Full disclosure:  I have been acquainted with Professor Marc Hauser (known affectionately as ‘Sparkles’ to us in Cage 2-F) for several years now on an up-close-and-personal basis and I think he is wicked cute.  There, I’ve said it.  Nonetheless, I will make every effort to keep my assessment of his behavior totally objective.  I am, after all, genetically wired for morally correct comportment, the Golden Rule, the Categorical Imperative, the whole nine yards.  That’s right, I will remain unbiased even if you offer me a banana to shade my judgment.  You can even make that two bananas, buster.
Indeed, it is strictly for moral reasons that I feel obligated to share my perspective on Professor H’s “fabricated data” case.  His lab assistants, graduate students, and the big shots at Harvard and the Federal Office of Research Integrity have all had their say, so I am compelled to put opposable thumb to iPad and set the record straight from the point of view of somebody who was actually there during the infamous experiments.  Heck, I was the experiment – it doesn’t get any more “in situ” than that.
First, let me to say that everybody makes stuff up.  That’s what separates us from the rats in Laboratory C upstairs.  Rats just see things one way and one way only—bars, pellet lever, treadmill.  For example, rats are simply incapable of seeing that treadmill as a metaphor for existential despair. No imagination.  No out-of-the-box interpretations.  It’s a blah world for those little four-leggers.  I feel sorry for them. Sparkles is a man of imagination, of inventiveness.  I respect that in a biped.
And let’s be honest here: There’s a major difference between Professor H’s intuitive whimsy and actually fabricating data.  All Sparkles has to go on is my behavior as he watches me from his perch on that stool in front of my cage.  (He does look awfully cute there, sitting with his little lab notebook in his lap, eyes fastened on my every move and gesture.  Girls, do you have any idea how it feels to have an adorable Harvard professor stare at you for hours on end, trying to figure out what you’re really thinking? I’m talking Swoons-ville.)
Take that controversial “Mirror Self-Recognition” test. The professor places a full-length mirror (think the fitting room at Alan Rouleau’s) in my cage.  Do I recognize myself?  Do I realize that it’s me I see reflected there?  Duh.  Of course, I do.  Unless you’re getting all philosophical on me and insist on questioning what the real “me” is.  My advice: Don’t go there.
In any event, while Professor H saw clearly that, indeed, I did recognize myself in that mirror (looking like I was having a serious bad hair day, I must say), some bio-psychologist at a minor state university insisted that a video of the experiment showed that “there was not a thread of compelling evidence—scientific or otherwise—that any of the tamarins had learned to correctly decipher mirrored information about themselves.”
Gimme a break, Minor State University Guy!  What did you expect me to do—wink at myself?  Come on, a girl has her pride.  Sparkles was watching me; I didn’t want to come off as vain.  And as to that business of Professor H’s corroborating videos mysteriously vanishing from his lab, I can settle that right now: I stole them.  As I say, it was a really bad hair day.  Who wants that in the archives for some smug grad student to gape at?
Okay, let’s take a look at that so-called damning “recognizing patterns of consonants and vowels” coding thingy.  I was right there, I tell you.  And I can tell you this: It was, like, soooo boring!  As we say in Cage 2-F, “Vowels, schmowels, as long as you’re healthy.” So after listening to these recorded ‘Ooos’ and ‘K-k-k-kays’ for a while, we simply tuned out.  Better things to do, ya know?
The point is I can recognize a consonant when I am half asleep.  Have you ever heard a tamarin chatter when somebody in the lab rips open a Planter’s Peanut Bar?  It’s all consonants, baby.  Vowels just don’t say it.  Professor H knows that.  He can see it in our eyes.  He’s tuned in. And he knows when we are bored, so he covers for us.  Coding, schmoding, the man knows.  He’s, like, one of us.
Sparkles would do stuff around us that we never saw him do when people were around. Like make funny faces.  And do that hilarious hopping around while scratching his chest bit.  Sure, some of the girls thought he was making fun of us, but we all knew he was just fooling around.  And then there were those precious times he would sing to us, especially around the holidays.  I will never forget the time he came into the lab around Christmastime, singing, “No-o-bel, No-o-bel, born is the King….”
Like I say, you had to be there.

To the editors:
I am writing to address the September 17 editorial, "Crack Down on Rape."
While it is absolutely true that drinking does not automatically lead to rape, it is undeniable that alcohol and sexual assault are highly correlated. In the majority of campus sexual assault cases nationally, alcohol is consumed by either the perpetrator, the survivor, or both. This is also true for the majority of cases handled by OSAPR. By suggesting that the HUPD and CPD should "focus their energies more on preventing rape and harassment than on a fruitless attempt to head off underage drinking," the author is ignoring the research, which shows that in most cases, these causes are related.
The correlation between alcohol and sexual assault is multi-faceted. In researching college-age sexual assault perpetrators, we have learned that they often use alcohol intentionally, either by seeking out someone who is already highly intoxicated or by encouraging drinking. This does not mean that drinking itself is the problem, but it does mean that we all have a responsibility to make sure our social scene stays safe.
There are a number of steps we can take to help prevent sexual assaults, such as challenging the social norms that mask predatory behavior by hosting safe parties, looking out for each other, stepping up to intervene, and supporting survivors. We should also be careful not to frame rape as a female-only health issue as it is in this editorial. Sexual assault affects both men and women and under-reporting, which is also mentioned in this article, is even more pervasive among male survivors.
Sincerely,
Sarah Rankin
Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a video appeared on the Harvard College Women’s Center’s youtube feed responding to the existence of a gender imbalance in undergraduate leadership at Harvard. The video features Undergraduate Council Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 encouraging women at Harvard to run for spots on the council, where women make up only 35 percent of the elected body. As we have often said before, our campus urgently needs to increase female presence and gender parity in student leadership.  We welcome any attempt to increase female representation in the UC, but must caution aspiring student leaders that truly effective change on campus may be best enacted outside of that unwieldy bureaucracy.
Achieving gender parity in student leadership is important for numerous reasons, not least of which is the negative impact that a lack of female role models and representation can have on future attempts for women to become leaders in political and corporate life. Women make up only 17 percent of Congress and only 16 percent of upper level management positions in Fortune 500 companies. This needs to change, and creating gender parity in college student leadership is an ideal place to start. As such, we admire Yalamanchi’s recent attempt to encourage greater female participation in the UC.
That said, we must caution any who run for the UC to be aware that they are entering a failed institution and we advise them to seek leadership roles elsewhere on campus. We believe that both men and women can affect far greater change on Harvard’s campus outside of the UC’s futile sub-committee meetings. We admire the organization’s intentions to change the nature of social space at Harvard, and to engage with the college administration—but its nearly complete lack of follow-through forces us to repeat what we have said before: the work of almost every committee on the UC would be better served if it were to be done outside of that legislative body.
For inspiring leadership, we need only look to our dining halls. Perhaps the most noticeable changes on campus this past year owe their origin not to the UC, but to student organizations like the Sustainable Food Project and to independent student activism. This is change we can believe in.
Indeed, in its current form, the UC is simultaneously ineffective and a reminder of the inequality of women in leadership. All students ought to continue pursuing gender parity in student leadership—but to focus their hard work somewhere outside of the UC, in organizations that bear fruit like the Harvard College Women’s Center and others like it that have done much to spur awareness and debate around these important issues.

On an anchored bobbing boat three guitarists from Bordeaux begin. The inside of the boat is small and packed with patrons in their twenties, gripping overpriced beers. They nod their heads to the folk onirique, looking vaguely bored but at ease. The windows fog up in the heat of the crowd and I slip away and up to the deck. The river’s current curls up against the boat, lapping at its hull as faint strums emerge from inside. There is a hushed Saturday-night hum: Threads of music and dancing and rising conversation mingle, wafting up from both sides of the river. There, on the deck, I find my wildly gesticulating friend.
He is three drinks in, his cue to start philosophizing. Catching sight of me he grabs my arm and pulls me into the circle, bringing me into the discussion, asking if I’d like a cigarette. When I return home I will still not know how to use a lighter— still hold the cigarette wrong, probably. I am only the most social of smokers. I say yes and take it and join in. After a bit someone pauses, cocks her head towards me. She knits her brow: “You’re not French, are you?” 
“T’es pas française, non?” The party is packed and the music throbbing; my head pounds with the pitch of a language I wish were more familiar. I catch about every other word. My eyes are fixed on her lips to make out the sounds and I hope this doesn’t scare her away. Our conversation is laced with uncertainty: I think she is talking about a movie, a film festival—on vacation, perhaps?  
The next thing I know she grabs my arm and beckons to a few others. She shuttles us into the bathroom, the only part of the apartment that is still quiet and dark. She brings in her laptop and turns on the screen. Huddling together, squinting, my right leg wedged uncomfortably next to the cool porcelain of the bathtub, we watch as a young man in a bowler hat wanders up a gray deserted street, looking dejected. For the next 10 minutes that’s all he seems to do. The credits roll and the girl’s name appears; this film is hers, a production of her sophomore fall.
 Our murmurs of admiration puncture the short silence. We file out of the bathroom and disperse. The party has arrived at the point where the boys (mostly gay) are all hugging each other and the girls (mostly beautiful) are all clustered in corners discussing boyfriends and dates. “I wouldn’t have known you weren’t French”—before she heard my accent—one says to me. It is possibly the best compliment I have ever received.  
Down the spiral staircase and out into the night: the stuffy heat of Clémence’s sixth-floor apartment gives way to a hushed breeze. I shut the door and one ringing note of  chatter recalls those still in rooms above.  Clémence lives in Montmartre, on the hill that sits atop the city. I have an old map of Paris from 1889 in which this hill is more striking: The urban landscape has not yet expanded into the eighteenth arrondissement and Montmartre regards it majestically, its walled cemetery buttressing this artists’ haven from the chaos down below. Today Paris has crept up to and around Montmartre. The neighborhood’s Place des Tertres is crowded with aggressive caricaturists and overpriced prix fixe brasseries and tourists wandering dazedly, drunk with too many sights. A little farther down the hill there is still a neighborhood feel.  
In a few months I will move in here to the Rue des Trois Frères, when I am kicked out of the apartment I am subletting, because the owner wants to move back in. I will befriend my graying portly half-Spanish neighbor with a wooden cane who lives across the inner courtyard and owns the laundromat next door. Every afternoon at two I will peek into the corner bar on my way to the metro, and he will be there, perched on a stool, a pint on the counter. From the window he will recognize me and I will wave.
For now I walk to the nearest Vélib stop—Paris’ bike-sharing program—and pull out my card. The metro closes at two or two-thirty in Paris, depending on the caprice of the driver, and I live across the city, too far for a cab. I love late-night biking anyway: The lane usually shared with busses and taxis I have all to myself.
I follow the sloping street down to Boulevard de  Rochechouart, passing the tawdry glow of Moulin Rouge and the Irish and Australian bars the Parisians seem to love, then the sex shops and cabarets, their shock factor as faded as their feebly blinking signs. From Clichy it’s a straight shot down to the Gare Saint-Lazare. I wonder briefly how different Paris was before Haussmann and the second Napoleon, before this century began, when the city was still a maze of medieval alleys. It was those two who hatched a plan to catapult Paris into modernity through broad swaths of pavement. Now it’s those boulevards that define the city, that carve and divvy it up.
From the shuttered gift shop kiosk I take a left to Opéra, passing the Palais Garnier to the river, as black and still as the roads that led me here. The river and its bridges are my favorite part of Paris, still. Even if I wish I could say somewhere hidden and unknown. There is something about crossing places that I have always loved: bridges, trains, the international arrivals hall at Philadelphia Airport. You are neither one place nor quite the other and in this liminality there is such freedom. From this bridge, one last long trajectory awaits me, down Rue de Rennes to my apartment by the Tour Montparnasse (the ugliest building in the city, but with its most spectacular view from the roof).
Before that I pause by the Place Dauphine and look out to the edge of the Île de la Cité, where the island tapers to a point. One of my first weeks in Paris a new acquaintance took me and two others to an underground jazz club near here, a damp-smelling wine cellar with bottles of Bordeaux and Bourgogne lining shelves along the back. The night began as a concert; we the only ones under 60 The musicians left the stage and a space was cleared on the floor until they filed back in, beginning the music again. After a few minutes a few elderly couples took each other’s arms and began to dance. We soon joined in too and were there for hours. A middle-aged French-Algerian man fell in love with my Swiss friend. When we left close to dawn it was raining hard outside. We wandered over here, to the edge of the Île, which Simon told us was the exact center of the city. In the summer everyone comes here to drink and to talk, he said. We looked out at the silent chilly stretch and tried to picture teenagers with beer bottles wearing cut-off shorts. The rain poured down and my hair clung to my neck. I wondered what the next months would be like.
Now it is spring and the first groups of young drinkers are sprinkled around the tip. I take in the dark beauty pierced only by streetlamps—a silence disturbed only by the recent memories of chez Clémence—and wonder how I will be able to leave.
Five months later, back at Harvard, I will walk up to the Yard from Eliot for the first time since December. In the midst of all this brick (such a contrast from Paris’s stone) I will notice the Hubway stop on the corner of Dunster St. and Mass Ave. This must be Boston’s version of Vélib, I will think, and a sharp pang of nostalgia will rise, spread, igniting in me traces of the city I have left.
It’s a funny thing about traveling, that it’s unclear what you set out to find. In the 1800s Americans went to Paris because the best medical schools were there, and the best collections of art to copy. In the 1920s it was where you could find everyone worth talking to or talking about. Were these reasons or excuses? For me, at least, if I’m honest, I was really just running away. Away from cloyingly big thoughts and adolescent angst I never quite grew out of, in a place where people were doing a million things well and everyone but me seemed so fine. That it was Paris I was going to seemed to justify my self-imposed exile: I was running towards somewhere, somewhere no one would question, instead of just away.
I packed my suitcase full of vague ideas of beauty and history and what my French classmates, rolling their eyes, called le cliché américain de Paris. I wanted to speak French—which I could read and write—but still struggled to wrap my mouth around its aspirated syllables. I thought all that energy devoted to learning a new language would sop up that silence éternel des espaces infinies (a phrase from Pascal I learned in a high school history class, and whose melodramatic force always struck me). Mostly I wanted to be not at Harvard for a while.
When I arrived in Paris two months later it suddenly became very important for me to know where everything was and how everything could be reached. I went for long aimless walks. I studied maps of the arrondissements. I never took the metro because it threw me off when I emerged blinking onto an unknown street. I grew embarrassed to tell people that I lived on the Left Bank, in Saint-Germain-des-Prés—an address I had coveted and that other Americans responded with “Oh! So pretty!”—because, as anyone knew, it was the Right Bank that was the hip place to be; the Left had died with Sartre. I felt that somehow it would mean something if I knew Paris so well, that if I internalized its streets and buildings I could get at the cartography of its soul.
For a long time, then, it was only these sketched-out structures that recalled the city for me. I thought of Paris as the beauty of the place, its inhabitants irrelevant or peripheral. There is a certain nobility in this image: a Paris gutted of people, its monuments rising in silent dignity from empty streets. There is also, of course, a certain naiveté.
I was in Shakespeare and Company once, that iconic English-language bookstore, when I stumbled across Rainer Maria Rilke’s “Letters to a Young Poet.”  There was one about Paris: where “everything echoes and fades away differently because of the excessive noise that makes Things tremble.” I called over my friend, who was browsing a few feet away. ”Isn’t this great?” She said it reminded her of refaire le monde, an expression we’d learned recently: “Remaking the world”—when French students get together to overanalyze and bare their souls and it all seems to echo with more purpose than elsewhere.
There is “a beautiful anxiety about life” in Paris, Rilke wrote, that comes out in the way people talk and the places they choose to do it. It’s in those particular Parisian inner and outer spaces—the apartments and cafés and cellars and heaving crowds by the Seine. It is important, I think, that Rilke was also a foreigner. There is something about this city that draws foreigners (“strangers,” in French) not only for its charm, but also for its alluring mélange of what can be learned and found out, and for what will inevitably remain unknown.
There used to be a castle here, I am told, where Henry III lived along with Marie Antoinette, both the Napoleons, too. When the Germans were bombing Paris, the Château de Saint-Cloud was caught in the line of fire. It burned to the ground. Now there is only a park—bike paths, gardens—and in places overgrown, ruins (stairs, a corner of a foundation). I try to imagine what a palace would have looked like here, all marble and bronze and Rococo detail instead of this almost wild secret garden. The park borders the Seine on the western side of Paris, the suburbs just beyond Boulogne, at the end of the metro line 10. From the top of the hill you can see a different view of the city. The Sacré Coeur rises up at the leftmost edge, its round roof more charming than striking. At the other end, all the way to the right, rises the Tour Montparnasse, the only skyscraper in Paris proper and for many a blight on its skyline.
“Your two apartments,” says Valentin, pointing to each. I have just moved into Montmartre. Between them rises up the Eiffel Tower, that ubiquitous effigy suspended between nostalgia and modernity, whose stairs I have not yet climbed and will not get around to climbing. Whenever I see it, I am reminded of the hawkers outside the Louvre, dangling gold and silver Eiffel Tower keychains one on each finger, repeating in thick-accented English, “one euro, one euro, one euro.”
Later that night, Valentin has a barbecue at his house in Saint-Cloud. At one point I wander out to see how our friend Grégoire is doing on the grill. He opens it for me and instead of hamburgers and hotdogs there are fat saucissons and carved breast of duck. I have to stifle a laugh. The dinner is like so many others these months: elbows crammed tight around a table, remaking the world, the tempo and pitch of the conversation rising as the wine bottles are emptied. I remember vaguely being at Harvard and how much I discounted nights like this. I remember finding it so easy to think so much about those eternal infinite things that the casual conversations, the dhalls and meetings and parties, seemed unimportant or unnecessary. I wonder, taking a bite, if I had it the wrong way around—if the bigger things were only a distraction; if it was these quotidian banalities that were perhaps the most real.
My first week back at school I go for a run down by MIT and return to the Weeks Footbridge, panting, out of shape. I lean up against the railing and dangle a sneaker over the water. I imagine it falling into the Charles, floating into Boston. To the bay—then the ocean—across the long, barren Atlantic. Arriving at Le Havre and down through Normandy, snaking through the curves of the Seine; to Rouen and then to Paris, where I once sat and dangled my feet over the Pont des Arts, and where I will see my sneaker and pick it up and dry it out and bring it home in my suitcase, wherever home turns out to be. And it could be here—because, obviously, not as everyone is as fine as I thought—and there is joy in quotidian banalities to be had here as well. I know the fallacy of nostalgia; I remember that poem by Musset—“A happy memory is perhaps on Earth /More real than happiness.” But I am susceptible, still, to its lure.
One of my last nights, in my second apartment, I have everyone over for drinks. I am a little apprehensive. I usually alternate between nights with my French and international friends, and I don’t know how well this attempted union will work. It is a little awkward, at first; the language of choice is unclear. My neighbor begins to blast Spanish pop music from across the courtyard, and that helps, breaking the tension. As usual I want tonight to mean something—I want it to give a resounding culmination to a semester in which I changed and was changed. As usual this is too much to ask. But there is good wine and good conversation with people I have grown to love. And, when I open the door to say goodbye, there is the long slope of the city, from Opéra to the Seine and all the way down Rue de Rennes, an expanse I know well and that I feel is somehow partly mine.

With police trolling Cambridge streets to crack down on student revelry in dorms and clubs, only the most clandestine of social gatherings will survive. To help keep your party life glamorous amidst the thickest of widespread crackdowns, FM shares some tricks to maintain a snazzy night while staying under police radar. It’s time to convert your party place into a speakeasy.
1.  Say goodbye to Solo cups.A trick fresh out of the prohibition era: Solo cups scream illicit alcohol consumption, but coffee cups deceive authority figures. Police knocking at your door will instantly interpret the coffee-cup aesthetic to mean that your group of friends is in for a harrowing and homework-ridden all-nighter, rather than a casual social time.
2.  Require a secret password for entry.Having a password will help keep out your friend’s friend’s sister’s friend and other uninvited randos, as well as any unwanted policemen who happen to saunter by. Password selection is key: You want something enigmatic, punchy, and sleek. Think “echo” or “dragonfly.”
3.  Play jazz music.Jazz makes every casual listener seem swanky and sophisticated. Authorities probably won’t even bother knocking at your door since they’ll assume you’re busy studying for your class on the Harlem Renaissance.
4.  Bob your hair.Nobody wants to mess with a bob cut! Not even a hairdresser. Too much hairspray and attitude up in that.

A note to our dearest readers:
Welcome back, and a merry weather to you! We hope you enjoyed reading last week's segment as much as we enjoyed writing it and our editors enjoyed pretending to edit it. If you haven't already read about last last week's weather, please do so now, as youmay find our description of this week's last week's weather confusing without any knowledge of what last last week's weather was like before this last week. 
 Signed,
Weathermen 
This week in last week’s weather, we talk about the weather from last week:The rain packed up and left this week, just like my father when I was eight. We had highs in the temperature, with an unusually mediocre joule count on Wednesday. Bob Ross couldn’t have painted a more perfect day. No literally, he couldn’t; he’s dead. I hope my father is too. The umbrellas have started their long hibernation. It’ll be days before they emerge again. Eager freshmen took to the yard, chasing after listlessly drifting frisbees, innocently oblivious to the impending Cantabrigian winter. Someone mentioned that Saturday was the best weather they had experienced in years. I didn’t notice; I was drunk.Your father never wanted you, says the sun, gleaming with gleam.
Aggregate score: 7.9 ½ out of 10.
Thanks for the overwhelming responses about comping! If you're still interested in comping the weatherboard, please email crimsonweatherboard@gmail.com, or come to our first meeting: Saturday, Sep. 22, 0300 hours (military time) on the roof of the MAC. Don't ask us how we get up there, we'll be blackout.

As the air gets crisp and the days grow shorter, we turn our thoughts to the greatest event of fall (excluding apple picking): the Ig Nobel award ceremony. Celebrated every year on Harvard’s campus, this questionably prestigious event invites real Nobel laureates to present prizes to researchers whose achievements “first make people laugh, and then make them think.” Here, FM predicts this year’s results.
Biology Prize: U.S. Representative Todd Akin, for his creative new conception of female biology. His work on the female reproductive system made us laugh with disbelief, cry with existential anguish (or deep offense), and think he was ignorant.
Psychology Prize: A second-hand prize goes to researchers from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Harvard Business School, and London Business School, for their innovative work on regifting, which is apparently not as rude as we think. Happy National Regifting Day! (N.B.: This exists, and they endorse it.)
Mathematics Prize: The presidential candidates, for their consistently innovative mathematical gymnastics regarding the economy. And to Bill Clinton, for using the word “arithmetic” in his speech at the Democratic National Convention.
Medicine Prize: Harvard’s very own inventor of breathable energy, David A. Edwards, without whose work we would have to drink Red Bull, or sleep.
Public Safety Prize: Herman Cain, for his startlingly original ads in the Republican primary, including the rampaging poultry one. We thank him for alerting the public to the dangers of angry chickens.
Literature Prize: Every gossip magazine in the world, for continued eloquent and groundbreaking coverage of the Kim Kardashian-Kris Humphries divorce.

I punched my sister in the face. I was about six years old, old enough to know better, but in my defense she was old enough to have learned to block. I promise the tooth that ended up falling out of her mouth was a baby tooth. I remember blood. I don’t think I’ve punched anyone since.
In second grade, there was this girl Carrie Baker—whose name has been changed from something equally Anglo-Saxon—and I didn’t punch her, even though I wanted to. I did call her a snob, though. This was the second time I stayed in for recess. The first time was when I banged my nose and had to go to the nurse’s office, clutching my dripping proboscis in the stairwell room that is now only the setting of anxious dreams. There was lots of snot on my face. I don’t remember blood.
“If you look up the word ‘snob’ in the dictionary, you’ll see a picture of Carrie’s face,” I announced to my family at the dinner table one night. I believed this was a genius turn of phrase. I had recently written my first story—or, rather, my first story besides the three-sentence thriller about the cat and the dog, which I banged out on my parents’ clunky old monstrosity of a Mac desktop, and which, if I remember correctly, was dubbed “spare, terse, and elegiac” by The New York Times. My second story was about a girl from the future who went back in time and kicked a threatening caveman, and that was handwritten, and “post-apocalyptic” was probably what The Times said. I had a little angst about time and the body as a child. Anyway, I was feeling pretty confident in my verbal prowess, and decided to turn this new lance-like power against the girl who had gained primacy over fat, bookish, ethnic little me in the eight-year-old playground wars.
My sister—who, two years later, was finally proving why she had gotten punched in the first place—passed young Ms. Baker this “spare, terse, and elegiac” phrase. This was the second time I had to stay in for recess, and this time there was no snot. Or maybe there was a little snot as tears came to my eyes, since I was unused to being chastised. I was three units ahead in our phonics book. I, unlike the group of cool boys led by Kevin Johns, had not decorated my pencil can with the word “sex,” though I totally knew what it meant since my mother was a feminist. There was me and Carrie and our teacher, and there was conflict, and there was me feeling powerless and taking it out on another powerless person.
I’m not going to write about how I wish female homosocial conflicts would just go to blows like Rick Davis did with that guy senior year, when they forgot they were privileged small-town kids with very little actual conflict, and decided to have a fistfight in front of the woodshop over some  marginal error in the distribution of marijuana.
It’s less about girls versus boys and more about the kind of force we exert against one another when we’re too old and too disciplined for it to come to actual blows. When it’s a little bigger than the classroom. Sometimes it feels like an undercurrent of brutality, except it’s a mental brutality, more brutal than brawling over a lost gram of grass. It’s made up of wearing things and knowing things and doing problem sets, if you’re that kind of person, or hammering out abstract concepts of cultural theory, if you’re that kind of person, or writing lyric prose. Baby teeth grow back and you can get a little blood off the carpet, and sooner or later you realize that verbal warfare with second-grade seatmates is a bit of a game. But recess dynamics don’t end, except pretty soon we run recess.
I thought I was pretty clever then, when I made my searing comeback about Carrie Baker and the dictionary. There was even a rumor in fourth grade that I read the things for fun, which I only did one time when working on a project in Mrs. Simmons’ room, and that was because I was newly interested in “clitoris” as a concept. But nowadays it seems everybody I know has been reading that dictionary for years. I don’t think Carrie Baker would appear in it anymore. The thing is, we’re going to end up writing the dictionary, and I guess I’m a little concerned that out of all the entries for derivatives and Jungian psychology and wearing things and bullshit. There are some other, more important words that won’t be there.

I was open to falling for Austin, but Austin, I found, was too open for me.
A drive up Congress Avenue, Austin’s main thoroughfare, gives you a good feel for the town. This summer, as I headed north toward downtown on my way to work each morning, I passed an empty lot occupied by food trucks, anchorless restaurants bordering on the carnivalesque. The proprietors of the food trucks were usually un-established, many anti-establishment—in Austin, there seem to be as many food trucks as there are restaurants. A retro silver bullet motor home selling South Asian food has tacked to its roof a sign reading “Nomad,” spelled out in Sanskrit-looking script. Further ahead, determinedly hip restaurants and eclectic boutique stores and some slightly less so—the American Apparel—line the road. I usually drove by at least three cars with a “Keep Austin Weird” logo plastered to their rear bumper. It is “decidedly and self-consciously Austin,” as a summer friend of mine liked to say.
From about a mile and a half out, you will see Congress Avenue’s six lanes march straight up to the city’s nucleus, the ivory neoclassical State House. You can see past the stores, the high-rise hotels, the bridge over Lady Bird Johnson Lake, and the eleven blocks of 30-story skyscrapers. Men, many years ago, carved this street out of hill, but nothing seems like it’s more than 15 years old. They flattened and shoveled until they had laid the city’s heart bare.
Classmates, both those who knew me well and those who did not, had told me I would “just love” Austin. But when I arrived there for my summer internship, I found this excessive line of sight unsettling. As a born-and-bred Bostonian, I wasn’t accustomed to such an unobstructed view. There was too much sky between buildings. The city was too open, too exposing.
I remember sitting on the hood of my rented Mazda that first night, parked just outside the lot of food trucks, eating Pad Thai made from spaghetti. It was 8:30 p.m.; I was parked illegally, and I couldn’t move. The moment there, and the spaciousness of that asphalt artery and the city fanning out around it, wouldn’t let me go. High rises bathed in the red-gold light of the setting sun. The mirror façade of the boutique across the street, a clothing store that I would never enter or learn the name of, swayed in the changing light. The sun dipped just below the roofline of the taco bar and the bourgeois burger restaurant.
I called my mother to let her know I had landed in Austin safely. She asked me about my flight, my apartment, and the city itself. The flight was fine, I said. And the apartment was clean and modern. Austin, however, confused me. I didn’t know how to explain this to her. I hadn’t lost my way on my drive from the airport. Streets were clearly marked. But with no crumbling jam-and-cram architecture for shelter, I felt, I don’t know, left out in the open, maybe. Vulnerable, perhaps.
“It’s not like home,” I said, at that point unable to verbalize the squeamishness in my stomach. “You didn’t expect Austin to be different?” asked my mom.
At night, whether it’s 90 degrees or 30, I sleep under my bed covers, completely—head, limbs, everything. For as long as I can remember, I’ve curled up and en-wombed myself. An old friend says that I “burrow” in my sleep. When I was a kid, my dad would wake me up in the middle of the night. He would pull the covers back from my face, and the rush of cold air would snap me out of my dream. He couldn’t see me, he’d tell me the next morning, and he wanted to make sure I hadn’t suffocated. He wondered how I could breathe under there. It doesn’t feel suffocating, I replied, just warm, and safe.
Several weeks into my stay, I was driving back from San Marcos, about 40 miles from downtown Austin. It was a Thursday. I had gone down each day that week to cover a capital murder trial. A daycare provider was accused of killing a ten-week-old in her care. I diligently recorded witnesses’ tears and doctors’ testimonies for eight hours a day. (Notes: “Prosecuting attorney –‘Were you holding Ben when he died?’ Father – ‘I was.’  SNIFFLES, SOBS.”) After trial that day, I staggered out of the courthouse particularly numb. The defendant had taken the stand. She broke down several times as she pleaded her innocence. On the highway later, I looked down at the odometer: 85 m.p.h. It didn’t feel all that fast. It was the landscape’s lack of landmarks. I pushed down on the pedal softly. 90 m.p.h. First time I had hit 90, ever. I pressed down a little more. I had heard friends talk about that time they hit 100. I wanted to, too.
The needle crept toward 100. It was 8 p.m. The sun was coming down, casting an orange-yellow light on the expanses of land lining the highway. Country music rattled through my rental’s cheap speaker system. It was reckless and exhilarating. And it seemed, just for a moment, as if the music was coming from the land itself—as if the notes had tumbled across the flat, browned fields. I looked out over the open terrain, hoping I could see them.
Eyes back on the road. I was gaining on the car in front of me. I eased off the pedal. 95. 90. 85. 80. 75. The distance between us comfortable again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of last spring, the new Charlesview housing site in Allston was only marked by some ground level foundation and the steel frame of an underground garage. Now, a few months later, the sight is impossible to miss, marked by a completed steel frame of three mid-rise buildings and several smaller townhouse buildings.
The project, which was slated to be finished in the fall of 2013, has remained ahead of schedule according to Jeffrey J. Beam, the project manager for The Community Builders Inc., the organization supervising the construction.
Beam added that consultants to the project are currently considering moving in the first tenants to the new buildings in the spring of 2013.
He attributed the project’s rapid progress over the summer to a “good, coordinated team.”
“We had good communication and a good plan of execution,” Beam said.
In 2007, Harvard reached a land-swap agreement with Charlesview’s board of directors. The University received the site of the current Charlesview residential complex, a five-acre plot that abuts Harvard Business School, in return for a parcel it owned near the Brighton Mills shopping center, the site for the new Charlesview complex.
Some of the brick and windows have been installed, which gives the community a better sense of how the project will appear upon completion, said John Viola, the Charlesview project supervisor at John Moriarty and Associates, the construction firm associated with the new Charlesview project.
“You can get a sense of how the buildings will look when they are finished,” Viola said.
Viola also said that he believed that residents of the current Charlesview site would begin to be moved in on a staggered schedule, as more and more buildings will look when they are finished,” Viola said.
Viola also said that he believed that residents of the current Charlesview site would begin to be allowed to move in on a staggered schedule, as more and more buildings are being completed.
Beam echoed this statement, but said there would be an emphasis on making sure that Charlesview residents still felt that they were part of a residential neighborhood.
“The goal is to not have people living in a construction site,” Beam said. “We want to be able to complete an entire city block and then shrink the construction site so those people are actually living in a normal, functional, completed set of buildings while the other buildings are setting up.”
The new housing complex will consist of 240 mixed-income units, which will be spread across 22 buildings made up of anywhere between 2 and 84 units.
Additionally, it will contain a number of parks and public recreational spaces.
These recreational areas are consistent with some of the original goals of the new site, which, in addition to providing housing, are also meant to help “reinvigorate pedestrian and commercial activity in this [Allston-Brighton] neighborhood,” according to the master plan for the project filed by The Community Builders with the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Both Viola and Beam said that they are optimistic that progress will continue along as it has been with relatively few hindrances.
“We’re through the hardest part,” Viola here. “From here, it’s smooth sailing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Emily W. Stokes-Rees first learned that she had been offered the position of resident dean at Cabot House, the museum anthropologist said that she knew her life and the lives of her family members were going to change dramatically.
“Taking this position, it was knowing that life was never going to be the same again,” Stokes-Rees said. “And I mean that in a really great way.”
Stokes-Rees, along with Luke A. Leafgren of Mather House and Caitlin M. Casey ’03 of Lowell House, will serve as new resident deans this fall. While Stokes-Rees was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University, both Leafgren and Casey were house tutors at Harvard before assuming their new positions.
Leafgren, a former tutor in Winthrop House and a lecturer in the department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said his experience as Winthrop’s Interim Resident Dean last fall while Gregg Peeples—Winthrop’s resident dean—was on sabbatical, will help him as he navigates his way through the new role.
“That experience helped me get a good sense of the challenges and the satisfaction that come with this role,” Leafgren said in an interview with The Crimson last May.
Similarly, Casey, a former resident of Leverett House and a lecturer in History and Literature, served as a non-resident tutor in Currier last year. When the she learned about the opening at Lowell House, the opportunity seemed “ideal,” Casey wrote in an email to The Crimson, because she could not be reached by phone.
Though Stokes-Rees hails from another Ivy League school, she said she has found students to be more than welcoming.
“It was almost overwhelming,” Stokes-Rees said of the first couple weeks. “I’d go to meals with my family and we’d have students come up every two seconds and say hello.”
Students in Mather and Lowell have been equally friendly to their new resident deans as they transition into each house community, according to Leafgren and Casey. In her email, Casey wrote that getting to know the students is easily the most rewarding part of her position.
“They come in to get a add/drop form signed and 40 minutes later we’re in some profound conversation about global politics or music theory,” Casey wrote. “That part feels like a gift.”
At Mather House, House Committee Co-Chair Hannah M. Cardiel ’13 said she appreciates Leafgren’s willingness to make an effort to learn about Mather and get to know his students.
“We were all impressed with him right from the start,” Cardiel said. “He was excited about the Mather community and getting involved with it, which is very important to me personally because the community at Mather is unique and valued so highly.”
However, the new role has not come without challenges for the new resident deans.
Both Casey and Stokes-Rees admitted it was difficult to find balance as academics and House administrators. The position is supposed to be 50 percent dean and 50 percent academic, but for Stokes-Rees, the reality is that much more time is spent on matters related to the House, she said.
“I think that 50-50 balance will probably never be realized,” Stokes-Rees said. “And for me accepting the position was realizing that will probably never be the case.”
Nevertheless, Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana believes Cabot is fortunate to have Stokes-Rees and said she exemplifies the values of Cabot.
“It’s still early into the semester, but she resonates commitment to the idea of community,” Khurana said.

For the four Harvard undergraduates and eleven graduate students in Linguistics 117r, reaching the basement room where they delve into the thorny morphology and phonology of the little-known languages of the Caucasus may involve a shuttle or a trek by foot.
But for the rest of their classmates, the journey is both simpler and far more complicated: While they sit still, they are beamed into Room B101 by satellite.
They are University of Massachusetts Amherst students, and their professors--Harvard’s Maria Polinsky and UMass Amherst’s Alice C. Harris--have figured out how to defy an age-old adage. They can be in two places at once.
Harris and Polinsky co-taught a smaller version of the class at the Summer Institute of Linguistics in 2007. Now teaching at separate institutions, they nevertheless decided to collaborate again because only a few American scholars have studied the course’s esoteric focus.
“We have both worked on these languages, but because there are so many of them, our domains of expertise complement each other. If we had chosen to teach two separate classes, the content would have been less rich,” Polinsky said.
Initially, the professors intended to have students drive between the two universities, 94 miles apart. But after conversations with Harvard’s Media and Technology Services, they discovered a less cumbersome means of connection.
During each three-hour session of the weekly class, William G. Countie, an evening supervisor for Media and Technology Services, manages projections displayed on two screens that dominate the front wall of the Harvard classroom. He switches between PowerPoint presentations, an overhead shot of the UMass Amherst classroom, a view of the lecturer at UMass Amherst, and a frame of the Harvard students in their seats.
When he controls the cameras within the Harvard classroom, he said, “It’s not like a joystick on a video game, but pretty similar.”
The virtual classroom format allows the colleges to share prominent guest speakers, including phonology expert Ioana Chitoran of Dartmouth and Nakh-Dagestanian language researchers Ann Gagliardi and Keith E. Plaster ’94 of Harvard.
Students said the virtual experience takes some getting used to. Michael H. Goncalves ’14 said that though he appreciates having another group of people in the room to offer feedback, he thinks that the class would have more conversation if taught only at one location.
“Sometimes it’s hard when you have a question, and they’re talking over there, so they might not see you waving your hand,” he said.
However, Goncalves’s classmates will not always be just images on a screen. Throughout the semester, the groups will meet in real time at local linguistics conferences throughout the region.
A handful of Harvard courses utilize less extensive videoconferencing, including occasional guest lectures by video in African and African American Studies 20: “Introduction to African Languages and Cultures.”
Likewise, the class History 84c: “Confronting Objects/Interpreting Culture” will host a joint session with Bard graduate students in October via video hook-up.
The technology is still fairly little-known, but students and staff who have utilized it say that they anticipate that it will become more common at Harvard.
Goncalves predicted, “It’s a process we have to get used to, but as more classes do this, it will become more standard.”
And Harris, the UMass Amherst professor, enthused, “The virtual class may yet shape our teaching styles in ways we can’t yet anticipate.”

The Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations did more this semester to attract students than just host office hours, distribute appealing syllabi, or even tack up posters. It paid for Facebook ads.
The department advertised introductory language courses in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese as well as three other undergraduate courses, according to Gustavo Espada, the financial and IT coordinator of the department.
One ad that appeared on the side of Harvard students’ Facebook news feeds read: “Is Vietnamese Too Hard? Unlike many other Asian languages, it uses Western characters! Study it at Harvard.”
When students clicked on the ad, it directed them to the iSite page for the introductory class Vietnamese Ba.
Binh Ngo, who teaches the course, which meets five days a week at 9 a.m., said that the class jumped from 8 students last year to 11 this year. He did not ask his students whether they learned about the course from Facebook, but he guessed that the ads had been effective.
“My feeling is more people know about my courses, and it may be one of the reasons why this semester I have more students,” he wrote in an email.
Espada declined to say how much the department paid for the advertisements, though he described it as a “modest” sum. The price of Facebook ads varies widely based on the targeted audience and the amount the purchaser bids per click -- sometimes as low as a dollar or two per day.
Espada said that the Facebook ads for classes were just one prong in a longer effort to increase the department’s online presence.
For example, East Asian Film and Media Studies 120: “Critical Exposures: Documentary Media in Postwar Japanese Fiction, Film and Photography” posted a trailer video on the class iSite to entice students, a technique that several other classes at Harvard have tried.
Espada also mentioned innovative uses of technology in the classroom and other social media outreach meant to connect students and faculty.
Harvard Summer School study abroad programs and the Peer Advising Fellows program have also posted paid ads on Facebook in the past.

Members of the Reform prayer group at Harvard Hillel are experimenting with a new way to prepare for the Jewish Day of Atonement: tweeting their sins.
#AlChetHarvard, introduced earlier this week at the Reform minyan’s Rosh Hashanah services, adds a modern element to traditional Jewish ceremonies.
The project runs through the Days of Repentance and ends before the Yom Kippur services, which begin Tuesday. The Reform minyan, representing one of the three major
Jewish denominations, plans to gather community confessions through Twitter and incorporate them into the confessional Al Chet prayer during Yom Kippur.
“Yom Kippur is more or less your last shot at a clean slate for the New Year,” said Michael J. Gil ’14, co-chair of the Reform Minyan. “So for the last few years we’ve been working to personalize the confessional part of the Yom Kippur services.”
Last year, the minyan encouraged its membership to share sins and mistakes anonymously on notecards. While the exercise increased engagement, Gil said he saw room for improvement.
“Not only was that an absurd waste of paper and resources,” Gil said, “but when you’re just sending a notecard, you’re isolated.”
In conversations after last year’s Yom Kippur services, Gil and co-chair Alexandra J. Booth ’14 agreed that Twitter would serve the minyan’s objectives of opening up discussion and fostering community, Gil said.
“Generally speaking, the Hillel is rather underrepresented on social media right now,” Gil said. “So this is our first step into that vein. But we have our Twitter account, and we’re asking our community, and other similar communities, just to share.”
With Yom Kippur almost a week away, participation in #AlChetHarvard has yet to ramp up. Early Thursday morning, only one sin had been tweeted: “I have failed to appreciate all the blessings in my life. This year I will focus less on life’s flaws and more on the beauty.” But the project has not gone unnoticed by the larger Jewish community.
“We are proud of the students at Harvard who are carrying on the creative legacy of Reform Judaism that always seeks to intersect ancient traditions with modern innovation,” wrote Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, a senior vice president of the Union for Reform Judaism.
“Leveraging social networking and new techniques in order to make Jewish liturgy relevant by meeting people where they are is a great example of a living, dynamic Jewish community," he said in an email.
To participate in the exercise, which runs through the weekend, tweeters can attach the tag #AlChetHarvard to their confession, which they should direct @Harvard_Reform.
Gil, for his part, said he was eager to see the results. “Twitter is accessible to our entire membership,” he said. “Here we see an opportunity for real discussion.”

A peek inside the gated Eliot House courtyard on a typical day in September reveals students lounging in the sun as they enjoy the view of the Charles River.
 
But for the first time on one Saturday evening this fall, the courtyard will transform into a classy dance floor decked out in flowers and lights with music, hors d’oeuvre, drinks, and “maybe even fireworks,” according to an email sent to the House community.
 
Response to the House life satisfaction survey conducted over the summer indicated that there was student interest in having an another formal event in addition to Eliot’s Winter Formal in December and Fête, the spring formal dance, in April.
 
As a result of the survey, the Eliot House Committee decided to throw its first-ever September Soiree this Saturday.
 
“It’s a chance to have everyone outside [in the courtyard] when the weather is still nice,” HoCo Co-Chair Jordan E. Sessler ’13 said. “It’s also a chance to foster more unity in the House.”
 
Sessler said that the night will begin with classic American music, such as “Sweet Caroline,” while guests sip on drinks like shandy and sangria. As the night goes on, the Soiree will feature a DJ, a dance floor, and “everything else that makes a good event,” Sessler said.
 
“The sophomores will get to see what the House is all about, and the seniors will get the most out of the House experience for their last year,” said Erin M. Fahy ’13, Stein Club co-chair who is also in charge of organizing the September Soiree.
 
Fahy said that the event is significantly smaller in scale than Fête, Eliot’s highest-budget event of the year and one of the biggest spring formals at the College, with 900 attendees last year. The Soiree’s cost is about a third of the size of Fête’s roughly $20,000 budget, according to Sessler.
 
Though Soiree will be smaller, Fahy said she expects it will be similarly successful in fostering a sense of community in the House. The September Soiree is open to all Eliot students who pay $52 annual House dues. Each Eliot student is allowed to bring one guest. 
 
According to Sessler, HoCo is “really invested” in making the September Soiree a success, adding that its budget is bigger than that of the Winter Formal. “Eliot is the best House,” Sessler said, “and we just want to make it better.”

In case you’ve been living under a rock for the past few weeks, the two captains of the Harvard men’s basketball team—seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry—have withdrawn from Harvard for the 2012-13 school year after being implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal, according to the New York Times.
Unequivocally, it’s a tragedy for the team and for Harvard athletics in general. Two of the school’s most recognizable faces—both on campus and around the country—leave under a shroud of uncertainty, seemingly guilty until proven innocent.
Some opportunistically have taken this chance as an “Aha!” moment. “See!” they’ll tell you. “We knew it all along. These guys aren’t like us! They don’t work as hard we do, don’t study like we do. They’re here just to play some game, not to learn. And this proves it! So, let’s get rid of them!”
Take, for instance, what senior Patrick Lane told the New York Times.
“[Some athletes] avoid academic challenges,” Lane said. “You know you won’t find them in a deductive logic course, but you will find them in a much less taxing sociology course. They sometimes exist apart, and collectively gravitate to the same majors…. It’s known.”
The article also added that “the news could reignite a contentious decades-old debate about athletes and academic integrity in the Ivy League.” In part, it is the debate about whether programs like the Harvard men’s basketball program—which has been accused of lowering academic standards to allow better players’ admission—should be allowed to grow and expand and increasingly become a player on a national stage. All of this, the critics will say, on the backs of these “less qualified” students.
All right, let’s debate. For now, allow me to focus only on the cases of Casey, Curry, and the Harvard men’s basketball team.
And it is here where I turn to that old political sage, Donald Rumsfeld.
“[T]here are known knowns; there are things we know that we know,” Rumsfeld once said. “There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don’t know.”
Let me begin with the latter. Here’s what I know I don’t know:
Having never covered a single basketball game, I don’t know what kind of people Casey or Curry are. I’ve never met either, never talked to either. I’ve never even seen Curry outside of a basketball-related event. I don’t know what kind of students they are, other than that Curry was Academic All-Ivy.
I don’t know what their exact situations are with regards to the cheating scandal. As has reported extensively, they’re implicated, but I don’t know if they’re guilty, and if so, how guilty they are.
And since I know nothing about either of those, I won’t speculate.
Here’s what I know I know:
I know their loss is a tremendous one for the Crimson. Casey was the biggest recruit in the history of the program and was a preseason favorite for Ivy League Player of the Year. Critics and players alike, though, have pointed to Curry as perhaps the team’s most important asset. And in that sense, it’s an absolute shame.
But I also know that Casey and Curry have both played critical roles in the rapid, historic turnaround of the men’s basketball programs.
And now, the big question: Why does that matter? Why should we care?
Sports, more than almost any other force I know, have the ability to unite communities, to bring people together in an almost magical way. Nothing can reduce grown men to tears, create instantaneous, massive ways of hugging and high-fiving, like sports can. And certainly, that feeling of camaraderie doesn’t end on the court or in the stands. It continues into the dining halls, into our everyday conversations, gives us something to root for, to smile about, even to dream about.
One friend at Georgetown once told me that during basketball season, people are friendlier to one another. At Duke, students rarely go abroad in the spring because of—you guessed it—basketball season.
Of course, the rejoinder is simple: We’re Not Georgetown or Duke, God Forbid. We’re Harvard. We’re not a basketball school. We’re an academic institution, damn it, and the finest one in the world at that.
But as I see it, having a nationally ranked basketball team doesn’t somehow diminish the school’s academic stature. Not at all. What can it do? Build community, school-wide community, a source of pride with undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni, with a reach and scope that very little else can match.
Last season, when Harvard made it to the NCAA tournament for the first time since the Truman Administration, we saw glimpses of that. And Casey and Curry were responsible for much of it.
And so, this I also know I know:
If you’ve been a part of that ecstatic throng to leap up and down on those crickety old Lavietes bleachers belting, “I believe that we will win,” you have Casey and Curry to thank.
If you stormed the court in March of 2011 following the Ivy title-clinching win against Princeton, you have Casey and Curry to thank.
If you never cared as much about a sports team until the 2011-12 version of Harvard men’s basketball, you have Casey and Curry to thank.
If you put down what you were doing on a random day during spring break to watch some basketball game in Albuquerque, you have Casey and Curry to thank.
And this I believe:
Maybe, thanks to the loss of its two stars, the men’s basketball team won’t repeat this season as Ivy champs. But despite that, and despite whatever infractions they did or did not commit, their impact on this school, as I see it, is still overwhelmingly positive. Casey and Curry have helped lay the groundwork for the long-term growth of this program, this team that united a community last year and has the ability to do so even more in the future.
And for that, Brandyn and Kyle, I say thank you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a rough, 6-0 defeat to No. 2 Connecticut, the Harvard men’s soccer team looks to rebound on its farthest road trip of the season.
The Crimson (1-3-1) kicks off its trip to California with a showdown against the Cal Poly Mustangs (4-2) in the Nike Central Coast Challenge on Friday night before facing No. 3 UC Santa Barbara (5-0-1) on Sunday afternoon. Harvard seeks to add to its lone win of the season against a hot Cal Poly team riding a four game winning streak and the top-ranked Gauchos. The weekend will be the team’s final tune-up before it begins its conference matches.
The Crimson will take one game at a time this road trip, focusing on its Friday match before facing powerhouse UC Santa Barbara in its second contest of the weekend.
“We are trying to not look too far ahead,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said.
The Nike Central Coast Challenge thrusts Harvard onto the big stage, where it will play in front of an estimated 6,000-person crowd against the Mustangs.
In spite of differing records, the team believes the match against Cal Poly should be a close contest.
“They are a very similar team to us,” said Junot when asked about his outlook on the game.
He believes his squad has an opportunity to exploit the Mustangs defense.
Before last weekend’s defeat to then-No. 3/4 Huskies, Harvard had a promising win against Michigan State and a close overtime loss to Southern Methodist. The Crimson looks to brush off its recent defeat and focus on the positives it gained from those two matches.
Players say that the loss to UConn reinforced the importance of having more faith in themselves against tougher opponents.
“We learned from the last game against UConn [that] we have to show respect but not be afraid,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said.
The weekend will also see a greater contribution from players who have recently returned from injuries. Junior defender Ross Friedman will play in his second game of the season after missing the team’s first four matches. He rejoins a defense that has given up a combined nine goals in the past two games.
On the offensive end, Kobayashi will spring back into action after his early season momentum was halted by an ankle injury. Kobayashi was the lone goal-scorer in the Crimson’s season opener against the University of Massachusetts.
“It was frustrating to see my team lose [last weekend] and not be able to do anything about it,” Kobayashi said.
The sophomore was limited to 20 minutes of playing time against the Huskies but was able to participate in all drills at practice on Tuesday. The Harvard offense has put up just four goals in five games so far this season.
Although freshman goaltender Evan Mendez let in six of UConn’s nine shots on goal, the freshman entered into the contest with an impressive 0.71 goals against average.
Junior forward Mackenzie Pridham leads Cal Poly’s attack, scoring three of the Mustang’s nine goals of the season. Sophomore goalkeeper Chase Hauser has been undefeated in the net after taking over for freshman Wade Hamilton, posting a .818 save percentage.
Cal Poly started off the season slowly, with consecutive shutout losses to Seattle and Washington. Since then, it has outscored its opponents, 9-2, in four consecutive wins against San Jose State, Valparaiso, Temple and Army, none of which are ranked opponents. This will be the Mustangs’ first contest against an Ivy League opponent.
Despite its 2011 campaign—in which the Crimson won a mere two games—and a slow start this season, the Harvard squad has remained optimistic.
When designing the schedule for this season, Junot sought to challenge his team, stockpiling its schedule with consistently ranked opponents such as the Huskies and the Gauchos in hopes of ultimately competing for the Ivy League title.
“Our overarching goal this season is to win an Ivy league title, [and] any win along the way just helps us get there,” Junot said.
The Crimson has not won an Ivy League Men’s Soccer title since 2009.
The trip to California will be Harvard’s final test before beginning its league schedule against rival Yale. Journeying across the country will bring its challenges, and the weekend looks to be a good gauge of the Crimson’s chances as it enters into Ivy play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After going 0-3 in two if its three tournaments to open up the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-8) heads to Dartmouth (1-8) on Friday night motivated to commence the most important part of its season: Ivy League play.
“I think we’re excited to get into league play because it is what really matters,” said sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey, who leads the team with 116 digs. “I think we’re excited to play some familiar opponents, and I think that just adds some extra drive to win. We’re not too down right now, but just hoping that we gain something from our losses—a little motivation.”
The Crimson has gotten off to a slow start this fall, extending its losing streak to five matches in a heartbreaking loss at New Hampshire (7-8) on Tuesday night.
Not only is Harvard excited to move on, but the team also feels that a tough early slate has it prepared for conference play.
“We always traditionally have a tougher preseason,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We didn’t come out on the winning end in as many [matches] as we would’ve liked, but we’re definitely prepared for Ivy League play.”
The Big Green has had a similarly rough start to the season. Although it finished fourth in the Ivy League last year with an 8-6 mark in league play, the team lost four seniors and its roster is now reliant on many younger players.
Even though Dartmouth has struggled of late, the Crimson still has much to prove. It has not beaten the Big Green since 2008, losing six straight matches over that stretch.
“It’s always a good rivalry [with Dartmouth],” Casey said. “It’s always an important game for us, so it’s good we start the season there. I know we’ll be ready to go because they’re a big rival for us.”
Weiss believes that Harvard knows how to attack this Big Green team and hopes that it can exploit Dartmouth’s weaknesses.
“They’re a very defensive team, they’re scrappy, and we know what their system looks like, so we can find holes in their defense,” Weiss said. “They lost a couple of key seniors and there are freshmen in their spots, so we’re going to capitalize.”
The Crimson finished sixth in Ivy League play last year. When asked if the team is positioned to improve in conference play this season, Weiss had no reservations.
“Absolutely,” she said. “[Last year] there were a couple of matches that we lost by a couple of points. It’s coming down to the preparation and how we practice…. The goal is to improve on that 5-9 [record], and we have the ability and athletes to do so.”
Kathleen Wallace, the freshman outside hitter who ranks second on the team with 88 kills, has been a huge part of this year’s Harvard team.
“Kathleen’s been playing really well, but what’s even more impressive is that she’s been a great teammate and that she’s handled this prominent role with a lot of poise,” Casey said. “She’s just crazy athletic, jumps so high and hits so hard, and is just a huge addition to our team.”
No matter the difficulties the team has had early in the season, things seem to be looking up for the Crimson, led by senior setter Beth Kinsella and captain outside hitter Taylor Docter. Docter paces the team with 93 kills and 2.74 kills per set, while Kinsella has a team-high 163 assists on the young season.
On Tuesday night at New Hampshire, both Docter and freshman setter Hannah Schmidt contributed with double-doubles, and the team seemed to be rounding into form despite the loss.
“We have really gotten better every time we’ve stepped on the court,” Weiss said. “We’ve done some good things with our offensive and defensive systems. So, we should be prepared.”
With the recent, non-conference matchups under their belt, Crimson players said they now know exactly what the team needs to do better if it hopes to compete with other Ancient Eight squads.
“We need to work on starting games strong and not waiting too long to turn it on, but there aren’t any huge issues,” Casey said. “Basically, we just need to play a little bit better.”
Harvard is confident, despite its disappointing start, that it can compete with the best of the Ivy League.
“Anybody can beat anybody on a given day, especially in the sport of volleyball,” Weiss said. “It’s always up for grabs in my eyes. We’ve been on the winning side and we’ve been at the top of the conference, and the goal is to be back there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s mid-September and that means the back-to-school grind is now upon us. And just as classes are starting to ramp up, Harvard athletics is in full swing as well, and some of Harvard’s top athletes are grinding it out in competition. But what were the best-of-the-best playing like in high school, before they became collegiate sports stars? Here’s a look at how some of the top Harvard athletes fared before embarking on their Crimson careers.
 
Danny Biega—Senior, Men’s Ice Hockey
 
Before joining the Harvard roster, the Montreal, Quebec native spent two years at Salisbury School in Connecticut.  As captain his last season, he led the squad to a New England prep title and was tabbed the Defenseman of the Year while also being named to the New England Prep All-Star team. In 2010, Biega was drafted in the third round by the Carolina Hurricanes. The first defenseman in Crimson history to record back-to-back 30-point seasons, Biega hopes to add to his already decorated career in his final year at Harvard.
 
Andrew Campbell—Sophomore, Men’s Lightweight Crew
 
The 2011 U.S. Rowing Man of the Year began his rowing career when he was just 13 years old. Campbell trained in New Canaan, Conn., at the Maritime Rowing Club under the tutelage of former Ukrainian national team member Yan Vengerovskiy. Despite being slightly smaller than other rowers, Campbell nevertheless emerged as one of the top lightweight rowers in the United States, finishing second in the lightweight double sculls at the 2009 U.S. Rowing Youth National Championships after finish fourth the year prior.  The following year, in 2010, Campbell took the title in both the single and double sculls at the event. After taking time off last year off to train for the Olympics, Campbell returns to Charles and looks to be a dominant force on the water for Harvard.
 
Temi Fagbenle—Sophomore, Women’s Basketball
After picking up basketball roughly six years ago, Fagbenle moved from England to attend Blair Academy in New Jersey and hone her game. Her efforts quickly paid off. Fagbenle, who also competed on Blair’s track and tennis teams, quickly turned into one of the most dominant players in the country on the court. She helped lead Blair Academy to the New Jersey Prep A state title and garnered McDonald’s All-America honors on the heels of a stellar senior season. Although she sat out her freshman season due to a questionable NCAA eligibility ruling, Fagbenle got her fair share of time on the court playing for the United Kingdom in this summer’s Olympic Games. Expect Fagbenle to be a force to be reckoned with on the court when the women’s basketball season gets underway in November.
 
Amanda Sobhy—Sophomore, Women’s Fencing
 
Amanda Sobhy was a name widely known amongst the international squash community well before the Sea Cliff, N.Y., native set foot on Harvard’s campus. In high school, Sobhy won the 2010 Junior World Championship, becoming the first American to ever win the title. She also was the youngest player to accumulate four WISPA (Women’s International Squash Players Association) titles. Sobhy entered Harvard as the top female player in the United States and was also ranked in the top-20 internationally. The highly touted recruit ended her freshman campaign as the CSA national champion after an undefeated season and looks to add to her already-impressive resume this coming year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent days, awkward, oversized high school students have been following awkward, oversized freshmen all over campus.  It’s that time of year again: varsity recruiting season. As the verbal commitments roll in, one must wonder whether a legend will emerge from the Class of 2017. Does one of these recruits have what it takes to be the next Harvard athletic great? Here’s a look at the pre-Harvard careers of some of the finest athletes to wear Crimson.
Jeremy Lin began to perfect the art of coming out of nowhere as a high school baller for Palo Alto High School in California. Lin became a local folk hero after he led his underdog team to a state championship over nationally-ranked powerhouse Mater Dei during his senior year. But Lin’s high school days were not all gravy and beans. UCLA failed to offer him a spot on its varsity squad, and even Stanford passed on the talent shooting hoops in its backyard. In addition, clumsiness plagued Lin’s high school career. As a junior, Lin suffered a season-ending injury in a pick-up basketball game the night before a regional championship game. In the midst of his senior year Cinderella run, Lin dropped and broke the California Central Section Championship trophy.
How many high school athletes win an Olympic gold medal? Well, this writer’s little sister did, but people tell me it’s a relatively rare thing. As a senior at Choate, Harvard hockey great Angela Ruggiero won the first gold medal in women’s ice hockey as a member of Team USA at the 1998 Nagano Olympics. She would go on to win another three Olympic medals over the course of her career. Harvard’s other four-time Olympic hockey medalist, Jennifer Botterill, was the youngest player on the losing side of the 1998 Olympic final as a member of Team Canada. She and Ruggiero joined forces as freshmen that very next fall and shared a triple in Leverett as sophomores.
After his senior year of high school, swimmer David Berkoff placed 31st in the 100-meter backstroke at the 1984 U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis. According to a 1985 Crimson article, Berkoff was a “late bloomer” who enjoyed a solid, but not world-class, senior year at Penn Charter School in Philadelphia. But the 5’9” Berkoff quickly rocketed to international attention at Harvard as he pioneered the “Berkoff Blast-Off”—a now-prohibited technique that involves kicking underwater for more than half the length of an Olympic-sized pool. Berkoff won the 100 back at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials and is Harvard’s most decorated Summer Olympian.
When Ryan Fitzpatrick sat down for his first class at Highland High School in Gilbert, Ariz., he did not appear destined for athletic success. According to azcentral.com, the scrawny freshman was just 5’4” and 120 pounds. But the Amish Rifle grew up quickly.  Fitzpatrick lettered in football, basketball and track, and he quarterbacked Highland High to a regional championship as a junior. Yet Fitzpatrick’s secondary school career followed the same trajectory as Jeremy Lin’s: great local success coupled with little national attention.  Arizona State passed Fitzmagic up, forcing him to play in the Cambridge cold.  What a bummer.

 Though they have been sparring back and forth for months, U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law school professor Elizabeth Warren will debate face to face for the first time Thursday night in prime time. 
The debate, sponsored and moderated by WBZ-TV in Boston, will be the first of three televised dialogues between the candidates. While only an hour in length, experts expect the debate—and the two scheduled for later this fall—will prove to be an important inflection point in the hotly contested Massachusetts U.S. Senate race.
With polls showing Brown and Warren neck-and-neck, the debates may serve as one of the last chances for the candidates to sway undecided voters before Nov. 6. 
Whether you're politically interested or just a TV junkie, watch the debate at 7 p.m. on WBZ-TV or online at www.cbsboston.com. Check The Crimson for post-debate reaction and much more on Massachusetts's U.S. Senate race.

Samuel F. Wohns '14, a UC candidate and leader in the newly formed Crimson Coalition, was handed down his second campaign suspension Wednesday evening after sending unsolicited messages to Quincy House residents.
The Undergraduate Council Election Commission says that Wohns violated campaign rules by using a mailmerge to send out campaign e-mails. Mailmerges, which make mass e-mail blasts look "personalized" by automatically incorporating the recipient's name, violate a UC election rule which specifies that candidates may not send unsolicited messages online.
"The Election Commission cannot understate the severity of this action: the advantage provided by a mailmerge cannot be discounted through any sort of penalty. In a UC Presidential race, this would have resulted in an immediate disqualification. The ability to directly reach all constituents severely disadvantages all other candidates, who have chosen to abide by the rules of this election and thus help ensure a fair, democratic process," reads the EC e-mail announcing a 36-hour campaign suspension.
This most recent sanction comes just one day after Wohns completed a 24-hour campaign suspension. That disciplinary action, which consisted of 12 and 24-hour campaign suspensions for all Coalition members, was prompted by a Coalition op-ed that printed before UC campaigning opened.
Wohns could not be reached for comment, though he did provide The Crimson with an e-mailed statement: "The EC has now suspended my campaign for a total of 60 hours, forcing me to cancel plans to distribute flyers, knock on doors, and participate in a GOTV event. The suspensions make it difficult for penguins to fairly choose their UC representative, but my fingers are crossed; you never know until the votes are counted."
Wednesday's EC announcement ended with a warning to Wohns: "Any further violation will result in immediate disqualification."
Voting for the 2012 General Election closes Friday at noon. Results should be announced by Friday evening.
