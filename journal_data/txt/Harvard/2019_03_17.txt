After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Subtle instrumentation puts poetic lyrics front and center on Noah Kahan’s new single, “Mess.” Like the indie artist’s previous songs, “Mess” marries soft fingerpicking with solemn lyrics that crescendo into a catchy, repetitive chorus. In this song, the lyrics portray that fame isn’t what he had hoped it would be, leaving the question to be answered: Can he “put [his] pieces back together?”

The single begins with simple minor progression and a steady tempo that, in true indie fashion, is appropriate for a long car ride on a familiar road, perhaps while staring dramatically out the car window. Nostalgic lyrics show Kahan’s desire to return to his home in rural Strafford, Vt. and drive the “89 to Boston.” He sings that, if he could, he would “try fit back into all [his] old clothing” and “would wipe [himself] clean of what is unimportant.” His voice lingers on the conditional “could” and “would,” aching for an impossible homecoming.
While the song’s synth beat and volume make it more upbeat than the verse, the chorus’s repetition maintains the melancholic tone of the song. Kahan remains nostalgic and ambivalent in his repetition of “I’m a mess.” The artist craves permanency: “I’d move back home forever / I’ll feed the dogs and I’ll put all / My pieces back together.” The use of the word “forever” shows his longing to stay static in one place and for the familiarity of simple tasks like feeding the dogs. However, the juxtaposition of the soft verse and forte chorus creates a sense of urgency — the sense that home may be lost forever.

The second verse retains the synths and stronger beat of the chorus, as Kahan questions what is important in the wake of his fame. He sings of a “weight on his back” and his coping mechanism of “ignor[ing] it.” He feels that his fame is a “mask” for what he really is, but is unable to find “the way [he] look[ed] before [he] wore it.” Kahan is yearning for something that is lost because fame is “not what [he] had hoped.” The song picks up the pace to show his grappling with the anxiety that comes with fame. Not even Kahan’s friends are the same — they “only ever ask how tour is.”

Kahan’s strength is his ability to make his struggle to reconcile conflicting desires for fame and for normalcy relatable. Some may envy the fame he has, but Kahan is honest that it’s not all that it’s cracked up to be. He wants the simple things that everyone else wants — he wants his dogs, the cold, and the 89 to Boston. He debunks the pleasure that comes with fame while also showing that it is common to feel that the grass is always greener on the other side. 

Kahan’s lyrics leaves us with a host of unanswered questions: Can he give up fame? Can he return home? Can home even be returned to if it’s not the same? In the end, he doesn't come to a conclusion at all. His repetition of “I’m a mess” becomes desperate. Even as the distance between him and his home continues to grow, he cannot give up on following his dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We kind of felt like we owed them one.”
Bryce Aiken’s words could not have rung more true on Saturday afternoon, with a chance to avenge the 2018 Ivy League Championship loss at Penn.
The Harvard men’s basketball team did just that, dashing past the Quakers in the final minutes to book a spot in the tournament final in New Haven. The third time against the Crimson was not the charm for Penn, who fell yet again to Harvard by a 66-58 scoreline that didn’t do the intensity of the contest justice.
An all-around effort on both sides of the court complemented lead scorer Bryce Aiken’s 19-point performance, capped off by a late top-of-the-arc dagger three over Quakers guard Antonio Woods. That triple widened the Crimson margin to six, and Harvard secured the victory in the final six minutes with a turn around jumper from freshman Noah Kirkwood and the junior Bryce Aiken’s lay-up.
“We had to do everything we could to make winning plays to win the game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I don’t think we played particularly well, but I thought we were tough and we made winning plays...I thought the difference for us was on the foul line and certainly on the backboard. We needed every single one of those numbers to win the game this afternoon.”
The prolific offensive dominance by Penn junior big AJ Brodeur continued on Saturday afternoon, as the 17.4 PPG man logged an efficient 10-of-20 outing on the stat line. Brodeur added 25 points to his previous 47 points inflicted on the Crimson side this season, but was rejected twice by Crimson big Chris Lewis late in the contest.
Freshman Kale Catchings, who made his fifth start tonight, was another critical component defensively, providing relief on Lewis in defending the over-sized Brodeur despite being undersized.
“[Brodeur] appears to be the heart and soul of their team in terms of how they play through him,” Amaker said. “He is very tough to defend and we tried to mix different types of players on him, Lewis being bigger, stronger, Kale being a little smaller and having great base and balance and quickness as a big-time athlete. So we had to try different people.”
The Quakers threatened with numerous runs in the second frame, including a 6-0 push as everything appeared to rim out for Harvard to kick off the second half, as well as an 8-2 spurt at the 10-minute mark. The Crimson went behind 43-48 at the point, but ensuingly scored eight unanswered to retake the lead.
Penn’s fouls also racked up on a team already thin in bench depth. Starting four Max Rothschild was forced to hit the pine only five minutes into the second frame with his fourth personal, while second-leading scorer Devon Goodman fell victim to a taken charge by Danilo Djuricic at the 7:06 point, giving the junior his fourth foul. Goodman’s foul trouble did not seem to be an issue as he carried just one personal heading into the concluding ten minutes. But the Penn guard heard the referee’s whistle three times in quick succession, and had to take a momentary breather on the bench.
Despite beating Penn twice this season already, the Crimson showed signs of nerves early on. Harvard looked shaky to start, early in the afternoon on Saturday. The Quakers leapt out to a 7-0 lead, and fed off of the energy present in the building, thanks to a heavy contingent of the Red and Blue faithful in the crowd at Payne Whitney Gymnasium.
But if the Crimson looked poised to go out in the semifinal round, Aiken had other ideas. The Randolph, N.J., native forced a turnover, before whipping a pass to Kirkwood to put Harvard on the board, following the play up with a layup of his own. Aiken’s early spurt helped calm the Crimson early on, but back-to-back baskets from Brodeur and a triple from Goodman forced Amaker to call his first timeout, as Penn took a 14-4 lead.
As the first half wore on, Harvard chipped away at the lead, locking down on the Quakers’ perimeter shooting after Penn started the game 3-of-5 from beyond the arc. A big and-one play from sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic narrowed the deficit, and the Ivy League regular season champs were finally able to level the score with three free throws from Juzang, who was fouled by the Quakers’ Jake Silpe on a three-pointer.
A triple by Kirkwood in the closing minutes of the half gave the regular season champions their first lead of the semifinal, and free-throws from Catchings allowed the Crimson take a lead into halftime. Both first-years played admirably in the biggest collegiate games of their careers, and Kirkwood in particular shined offensively, knocking down two of the biggest threes of the contest. 
“My approach was the same, mentally I felt I was fine,” Kirkwood said on his mentality in his first time playing in the Ivy tournament. “I have great teammates like Bryce and a lot of upperclassmen especially that were guiding me and telling me the ropes of how these games go on with the shorter warmups and all that stuff. I felt prepared even before I stepped on the floor.”
The Ivy League championship game tips off at noon tomorrow morning on ESPN2. Only the winner of the Yale-Princeton contest stands in the way of the Crimson’s return back to the Big Dance. Harvard has not appeared in March Madness since the 2015 season, a year in which the Crimson fell by just two points to the University of North Carolina in the NCAA Tournament.
“Everyone contributed to this game and played a big part [in the win],” Aiken said. “My teammates played terrific and picked up the slack. Obviously it hurt with that loss last year so we just wanted to come out and get the win.”
If Harvard is to advance to March Madness, they will have to most likely beat Yale or Princeton for a third time this season. But this Crimson team, that has so brilliantly exorcised the demons of last season by beating Penn for a third time, is more than equipped to do the job. When the dust settled on Saturday afternoon, Tommy Amaker’s team found themselves 40 minutes from March Madness.

NEW HAVEN — Harvard women's basketball will face off against Penn on Saturday night, as it hopes to earn its first-ever appearance in the Ivy Tournament final. The Crimson has fell short in each of the two tournament semifinals in the history of the tournament.
The Crimson are led by junior sharpshooter Katie Benzan and junior forward Jeannie Boehm, and are coming off a sweep of Columbia and Cornell in the final weekend of Ivy play. Harvard lost to Princeton and Penn in its final regular season tilt, but did earn a victory over the Quakers in its prior contest at Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penn guard Ashley Russell grabbed a rebound, then looked ahead to see teammate Tori Crawford streaking ahead of the defense. Russell found her teammate, who laid the ball in to put the Quakers up 37-18 on Harvard midway through the second quarter. It was the Quakers’ seventh straight make to start the second quarter, and Penn never looked back, going into halftime with an 18-point advantage and extending it to as many as 30 points in the second.
Harvard (16-13, 9-6 Ivy) dropped its semifinal contest against Penn (24-5, 13-2) 91-62 at the Lee Amphitheater this past Saturday night, exiting the Ivy League Tournament in the semifinals for the third consecutive year.
Despite boasting one of the best defenses in the country, it was the Quaker offense that was the star of the game tonight. Shooting 54.4% from the field and having five players score in double figures, Penn’s offense was seemingly unstoppable. The Quakers scored over 20 points in every quarter, and dominated the game from start to finish.
“I am completely shocked by how we started this game and how we responded to normal things in a basketball game,” said head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Whether it’s an official’s call you don’t agree with or a missed shot… instead of us getting mad and digging in a little bit we just went back on our heels and I never expected my team to do that. I am shocked by that and I don’t have an answer for why we reacted that way.”
It was not supposed to go this way.
The first two matchups between Harvard and Penn went to at least one overtime, with the Crimson sneaking past the Quakers in double overtime in Cambridge before Penn returned the favor in an overtime win at the Palestra a few weeks later.
“We talked a lot about putting 40 minutes together,” said junior forward Jadyn Bush. “The biggest difference between those two overtime games and tonight was that before we were able to put 40 minutes of solid defense together regardless of whether our shots were falling. Tonight our shots not falling greatly affected our defense and it ended up costing us.”
Both teams expected another close one on Saturday night, but it was clear pretty early on that this night was going to be different. After Harvard took its only lead of the game, Penn went on a 12-0 run to end the first quarter, then hit another three to start the second to push its lead to 24-10.
“Honestly they started in the zone,” said Delaney-Smith. “They had a game plan to catch and shoot threes from kids that maybe don’t have that role all year long. They have great rebounders and we were supposed to box them out. They just hit the shots and we reacted really poorly to that perfect flow they had at the start of the game and I just couldn’t get my kids to recover unfortunately.”
The Crimson never got close after that. For a brief moment at the start of the third quarter, it appeared that Harvard might yet get back into the game. It forced a steal, leading to a three from junior guard Katie Benzan — who ended up leading the team with 12 points — to cut the lead to 15. When the Quakers turned the ball over a second consecutive time, it seemed as if the tide was changing.
But Penn quickly regained control, scoring 11 of the next 14 points to push the lead to 23 and eventually extending the margin to 26 at the end of the third quarter. Russell led the way for the Quakers, scoring 20 points and adding four assists as she looked in control of the offense throughout.
“When your shots don’t fall, it’s tough to get into that role or that zone, but that’s the sport of basketball, sometimes they fall, sometimes they don’t,” Benzan said. “Regardless, we have to keep that intensity on the defensive end. They just played us much tougher. They got to the 50-50 balls and the long rebounds. When you’re not making shots on one end, and they’re outhustling you on the other, it’s a tough combination. When you have that combination, you unfortunately lose a big one, and it’s really hard to have that loss here at the tournament.”
In the fourth quarter, the desperate Crimson resorted to playing more physically and to taking more risks defensively. Harvard committed 13 fouls in the fourth quarter, leading to 17 Penn free throws. With frustration mounting, senior guard Nani Redford committed her fourth foul in the backcourt with 3:23 to go, then slammed the ball on the floor out of frustration. The referees gave Redford a technical foul, ending her night and her Ivy League career and serving as a fitting coda to a bitterly disappointing night for the Crimson.
Harvard will await word on whether it will participate in an invitational tournament in the upcoming days.
