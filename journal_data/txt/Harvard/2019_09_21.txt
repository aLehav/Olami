Visually staggering and emotionally riveting, James Gray’s epically proportioned “Ad Astra” not only launches audiences into an engrossing space odyssey of interplanetary voyage, but in doing so, also encourages pensive soul-searching: At the film’s core are questions about legacy, humanity’s place in the universe, and the pursuit of science. These poignant themes are elevated by a magnetic performance from Brad Pitt and gorgeous cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, propelling "Ad Astra" into the stratosphere of space epics.
Set in the near future, at a time when mankind has ventured to the far reaches of the solar system and travel to the moon has been commercialized, “Ad Astra” wastes no time dwelling on world-building and dives head-first into its central conflict. When a mysterious power surge from Neptune leaves tens of thousands dead on Earth, Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), son of legendary astronaut Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), is tasked to discover its source, which is hypothesized to have a connection with his long-lost father.
Make no mistake: “Ad Astra” isn’t just the science fiction action-adventure the film’s marketing makes it out to be. Yes, Brad Pitt rides a moon rover and is chased by space pirates. But viewers searching for cheap carnival thrills and gimmicky computer graphics should look elsewhere. “Ad Astra” can at times be a glacially paced drama, and at other times, an adrenaline-inducing thriller, but never in its 122 minute-runtime does it lose the viewer's fascination.
Much of the film's magnetism stems from Brad Pitt's commanding, career-defining performance: He anchors the film with stoicism, heartfelt sincerity, and moments of stinging vulnerability. Already a three-time Academy Award nominee (for “12 Monkeys,” “Moneyball,” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”), Pitt makes a strong case for a double-nomination this year. It’s hard to believe that the same actor who played the laughably indestructible stuntman Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino’s comedy “Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood” just this summer, so brilliantly enlivens such an antithetical character.
At the film’s heart is a story about a son struggling to cope with his father’s legacy. Should a son be held accountable for his father? Should a son take up his father’s mantle? Should a son even try — or is he destined to? Unlike many other audacious science-fiction projects, "Ad Astra" makes a concerted effort to find satisfying answers to these existential questions, and most importantly, it leaves one guessing on these answers until the very end.
Gray also isn't afraid to dive into a labyrinth of social issues. From the economic war for land and resources on the moon to the relentless drive for scientific advancement, the film’s themes are as resonant as its characters. The overarching motif bridging these themes is the insatiability of mankind's desires: People are commercializing space just as they commercialized Earth — from the Subway shop on the moon base to the Virgin Atlantic rockets flying commercial to the moon. Perhaps our never-ending pursuit to further science, to leave no stone unturned, has distracted us from appreciating the more important aspects of life. It is such concerns that breathe lingering life to “Ad Astra” long after it's closing credits.
It’s perhaps surprising then that 20th Century Fox would spend $87 million on what essentially amounts to a thought-piece on mankind's solitude in the universe. Needless to say, no expense was spared; "Ad Astra” is a visual splendor. Cinematographer van Hoytema colors the film beautifully: From the industrial, claustrophobic outposts on the Moon and Mars, to the clinical, hypnotic white interiors on the space-ships, he delivers on Gray’s campaign to cherish what we have and not to dwell on what we don't — to embrace Earth as our special home. Hoytema's breathtaking frames of space even live up to his earlier work in Christopher Nolan's “Interstellar," or even Lubezki's mesmerizing cinematography in Alfonso Cuarón’s “Gravity," placing “Ad Astra” at the zenith of science-fiction spectaculars.
Gray imbues his film with melancholy — perhaps excessively at times — but this only reinforces the film's message; its conclusion is so fulfilling, so cathartic, and yet so optimistic. “Ad Astra” is James Gray’s most ambitious project, but unlike other science fiction soirees into the final frontier, this film doesn’t buckle under self-enforced narrative pressures that force unsatisfying answers or unearned conclusions (take Danny Boyle’s “Sunshine” or Nolan’s “Interstellar”). “Ad Astra” is an achievement in tight, efficient storytelling, highlighted by a timely message, stunning cinematography, and a heavyweight performance from Brad Pitt.

The challenge of adapting any novel to the screen is effectively communicating its plot while providing insight into its characters’ development. This makes adapting Donna Tartt’s Pulitzer Prize winning epic, “The Goldfinch,” all the more difficult: This work, told from the perspective of protagonist Theodore Decker, covers almost 10 years and is comprised of some 800 pages. Given these parameters, it is safe to say that director John Crowley does a reasonable job of translating it to the screen. While others have criticized Crowley’s film adaptation of the book for its admittedly staggering length and downright bizarre plot order, it feels rather exaggerated to dismiss it all together. Though it is by no means a great film, “The Goldfinch” still manages to explore its characters’ traumas successfully and allow its lead actors to deliver compelling performances.
Summing up the first plot points of “The Goldfinch” is difficult as its beginning barely scratches the surface of its complex sequence. After surviving a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art which kills his beloved mother, Theo (played in childhood by Oakes Fegley, and in adulthood by Ansel Elgort) is forced to take refuge with the family of his childhood friend Andy (Ryan Foust): The Barbours are a wealthy Upper East Side family, headed by the cold, philanthropic matriarch Samantha Barbour (Nicole Kidman). Theo’s situation is all the more complicated since he walked away from the accident with Carel Fabritius’s priceless Dutch masterpiece, “The Goldfinch,” an artwork that simultaneously haunts and comforts him throughout his life.
Transitioning a character from adolescence to adulthood is no easy feat, but the actors manage to achieve it seamlessly. Fegley proves to be an excellent young Theo, accurately capturing the character’s self-assuredness and charm as well as his trepidation. He even seems to mimic the mannerisms of adult Theo, played by Elgort, astonishingly well. In fact, most of the other young actors do a fine job of adopting the demeanors and speech patterns of their adult counterparts. Even Finn Wolfhard, with his wobbly Slavic accent, manages to perfect adult Boris’ (Aneurin Barnard) shrug and wry smile.
Elgort, in particular, is well-cast as the smooth-talking businessman. At times his performance can feel quite heavy-handed, such as in the tearful scene in which he declares his love for Pippa (Ashleigh Cummings), where his desperation feels completely forced and melodramatic — as in, Claire-Danes-as-Carrie-Mathison-of-“Homeland” level melodramatic. Yet Elgort manages to deliver an overall satisfactory performance. His breakdown after Boris’ confession and his confrontation Kitsey (Willa Fitzgerald) about her infidelity are particularly touching moments, as are any of the scenes that Theo shares with Mrs. Barbour. Nicole Kidman, of course, plays the role of the uberly-rich but damaged Mrs. Barbour perfectly — a role that given her earlier credits in “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Big Little Lies,” she might be able to perform in her sleep at this point.
Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be praised for his beautiful shots, particularly the incredibly close shots of the actor’s faces, which showcase their emotional range. Even his framing and lighting are immaculate, as if emulating the artistry of the painting central to this film.
But despite Deakins’ efforts, the editing and sequencing are reductive. There is an extraordinary amount of fades between scenes that prove both unnecessary and distracting. While the film’s mangled order of events might have the intention of imbuing mystery, for those who have not read the book, it is confusing and messy. The decision not to tell the story chronologically, as the book does, might have appeared advantageous, but instead means that the film loses the book’s unique narrative style.
Unfortunately, the book’s myriad genres lend themselves much better to the novel form. As a result the film feels like it’s straddling way too much material and comes off as disjointed, suggesting that the story might have worked better in a mini-series form afterall. If Crowley should be criticized for anything, he should be for his failure to make the plot’s changing tones blend together seamlessly.
Still, the film does not totally lose sight of its core themes. It still manages to raise questions about grief and the value we place on objects of our lives. Of course, there is so much ground to cover that it shies away from exploring the importance of art. But there lies the crucial point: There is just too much material for the film to cover. The popular criticism that certain characters like Boris or Hobie not done justice are valid, yet, by choosing to focus on the most central points in Theo’s life, Crowley makes the calculated decision to give a broad view of Theo’s suffering rather than a detailed Dickensian-level portrait of the nuanced world he lives in.
Tartt’s novel is partly famous for its rather rambling ending, which packs a number of questions into its final chapter. The film presents an ending that is much simpler. In a film so defined by intercutting scenes, it is rather poetic that we finally get a complete look at the moments that changed Theo’s life. While the film is too messy to spark much award-season buzz and too plot-heavy to please the book’s readers, “The Goldfinch” still manages to be an earnest film.

Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel will conduct a review of billionaire donor and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein’s donations to the University, Vice President and General Counsel Diane E. Lopez announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Friday afternoon.
“This review, led by Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel, is ongoing,” Lopez wrote. “We will continue to work to gather facts, review relevant materials, and speak to people across the University with pertinent information.
The message follows an email sent by University President Lawrence S. Bacow last week in which he detailed the gifts Epstein gave to the University and announced a review. Bacow wrote that the University has accepted nearly $9 million from Epstein between 1998 and 2007 and did not take a gift from him after his guilty plea in 2008. He also wrote that the University will donate $186,000 in unspent gifts to organizations that help victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.
Lopez announced Friday that Harvard affiliates with knowledge of Epstein’s donations could send information to the Office of the General Counsel by email, or if they wished to remain anonymous, share information via the Harvard University Anonymous Reporting Hotline.
The hotline may be used by anyone — not just University students, faculty, and staff. Those who wish to provide information through the anonymous hotline can do so by calling the office’s phone number or submitting a report online.
Epstein died in an apparent suicide last month after facing multiple allegations of sexual abuse of underage girls. The Miami Herald reported in November 2018 that Epstein operated a sex ring out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home and identified around 80 women who say Epstein molested or sexually abused them before 2006.
As a result of an extraordinary plea deal led by former U.S. Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta ’90, Epstein spent only 13 months in a county jail. Acosta resigned in July after federal prosecutors in New York opened a new probe into Epstein.
Epstein has long-standing ties to Harvard, despite never attending the University. He was close friends with a number of administrators and professors including former University President Lawrence H. Summers, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky, and Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz. In his email last week, Bacow revealed Psychology professor emeritus Stephen M. Kosslyn named Epstein as a visiting fellow in the Psychology department in 2005.
Last week, The Crimson also reported Epstein “facilitated” but did not contribute money toward the construction of Harvard Hillel’s building, contrary to previous reports.
MIT has also faced criticism over their connections to Epstein. The school’s President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter last week to MIT affiliates that he signed a letter thanking Epstein for a donation to the school in 2012. Reports show that Epstein donated to the MIT Media Lab, prompting Joichi Ito — the former director of the Media Lab — to resign.

Forty-five students were elected to the Undergraduate Council in the highest-turnout election in recent years, the UC Election Commission announced Friday.
This year’s election saw 2,149 voters, a significant increase from the 1,885 ballots cast in 2018 and 1,454 votes in 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board proposed a rule Friday that would essentially reverse a 2016 decision that opened the door for students at private universities and colleges — including Harvard — to unionize.
It remains unclear what effect the rule change might have at Harvard, where the University recognized, and began bargaining with, its graduate student union last fall and negotiations are ongoing. The proposed rule — which will officially publish in the Federal Register on Monday — will undergo a 60-day public comment period before it can be implemented, according to an NLRB press release.
Sam Klug, an organizer with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, wrote in an emailed statement that while he does not expect the rule to affect Harvard’s union, the proposal is an “egregious and desperate misuse of power by the Trump administration.”
“It is practically unprecedented for the NLRB to engage in rulemaking on an issue like this,” Klug wrote. “This latest attack on our democratic rights will only embolden our massive and growing movement of tens of thousands of student workers.”
Klug added that the union plans to submit a public comment opposing the change.
NLRB Chairman John F. Ring said in the release that the board wanted to clarify a regulation that has been reversed three times in the past 19 years.
“This rulemaking is intended to obtain maximum input on this issue from the public, and then to bring stability to this important area of federal labor law,” Ring said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “reviewing the proposed rule” to determine how it may affect the ongoing negotiations.
The proposed rule would revoke the employee status of students undertaking academic work under the National Labor Relations Act — a law that grants recognized employees the right to form unions. Universities, however, could still voluntarily recognize such student unions.
The board’s proposed view is that these students are primarily on campus to learn, not work, thus they should not be classified as employees, according to the release. In 2016, under the Obama administration, the NLRB ruled that private university students could be classified as employees, though that decision was made as a result of a case brought by students at Columbia University, not through the board’s rulemaking processes.
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV said it is “unprecedented” for the NLRB to use rulemaking to overturn an established principle.
Rulemaking is typically only applied to fill a gap in the current law, he said.
Gould said that the dynamics of graduate student unionization before and after the proposed rule will remain fundamentally the same, but the university might be able to take a different approach to recognition.
“At the margin, it creates a greater incentives for universities to refuse to recognize unions and contracts,” he said.
The NLRB voted 3-1 in support of the proposal, with board member Lauren McFerran dissenting.
McFerran wrote on Twitter that she opposed the decision because student employees have “workers’ interests and workers’ rights.”
“There is no good basis – in law, in policy, or in fact – to take their rights away,” she wrote. “But it is not too late for the Board to reverse course. I urge my colleagues to hold public hearings to hear directly from the workers whose lives are affected by this proposal.”
