After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mattie R. Kahn ’15 cares about girls — and she thinks you should too. Her debut book, “Young and Reckless: The Girls Who Sparked America’s Revolutions,” set to release on June 13, 2023, chronicles American social movements and their common denominator — teenage girls committed to justice.
“Young and Reckless” raises questions about why girls have been tasked with leading community service throughout American history, a phenomenon Kahn first noticed interviewing climate activists for Elle. She noticed how women dominated the justice space and began to explore how and why young women and girls held principal roles in the movements she wrote about. The book takes readers through the 1830s labor movement, women’s suffrage, the Civil Rights Movement, Black Lives Matter, and climate protests today.
Kahn worked at Elle as a staff writer from the fall of 2015 and later transitioned to be a senior editor and culture director of Glamour Magazine from 2018 until her departure in November of last year.
Her time at Elle began at Harvard while she was covering the band Pussy Riot in 2014. While the group originally refused to be interviewed, Kahn was able to snag an interview after an incident at the JFK Forum at the Institute of Politics. The band members demanded the release of a graduate student who had been detained by local police for trespassing on Harvard property, as he had been banned from campus earlier in May for protesting. This incident gave Kahn a unique opportunity to visit the Cambridge Police Department for an inside scoop. Her first story was published in Elle on Sept. 16 of that year and titled “A Night in Jail With Pussy Riot.”
While finding joy in her beginning at Elle, in typical Havard alumni fashion, Kahn vacillated between whether she could pursue writing or other fields. “I really did not know, I thought, ‘Should I do consulting recruiting?’” she said.
A History & Literature concentrator and former Kirkland House resident, Mattie thanks her time at Harvard for “allowing me to feed my curiosity.” She learned how to navigate JSTOR, and took classes with Pulitzer Prize winner Louis Menand and historian Jill Lepore.
“I think the most valuable thing I got out of my classes was the permission to ask people questions,” she said.
Within a year of leaving her post at Glamour, Kahn had a book review of John Pompeo’s “Blood & Ink” and a think piece on balloons printed in the New York Times. She also profiled Aid Access founder Dr. Rebecca Gomperts for this year's Glamour Woman of the Year and wrote a cover of First Lady Dr. Jill Biden for Harper’s Bazaar in May.
Kahn credited Leah Chernikoff, former digital director of Elle, with giving her her first professional opportunity, and creating a space that helped Kahn grow as a writer and woman. At Elle, Kahn was able to go head-first into the 2016 election coverage. She also worked alongside women like Nikki Ogunnaike, Sally Holmes, Gena Kaufman, Julie Schott, and many other talented writers who have ascended professionally to new heights for women in media.
Kahn described her former team at Elle as “The Avengers,” she said. “It shall never be reconstituted…that team taught me to just go for it.”
Working in women’s media gave Kahn the access that informs “Young and Reckless.” By having a diverse and supportive environment centered around women’s stories, Kahn had already examined many of the issues her book chronicles.
However, she was not ready for the transition from a professional question-asker at Glamour and Elle to a 1,000-words-a-day author.
It was “absolute horror,” she jokes.
Kahn managed with a savvy writer’s toolkit. She would break her writing into smaller and more manageable chunks and break the movement into distinct eras. She also cites her dog Marvin, a rescue she and her husband Jason Hellerstein ‘15 adopted over the pandemic, as another key to writing success.
Kahn thanked the Bravo TV “The Real Housewives” franchise for being the perfect way to relax when struck by writer’s block. She would also call her mom to talk out ideas when writing during lockdown. Lastly, citing her sources as she wrote — a trick she learned while at Harvard — and a thesaurus helped round out a smooth writing process.
While writing “Young and Reckless,” one of the unsung heroes Kahn discovered was Mabel Ping-Hua Lee, a Chinese women’s rights activist and minister in the early 20th century.
“Why did it feel worth it to her to advocate for and care about people who were not extending her the same grace?” Kahn asks of Ping-Hua Lee. “She had her eyes on a bigger prize… every step forward was going to be a step for women.”
According to Kahn, “Young and Reckless” is a celebration of women like Lee while simultaneously pushing readers to consider the unique pressures placed on girls. Clearly Kahn’s interest in activism and political expression, the basis of her debut book, began before her time at the College, but has evolved to encompass the often underrepresented multitudes of womanhood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Performed for only one weekend, from Nov. 10 to Nov. 12, Boston-based queer creator collective What If?’s “Romeo and Juliet” remained committed to both quality artmaking and radically inclusive community-building. Harmonizing seemingly contrasting elements, director Aloe Dickson’s lively and unorthodox vision yielded a well-done, moving tragedy infused with fast-paced humor and an attention to detail that did not detract from free and spontaneous artistic exploration, and outstanding performances from actors despite the casual and laid-back staging.
The intrigue of What If?’s “Romeo and Juliet” began even before arrival at the destination. After receiving the address to a private location, audience members embarked on a walking adventure — under an unpleasant overpass, alongside a busy non-pedestrian road, and down an easily-missed dirt path — to reach a nondescript white building that seemed more like a place to avoid than a performance venue.
The mysterious journey made it all the more thrilling to enter What If?’s colorful, cozy, hidden basement space. The neon mushrooms and hula hoops on the walls, sideways penguin and disco ball on the ceiling, and beanbags and dry paint on the floors immediately established the artsy, unconventional, and unconstrained nature of What If?.
These qualities were also clear throughout the show, which had a light, youthful spirit. With contemporary music like “Wildest Dreams” by Taylor Swift and “Sad Femme Club” by Kimmortal, contemporary costumes by Charlotte Stowe, and vibrant performances from every actor, this production of “Romeo and Juliet” did not drag. Dickson’s choice to heavily highlight comedic bits played to the strengths of the cast and rendered the show more engaging, accessible, and enjoyable for the audience.
Even still, What If?’s creative risks extended beyond comedy, maintaining the tragedy essential to “Romeo and Juliet.” For example, right before Romeo and Juliet died alongside each other, they locked eyes and — both alive and conscious for a brief moment — shared a kiss before their fatal ends, despite the common interpretation that the lovers are not awake together at the same time. Dickson’s bold choice for such a famous scene worked well and contributed to its heartbreaking effect.
The most compelling aspects of the production were remarkable performances from Zoa Archer (“Romeo”) and Melinda Kalanzis (“Juliet”), accurately described online as “two baddies.” Archer was captivating, lighting up the stage with her infectious energy, strong stage presence, and wide emotional range. Kalanzis played Juliet in a genuine and convincing manner, with sensitivity and heart. Displaying the romantic yearning essential to “Romeo and Juliet,” the joyfulness essential to What If?’s production, and undeniable stage chemistry, Archer and Kalanzis made Romeo and Juliet lovable characters — which is a difficult feat and often the greatest challenge to a successful production of this play.
Moreover, Conor Bean (“Lord Capulet”) and Jorge Gutierrez (“Tybalt”/“Paris”) mastered an obnoxious, arrogant rapport as Capulet and Paris, properly establishing the significance of their characters. Laura Clabaugh (“Nurse”/“Montague”) had impeccable comedic timing as the Nurse, which was refreshing for the role. Gretchen Waldorf (“Mercutio”/“Lady Capulet”) approached deep, complex emotions with maturity and skill: When Capulet threatened to disown Juliet, Waldorf stole the show, despite having few lines in that scene. Jolyne Allegro (“Benvolio”/“Friar”) brought a tasteful goofiness that completed the show.
Every actor performed with a strong grasp of the text, having worked with the Shakespearean language and scansion of iambic pentameter to a point of mastery and, beyond that, reinvigoration. The verbal work demonstrated that creativity, imagination, and fun can coexist with intellect, high-quality artmaking, and capability of handling difficult drama.
At the end of the show, Kalanzis said to the audience, “I have always wanted to make this kind of weird, gay basement art that really means so much to all of us.”
The audience responded with a warm laugh, but Kalanzis’ statement was both honest and important. What If?’s “Romeo and Juliet” was wholesome, eccentric, and unapologetically queer. Above all, it was good art. Listening to an expertly-delivered “a rose by any other name” soliloquy over the smell of marijuana and the sound of trains rushing by on the Orange Line was healing. Reaching What If?’s location might have felt dangerous at first, but upon arrival, audiences felt safer than ever and were fortunate enough to witness excellent art.

—Baba Lukata, “Rehearsal”
Death is all too common for Black folk. Black women, men, queer, non-binary, and trans folks too often don’t get to grow old in this world. Black people live within zones of disposability where our lives are too often treated as if they don’t matter. Being a Black person in America, we carry death with us. Death is all around us, and that’s what makes grieving even harder. Grieving never ends in a world that continually takes one’s loved ones prematurely.
Takeoff, whose real name is Kirsnick Khari Ball, was the youngest member of the Georgia rap trio Migos — along with his uncle Quavo (Quavious Keyate Marshall) and his cousin Offset (Kiari Kendrell Cephus). Together, they have triumphed in the rap industry for more than a decade. The group was formed in 2008, and they dropped their first mixtape, “Juug Season,” in 2011. On Nov. 1, Takeoff was fatally shot outside of a downtown bowling alley in Houston.
Takeoff’s death is a sure tragedy, but within Black history — and within Hip Hop history more specifically — this pattern of ever present death and violence isn't out of the ordinary. In recent years, there has been a seemingly endless list of rappers who were killed due to gun violence. Pop Smoke (Bashar Barakah Jackson), Young Dolph (Adolph Robert Thornton Jr), Nipsey Hussle (Airmiess Joseph Asghedom), and PnB Rock (Rakim Hasheem Allen) are just some of the that have recently been killed.
“Young Rich N*ggas” was my first introduction to Migos at a time when everyone around me was listening to Versace, Hannah Montanna, Bando, and Baker’s Man. I remember listening to “No Label II” with my friends in elementary school. We were probably too young to really be listening to Migos and understand the hard life lessons they were rapping about, but we did it anyways. We were running through our school’s gym and playground, rapping the lyrics to “Handsome and Wealthy,” “Freak No More,” “Contraband,” and “Antidote.”
As I went through middle school and high school, Migos began their ascent to superstardom with the release of “Culture,” which included hits, “T shirt,” “Slippery,” and the 2017 anthem “Bad and Boujee.” A year later, they followed it up with “Culture II,” which solidified their status as leaders of rap culture with chart-topping tracks including “Narcos,” “Walk It Talk it,” “Stir Fry,” and “Motorsport.”
Coming from the South, Migos was a part of the soundtrack to my life. As I grew up and matured, Migos grew in popularity. As they became leaders in the rap scene, their sound also matured. That is why Takeoff’s passing hit me and many in my generation so hard. We not only lost a rap icon, but we lost someone we had considered one of us.
I remember waking up the morning of Nov. 1 and listlessly scrolling through Twitter before I got ready to go to classes. Within minutes of being on Twitter, I saw multiple posts about Takeoff’s death and read speculations that the video of the murder was being circulated as well. That’s when I closed the app.
Black death is treated as a spectacle, especially in media. Whenever a high-profile celebrity dies, or when there’s yet another case of police brutality or other forms of anti-Black violence, videos of the event are spread around on social media like wildfire. Although the spread of information can be a valuable catalyst for change, oftentimes, social media exploits violence against Black people for clicks, enjoyment, or sadistic pleasure. People should be allowed to rest, mourn, and grieve in peace, and families shouldn’t have to be subjected to the repeated violence.
The concept of preventing death, especially while being prominent in the rap game, was ever present in the discussion following Takeoff’s death. This was especially relevant given that Migos have always taken their security seriously, even down to what they post online.
What’s even more ominous about Takeoff’s untimely death, however, is that about a week before, on Oct. 22, when Takeoff and Quavo were on the podcast Drink Champs, hosted by N.O.R.E and DJ EFN, Takeoff spoke about how he purposely avoids speaking about death. “I'm just a witness of manifestation… I've seen it, so I know the power of the tongue is powerful,” he said. “What you speak comes to existence. There's certain things you just don't say."
Looking back at it, the quote that hits me hardest is when Takeoff said, “Enough is enough, you know? I'm chill and I'm laid-back, but it's time to pop it. Time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don't want them later on when I ain't here. I want them right now."
Takeoff deserved his flowers then, and he deserves them now. Quavo gave his nephew his flowers in a radio interview in 2018 when he gave Takeoff the title of “best rapper in the group.” But Takeoff deserved to grow old.
Both Quavo and Offset have since issued statements detailing their love for their cousin and nephew and how much he will be missed. Takeoff was a quiet but influential figure in the rap game, and although he had a reserved personality, his impact will stand the test of time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were no empty seats in the Temple Ohabei Shalom on the evening of Thursday, Nov. 10 in anticipation of the Rasa String Quartet’s performance of “The Best of Hans Zimmer.” Upon entrance to the temple, the stage, lit merely by hundreds of candles, left audience members hoping that the performance could somehow live up to the dazzling surroundings. Once the four musicians began to play, however, all fears were assuaged.
The show, a part of Fever’s Candlelight Concerts in Boston series, featured twelve of famed film composer Zimmer’s best-known movie soundtracks. Audience members of all ages purchased tickets to experience the music so often heard in movies like “Interstellar” or “Pirates of the Caribbean” live. A violinist from the quartet, Kiyoshi Hayashi, spoke about his experience performing such pieces.
“One of the coolest things about being a musician is that when you play music from movies that are from your childhood, it’s able to bring back all of your memories that you associate with that movie. It’s so fun. On stage, I’m thinking that I can’t believe I get paid to do this,” Hayashi said after the performance.
Hayashi wasn’t the only one having fun during the performance. Audience members across the room were tapping their foot to the beat or smiling at songs from beloved films. The music ranged from the somber tones of “A Dark Knight” from “The Dark Knight” to the light, upbeat “Zoosters Breakout” from “Madagascar.”
The Rasa String Quartet, a group of skilled performers with charismatic stage presences, were the perfect conduits for such pieces. Made up of cellist Mina Kim, violist Emma Powell, and violinists Maura Shawn Scanlin and Hayashi, the quartet played with both a poise and playfulness that perfectly reflected the nature of the music.
And, while the songs may be nostalgic for most viewers, the unique space gave audience members a new and compelling way to engage with the music. On the center stage of the temple’s expansive main room, the four musicians were crowded by artificial candles at varying heights. The dim lighting brought the quartet to focus while also subtly illuminating the wonderful features of the temple.
“It’s such a great atmosphere — I feel like it’s as much about the music as the atmosphere. It’s all commingled together in what hopefully makes it a great experience for audience members,” Hayashi stated.
He wasn’t wrong. The setting allowed the incredible concert to be about more than just about music; It was inherently meditative in its nature, perhaps even emotional.
The concert served as a reminder to viewers of the power of music, the power of film, and the power of nostalgia as we look back upon songs we perhaps heard for the first time years ago, when we first encountered a childhood classic like “The Lion King.” The music in the background of these films, that we may not have not fully recognized when watching, has stuck with us, just as the stories and characters have. And, what a beautiful way to be reminded of these remarkable songs, often long forgotten, by the Rasa String Quartet in candlelight.
The only downside of the concert was its brevity, as the entirety of the performance lasted under an hour. Out of Zimmer’s dozens of film scores and soundtracks, the show covered a mere twelve. By the looks of the entranced audience members, it seemed as if the quartet could have played for a few more hours without losing any viewer’s attention.
However, all-in-all, Zimmer’s remarkable music was made that much better by Fever’s concert with the Rasa String Quartet. Though it might not be believable that the songs could become any more sentimental and meaningful, the candlelit concert found a way to do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is easy to confine writing to a highly formalized art form, entered through academia, confined to a particular realm of education. Nadia Colburn ’95, a poet, teacher, and writing coach currently based in Cambridge, argues for a more holistic approach to writing, however, one more fully realized within the human experience, and accessible to all.
“I really think that we are creative beings,” Colburn said in a recent interview with The Harvard Crimson. “And that, like birds, we sing. I think that it's just a natural human capacity to use language to communicate and to make something beautiful.”
Colburn discovered her love for poetry early on in her education at the College. “I took a Whitman seminar with Helen Vendler when I was an undergraduate,” she said. “That course totally shifted me to thinking ‘Okay, I'm going to focus on poetry as an undergraduate on my thesis,’ and then I fell in love with the work of W.H. Auden and I wrote my undergraduate thesis and my dissertation on Auden.”
After graduate school, Colburn began to explore writing outside the confines of academia alone. “I felt like the container of the ways in which literary academia looked at literature felt a little bit limited,” she said. “I wanted to get outside the box a little bit more.” This choice prompted Colburn to begin to focus more on her own creative writing, as well as lay the foundation for her current holistic writing program, Align Your Story.
“I realized that there was a big community of people who are really looking for creative writing,” she said. “Teaching academia, you're usually teaching young people, and people of all different ages want to continue studying literature and studying writing. So I created the Align Your Story writing school to teach in a more holistic way. I often bring in meditation and yoga and work with writers who are interested in writing creative nonfiction and poetry.”
Align Your Story has allowed Colburn to cultivate her own writing alongside that of her students, in a supportive and passionate creative community. “It's so rewarding for me to help other people go through that process of using their writing as a way of both developing as a writer and developing as a person,” she said. “I think the more those two go hand in hand, the more we develop as a person, the more our writing actually gets stronger. And we have a vision that we want to share with other people.”
Alongside her collaboration with students through Align Your Story, Colburn has dedicated significant energy to her own projects. “The High Shelf,” Colburn’s first collection of poems, was published in December 2019 and contains work produced over a span of many years of writing.
Colburn emphasized that “The High Shelf” consists heavily of reflection on her past experiences and struggles as well as her newer role as a mother. “You have little kids, and then you're their home, and you provide the stability and answers, and then it's turtles all the way down. What's beneath that?” said Colburn, referring to the story “Yertle the Turtle” by Dr. Seuss. “And I asked myself, well, what's the foundation underneath the foundation? For that, partly, it was my own reckoning with my own childhood.”
Perspective was a major component in the ultimate publication of Colburn’s debut book. “The material I was working with was so personal, and I was so much in the middle of a question that hadn't been fully resolved,” she said. “So I put the manuscript aside and went on and wrote a memoir, and then in the process of writing that memoir, understood myself a lot better. Then I went back to that manuscript. I think that with more hindsight and more perspective, I was able to see it less from inside the question and more from outside the question.”
Taking a step back from the manuscript not only affected the creation and process of “The High Shelf,” but also the individual poems within the collection. Colburn described the imagery that came as a result of this reflection: “It was both working with that sense of openness and enclosure, and so I have a lot of poems about boxes, and also a lot of ways in which I was exploring silence and open space and the intersection between those different concepts.”
Although “The High Shelf” was Colburn’s first formal collection of poems, she has been writing for the majority of her life. Colburn describes her artistic process as stemming from a deep personal reflection. “I write very traditionally lyric poetry, where my poetry comes from a conversation with myself. A kind of dialogue with myself,” she said. “Also with the poems that I've read — they're in dialogue with my own reading. Then I write out of whatever it is that I'm experiencing, thinking about, and feeling at the moment.”
Poetry specifically presents an opportunity for Colburn to work through questions and themes she personally grapples with. “One of the themes that I come to again and again, is how to find a container large enough to hold both the suffering and the joy, the injustice and in the kindness of the world,” she said. “Poetry, for me, is a place of integration and finding a kind of spiritual home in language through questions.”
This type of “spiritual home” is highly important for Colburn and her work. “Poetry can help us access other ways of knowing the dream life and the unconscious and the mythic or the spiritual,” she said. “Then it can help integrate them with a narrative with more linear minds.”
Colburn is highly influenced by the Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, who she takes as a “primary spiritual and philosophical teacher.” She highlighted the importance of his teachings of inter-being and the concept that we are all interconnected on a deep ecological plane. This intrinsic link between the body and the environment is a large influence for Colburn’s spiritual philosophies around writing.
“In school, so often we're trained to write sitting at a desk, and the academic institutions develop our intellect. I was pretty good at that. I value that very much,” Colburn said, “but at the same time, that's only one part of ourselves, and then often the head almost gets cut off from the rest of the body. My own personal process is integrating the mind and the body and the spirit. For myself, a lot of my own stories were carried in my body and not fully understood by my intellect, and writing helped me. Reconnecting my mind and body helped me listen to those stories that my body was holding.”
Colburn’s second poetry book will be released in the coming year, with the University of Kentucky New Poetry and Prose Series. She is excited for the future trajectory of her own work, as well as the further development of Align Your Story and the students she collaborates with. “I see [my career] as personal work, creative literary work, and also the work of being a citizen in the world,” she said. “I think that all goes hand in hand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanksgiving is a time for togetherness, cheer, and appreciation for many people across the U.S. And with (nearly) a full week without classes for college students, it’s also a great opportunity to reflect and spend some time curled up with a good book! In honor of the holiday season, here is the definitive list of recommendations to suit the holiday.
For books celebrating families big and small who truly love one another:
“Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman

“Howl’s Moving Castle” by Diana Wynne Jones
Sophie is the eldest of three sisters, so she knows she is fated for precisely nothing. After her step-mother sends the girls into the world to seek their fate, Sophie gets cursed, runs away, and meets a cowardly wizard. A wacky story about magic, mayhem and the power of belief, the novel that inspired the Studio Ghibli film of the same name is a must.
“Lady Midnight” by Cassandra Clare
Set in the famous Shadowhunters world of “The Mortal Instruments” series, this novel tells the story of childhood best friends Emma and Julian. Faced with a change to get revenge for the murder of Emma’s parents and reunite Julian’s family, the two will stop at nothing to get what they want and protect the people they love.
“To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” by Jenny Han
Lara Jean Song-Covey loves baking, old movies, and the idea of love. After her older sister leaves for college, she feels adrift at home and finds herself embroiled in boy drama after a fake dating scheme goes awry. A sweet novel about first loves, growing up, and the joy of sisterhood.
“Little Women” by Louisa May Alcott
The March sisters are four very different girls, who all dream of different futures growing up in Massachusetts during the Civil War. Through trials, anger, and disagreement, the sisters learn what it means to lean on each other, come what may.
Since family is about much more than who you’re related to, here are some books featuring characters who come together to form their own familial communities:
“Six of Crows” by Leigh Bardugo 
In this heist novel set in a fantasy world, six hypercompetent teen criminals team up for the ultimate job. It quickly becomes about more than just the money as they each interrogate what they want from their lives, and how, working together, they could be so much more.
“The Ranger’s Apprentice” series by John Flanagan
In this YA series based in the medieval-style kingdom of Araluen, a group of orphans who grew up together come of age and begin apprenticeships. As they go out into the world, the kids realize their flaws, take on adventures, and make friendships to last a lifetime.
“Red, White and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston
The first son of the United States and a Prince of England find out they might just be perfect for each other, if given the chance. Strong friendships, complicated family dynamics, and blossoming relationships abound in this lovely novel about self-discovery, bravery and the power of love.
“Vicious” by V. E. Schwab
A duology about revenge, supervillains, and family, “Vicious” features a pair of best friends who become enemies. Lost souls who have powers they don’t know how to control find family together, and are willing to do anything to save themselves and those they’ve come to love.
“The Rise of Kyoshi” by F.C. Yee
Set in the world of “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” Kyoshi’s life is turned upside down when she discovers that she, and not her powerful best friend, is the next Avatar. Thrust into a political mess, she has to reckon with this new legacy dumped in her lap, learn about the parents she never got to meet, and decide which of the people she grew up with she can trust.
The “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” series by Rick Riordan
A wonderful series about the half-mortal children of the Greek gods in the modern (or, 2005) age. When Percy Jackson discovers he might have a special destiny, he doesn’t care, and only wants to save his Mom.
“Matilda” by Roald Dahl
In a lovely children’s book about a magical little girl who loves to read, Matilda is unappreciated by her birth family. As she grows up, she manages to make friends, surround herself with people who really love her, and finds power within herself.
“The Perks of Being A Wallflower” by Steven Chbosky
Charlie, a socially awkward teenager who has been through a lot, chronicles his growing pains, family difficulties, and high school struggles through letters to the reader. He finds healing through intense, meaningful friendships and finding peace with his family.
For many, the holiday season can stir up complicated feelings. So, finally, for some excellent reads that explore the complex ideas of friendship, family, and communities, and the many things those words can mean, try:
“Dune” by Frank Herbert
In the sweeping fantasy saga recently adapted into the 2021 film, feudal families go to war for the control of a desert planet. Heir Paul Atreides wants to live up to his parents’ aspirations for his potential, ensure the futurity of his house, and find peace in the new home he doesn’t understand.
“If You Could Be Mine” by Sara Farizan

But when her best friend who she has been in love with her whole life gets engaged, she decides she has to stop it. In doing so, she learns about BGLTQ communities in a country where homosexuality is illegal, and she has to weigh how far she is willing to go for love.
“The Fifth Wave” by Rick Yancey
One of the few survivors of an alien apocalypse, all Cassie cares about is saving her brother. As children become soldiers and enemies make alliances, the characters have to decide what they’re willing to endure for the future of everyone and everything that ever was.
“If I Stay” by Gayle Forman
After a tragedy, aspiring cellist Mia is in a moment of stasis, and needs to decide whether she wants to live or die. She reflects on her life, her family, her friends, her boyfriend, and her dreams, and tries to decide what it would mean to go on.
“The Pact” by Jodi Picoult
The Harte and the Gold families have been close for years, so when their eldest son and daughter start dating, it seems only natural. But after a suicide pact went wrong, the families are forced to reevaluate their relationships with each other, and how happy they really were.
“The Cruel Prince” by Holly Black
Jude and her twin have lived with the man who killed their mother since childhood. Now, she needs to manipulate the treacherous High Court of Faerie to get vengeance. And might even have to trust the contemptuous youngest son of the king who has made no secret of his disdain for her.
“We Were Liars” by E. Lockheart
A rich, privileged, multigenerational family lives under a set of strict, unspoken rules, and summer together every year. Two summers ago, something awful happened that no one will talk about, and struggling Cadence can’t remember what it was. Now back at the family summer home, she is determined to find it out, and uncover what family secrets are lurking below the surface.

Language has power. It can influence our thoughts, interactions, and even the way we dream. This multifaceted influence of language is explored in R. F. Kuang’s “Babel: Or, The Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution.” Set in Oxford during the 1830s, “Babel” imagines a fantasy world in which the study of languages, alongside the smelting of silver, can create magic.
Readers follow Robin Swift, a Chinese boy raised in England, as he begins to see how his powers are harnessed by Britain to control its worldwide empire. Kuang’s novel critiques imperialism and academia by utilizing a fantastical version of Oxford and underrepresented voices from the British Empire. Although “Babel” is occasionally straightforward in its themes, its well-researched plotline and amazing characters create a stunning alternate history which successfully critiques the legacy of empire.
R. F. Kuang has distinguished herself as a respected fantasy author through her “Poppy War” trilogy, which uses detailed research to reimagine Chinese history. Kuang’s work reflects her academic career — she has studied at Georgetown, Cambridge, Oxford, and is currently pursuing a PhD in Eastern Languages and Literature at Yale. The author’s deep passion for history and language are again put on show in “Babel,” making it a dream read for any academic, especially those who are interested in the social implications of empire or linguistics. Every historical reference and etymological phrase has been carefully founded in fact.
The struggles of the novel’s main character, Robin, are also based in the true stories of those oppressed under the British Empire. Robin is from China, but after his mother’s death is swept to Britain to be educated in the magic of language to serve the Empire. While there, Robin is constantly taunted for his Chinese heritage. At Oxford, he meets Ramy and Victoirie, who are also outsiders from India and Haiti, respectively. In “Babel,” these characters are allowed at Oxford, which in the 1830s would not have accepted people of color or women, yet they face discrimination at every turn. Kuang shows how foreigners in Britain were seen as exotic and uneducated, no matter their status in society.
Despite the clear research that went into the project, it sometimes felt as if Kuang was unsure about her own work. In an author’s note, she writes that “anyone who has spent time at Oxford will scrutinize your text,” and she seems to carry this anxiety throughout her piece. This insecurity spoils the novel’s nuance, since Kuang seems to constantly want to justify her ideas. “Babel” is littered with footnotes, which occasionally enhance the text by explaining certain foreign phrases, but chiefly disrupt the reader’s immersion. The tone comes off as awkward and unnecessary and gives the impression that Kuang did not trust the reader to comprehend basic European history or draw their own conclusions concerning the characters’ conversations. The novel could have benefited from the removal of these comments, which inject Kuang’s voice into the narrative rather than clarify confusing remarks.
While the fantastical magic system of the novel is compelling, it isn’t explored comprehensively enough. Magic in “Babel” is an intriguing combination of silver bars and linguistics, and the novel’s characters study languages and etymology in order to harness the magical qualities of silver. The reader is told that silver powers almost everything in the British Empire, including steam engines, water purification, and even the construction of Westminster Bridge. This system of magic is intriguing since it is rooted in the realm of academia and language, but the main characters are never able to truly access its power. Although they learn to use silver as they progress in their studies, their education never gets completed, and they lack the ability to harness its full power. While this lack of knowledge may be a deliberate metaphor for the British Empire’s ability to bar certain activities from its oppressed subjects, it also leaves the reader unsatisfied.
The unexplored aspects of the magic system leave the reader to ponder if “Babel” should even be a fantasy novel. Kuang’s research was amazing and most of its ideas could have been communicated in an alternative history of real-life Britain. Instead, Kuang sets her novel in a fantasy world, which is intriguing but less developed than her critiques of empire. “Babel” could have reached its full potential if its magical elements were explored further.
While Kuang’s disruptive voice and unexplored fantastical elements do affect the reader’s perception of “Babel,” the novel is still well worth the read. It allows its readers to reconsider their stance on the British Empire and see how outsiders were discriminated against at Oxford and England at large. Most importantly, it is an exciting foray into history and how it can be shaped by individuals. As Kuang writes: “History isn't a premade tapestry that we've got to suffer, a closed world with no exit. We can form it. Make it. We just have to choose to make it.” “Babel” chooses to make a new version of history, and does so quite creatively and successfully.

The following review contains minor spoilers for “The Crown.”
On Nov. 9, Season Five of “The Crown” returned to Netflix at a precarious time for the future of the British monarchy — and the world’s opinion of the Royal Family. About two months after the death of Britain’s longest reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, “The Crown”’s portrayal of the late Queen was not the most favorable.
Reopening its examination of royal life, the Season Five premiere begins with a portrayal of the Royal Family’s (perhaps embellished) preoccupation with power and luxury, hinting at their detachment to the widespread economic hardships of their country.
Claire Foy reprises her role as young Queen Elizabeth, giving viewers a brief history of the family’s royal yacht, the Britannia. Beyond inspiring a sense of nostalgia for the early years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, this season’s narrative structure also points out the inherent flaws that arise with supporting such institutions.
While “The Crown” has in past seasons done its best to frame the Queen in a positive light, glorifying her commendable poise and elegance, this episode offers quite a negative outlook on the priorities of the esteemed family. In the episode, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip casually request and even attempt to order the government’s provision of millions of British pounds for the repair of their yacht. Whether or not this scene was slightly dramatized, it is evident that a clear shift and change in perspective has occurred on the show’s part. By placing an emphasis on the separation between the British Royal Family and the rest of the country, “The Crown” takes a step towards a neutral portrayal of the family, balancing out their past idolization with some stark realism.
Even supporters of Queen Elizabeth had to wince at her portrayal in this episode: In one scene, she notes that of all her inherited palaces and castles, her favorite has been her yacht — the only thing that has been a true “expression” of herself. Viewers will be reminded that, in Season Four of “The Crown,” Queen Elizabeth despaired at the corrupt nature of her eldest son, Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor), who prioritized making his own estate into an “expression” of himself, blatantly ignoring the needs and happiness of those around him. Seeing Queen Elizabeth go from being able to recognize such self-centered obsession to attempting to do the same thing years later reveals the deteriorative impact of her family.
In terms of casting, however, “The Crown” has certainly succeeded. From Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth to Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana, the roles of such highly scrutinized and celebrated public figures have been done justice. The transition from Emma Corrin’s Diana in Season Four to Debicki’s this season was a considerable improvement. Not to say that Corrin’s portrayal of Diana was unjust, but Debicki captures the essence of Diana with greater nuance, giving “The Crown” a new sense of maturity and realism.
Jonathan Pryce’s portrayal of Prince Philip is also especially convincing. Unlike many other characters, the actors who have portrayed Prince Philip throughout “The Crown” have been consistently excellent, from Matt Smith to Tobias Menzies and finally Pryce. As the season progresses, viewers should look forward to seeing how Pryce grows into the role after a remarkably strong start.
The one casting choice that may be disappointing to viewers, however, is Dominic West as Prince Charles. While, again, his acting does the role of Prince Charles justice, previous actor Josh O’Connor set a very high bar in Season Four. As of the first episode, West is not a very convincing Prince Charles, but, again, he has plenty of time to settle into the role as the season continues.
Overall, Season Five is off to a very promising start, especially with the casting choices of the first episode. Yet with so much controversy in the world regarding reignited feelings about the Queen and the Royal Family, many will be surprised that “The Crown,” might be changing its stance on the very institution it previously idolized, overshadowing the production and casting choices themselves.

Katherrin A. Billordo approaches the latest installment of this column with artowrk depicting lush multicolored flowers, public artwork, and smooth jet-black cement. Using a range of techniques with a simple pen, the goal is to depict gentrification in modern-day Chicago.
Formerly an abandoned rail line, now a popular walking trail, the 606 is a greenway project that runs through Chicago's most notable northwest side neighborhoods. Unfortunately, these urban “beautification projects'' are much more problematic than they may initially seem.
Graffitied murals, overgrown weeds, cracked support pillars, and displaced residents lie below the trail. A closer inspection of the scene reveals the harsh reality of the 606 and other public projects that indirectly trigger gentrification. Despite the city’s investments in new amenities, concerns of community members most affected are ignored. Property values rise and residents and business owners are displaced in favor of wealthier counterparts.
The piece’s title, “The Purge,” references both this displacement and the movie of the same name, drawing a hyperbolic connection to their similar levels of chaos. The stroke techniques used exemplify this disorder. Cross-hatching (drawing multiple angled lines over each other), stippling (repeated dots), and scribbling fill the piece with shadows to give it a dark, gloomy, and disorganized look.
—Katherrin A. Billordo ’26’s column, Corazón, is a painting/sculptural series that depicts and explains aspects of her lived Hispanic-American experience and the technical artistic decisions behind the pieces.

Claire Saffitz ’09 returned to Cambridge on Friday night to discuss her newest cookbook, “What’s for Dessert: Simple Recipes for Dessert People,” at the Brattle Theatre. The New York Times bestselling author of “Dessert Person: Recipes and Guidance for Baking with Confidence” spoke about her recipe development process, inspirations, and favorite Thanksgiving desserts from local restaurants and bakeries during the event, which was hosted by the Harvard Book Store.
There wasn’t an empty seat in sight at the sold-out event. Guests, with cookbooks in hand, had the opportunity to ask Saffitz about baking techniques and recipe tips. Saffitz was joined onstage by moderator Megan Zhang, a journalist who writes about the intersection of food, identity, and culture for Saveur.
Saffitz rose to prominence through her role in the popular series on Bon Appétit Test Kitchen’s YouTube channel, Gourmet Makes, which featured Saffitz recreating popular candies and snacks with classical pastry techniques. Before joining the Test Kitchen, Saffitz trained at École Grégoire Ferrandi in Paris and earned her master’s degree in Culinary History from McGill University. Amid allegations of workplace misconduct at Bon Appétit in 2020, Saffitz announced her exit from the company and began creating her own content, including “Dessert Person.” Her personal YouTube channel Claire Saffitz x Dessert Person has amassed over one million subscribers and 57,000,000 views.
“What’s for Dessert” provides easy, accessible options for bakers of all skill levels, with drool-worthy photos throughout. In the introduction of the cookbook, Saffitz writes, “If you’re a beginner, rest assured: No dessert in this book is out of your reach.” The 100 recipes included a vast spectrum of desserts, including cakes, cobblers, pies, pastries, puddings, crepes, cookies, and more.
“It was really about making the book as accessible as possible to people at all skill levels, and also to provide a wide variety of different kinds of recipes that cater to different tastes,” Saffitz shared. “‘Dessert Person’ was so much about my point of view as a baker, and I think this book is a lot more outward looking.”
One unique feature of the cookbook is its recipe matrix, which plots each of the recipes on axes representing difficulty and time commitment. The distribution of recipes ranges from hot chocolate with marshmallows at five minutes and low difficulty to whipped cream tres leches cake with hazelnuts at six hours and moderate difficulty. Importantly — especially for people with less equipment and space — Saffitz does not require a stand mixer for a single recipe in the book.
Zhang pointed out that “What’s for Dessert” departs from Saffitz’s debut cookbook in that it incorporates a variety of techniques.
“For ‘Dessert Person,’ most of the dishes were baked, but for this book, you have frozen desserts and dishes you make on the stovetop,” Zhang noted during the discussion.
Saffitz emphasized the role that her background, which spans casual Midwestern bakes to classic French pastry, plays in recipe development. At the end of the book, she includes a section called “Essential Recipes & Techniques,” which contains recipes for things like pastry dough, marshmallows, and meringue. Saffitz also includes how-to guides for key techniques like creaming butter and sugar, which are central to any recipe, underscoring her commitment to accessible baking.
“For me, dessert, historically, has meant something baked. But I felt like that was in a way limiting and that I owed it to myself as a recipe developer and as a dessert person to expand my own horizons,” Saffitz explained. “And then that goal dovetailed with the goal of accessibility for these recipes.”
The cookbook comes just in time to impress relatives and friends at Thanksgiving. Saffitz recommended her easy apple galette, cinnamon-and-sugar apple pie, and walnut & oat slab pie as potential options for audience members. For the non-bakers in the audience, Saffitz recommended her favorite Cambridge bakery, Sofra.
Saffitz’s appearance at the Brattle Theatre, which brought community members together to celebrate a Harvard alum, certainly answered the question “What’s For Dessert.”

On Nov. 7, the Harvard Department of English invited writer and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Jericho Brown for their Morris Gray Poetry Reading. Brown has authored several works of poetry, including “Please,” “The New Testament,” and “The Tradition,” from which he read a few pieces. Harvard Professor of English and African and African American Studies Tracy K. Smith, who helped organize the event, set the scene with opening remarks, introducing Brown's writing as one of “many traditions,” including the “Black lyric tradition.”
Audience member Micaela N. Rosen ’23 expressed a similar appreciation for his connection to the Black lyric tradition, saying Brown’s works were “very political,” and “rooted in Blackness.” When Rosen, who studies poetry at the College, was asked what they most admired about Brown and his works, Rosen said “You can understand his poetry. The way he writes is really beautiful, but you also know what he’s saying, which is not always the case in poetry.”
Crimson editor Serena Jampel ’25, who also studies poetry and read Brown’s book over spring break, recounted his “beautiful language and amazing imagery” as two of his greatest strengths.
“He just writes really evocative poetry that has such a masterful command of language. I just want someday to emulate maybe half of his talents. He truly is just an incredible poet,” she said. Jampel also expressed wanting to hear his poetry, specifically his duplex, a form he invented, “in his own words.”
Brown did in fact read several of his pieces from his different works, including a new poem inspired by the 1970s hit tv show “The Jeffersons,” and some duplexes from his book “The Tradition.”
Mia A. Ward ’24, who was also excited to hear his duplex poems, expressed her love for “The Tradition,'' saying it was a massive inspiration to a writer like herself. Ward admired the way Brown was “playing with form and creating his own type of form,” which she would like to incorporate in her own work.
“Before really studying him and studying his different types of poetry academically, I was just like a freestyle writer, like fuck form, it puts boundaries on writing,” she said. “But Jericho has introduced me to form, that you're able to express your thoughts more clearly through boundaries, and I really appreciate that.”
Brown acknowledged his love for form with a little dig at prose writers: “Can’t no prose writer read you the last page of their book.”
His poems were accompanied by witty remarks and life sentiments that made the audience laugh, clap, and ask questions after. When a question about his form was asked, he said simply, “every poem that we love says something twice. I can bring up anything I want, as long as I bring it up again.”
Student Dara F. Badon ’22, who took a class with Professor Tracy K. Smith, shared that she contemplated whether to attend the event, but then she reflected on how it felt to walk into Professor Smith’s class. “It felt like something was being spoken to me and I was being heard even when I wasn't speaking. I felt very nourished and very good, which is what I needed.” Badon also shared that after experiencing the event she did not “just appreciate Brown's work, but poetry as a whole.”
“It reaffirms the magic that is art and the magic that is poetry,” she said.
Tomisin M. Sobande ’26 said that although she didn’t necessarily know who Brown was two days prior, she loved it. “I am obsessed, he’s so intelligent,” she said. “A lot of the stuff he says goes beyond poetry and applies to our lives in general. His answers to a lot of the questions, those are just things we should apply to our lives to make our lives more fulfilling.”
The comments from attendees made it clear that Brown’s work can connect different generations of people and bridge the gap between older and more contemporary definitions of poetry.
“He just writes down lines he thinks of. That was inspiring to me because I've always felt like you have to know what you're writing about and write it all at once. He makes it more attainable. Poetry is like a higher order in my mind that I can’t reach, but I feel like he brought it down to earth,” Sobande said.
O'Gorman, who has an interest in writing, said that going to events like these inspires her and re-encourages her to write. “Overall, poetry is outdated and old, not relating to my life personally: it is inspiring to find a black, queer, poet who is young and living today and writing about current issues, and being able to read that in poetry,” she said.
After the event, Brown explained how he navigates the world of poetry. “The good thing is that I’m a Black poet, and for every Black poet that has ever been, there has never been any expectation,” he said. He referenced Gwendolyn Brooks, the first Black person to win a Pulitzer Prize: “She had no idea they were going to give it to her, or that anybody Black would be winning a Pulitzer Prize. You just do things knowing you got to do it for you.”

On Nov. 5, Harvard was lucky enough to host famed jazz trumpet player and composer Ingrid Jensen in a performance with the Harvard Monday Jazz Band. Jensen, alongside Yaure Muniz, the Interim Director of Jazz Ensembles, led the Harvard band in their “Landscapes from Venus: Large Ensemble Works by Women Concert,” which included some pieces composed by or featuring Jensen.
In the days following the performance, Jensen sat down for an interview with The Harvard Crimson to talk about the experience, as well her career in jazz more broadly.
As Jensen puts it, she “knew that [she] was going to do music since probably before [she] was born.” Her lifelong journey paid off. Since her graduation from the Berklee College of Music in 1989, Jensen has been taking the jazz world by storm. Some of her more notable accomplishments include becoming the youngest professor at the Bruckner Conservatory in Austria, performing with Corrine Bailey Rae on Saturday Night Live, winning the Carmine Caruso Trumpet Competition in 1995, and receiving the Jazz Journalists Trumpeter-of-the-Year award in 2019.
When asked what led her to become a musician, Jensen cited her mother’s record collection.
“My mom loved swinging jazz piano, so her record collection turned out to be majoritively African American artists — Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, Fats Waller and all of the real deep historical legends of this music,” Jenson said. “Their message was the music and the camaraderie and community that it creates. So between that, and growing up in an environment where we had a deep respect for language, I think swinging music was in my cells.”
“Swinging” ran so deep in her blood, in fact, that it prevented her from other avenues of music. Jensen recounted her brief stint with classical music, which came to a halt when her teacher told her that she was “too jazzy” to play in the “straight” manner required for classical music.
“At the time, I was hurt,” Jensen said. “Now I look back at it and think it’s kind of a compliment.”
On stage, Jensen’s “swinging” is evident in the best way. Jensen was outgoing as both a person and a musician, as she led the Harvard Monday Jazz Band. She danced her way through the performance, cheering on other band members in between her phenomenal trumpet playing.
“Think of it as a painting,” she said in reference to her performance. “The dancing and moving of my body comes from the emotional connection I feel to all these different textures we're playing with — sometimes a bright blue or other times foggy, earthy tones. When I start playing with the band, it's really their energy I'm buying off of. The more they connect with me and the more I can connect with them, the easier it is for me to do what I do.”
Jensen praised the Harvard Monday Jazz Band in this regard. “I know those students are doing a million other things. Their lives are so full and their brains are so saturated with so much information. For them to come on stage and play the way they played on that level is extraordinary in itself,” she said.
Musicians, Jensen went on to describe, need to be “in their body” when it’s time to play — something she feels the Monday Jazz Band did well. She spoke specifically about her piece “At Sea,” which she composed to tell the story of her honeymoon, where she and her husband sailed through southeast Alaska.
“They had done their homework, having checked out the song and listened to it. It made it easier for me — I didn’t have to explain the essence of each section,” she said. “It became more about what their impressions were and how they decided to put the story through their instruments. Every time I do that piece, it’s completely different – that’s why it’s so fun.”
Though the concert was specifically dedicated to large ensemble works by women, Jensen was notably one of the only women on stage with the Monday Jazz Band. Specifically, Jensen was the only female trumpet player.
When asked how she felt about it, Jensen shared that the issue of diversity comes from the popular vision of what a trumpet player looks like, especially as it affects younger students.
“The real problem is in the lower grades in school where they don’t see an image of a trumpet player, and if they do, it’s always the stock image of a man with a hat and cool sunglasses from New Orleans.”
However, Jensen thinks this can be changed.
“I can imagine that after this experience they’ll reach out to female trumpet players they may know. That's where we have to really nurture all those relationships — to encourage one another to come out and play. To get the representation of all people undernourished in this genre, mostly just because of the visual.”
Jensen will return to Boston in early February for two concerts with the ensemble Artemis at the Berklee Performance Center. To hear Jensen’s recorded music, check out her album “Infinitude,” co-released with her sister Christine Jensen and her more recent recording “Invisible Sound.”

While most of our student body was busy working during Indigenous People’s Day, a gathering of over a 100 people celebrated with speeches, dances, and activities. However, this joyous occasion is darked by  Harvard’s continued delay in returning Indigenous sacred artifacts and remains that reside across the institution.
Earlier this year, Harvard’s role in slavery and colonialism boiled to the surface with the release of the 2022 Harvard and The Legacy of Slavery Report. While the publication of the report was certainly a positive step towards rectification, it must be supplemented by an active commitment by students, professors and Harvard affiliates to ensure real change occurs at all levels of the institution. This commitment includes following the United States Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which requires the federal government and federally funded institutions to return Indigenous sacred objects, funerary objects, and human remains.  Under the original act, institutions had until  1995 to catalog and return any and all objects that fell within the criteria. Yet, 27 years after the inventory’s deadline, the Legacy of Slavery Report states that at least 6,400 Indigenous remains reside at Harvard,  along with some 13,600 sacred and funerary objects that aren’t affiliated with any specific tribe, according to federal NAGPRA databases. It is therefore clear that the NAGPRA Act is not being enforced effectively at many federally funded institutions — Harvard included.
Numerous Indigenous leaders have called out Harvard for the prolonged delay in the return of these remains and artifacts. Many federally funded institutions continue to draw out the lineage process of Indigenous sacred artifacts and remains, despite NAGPRA explicitly stating that  in cases of unidentifiable remains and items, the pertinent stakeholders must return them to tribes from the Native lands from which the artifacts and remains were originally taken. This June, following the  leak of an unfinalised version of the University report, the CEO of the Association of American Indian Affairs, Shannon O’Loughlin, expressed that the process of identifying the appropriate destination for remains was “not a scientific investigation,” and called on the University to follow the law that explicitly states that “no additional research is necessary” and that “the museum is supposed to use information it already has and consult with tribes” before conducting unnecessary, delay-ridden research.
Likewise, in 2021, the Association of American Indian Affairs explicitly stated in a letter  to University President Lawrence S. Bacow that “you have significantly more deceased Native people in boxes on your campus than the number of live Native students that you allow to attend your institution,” a mathematical certainty. When Ancestors cannot be buried and sacred items are not returned, long-established trends of America’s colonial history of ‘othering’ Native populations and their traditions are reproduced, whether intended or not.
Despite Harvard’s promise to reckon with its legacy of slavery and colonialism, affiliates across the institution have expressed that there is not a strong commitment to acting with efficiency, as demonstrated through the delayed completion of the NAGPRA guidelines for 27 years. Although Harvard created a Human Remains Returns Committee in September 2022, it is unclear whether this would speed up the process or purely provide another bureaucratic hoop to jump through. Throughout academia there is a long history of institutional forces being intertwined with white supremacist agendas.  Therefore,  in the creation of this committee,  the potential influence of institutional forces that may inherently undermine the committee’s progress must be taken into account. A committee of this nature should exist at our institution in the effort of repatriation, but a major issue facing this committee would be that the governing body and investigating party are one and the same. There needs to be a third-party, independent committee that ensures the University is abiding by NAGPRA.
It is important to acknowledge that implementing NAGPRA is  a widespread problem across universities, museums, and other federally funded institutions. Reclaiming artifacts is a lengthy and often expensive process for various Indigenous communities in the United States. As repatriation request processes differ from institution to institution, there is no uniform waiting period for communities receiving their rightful property. Some schools, like Harvard, have struggled in parting with history, leading to delayed repatriation. However, others have recently moved forward the communal effort of returning remains and sacred items. During the period from August 2020 to August 2021, UC Berkeley “[transferred] at least 297 individuals and 15,792 of their belongings back to tribes.” Similarly, earlier this year Vassar College completed its return of all Indigenous artifacts in their archaeological collections. These schools follow the lead of others like UNC Chapel Hill and Stanford, among others, in the rightful return of stolen items and remains. These universities prove that prompt, careful attention to detail of Indigenous artifacts is possible if the commitment to doing so is sincere and devoted enough institutional resources.
Harvard’s decisions and actions in the following months will demonstrate its sincerity — or lack thereof — to repatriate Indigenous remains and sacred artifacts. Harvard’s recent pledge to return the hair samples taken from Native American children in Peabody Museum to the rightful tribes is a positive act, but it is not enough. The wellbeing and success of Indigenous students currently at Harvard must be prioritized as well. As Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s History Department Anthony M. Trujillo, expressed in The Crimson, “this university just can’t ignore Indigenous life, thought, creativity, if it wants to be a leading institution in the next years and decades, centuries to come.” Returning the hair samples, in addition to the remainder of Indigenous remains currently in the University’s possession, cannot be the end all of Harvard’s commitment to its Indigeneous affiliates. More action must be taken to support and center Indigenous voices as well.  This lack of creativity in finding solutions hampers everyone and we, as Harvard students, need to decide what kind of institution we want to cultivate.
As Harvard continues to drag its feet, it is up to us, both Indigenous people and allies, to amplify the voices of our Indigenous classmates. Speak out against the injustices and violence that continues against Indigenous communities as time passes by. If we commit to shining a constant spotlight on Harvard’s moral hypocrisy in returning property to Indigenous communities, especially given the broader context of Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery Report, then there is a great possibility for change and transparency across the institution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, members of a neo-Nazi group came to Cambridge, where they threatened and intimidated local residents right in the heart of our campus. Donning masks and apparel touting NSC-131, a white supremacist organization based in New England, the individuals disrupted an anarchist book fair at the Democracy Center. The NSC-131’s jarring and alarming march should really be a wakeup call to a frightening movement that has been gaining momentum across the country.
This incident is part of a larger alarming trend of increased white supremacist and antisemitic activity in the U.S., which we condemn wholeheartedly. Hate against any group has no place in our discourse, and we unequivocally denounce all neo-Nazi hate groups, including NSC-131.
Though NSC-131’s presence is shocking and upsetting, it would be irresponsible to allow impending occurrences like these to continue surprising us. NSC-131 is only one organization within a broader movement for white power, which has swelled over the past several years under the Trump administration, which culminated in the Jan. 6th riots. Since Donald Trump’s departure from office, white supremacist hatred has continued, and Trump’s announcement that he will pursue a third bid for the presidency will only add fuel to the fire. Shootings against marginalized groups — like the racist rampage in Buffalo and the recent homophobic massacre in Colorado — are unlikely to cease soon.
In particular, hate crimes against the Jewish people have been rising around the globe. From Pittsburgh to Poway, Jewish communities have found themselves under attack in recent years, and Jews remain the most tormented religious group in the U.S. This uptick in attacks is merely a manifestation of a millennia-old phenomenon of hatred directed at the Jewish people — from the blood libel of the Middle Ages to the Pogroms in Europe, and from the persecution of Soviet Russia to the white supremacy during the Holocaust and today. The hatred we saw in Cambridge is nothing new.
Boston is no exception to this trend. During last summer’s Fourth of July weekend, the white-supremacist group Patriot Front marched the Freedom Trail with signage reading “Reclaim America.” In another instance, unidentified members allegedly attacked a Black passerby in Boston. That same summer, NSC-131 targeted a Boston drag-queen’s “story hour.” These are but a few examples of what is certainly a proliferation of white supremacy in Boston.
Hatred is not easily combated. We can more tangibly focus on its impacts: threats to the safety of the community. NSC-131’s activity took place just outside of Quincy House, and members of the group were caught “lunging and shouting” at people across the street. Though this threat was not directly targeted at students, it still raises concerns about campus safety. To ensure a safer campus, Harvard should ensure security forces are equipped to handle potential attacks on campus. This does not mean increasing police presence, as we have opined in the past, but directing some sort of pared-down security team to protect Harvard’s students.
Another way to combat hate is by improving Holocaust education across the country, which will help Americans understand the harmful potential consequences of white supremacist rhetoric. Though 19 states require public school Holocaust education curriculum, the remaining 31 states do not. One 2020 survey revealed the distressing reality that while most adults know what the Holocaust was and when it happened, only 45 percent of respondents could state the correct number of victims. Accurate, comprehensive Holocaust education can inform individuals about the dangers associated with hatred and discrimination, and is crucial in combatting prejudice and acts of hate. Higher standards for Holocaust education must be achieved to ensure that people adequately understand the history and truth of the Holocaust.
We are saddened to see hateful groups come to the place that we call home, but we can no longer treat these events like one-off incidents. White supremacy is still marching across our country and we must be ready to fight it. Although hate has come to our home, it is our duty to make sure it finds no home here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s annual financial report for fiscal year 2022 reflected a $2.3 billion fall in our endowment, as market instability and inflation nudged us towards net losses for the first time since 2016. But the report’s release saw University affiliates and stakeholders lose something else too, something less tangible than that princely sum: Transparency.
In a departure from previous years, Harvard’s most recent Annual Endowment Report failed to include underlying data on the performance of investments disaggregated by asset class. The Harvard Management Company, which oversees the endowment, had previously disclosed returns from University investments in specific asset classes such as public and private equities, real estate, and natural resources. This year, that transparency is gone.
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow has sought to justify this change, arguing that previous levels of transparency exceeded those of peer institutions and could therefore prove a competitive liability with respect to endowment performance. The validity of this argument seems uncertain even to financial experts, and we wish that Bacow would make a more substantial argument to the community.
We acknowledge that the interests of HMC may be at least broadly aligned with those of the broader Harvard community — namely, maximize endowment returns. In light of this fact, it may seem that concerns over declining transparency are trivial. But even if incentives are perfectly aligned, the protection of nondisclosure can result in insular and sclerotic decision making. There’s a reason that shareholders do not trust executives to run their company without transparency and oversight. In fact, data on asset class performance has explicitly motivated past scrutiny: The 2016 underperformance of natural resources was covered critically in the press, and HMC soon reportedly reconsidered some of its investments.
We also worry about the potential for cracks in the incentive alignment of HMC with Harvard writ large. Perhaps administrators and HMC executives, understandably desiring job security, are seeking to blunt any future criticism for low returns by robbing it of specificity. Less transparency might lessen pressure from outside skeptics to reconsider current strategy or even personnel. Even if this policy change is not malicious in intent, we generally believe that actors’ performance improves when they are exposed to external criticism.
Based on these concerns, we propose a compromise: The HMC should provide a detailed breakdown of returns by asset class to major donors in lieu of releasing this data publicly. This solution strikes a balance between transparency and pragmatism. It enables a group with a vested interest in the success of the endowment to act as an external check on the administration and HMC, but it also mitigates the danger that public reporting might pose to our competitive advantage by keeping this detailed information from our competitors.
As the endowment grows, both in size and complexity, the need for transparency and accountability becomes more and more apparent. The decision to obscure data on asset classes is a step in the wrong direction.

Harvard Sex Week hosted a lecture on Friday in Emerson Hall on navigating healthcare as a transgender person.
The event, named “Accessing Healthcare with the Trans+ Community,” featured guest speaker Robbin Russel, who shared resources for gender-affirming healthcare and her personal experiences as a transgender person.
Russel’s talk focused on self-advocacy and medical resources for transgender people while acknowledging the complicated reality of the American healthcare system.
Russel recommended OutCare Health and TransCare Site as online resources to find healthcare that is both gender-affirming and supportive of LGBTQ individuals, adding that social media platforms such as Reddit and Discord could also be helpful.
Russel said Fenway Health — a Boston health center providing both preventative and curative care for LGBTQ patients — has been “invaluable” and “second to none.” For hormone therapies, Russel pointed to Planned Parenthood as a provider of hormone therapies for transgender patients.
In addition to healthcare suggestions, her lecture focused on self-advocacy for transgender people in the face of a “nightmarishly complex” healthcare system that she said poses additional barriers for transgender people.
“Being able to be an advocate for yourself is very important as a trans person navigating healthcare,” Russel said.
While Russel acknowledged self-advocacy can sometimes be uncomfortable, she said she believes it is often worthwhile. She encouraged attendees to "never feel ashamed" for needing to correct someone for misgendering.
“You deserve to be treated at least with the right pronouns and name,” Russel said.
“Taking back power in that situation is really hard, too," she added. "The best way to do it is usually the simplest way."
Russel added that although self-advocacy is essential, comfort is the “most important thing."
“Do whatever is going to make you the most comfortable, and if the people around you are causing issues, remove yourself from the situation,” Russel said.
Though Russel recognized the difficulties that LGBTQ and specifically transgender people face in the American healthcare system, she said she believes there has been progress.
“Right now we have more out trans seniors than ever before, which is great,” she said. “This also means there is more healthcare available than ever before.”
Russel concluded by reminding attendees to advocate for respect from those around them, including in the medical system.
“Remember you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and people deserve to know that their healthcare providers will do the same thing,” Russel said.

Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana discussed the Honor Council’s goals in a Monday interview following the release of new data indicating an uptick in academic integrity cases referred to the body during the 2020-2021 school year.
Twenty-seven students were forced to withdraw from the College due to Honor Code violations over the 2020-2021 year, according to statistics released this month, marking a six-year high. The Honor Council — which is chaired by Khurana and consists of students, faculty, and administrators — heard 138 academic dishonesty cases over that period.
While Khurana declined to comment on specific disciplinary cases, he said the Council’s goals are rooted in helping students grow academically.
“What I want to assure our students is our philosophy is anchored in education and supporting our students through this educational journey and finding ways to help them live their values,” Khurana said.
Khurana said the Honor Council aims to refer disciplinary cases back to faculty for local interventions when possible. Determined at the discretion of the course instructor, these sanctions may include mandatory tutoring, warnings, or grade penalties.
Six students received local sanctions over the 2020-2021 year, marking a six-year low.
“Each year, we have an opportunity to look at the underlying trends to see where there are areas of challenge,” Khurana said. “We work with faculty to see how we can address any of those issues, as well as how we can support students to help them to meet any academic challenges they might be facing.”
As reading period and final exams begin in December, Khurana called on students to care for themselves.
“Obviously, we want you to focus on your learning, but your grades don’t define you,” he said.
Khurana also discussed the 138th iteration of the Harvard-Yale Game, which took place Saturday at Harvard Stadium for the first time since 2016.
“I love just seeing our students, our alumni, our fans come together after a long absence from the stadium to have an opportunity to celebrate and support our community — and support our student-athletes,” Khurana said.
Prior to The Game, some students reported frustration and confusion about the College’s restrictions on tailgating and dorm parties.
Khurana said the College aims to “create an environment of fun and inclusion and safety.”
“We take student input very seriously, and at the same time, we’d want to make sure we have an event that starts with joy and ends with joy,” he said.
Though Yale won The Game 19-14, Khurana said he appreciated the continuation of a long-held tradition.
“Whatever the score is, what everybody knows is that what we’re carrying on is an important tradition,” Khurana said. “A tradition in which members of their community come here and live with us and stay overnight with us, and that that’s reciprocated next year — and that sense of stewarding, that tradition, that treating each other with respect.”
“Win or lose, it’s about having a great event and celebrating the fans,” he added.

Harvard’s Language Exchange Program received a multi-thousand-dollar grant from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to expand the reach of its language-learning platform.
The Language Exchange Program, a platform connecting nearly 700 Harvard affiliates seeking conversation practice in various foreign languages, is based out of the University’s Language Center.
Language Center manager Mary L. DiSalvo recalled struggling to find a native Italian speaker with whom she could practice during her time as a student in Harvard’s Italian Ph.D. program.
After transitioning into her role at the Language Center, DiSalvo said she realized a language exchange program could solve this problem by allowing Harvard affiliates to “sign up on their own time, on their own terms,” search for partners, and meet them at their own convenience.
DiSalvo said the Language Exchange Program encourages “cross-conversation” across a “pretty strong dividing line” between members of Harvard’s various departments and schools.
“This seemed to fulfill not only the role of language practice for people who wanted to get some experience in a second or third or fourth language but also to meet people at Harvard who they normally wouldn’t meet,” DiSalvo said.
In testimonials, the program’s users — who range from beginners to native speakers — raved about the ability to connect with others who speak different languages and come from different backgrounds.
Ariana Aram, a recent graduate of the Harvard Dental School, wrote in a testimonial that she met two close friends through the program.
“It’s the thing that I look forward to each week (since summer 2020!) and it has not only helped me improve Spanish and Italian, but also to gain deeper understandings of other cultures and perspectives through the lens of students at other Harvard schools,” Aram wrote.
Minami Kojima, who attended the Harvard Extension School, stressed the importance of the program for non-native English speakers.
“As a nonnative English speaker living outside the US, this has been a great opportunity to improve my English speaking skill in a more intimate, comfortable, and casual environment, which prepares me to be more confident using English in classrooms,” Kojima wrote in a testimonial.
According to DiSalvo, the platform’s most popular languages include Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish, but the program has encountered trouble recruiting speakers of “less commonly spoken languages,” such as Romanian.
To attract more users, the center has displayed promotional newsletters and posters and is organizing an open house event in the spring.
“I'm hoping that as we go forward, we can hold more events — in-person events — at the Language Center itself,” DiSalvo said. “We don’t get a whole lot of visibility — we’re down in the basement of the Science Center — and I want people to know this resource exists.”

Harvard School of Public Health professor Sara N. Bleich has been tapped to oversee the implementation of Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery initiative as the inaugural vice provost for special projects, the University announced on Nov. 14.
Bleich, who currently serves as the director of nutrition security and health equity for the Food and Nutrition Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has worked on issues such as diet-related diseases, health equity, and racial injustice. She will step into her new post on Jan. 23.
Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an email announcing the appointment that Bleich’s background in social justice and work across disciplines equip her to spearhead the University’s initiative.
“Sara’s work at the intersection of public health and social justice, in addition to her expertise in helping build a collaborative culture of intellectual exchange across academic disciplines and sectors, makes her uniquely suited for this work,” he wrote.
Bleich’s appointment marks the latest step in the University’s ongoing work to fulfill the recommendations of the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, which University President Lawrence S. Bacow formed in 2019. In May, the committee released a long-awaited report detailing how slavery “powerfully shaped Harvard.”
The report found that University affiliates enslaved more than 70 Black and Indigenous people across almost 150 years and had “extensive financial ties” to slavery. Harvard pledged to allocate $100 million to implement the recommendations outlined in the report.
Advised by members of the implementation committee, Bleich will work with Harvard affiliates, descendants of enslaved individuals, and the broader public to engage with the history and legacy of slavery on campus. She will also act as a spokesperson for the University's “reparative efforts.”
Garber said Bleich will play an important role in the University’s efforts to reckon with its history.
“The creation of the role of vice provost for special projects is a critical next step in ensuring the University and Schools make needed progress in addressing Harvard’s ties to slavery and remedying the many aspects of its persistent aftermath,” Garber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two years after the Cambridge City Council ordained the 100 Percent Affordable Housing Overlay, an ambitious zoning reform to incentivize affordable housing, a group of city councilors have introduced an amendment seeking to think bigger — literally.
The AHO, implemented in 2020, allowed developers to quickly bypass a long and uncertain permitting process for residential buildings that contained only affordable units and adhered to a set of design standards. It also loosened some zoning restrictions on height, size, and density for affordable projects.
Now, four city councilors — Marc C. McGovern, Burhan Azeem, E. Denise Simmons, and Quinton Y. Zondervan — have introduced an amendment that would significantly loosen height restrictions further.
The proposed amendment would allow AHO projects of up to 13 stories along several major streets including Cambridge St., Mt. Auburn St., Memorial Drive, Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave., and Broadway, and up to 25 stories in Central, Harvard, and part of Porter Squares. The amendment also relaxes certain other dimensional requirements for AHO projects citywide.
During the Council’s Monday evening meeting, councilors voted 8-1 to refer the proposal to committees on Housing and Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, and Arts & Celebration for further public hearings, kickstarting an ordinance process that is likely to last several months.
McGovern said in an interview that the AHO has been “successful,” but that zoning restrictions have still prevented nonprofit affordable housing developers in Cambridge from pursuing some projects.
“We’ve left some opportunities on the table because of some limitations around some of the height and density,” McGovern said. “We did not want to wait and continue to leave those units on the table.”
Zondervan said in the meeting that the proposal targets areas near transit where increasing density and height “makes the most sense.”
But Councilor Dennis J. Carlone said the proposal was “regressive” and “doesn’t make economic sense,” saying that in his experience, residents of affordable housing “do not want to live” in towering buildings.
“They said they wanted to look like their neighbors,” Carlone said. “They want to fit in, they don’t want to stand out.”
He added that the Council should instead focus on helping the city acquire land for affordable development projects.
In the meeting’s public comment period, the proposal was met with resistance from some residents, who outnumbered supporters roughly three-to-one. Many said they felt blindsided by the introduction of the amendment and called the increased height limits a radical and hasty solution.
Some councilors echoed their concerns.
Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 contrasted the introduction of the amendment to the “year-long discussion of principles” that preceded the drafting of the AHO.
“This is so stunning to people who feel blindsided because there was not that prep work to have ordinance language on the table,” Nolan said.
She added that the proposal came “without context for understanding the rationale,” including an analysis of the most cost-effective methods of affordable development.
In the meeting, McGovern emphasized that the proposal was at the beginning of the ordinance process and that the Council was “not settling anything tonight.”
“I assume that this will be the same as 95 percent of the other ordinances: it will come out looking very different than how it went in,” McGovern said. “That’s the process. That’s what happens.”

Following the scoreboard, perhaps the second most horrifying thing from The Game was the wild turkey mascot we all saw running through the stands. Sure, it was funny in the moment to pose for a selfie with it, but imagine if our new game day mantras become “Go Turkeys!” or “Gobble Gobble”… yikes!
For a school that prides itself on having highly competent students, we sure are lacking talent in the mascot selection department. I remember looking up the Harvard mascot after Admissions Day and feeling sorely disappointed when greeted with the following Google search result:
What does that even mean? Are we the Harvard Pilgrims? The Harvard John Harvards? And we soon might be the Harvard Turkeys but I’m not sure if that’s even better. No wonder everyone just sticks with a classic “Go Crimson!” at games...
To remedy Harvard’s subpar school spirit situation, here are some alternative ideas to consider for a new mascot:
Hedgehogs
Who doesn’t love a good alliteration? Plus, being cute but also a little standoffish and prickly would fit the vibe of a standard Harvard student. Other alliterative options include the Harvard Horses or the Harvard Hamsters. Pick your poison, I suppose.
Remy
He’s already basically the informal mascot of Harvard, so why not just make it official? His orange fur color is almost Crimson anyway (right?); and then we could chant “Go Cats!” in response to Yale’s mediocre “Go Bulldogs!”
Rats
I don’t know about you all, but any time I step into the Kirkland or Eliot dhalls, I always see a little friend crawling around by the back walls. Let’s give these loyal companions a shoutout by featuring them as our mascot. We always thought “Le Festin” would be a great walk-out song, Harvard Athletics! Alternatively, we could also become the Harvard Roaches or Centipedes for similar reasons.
David Malan
This might be a bit of a controversial choice due to CS50 now being offered at both Harvard and Yale, but we know that David Malan reps Cambridge over New Haven any day. Harvard Shop, if you’re listening, the “I took C50” shirts could become the new game day merch.
Snakes
Between some of the club comp processes, blocking group drama, and the recruitment hustle, Harvard students can definitely be snakey at times. But why try to hide it? Let’s own our ruthless, cold, and cunning personalities with pride. In a stunning turn of events, this could be our most honest option yet.
Although Harvard beats Yale on basically every front, even I must admit that they have a leg up on us in the mascot category. With this diverse array of mascot picks, though, those bulldogs won’t stand a chance against us next year! Roll Crim!

Over 600,000 people have fallen in love with Yale senior Emme Zhou '23’s TikTok account, which documents her college experience and highlights her dining hall adventures. Over the Harvard-Yale weekend, Flyby brought her and her friends to the hallowed Adams House dining hall to learn how HUDS compares to Yale dining (Hopefully, it fairs better than our football team). After completing the classic Harvard introduction (Emme is a senior in Pauli Murray College studying Econ and Art!), we got to the juicy questions.
HUDS Pros 
While Emme’s questioning of the mysterious beige sauce in the sandwich bar did not bode well for us, she noted many pros of the Harvard dining experience.
While Yale may have the better football team, they apparently do not have trays. Emme joked that “trays are a game changer.” But, honestly, making multiple treks around the dhall would certainly increase your chances of ~coincidentally~ running into your House crush.
Beyond trays, there were many other HUDS dhall staples that Yale doesn’t have (#losers #stayjealous). Emme noted that the “sandwich bar is something we don’t have,” and there are “so many milks.” Notably, the chocolate milk did bump the Yalies’ overall HUDS rating up from a 6.5/10 to a 7/10.
Max, Emme’s boyfriend, also commented on the cereals. He stated, “I like how proud they were to have the knock off cereals. We have knock off cereals, but they just call it Cinnamon Crunch. But, you guys [are] like ‘this isn’t Fruit Loops this is Veggie Rings.’” They’re right — something about eating cereal called Apple Zings or Marshmallow Mateys makes the culinary experience so much more fun.
The Yalies were startled by a group of students who had lugged in a TV to watch the World Cup. We then explained that the seating area never closes. Turns out, at Yale the “you can’t be in [the seating area] unless it’s dining hours,” a change that would unfortunately force students to watch the World Cup in their room, the more standard location.
Honorable mention to the crunchy peanut butter.
HUDS Cons
However, the Yalies noted some aspects of the HUDS experience that could be improved.
Emme commented that the signs explaining the ingredients in each HUDs dish are small. This was especially relevant given that Emme is vegetarian. While enlarging all the HUDS signs may seem like a daunting task, if we can make the turkey mascot happen, we’re confident we can get this ball rolling.
Emme also stated that at Yale the kitchens are more visible where “most of our students will be like ‘Oh hi, Joe! Hi, Frank!’ and greet our dining hall staff. It’s definitely a different experience here.” More love to HUDS staff seems definitely doable as well <3.
How About Yale? 
Emme and her friends also talked about their experiences with Yale dining (spoiler alert: they’ve been pretty freaking great).
When asked about her favorite Yale meal, Emme described “chocolate chip or multigrain pancakes with cardamom whipped cream and coconut flakes. Scrambled eggs with melted cheese and pesto parm crusted potatoes on the side… And I always get 2% milk.” Next Harvard-Yale, we will be going straight from the tailgate to the Pauli Murray dhall.
Emme also described the variety of offerings at Yale. She explained, “I grew up in a Chinese household and most of the time we just ate Chinese cuisine. Yale dining has introduced me to a lot of cuisines… We have a variety of food that I would never have eaten if I was just at home.”
While maintaining the motivation to create can be difficult, Emme states that she “truly enjoys the [Yale] food,” and describes that “what keeps me going is a genuine interest in what I’m filming.”
Question: Based on vibes and name alone, rank the given past and present Harvard dhall offerings.
Answer: Fogbuster, Red’s Best Catch, Blueberry Pork, Shrimp Pancakes, Beef Fettuccine Alfredo.
Question: You make Yale food look so good. Any tips for romanticizing your life?
Answer: Plating is so important. If you really want to level up your dining experience, please make sure your food does not touch.
