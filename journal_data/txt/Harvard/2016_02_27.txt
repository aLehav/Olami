After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Language is often lost in translation, but such is not the case in Korean author Han Kang’s new novel. In “The Vegetarian,” she brutally yet beautifully explores the gap between one person’s expression and another’s reception; her pen pierces through all the codified elements of society—dietary practices, daily routines, and even accepted notions of death. Though at times too shallow to stay in the reader’s mind, her sparse descriptions generally cut through to essential social questions: How do traditions bind? Whom do they draw close, and whom do they suffocate? And when severed, what, if anything, is left to bind the fragile, desperate soul to its helplessly ephemeral container?
Kang prompts her readers to consider these issues through key structural decisions. While the narrative focalizes on Yeong-hye, an altogether ordinary woman by Korean social standards, each of the novel’s three distinct parts relates a period of Yeong-hye’s life from the vantage point of various people around her. In Part 1, “The Vegetarian,” Mr. Cheong disgustedly describes Yeong-hye’s odd behavior following her bout of blood-filled dreams and subsequent vegetarianism; next, in “Mongolian Mark,” Yeong-hye’s obsessive brother-in-law violates her emotionally and physically, revealing further signs of Yeong-hye’s mental decay; finally, in “Flaming Trees,” Yeong-hye’s sympathetic but helpless sister In-hye mediates the conclusion of Yeong-hye’s bizarre descent into madness. Except for short dialogues and lapses into dreams, Yeong-hye rarely speaks. By folding the main storyline—Yeong-hye’s mental illness—into the ears, eyes, and tongues of others, Kang creates necessary layers of distance between reader and text, an emptiness that mirrors the alienation felt by Yeong-hye herself. “‘No one can understand me … the doctors, the nurses, they’re all the same … they don’t even try to understand … they just force me to take medication, and stab me with needles,’” Yeong-hye says in a moment of lucidity—one of her last. Throughout the story’s unfolding, Kang evokes Yeong-hye’s frustration in the reader by continually denying access to Yeong-hye’s own voice. Kang’s use of this structural device powerfully demonstrates the objectification of Yeong-hye in all aspects—as woman, as lover, as beauty, as pain.
The novel’s absence of descriptive embellishment evokes this same emotional distance. Though the scenes conjured are supernatural and disturbing, Kang’s tone remains even, unadulterated, and matter-of-fact throughout: “I like my breasts, nothing can be killed by them .… With my round breasts, I’m okay. Still okay. So why do they keep shrinking? Not even round anymore .… Why are my edges all sharpening—what am I going to gouge?”, Yeong-hye dreams. In one of these rare instances in which Yeong-hye’s pale voice does float through the surrounding white noise to address the reader directly, her self-description seems flat; she repeats the same word—“round”—without ever delving into deeper depiction of physical appearance, which imparts a hollowness of self that mirrors Yeong-hye’s inner emotional state.
Kang adopts this sketch-like method of description for much of the novel, and for the most part, it works. At times, however, the directness of her writing style detracts from the emotional weight of the message. For instance, In-hye narrates Yeong-hye’s condition in the mental hospital: “Her eyes followed the second hand on the clock as it ticked around, and she made another effort to regulate her breathing .… A feeling of déjà vu crept up on her then, a feeling of having already experienced this same moment countless times.” When applied to inanimate objects rather than people, simplicity of style dissolves into boredom; the bland descriptions fade into monochrome and force the reader to search, foggy-eyed, for moments of beauty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—With freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy sitting with a concussion, the Harvard men’s basketball team (11-16, 3-8 Ivy) struggled to generate offense all night against archrival Yale (19-6, 10-1) in a 59-50 loss.
The Bulldogs, which won for the first time in their last five home games against the Crimson, held Harvard to just 22 points in the first half and 40 percent shooting for the game. The team’s leading scorer for the season, junior forward Zena Edosomwan, did not have a single basket. While seniors Agunwa Okolie and Patrick Steeves picked up some of the slack, scoring 27 points, the rest of the team shot just over 30 percent.
“They’re very physical, athletic and we were somewhat overmatched there and that’s disappointing to have to say that, but that’s the way the game was for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The two seniors led the team from beginning to end. Okolie had Harvard’s first five points of the game, including a rare three to kick off the scoring. Steeves matched him with seven first-half points, helping lift an offense that otherwise shot just 18 percent in the first session.
In the second half, the seniors led Harvard’s biggest push. After Yale extended its lead to 18 early in the second period, Amaker sent Edosomwan to the bench for the final 13 minutes of the game. In the absence of its leading post player, Harvard found new life—scoring nine straight points to cut the lead to single digits.
Steeves had a chance a possession later to cut the lead to seven, but had a costly miss. On Yale’s next trip down the floor, sophomore Makai Mason drilled his third triple of the game with a hand in his face. After a layup from freshman Weisner Perez cut the lead to 10, Yale held Harvard scoreless for the next four minutes and pushed the lead to 17. While Harvard ended the game on a 10-0 run (nabbing a backdoor cover in the process), it came with both teams playing backups.
“We played harder in the second half,” Okolie said. “We didn’t play a good first half at all, but guys were ready. We were down, we were in the same situation last Saturday at Cornell, so we just had to keep chipping away. Unfortunately, we couldn’t finish.”
The biggest story early for the Bulldogs was their hustle on the offensive glass. With seniors Brandon Sherrod and Justin Sears relentlessly attacking the basket, Yale drew two early fouls on Edosomwan and then played volleyball on the backboard. The Bulldogs, which came in outrebounding opponents by an average of 10 boards a game, limited the Crimson to just two offensive rebounds and two second-chance points.
The larger effect was on the other end, however, where the Bulldogs overcame early shooting struggles by extending possession after possession. When Harvard mixed in some early zone looks, Yale’s senior duo swooped in to corral loose balls. When the Crimson collapsed, Sears and Sherrod (eight total assists) kicked the ball out to Yale’s shooters. A third of the Bulldogs’ first-half points came off offensive rebounds.
“It’s always very tough [to guard Yale],” Okolie said. “You have to cover the floor, but they have a lot of shooters as well. It would have been a lot easier for us if we held them to one shot but unfortunately, we couldn’t do that.”
The problems on the glass begat a larger offensive malaise in the paint for the Crimson. For the game, Harvard had just 18 points in the paint—just six more than it had on long two-point jump shots. Edosomwan, backup Chris Egi, and captain Evan Cummins had just one interior basket between them as Yale collapsed quickly on any Harvard post attempt, taking advantage of Harvard’s inability to find open shooters.
Harvard’s inability to drive the ball was a key factor in the team shooting just five free throws on the game. After the game, Amaker bemoaned his team’s inability to prop up an otherwise struggling offense at the charity stripe.
“We need to get to the foul line,” Amaker said. “We were one foul away from being in the bonus early in the second half and we were never able to push that to where we were utilizing the foul line to make our run which we were trying to do, and it just didn’t happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
POTSDAM, N.Y. — On a sheet of paper, the Harvard men’s hockey team appeared to get exactly what it wanted Friday night. The No. 12/12 Crimson earned a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs, locked up home ice for the tournament quarterfinals, and even moved up a spot in the playoff-predictive PairWise rankings.
But on a sheet of ice, specifically that of Cheel Arena in the heart of North Country, Harvard had far less to be happy about. Capitalizing on a pair of costly Crimson turnovers, Clarkson (17-13-3, 9-9-3 ECAC) built up a two-goal lead in the second period en route to a 2-1 victory over the visitors from Cambridge.
Harvard’s first score came with just 48 seconds remaining in regulation with sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen on the bench in favor of an extra attacker. Junior center Alexander Kerfoot split the seam with a pass between two separate pairs of Golden Knights, allowing co-captain Kyle Criscuolo to lift a shot over the outstretched right pad of senior goaltender Greg Lewis on the back door.
Down a goal, the Crimson (15-9-4, 11-6-4) won the ensuing faceoff and successfully broke into the attacking zone, allowing Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 to put a sixth skater on the ice yet again, but the Crimson’s final shot—a blast from senior Colin Blackwell—sailed well wide, enabling Clarkson to hang on to its second victory over Harvard this season.
Despite waiting until the final minute to score, the Crimson had more than its fair share of scoring opportunities, firing 22 shots over the final two periods and generating three power plays—including a minute-long 5-on-3 at the end of the middle frame. But the puck simply was not finding the net.
A lead pass in transition from co-captain Kyle Criscuolo to junior defenseman Clay Anderson darting through the slot marked one of Harvard’s best chances of the night near the end of the second period. However, senior forward Pat Megannety brought down the unlikely attacker atop the goalmouth, forcing his shot to go off target. 
The trip of Anderson turned a Crimson power play into a two-man advantage, on which Harvard forced plenty of bouncing pucks in front of Lewis. But the netminder would not be beaten. The Crimson’s power-play unit, which had scored in three consecutive games, was held 0-for-3 on the night.
“It felt like we had eight to 10 chances...to finish some pucks off,” Donato said. “I think we easily could have had four or five goals tonight. It’s frustrating because we really have to bear down and finish some of those chances.”
After a slow start for both teams, the Golden Knights presented two of the game’s biggest threats in the final moments of the first period. Moments after sophomore scoring threat Sam Vigneault nearly stuffed home a feed from senior Jeff DiNallo on the doorstep, the third member of their line—junior Troy Josephs—missed the netting by a matter of inches, ringing iron off a slap-pass from senior defenseman Kevin Tansey.
But after coming up just short in the final minute of the opening frame, Clarkson’s second line pounced in the first minute of the second.
Stepping in front of Kerfoot as he tried to break out of his own zone, Josephs forced the puck off the center’s stick at the Harvard blue line. DiNallo stepped in to collect the puck, moved to the top of the right faceoff circle, and ripped a wrister past Madsen to put the Golden Knights in front. 
Then with five minutes remaining in the same frame, Clarkson upped its advantage to two. After an attempted pass from senior defenseman Brayden Jaw found the stick of freshman blue-liner Aaron Thow, the rookie led sophomore center Ben Dalpe forward in transition.
Dalpe entered the Crimson zone with the puck, but immediately dished it off to junior forward Perry D’Arrisso, who lofted a wrister on net from about the same spot as DiNallo 15 minutes prior. Madsen made the initial stop, but crashing the net and forcing the loose puck through was Dalpe, finishing off a shot that Donato said “really shouldn’t result in a goal, quite frankly.”
The 2-0 scoreline would hold well into the third period, even through a Harvard power play 2:22 into the frame which saw the Crimson’s leading scorer, co-captain Jimmy Vesey, get a look at a half-vacant net from the slot. Nonetheless, Lewis would be bailed out, as a Golden Knight stick entered Vesey’s shooting lane just in time to thwart the chance. 
Harvard watched its comeback prospects grow even more grim with 7:05 remaining in regulation when Anderson knocked senior Christian Powers into the boards on a hit that drew a five-minute major for boarding and a game misconduct from the officials.
Madsen made four saves on the ensuing power play, and the Crimson completed its fifth successful kill of the night, but by the time sophomore Eddie Ellis—serving Anderson’s five-minute penalty—left the box, Harvard had just 2:05 to work with.
Criscuolo’s 18th goal of the season would pull the Crimson a little closer, but Clarkson held on for the final 48 seconds to improve its home record to 12-2-2 and wrap up home ice in the first round of the ECAC playoffs.
Meanwhile, Harvard managed to clinch a first-round bye by way of Rensselaer’s 2-0 loss to Colgate on Friday. But the Crimson was in no mood for celebrating.
“We want to win hockey games at the end of the day—that’s our goal,” Kerfoot said. “We’re not looking to sneak in through the back door.”
“We’ve got to take care of our own game,” Donato said. “It’s about us playing as well as we can play, not about worrying about this, that, or the other thing that might happen. We have to be in control of our game and really play with an intensity that’s necessary this time of year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—A hot start by Yale and a 14-point halftime deficit were too much for the Harvard men’s basketball team to overcome as the Crimson fell to the Bulldogs, 59-50 in New Haven. With freshman starting point guard Tommy McCarthy home in Cambridge with a concussion and junior forward Zena Edosomwan on the bench for most of the evening, Harvard (11-16, 3-8 Ivy League) did not have the firepower to keep pace with the Bulldogs (19-6, 10-1). The loss locked up Harvard’s first losing season since 2007-2008 while Yale kept pace with Princeton atop the Ivy League standings.
NO POST PRESENCE
Edosomwan picked up two personal fouls before the game’s first media timeout, a trademark of his sophomore campaign, and was consigned to the bench by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker,
While the Los Angeles native returned to the floor later in the half, it was a mere two minutes before Amaker decided that the more conservative defense Edosomwan would have to play to avoid picking up his third foul outweighed the offensive presence he added and the double teams he attracted.
“It’s tough on defense, especially when you play great defense for 30 seconds,” Okolie said. “A shot goes up and you can’t get the rebound and that’s tough.”
The Bulldogs took advantage of the hole left on both ends of the floor by Edosomwan’s absence. Yale outrebounded the Crimson, 37-29, and the guests only corralled two rebounds on the offensive end. The Bulldogs chewed up Harvard inside, collecting 34 points in the paint.
In the second half, with Edosomwan sitting, sophomore Chris Egi and freshman Weisner Perez played the lion’s share of the frontcourt minutes. The underclassman duo combined for two points, eight rebounds, and seven fouls in 34 minutes.  Only 18 of the Crimson’s points came in the paint and the team only got to the free-throw line five times.
“We need to get to the foul line,” Amaker said. “We were one foul away from being in the bonus. Early in the second half and we were never able to push that to where we were utilizing the foul line to make our run.”
FEARSOME FOURSOME
While Amaker emphasizes the importance of an inside-out game on the offensive end for his team, it was James Jones’ team that was able to spread the floor and score in a variety of ways. The Bulldogs shot 45.3 percent from the field, and made six three-pointers to go along with 34 points in the paint.
Sophomore guard Makai Mason got the ball rolling for Yale in the first half, finishing with 11 points, including three treys, before intermission.  Some of Mason’s open looks were created by Harvard’s smaller lineup, which often switched into zone defense in order to slow down the Bulldogs’ physical big men.  Backcourt mate senior Nick Victor also chipped in seven points before the break.
“It’s always very tough,” Okolie said. “You have to cover the floor, but they have a lot of shooters as well. It would have been a lot easier for us if we held them to one shot but unfortunately, we couldn’t do that.”
After the intermission, Yale’s forwards and the team’s balance began to take their toll on the Crimson.  Senior forwards Justin Sears and Brandon Sherrod chipped in 12 second half points to go along with six rebounds, setting the tone for a workman-like half from the Bulldogs. Yale kept Harvard at arm’s length and grew its lead to 17 before both coaches explored the depths of their benches.
A 10-0 run to close out the game allowed the Crimson to leave New Haven with a single-digit defeat, but Mason, Victor, Sherrod, and Sears had already done their damage. The quartet had 48 of the team’s 59 points and 28 of its 37 rebounds.
“They’re a veteran team,” Amaker said. “Physically they’re strong. I think they’ve done a great job with being relentless on the glass, very hard to get second chance points against them.”
