After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear first-years,
As you begin your first few weeks at Harvard, you will undoubtedly hear hollow speeches from our administration. They will tell you that the next four years of your lives will be a transformative experience and that you’ll all go on to be world-changers. These speeches usually end with a call to live up to our motto, Veritas, to search for “the truth.” That is, of course, as long as this truth doesn’t upset the status quo.
Because when truth demands change, it is swept under the carpet — and Harvard is no exception.
What the administration is not going to tell you is that Harvard is designed to maintain the status quo when it comes to social change and justice. They prefer incremental but inconsequential reforms that let you give yourself a pat on the back. You will distract yourself with snobbish discussions in dining halls about political and social theory so you never end up confronting the real question: Am I actually bringing this world closer to freedom and justice? Is our institution, an infamous pipeline to finance and consulting, genuinely helping?
Some people at Harvard will argue that they don’t know much about politics. Others will tell you that they don’t get involved because they don’t want to upset anyone. Then there's the cherry on top of social ignorance: “It’s too controversial.” As Harvard students, we are already immensely privileged, but these hesitant excuses to remove ourselves highlight a deafening indifference to the reality we live in. Marginalized and targeted communities around the world do not have the choice to be ignorant of politics: They are born into politics and must endure it on a near daily basis.
The cold reality is that in order to change oppressive and systemically violent systems, you have to upset powerful institutions. Why? Because these institutions, Harvard included, have benefitted and still benefit economically and politically from the subjugation of others. If you really start to push, Harvard knows there are real stakes on the line: its money and power.
Apologies for bursting the everyone-hold-hands-in-harmony bubble, but the poisonous narrative of “respect everyone’s opinions” breeds political passivity. I can already hear  apologists beg marginalized groups to stop being angry and relax — to call for everyone to be friends and love one another.
But the reality is that administrations who claim to fearlessly pursue truth only promote stale dialogues. Student activists argue that the prison-industrial complex maintains a systemically violent, racist state and demands divestment. The administration gets up and says that Harvard should not use its endowment to “achieve political ends, or particular ends.” (I, for one, think it should be blatantly obvious that making money from private prisons is already political.)
Then, the moderator thanks everyone for sharing. Everyone goes home. Nothing changes.
Student activists demand divestment from the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine and the imposition of an apartheid regime there. The complicit administration repeats their spineless position that endorsing “individual or particular positions on these issues do not encourage debate; they actually quash it,” despite bragging about alumni who put their lives on the line for the sole purpose of social change.
The moderator thanks everyone for sharing. Everyone goes home. The apartheid regime stands untouched.
Unlike our discussions in seminar classes, groups living under the boot of oppressive regimes do not have the luxury of listening to the other side, forgetting about it, then going back to their daily lives. Opinions have consequences in the real world, so let’s stop fooling ourselves by insisting that “respecting everyone’s opinions” is a virtuous position to take —  it rings hollow.
No Harvard administration has ever been the driving force for real change and social justice. The real force comes from grassroots organizations. They are the ones who push the administration and cause discomfort until it finally heeds the call for justice. By all means, Harvard’s sweet-talk tries hard to convince us otherwise. The facade is crystal clean and well-manicured — no doubt the result of a very clever marketing team — but the inside is more sinister. We hear our deans talk of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and we think to ourselves, “Wow these people really must be the pioneers of progressivism!” But I don’t buy it and you shouldn’t either. How can an administration talk about inclusion and justice when they refuse to publicly commit to divest from private prisons and have investments in companies complicit in Israel’s apartheid regime?
So what should you do? Find the divest groups on campus (Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Stop Harvard Land Grabs) and start organizing. Push the people around you by talking about real issues. Elevate the voices on campus who are calling for justice. Put your feet on the ground when they organize a protest. Disrupt. Keep making noise until it grabs people’s attention. Make people uncomfortable until they can no longer turn a blind eye. Frankly, that’s the only way that change has or will ever come about.
I’m not going to pretend that Harvard’s multiple divest campaigns would solve the world’s problems if they succeeded, but as the Crimson Editorial Board has said before regarding prison divestment, “The question is not where to stop, but rather where to begin”. Do you really want to look back when you’re older and think to yourself that you stayed silent while others spoke up?
Teach yourself how to speak up, because Harvard won’t. If you really want to make a change, start organizing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am the daughter of a nurse.
Growing up, I spent dinners listening to the visceral rundown on my mother’s patients — procedures they’d undergone, updates on their diagnoses, treatment plans, and anticipated recoveries. To this, my brother and my dad often reacted with hands-over-ears squeamishness, plates pushed away in disgust. On those evenings in our one-bedroom apartment, teeming with questions and grinning widely, I leaned in to hear more.
Against all the caution of my mother’s stories, I wanted to go into medicine.
While learning about anatomy and medical terminology are certainly perks of having a nurse as a mother, the most valuable lessons my mother gave me at dinner were not strictly medical in nature. They were about values: humanity, compassion, and empathy. She spoke not just of her patients’ physical suffering but of their home countries, cultures, jobs, and dreams. My mother carried with her the twinkle that sparkled in her patients’ eyes as they looked adoringly at their partners and children spending hours with them despite the plasticky discomfort of the hospital waiting-room chairs. In the ridges of my mother’s tired hands, I could feel her extraordinary efforts to prioritize her patients’ dignity and comfort and, before they were discharged, to teach them how to care for themselves.
Through her work on the floor and at the table, she showed the real purpose of medicine — to return humility and agency lost. That’s what I thought it meant to be pre-med.
At Harvard it isn’t. Or at least, for far too many, being on the pre-medical track isn’t about upholding the values my mother instilled in me. Many of my pre-med peers chose this path for its hefty salary or prestige and not (as one would hope) out of selflessness. And their actions reflect this: rushing to slap their name on as many PubMed articles as possible, concerning themselves primarily with the health of their precious GPAs, and most likely numbering among those who partied maskless during a pandemic.
While at Harvard, the overturning of Roe v. Wade sent a second tectonic shock through my pre-med world. The moment my roommate burst through my bedroom door to inform me of the leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson during last semester’s finals season will forever be stained on my frontal lobe. Hunched over my laptop, I paused from editing my final project, speechless as my heart sank and my tired eyes drooped with a different, more profound exhaustion.
As an American uterus-owner, the repercussions of a decision made by five Supreme Court Justices do not leave my mind. What haunts me most is a newfound sense of my precarity — the realization that just a few differences separate my circumstances from the dire realities of victims of rape and incest, pregnant people with health complications, and those simply uninterested, unfit, or unprepared for parenthood. As a member of this last group, I can now sense that my station in society is the only thing preventing my government from regarding me as reproductive livestock.
As a future doctor, I am preoccupied not just with thoughts of being in their shoes but of one day encountering them as patients in whichever specialty I choose. In this post-Roe world, a long list of additional questions about my future in medicine eats away precious minutes of my sleep each night. Should I prepare to be targeted like Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who saved the life of a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio and now faces threats of investigation despite doing her job? Could I have my medical license revoked, after working tirelessly for years on end and taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, for providing life-saving reproductive care? And the question that troubles me most of all: How will my peers and I respond when expected to deny patients the right to their own bodies?
My worry is that we will lend our hands to the destruction of lives impacted by sexual assault, ectopic pregnancy, and unprotected sex by failing to treat abortion as essential healthcare. My hope is that we, America’s pre-meds, won’t shy away from specialties like OB-GYN for fear of future legal battles. Where it already runs too thin, I say to all the pre-meds post-Roe: the medical field needs a higher dose of our compassion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few months ago, I was talking to a British contractor and a Singaporean army recruit at a bar in Cairo about something that had been weighing on my conscience — the infamously contested “selling out.”
I explained my predicament concisely: I want to pursue a lucrative job immediately after graduating, primarily to assist my family and to pay back my mother for the sacrifices she has made since immigrating. However, I could never imagine telling my friends, or a crush for that matter, about a consulting internship with a straight face. The palpable stigma at Harvard surrounding “going into finance” or taking consulting jobs is daunting. My two new friends looked confused. After some pause, one asked, “isn’t the point of going to college to earn more afterward?” Although I don’t endorse this sentiment, it made me realize something all too easy to forget: Selling out is mainly a concern within our Ivy League bubble.
Of course, there are strong reasons this stigma exists at Harvard. Students consistently describe consulting, finance, and tech positions as soul-crushing jobs with long hours and little emotional reward. Further, a lot of the students who end up taking jobs in these industries already come from wealthy and privileged backgrounds. This narrative, however, is too simple.
Financial comfort is a legitimate factor for students of all socioeconomic backgrounds to consider when choosing careers. Financial excess, though, is harder to justify. The line between comfort and extravagance is blurry and subjective, marking another reason our current discourse on selling out is lacking subtlety. Also, there are plenty of meaningful and high-paying jobs that serve to question the negative correlation between salary and social value — physicians and climate consultants, for example. Our current discourse is a broad castigation of anyone who takes a high-paying job in dominant industries. The most corrosive effect of this lazy narrative is the stigma it creates for low-income students, who should never be shunned for seeking lucrative jobs after graduation. These jobs are oftentimes the only, and fastest, avenue to ensure financial comfort for these students and their families.
In a past opinion piece, Patrick M. Magee ’21 defended the choice to sell out. He argued that not everyone can pursue socially meaningful work, but we can all be more generous within our communities. Similarly, I want to defend the notion of selling out, but only for those with low-income backgrounds. It’s absurd that a first-gen student would have to hide the fact that they are thinking of working in finance or are on the board of a consulting club. I don’t believe a student who comes from an underprivileged background should ever have to justify their choice to pursue financial comfort after college — especially to other students who have a strong sense of financial security. Social mobility for low-income individuals and their families should be a shared and categorical goal for Harvard. Yet, spreading the simple narrative that selling out is broadly immoral actively detracts from this important project.
The irony of this situation is in plain sight. Progressive students that are justifiably concerned with income and racial inequality are leading the discussion against selling out, guiding individuals to non-profit or social justice work instead. This discussion, in turn, puts pressure on low-income students to avoid jobs that would create social mobility, ostensibly a progressive goal. Broad claims about selling out implicitly place the onus of inequality on students who have the rare opportunity to reduce it.
To be clear, I don’t want to encourage all low-income students to only seek the highest-paying jobs. I also don’t want the stigma around picking lucrative careers over meaningful ones to fully disappear. I just want students to be more intentional when they talk about the idea of selling out. There may be some justification for criticizing a privileged Harvard student that chooses to work at Goldman Sachs; students with a financial safety net should be encouraged to pursue work in fields that lead to positive change. What is most important, though, is that the first-gen student who is also being recruited by Goldman doesn’t have to deal with the same rhetoric and stigma.
For many low-income students and their families, Harvard is a vessel for financial success, not a flowery exploration of the liberal arts. Let’s encourage everyone to work in socially beneficial roles, while also acknowledging that financial comfort is a reasonable goal for all students. Paramount, though, is ensuring that the stigma against taking high-paying jobs is not felt by low-income and first-gen students — the very last people who should carry this weight on a progressive campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2022, at 4:02 a.m.
Geoffrey G. Diehl won the GOP nomination for Massachusetts governor over a more moderate opponent on Tuesday, setting the stage for the Trump-backed candidate to face Maura T. Healey ’92, a Democrat who gained national prominence for challenging the former president, in the general election.
Healey, the state’s attorney general, coasted to the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary. Her two former primary opponents, state Senator Sonia R. Chang-Díaz and Harvard professor Danielle S. Allen, both suspended their campaigns months ago.
Diehl, who campaigned with former President Donald J. Trump, defeated businessman Chris Doughty in the GOP primary.
Healey immediately went on the offensive against Diehl, saying in a statement Tuesday night that the Republican wants to “bring Trumpism to Massachusetts.”
“I don’t know about you, but I am tired of the anger, the vitriol, the division,” she said to supporters at a victory party in Boston. “That’s not who we are.”
In his victory speech, Diehl attacked Healey as a Democrat “who will put big government before individual freedom.”
“Under her leadership, Massachusetts will be more expensive, more excessive, and more restrictive,” he told supporters at a party in Weymouth.
Andrea J. Campbell became the first Black woman to clinch a Democratic nomination for statewide office in Massachusetts on Tuesday, beating labor attorney Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90 in the party’s primary for attorney general.
The attorney general race was one of the most closely-watched primary contests in the state going into Tuesday, with polling showing it to be a dead heat. But Campbell, who lost a bid for mayor of Boston last year, opened up a wide lead as results trickled in after polls closed on Tuesday.
Liss-Riordan, who has never held public office, spent more than $9 million of her own money on the race.
The primary divided Massachusetts’ Democratic establishment, with the state’s two U.S. senators on opposite sides.
Campbell will face Republican James McMahon in the general election. He was unopposed in the GOP primary.
She would be the first Black woman elected statewide in Massachusetts.
Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll defeated state Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07 and state Representative Tami L. Gouveia in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor.
Lesser, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School who was seen as an up-and-coming figure in the state party, conceded to Driscoll via Twitter at 10:22 p.m. Tuesday evening, offering his “full support” for the general election.
Despite an early fundraising advantage, Lesser trailed Driscoll in polls leading up to the primary.
Driscoll said she was “humbled” to join Healey on the Democratic ticket, writing in a tweet Tuesday evening that Massachusetts will “elect our 1st all-woman executive team” in November.
Gouveia conceded the race in remarks to supporters in Maynard.
Driscoll will face either Republican Kate D. Campanale or Leah C. Allen, whose primary was too close to call as of early Wednesday morning.
Longtime incumbent William F. Galvin won the Democratic primary for secretary of state, handily beating a progressive challenger for the second cycle in a row.
Galvin, who has served as secretary of state since 1995, beat Tanisha Sullivan, president of the NAACP of Boston, who ran as a progressive.
Galvin will face conservative radio host Rayla Campbell, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary.
In the Democratic primary for state auditor, state Senator Diana DiZoglio beat Chris Dempsey, a Harvard Business School alum who formerly served as assistant secretary of Transportation. She will face Anthony Amore, who was unopposed in the GOP primary.
All eight Democrats who make up Cambridge’s state legislative delegation — Representatives David M. Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Michael L. Connolly, Steven C. Owens, and Jay D. Livingstone and Senators Lydia M. Edwards, Patricia D. Jehlen, and Sal N. DiDomenico — were unopposed in Tuesday’s primary.
The two congresswomen who represent parts of the city, Ayanna S. Pressley and Katherine M. Clark, were also unopposed in their respective primaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning from two years of administrative leave for allegations of sexual and professional misconduct, Harvard professor John L. Comaroff stood up to start teaching his first class back on campus Tuesday afternoon.
Then, five graduate students stood up and walked out of the classroom in protest.
Meanwhile, dozens of students congregated in the Science Center Plaza to decry Comaroff’s continued employment at Harvard on the first day of his course, African and African American Studies 190X: “The Anthropology of Law: classical, contemporary, comparative, and critical perspectives.” This week, Comaroff resumed teaching for the first time since University investigations found he violated sexual harassment and professional misconduct policies.
“Professors who harass shouldn’t be in class!” shouted students in unison at the rally organized by members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
In a speech during the rally, organizer Courtney M. Whilden, a co-chair of the union’s feminist working group, said University administrators should hold faculty accountable for misconduct.
“It’s Harvard’s job to protect us from faculty when they do wrong,” she shouted to the crowd. “We should not have to rely on the whisper network to take care of ourselves as students on this campus.”
Tuesday’s protest comes roughly eight months after Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on unpaid leave and barred him from teaching required courses this academic year after a pair of University investigations found him to be in violation of its policies. Gay previously placed Comaroff on paid administrative leave in August 2020 after allegations that he sexual harassed students first emerged earlier that year.
After students learned Comaroff would resume teaching in the fall, HGSU-UAW circulated a petition demanding Harvard clarify its process for deciding what sanctions to impose on professors who violate sexual harassment policies, “up to and including the revocation of tenure.”
“Tenure exists to protect the academic freedom of scholars to cultivate a rich and vibrant academic community, not to protect the freedom of tenured individuals to erode the very conditions of mutual respect and safety required for such a community to exist,” the petition states.
The petition also called on Harvard to take “active and public steps towards” restoring trust in the University.
The petition, which has more than 250 signatures, stipulated that the union and its supporters would “commit to collective action” should the University fail to respond to their demands before the start of the fall semester.
HGSU-UAW member and Philosophy Ph.D. candidate Denish K. Jaswal argued for the union’s longstanding demand for “real recourse” — defined by the union as third-party arbitration of sex-based discrimination and sexual harassment grievances. Jaswal added that Harvard’s Title IX process is inadequate to stop serial abuse.
Following speeches from students in the plaza, dozens of attendees marched to the Northwest Building and stopped to chant outside of the room where Comaroff was teaching.
Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, one of Comaroff’s lawyers, wrote in a statement that though Comaroff recognizes the students’ rights to peacefully protest, “the protesters’ goals are incompatible with the values of fairness and due process,” claiming that the union’s demands are based on “untested accusations.”
Clare T. Canavan, another co-chair of the union’s feminist working group, said she felt the rally showed survivors that there are people willing to fight for their safety on campus.
“We’ve all been fighting this fight for a long time against Comaroff and just for better protections, and justice for survivors in general at Harvard,” she said. “And this is just one stepping stone in that fight.”
Max G. Ehrenfreund, an HGSU-UAW member and a Ph.D. candidate in History of Science, said Comaroff’s continued employment at Harvard demonstrates a need for structural change at the University.
“The Comaroff case is illustrative because he was found by the University’s investigation to have violated these policies, but nonetheless, there is no real accountability,” he said. “What we see is that even when there is overwhelming evidence, still the University does not act — and that shows the need for thoughtful reform.”
University spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
As of Sept. 6, FAS class enrollment data shows two students — one undergraduate and one graduate — are currently enrolled in Comaroff’s class.

Jeremy C. Hendley, a first-year student at Harvard Law School, has died by suicide, according to an announcement by the school on Sunday. He was 35.
His death marks at least the third student suicide in five years at Harvard Law School.
“No words can convey the depth of this loss to his family and friends,” Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an announcement sent to HLS affiliates Sunday morning. “It feels especially important, in this sad time, for all of us to care for and support one another.”
Manning wrote that Hendley’s wife, Alma Aracely, asked the school to disclose that his death was a suicide.
The Law School is working to provide “opportunities to gather in remembrance and mutual support in the days ahead,” Manning wrote.
Hendley graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2015 and was an employee of the Chickasaw Nation for more than 16 years, according to his LinkedIn profile.
“We will soon come together as a community to remember Jeremy and celebrate his life,” Manning wrote.

Harvard students who lived on campus over the summer reported poor communication and a lack of support regarding housing logistics from administrators.
Select students were eligible to live on campus during the summer from May 15 to Aug. 14. The College also provided “bridge” housing to certain students — including those with “extenuating personal circumstances” — for the week leading up to the fall semester.
Some students living in summer and bridge housing described their residential experience as stressful, citing anxieties over food availability and repeated relocations across campus.
Julia Welsh ’23, a summer and bridge housing resident, urged top Harvard administrators to better support low-income students during their transition to bridge housing in a letter sent to school officials including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay.
In the letter, Welsh wrote that the relocation from summer to bridge housing imposed a financial burden on her low-income peers, leaving some of them without the means to eat. Many students were unaware they would not be allowed to eat in the dining halls during their bridge lodging, she said.
Though Welsh herself had dining hall access throughout the summer due to her participation in a summer program, she sent the email on behalf of her peers.
Students in bridge housing were provided access to communal kitchens in Eliot House and Leverett House. After initially restricting access to undergraduate dining halls, the Harvard College Housing Office notified bridge residents on Aug. 16 that they would receive a $75 stipend and have access to dining halls beginning Aug. 18.
Students had access to kitchens — either in-suite or communal — throughout the duration of the summer, per a Harvard spokesperson.
Jenny H. Lé ’24, a first-generation, low-income student, said she was unexpectedly relocated to different housing in July, forcing her to take off work to move her belongings.
“We were all in shock because we were all working 40-plus hours a week — like more than full-time jobs,” she said. “So we just didn't know when we would find the time to move.”
Amiel Bakshi ’23 described a lack of communication from administrators regarding move out from summer and bridge housing.
“In terms of support and resources during the move-out and move-in process, there was no resource,” he said. “I was on the verge of tears trying to find out how to literally move all my stuff from one place to the next, to the next.”
Bakshi said one of his professors helped him move his boxes in between his summer, bridge, and term housing.
Lé said she also recruited a professor to help move her belongings into summer housing.
Kwaku O. Adubofour ’24, a member of the football team, said Harvard could have implemented “more efficient” ways to manage bridge housing for athletes.
“I just wish the school would figure out some way to help their athletes move into their housing in a more smooth manner that factored in the rigor of playing sports in pre-season and the rigor of moving in,” he said.
Student-athletes participating in fall pre-season were not required to apply for bridge housing, as the College automatically marked them eligible. Other students had to individually apply and were approved on a case-by-case basis.
Harvard College spokesperson Aaron Goldman declined to comment on students' criticisms about summer and bridge housing.
James C. Glaser ’25, who lived in Winthrop House during the summer, said Harvard’s housing is “such a hot commodity,” making organization difficult.
“It ends up feeling a little bit [like] patchwork, which can be frustrating,” he said.
Despite challenges, Lé said she was “extremely grateful” to have summer housing.
“I know that there are a bunch of people that had jobs over here in the summer but weren't given summer housing,” she said. “For that, I'm extremely grateful because I don't know where else I would live if I didn't have housing on campus."

If you’re a Harvard student, you know that El Jefe’s Taqueria is essential to campus life. Where else can you take refuge from a terrible Mather JCR party and reunite with classmates you haven’t seen in years, all while eating an incredible, slightly greasy burrito?
If you haven’t been living under a rock, you know that the place where these precious mems took place is no longer Jefe’s — earlier this summer, our beloved taqueria moved from its long-time residence on Mt. Auburn and into that funky-looking building on Brattle.
So, the Jefe’s location change brought up many necessary questions: Does the new Jefe’s have the same nostalgic, rugged feel? Is it still easy to find someone (anyone!) you vaguely know and join them in the line? Will another Harvard Shop take its place?
Luckily Flyby investigated the new Jefe’s (meaning I went there three times over the past three days and am now giving my unsolicited thoughts).
Cons of the new Jefe’s
No, you cannot cut the line as easily as you could before. The restaurant has a new, streamlined layout, which did unstreamline my personal burrito ordering process.
Personally, I was not a fan of the multiple TVs added. Reading about Russia’s energy attack on Europe was a bit of a vibe kill after my night out.
New Jefe’s was stingier on the guac. I have no idea if this has to do with their fancy new building, but it was upsetting.
The new location does not have the same cozy, homey, everyone is on top of everyone vibes. Since New Jefe’s hasn’t been lived in the same way, it did feel a bit sterile. Why was I not getting pushed in line?
Pros of the new Jefe’s
As one of my friends remarked, “the quality of seating is far better.” New Jefe’s does have more seating: there are high-top tables by the line and long benches on the upper deck. Turns out my friend meant that the benches seemed physically sturdier, and, I suppose, that too, is a pro.
You are still able to order quesadillas at night.
I appreciated many of the decor choices. Aesthetically the new Jefe’s is quite similar (the walls are still bright teal). But there were some new, thoughtful additions, including a hot sauce display wall.
The space is bigger and located closer to the yard. That might mean more freshmen, but you can’t win everything.
The highlight of my new Jefe’s experience, though, was that over the three nights, I still ran into literally everyone I have ever met at Harvard. No matter the location, Jefe’s will always be the ultimate post-game spot and its charm truly comes from the people inside (aww). Am I still sad to lose the old Jefe’s? Absolutely. But, I can’t wait to consecrate the New Jefe’s with section-crush sightings outside class, unsolicited, whole-restaurant sing-alongs, and disagreements with that one non-Harvard-affiliated individual who doesn’t understand Jefe’s has no line.
