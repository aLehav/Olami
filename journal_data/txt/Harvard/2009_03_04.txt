After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With merciless ferocity, the credit crunch has taken its varying toll on each of the European Union’s 27 diverse nations, dashing many semblances of unity among member governments. The need to “stick it out in tough times” is easier said than done. The largest and most threatening fracture divides new EU countries from old and has caused Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary to warn against “a new Iron Curtain” that could once again divide the continent. A solution must be formulated to prevent that development.
Several Eastern European countries, including Hungary, Romania, and the Baltic states, are in a state of near meltdown, yet Western nations are prioritizing their own domestic difficulties. In the name of self-preservation, European solidarity, and long-term political strength, western EU countries have no option but to aid their neighbors. As severe recessions plague even the strongest economies in Europe, however, the cost of solidarity will undeniably be expensive.
Economic cooperation is the crown jewel of the EU and demands preservation if the EU is to endure. The Euro currency is used by 16 EU nations, which together constitute an economy the same size as the United States’s, and the fair-weather economic interdependence has been a lucrative source of prestige. The EU simply cannot afford to so accurately fulfill Euroskeptic predictions and allow its unity shatter in more turbulent economic conditions. 
Indeed, the strife caused by the credit crunch only heightens the importance of economic unity. A shared currency, cross-national lending, and numerous Western investments in the East intrinsically link the welfares of European countries. Should one country go under, the detrimental effects felt across the whole of Europe would be monumental. To an even greater extent, the well-being of the European Union as a whole depends on the respectable performance of each constituent member. Failure to remain united may breed disillusionment with Western capitalism and leave Eastern Europe dangerously susceptible to Russian influences. Thus, for the sake of national interest and the endurance of the European Union, Western countries must find the means to create a bailout plan for failing countries in Eastern Europe.
Of course, given today’s universal economic problems, Western European countries will face both economic and political difficulties in sending money abroad. Even Europe’s strongest economy, Germany, is predicted to shrink by two to three percent this year, the worst performance since World War II. The recession has hit every country in Europe and has given rise to an upsurge in nationalist sentiments. Both the UK and Germany are due national elections in the next year or so, and leaders are astutely aware of the demands of their public. Nevertheless, politicians must do their utmost to explain the imperative need for an Eastern European bailout to their constituents. There will undeniably be short-term costs, but the long-term security that this plan ensures is in Europe’s best interest. 
A bailout plan also presents an opportunity to improve several conditions within the European Union. The European Union allowed many Eastern European countries to amass unsustainable levels of debt in order to create a sense of prosperity—an act that has compounded the negative impacts of the current crisis. A bailout plan would generate more stringent economic regulations and could be used to promote unification of the national fiscal policies within Europe. 
Furthermore, the partnership created in uniting to survive this crisis would likely increase social capital and improve relations between Eastern and Western Europeans. When the newly accepted Eastern European countries first joined the EU, Western Europeans initially reacted with hostility to the wave of immigrants that entered their society. Persistent unison and a shared economic venture may well reduce such antagonism. 
Reality mandates that, even if the Western European countries dedicate maximum available effort and resources to support Eastern nations, there will still be a shortage of funds and instability will endure. Both Eastern and Western European countries should appeal to outside sources of aid and attempt to garner increased assistance from institutions such as the IMF. Only with a combined effort does the European Union have the credible means to pull through the economic crisis. 
In troubled conditions, countries have a natural impulse to turn inward and focus on their own problems. However, the member states of the European Union are not isolated nations, but part of a larger political cooperation. Both for egotistic reasons and for the long-term well being of the EU, Western European countries must lend their support to Eastern European nations and attempt to retain a unified Europe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kennedy School professor Ashton B. Carter won’t have a hard time making friends in Washington. Carter, who recently announced his appointment as the new director of weapons procurement at the Pentagon, will join a flock of Harvard affiliates who have already migrated to the capital. The role call boasts some of our biggest names—from Elena Kagan to Cass R. Sunstein ’75—and the total count comes to at least 10 Harvard professors along with numerous alumni. 
These men and women may seem like inspiration for a Harvard graduate to pass over Wall Street or med school for a cozy cubicle at the Pentagon. But a closer look at the career paths of these appointees points motivated students in a different direction. Many of Obama’s Harvard picks moved into their elite roles laterally, from top positions in related fields, rather than through the government apparatus itself.
This is discouraging for those of us interested in pursuing government jobs. We’re conscientious citizens, but we also want to be rewarded for a job well done. If Washington wants to encourage bright students to spend their careers in government, therefore, rather than marketing the public sector to us more aggressively, it should lay out a clearer path to success from within the bureaucracy. 
As it stands, many government head honchos are there by way of other fields, such as academia, business, or law. Sunstein, the new head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, for instance, spent 90 percent of his professional career at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law Schools.  The new associate attorney general, law school grad Thomas J. Perelli, started out in top D.C. law firm Jenner & Block. 
Such external appointments are daily business in the public sector. They are not inherently bad—indeed, few would doubt that Sunstein, the most frequently cited legal scholar in America, is not qualified for his post.  However, these indirect career paths do discourage bright, ambitious students from signing on for a career in public service.
Such students do not want to work in a field where in-house opportunities for career advancement are so uncertain. No matter how passionately we feel about public service, dismal-looking advancement opportunities packaged with lower salaries and a lack of immediate prestige make this field a difficult choice. No number of info sessions by OCS or heartfelt appeals from the commencement dais will change this.
Rather, if public service is to become a more attractive option, the government must ensure that career advancement is a real possibility. Here, some inspiration may be taken from the elite military academies. The prestige and concrete career boost conferred on West Point graduates—they start out as second lieutenants  after graduation, rather than privates—motivates students and assures them of being properly valued in the military.
A similar career boost for bright students would be helpful in government. The public sector already has plenty of institutions that do the job of a West Point in the form of high-ranking government and public-service schools. The government would be well-served by starting a “Public Service Fellows” program in which students who graduate magna cum laude are put on an official career fast track. Of course, this does not mean that such graduates should be blindly promoted regardless of competence. But simply giving a promise of open doors and professional attention ahead of time—in return for merit-worthy work—would make public service a much more attractive career option.
Admittedly, such a program should not have to exist. Quality workers should naturally rise to the top in any good organization. But that’s a magnificently long-term problem, and in the meantime the government still needs an influx of talented students in its ranks. When career bureaucrats dominate the cabinet roundtable, then advancement shortcuts will be obsolete. Until then, talented students will need to see a less murky path to success if they are to join the public sector.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last December, President Faust warned the Harvard community that the administration would be taking a “hard look at hiring, staffing levels, and compensation.” In the past, Harvard’s “hard looks” have hit workers hardest, resulting in layoffs, outsourcing, and unlivable wages for Harvard’s service employees. Yet resistance from workers and students has kept Harvard accountable for its questionable labor practices and allowed for the implementation of many policies and contracts that adequately compensate employees for their work.
One such policy is the Wage and Benefit Parity Policy that guarantees outsourced workers the same compensation and treatment as those employees hired directly by Harvard. The policy purports that outsourcing is used “to increase quality and spark innovation, not to adversely affect the wages and benefits of Harvard’s own service employees.” Despite Harvard’s reluctance to hire in-house, the Parity Policy has been an important and laudable effort by Harvard to express its commitment to workers’ rights for all employees on campus regardless of who signs their paychecks.
Unfortunately, this policy has not protected outsourced workers from becoming some of the first targets of layoffs. Last month, Harvard announced that it would cut 13 of 27 jobs contracted through American Cleaning Company at Harvard Medical School and would reduce some 30 to 40 percent of costs allocated to OneSource, the cleaning subcontractor for Harvard Real Estate properties. Only about 40 percent of Harvard’s custodial staff is directly hired, so similar measures at other schools and departments would drastically affect the overall custodial staffing levels. These cuts are part of a university-wide effort to reduce spending to compensate for the rumored $8 billion loss in Harvard’s endowment. Although additional layoffs of service employees have yet to be announced, many workers are bracing themselves for similar layoffs across all departments and schools. 
We all must expect to make sacrifices during these uncertain times, but it is particularly troubling that Harvard has identified outsourced custodians as its first superfluous expense. By targeting the lowest-paid, least-valued, and mostly immigrant workers at this university, Harvard sends a clear message that some members of our community are more expendable than the next. Service employees made sacrifices so their families could live better in even the best of economies. They saw no perks or benefits, even when the endowment grew at astronomical rates. Yet they are the first to suffer now that university budgets are in crisis.
In addition to the obvious problem that layoffs pose for those who lose their jobs, it also impacts those “lucky” enough to have weathered the storm and retain their employment. With upcoming layoffs at Harvard Medical School totaling about 40 percent of the custodial staff, cuts will nearly double the amount of work for already overextended employees. Such overwhelming personnel cuts like those slated for the medical school campus are unacceptable and are disproportionally making custodians feel a harder pinch than the tightening of the belt that all parts of the university are facing. 
Budget cuts will be hard for everyone, but a university that prides itself on being at the cutting edge of innovation and thought can surely find more creative ways to make up the deficit than laying off its lowest-paid workers, who need their jobs the most. Harvard must make a conscious effort to save as many jobs as possible and prioritize the livelihoods of those who work hard to keep Harvard working. 
Beyond our own priorities as a university, Harvard must also recognize that it has an obligation to its neighbors and surrounding communities. As a recognized nonprofit, Harvard receives substantial tax breaks in return for providing educational services and stimulating local economies. Layoffs may allow Harvard to breathe easy, but in doing so they are simply shifting the burden of labor costs onto the cities of Boston and Cambridge and local taxpayers. Because Harvard is one of the largest employers in Massachusetts, any substantial layoffs at Harvard will dramatically affect neighboring communities—those that don’t have the most expensive money managers and billions of dollars in an endowment to jump-start their financial recovery. Harvard teaches its students to be responsible citizens, but there is nothing responsible about the richest university in the world conducting massive layoffs that will only add to the already hurting economy.
Today, workers are holding protests outside the offices of Labor Relations in Holyoke Center at 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Janitors, library workers, security guards, and dining-hall staff will come together to make visible the very real consequences of these potential layoffs. Hundreds of working people are refusing to be reduced to percentage points on Harvard’s budget charts and are fighting to keep the jobs on which they and their families depend.  
As students, we should stand in solidarity with workers in these difficult and uncertain times. We must express to the Harvard administration that we are willing to make sacrifices so our friends can keep their jobs. Harvard’s educational mission should not only be an intellectual one, but also a moral one, that teaches us to put people over profits and value all members of our campus, whether they are using the classrooms or cleaning them. The strength of Harvard comes not from the rate of its endowment growth, but in the community of people that comprise it. The road ahead will be difficult, but only by collective sacrifice we will retain our community and begin the recovery process together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the coming months, the Obama administration will give us a better sense of what American foreign policy will look like over the next four to eight years. The president is faced with more challenges abroad than he and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can realistically hope to resolve in one or even two terms, and several are significant enough that, alone, they could come to define American foreign policy during the Obama years. What will our troop commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan be in 2012? How much will Obama seek to engage Russia in dealing with Iran? Will increased cooperation with Russia undermine ties with Georgia and the Ukraine? How heavily will Obama’s administration prioritize aid to Africa? Will he get anywhere on the road map to a Middle East peace? Will cooperation over the financial crisis suffice to effect a real rapprochement with our traditional Western European allies? Yet, in the long run, the most important question in American foreign policy remains what level of engagement we will seek with China. And, as Hillary Clinton’s recent trip to Asia demonstrates, the most worthwhile strategy for pursuing Sino-American cooperation is teamwork on climate change. 
China is not only America’s largest creditor, but it is also America’s only real global competitor. American demand for Chinese goods has fueled growth in Chinese manufacturing, and Chinese savings, in turn, have enabled America to live beyond her means. Yet this symbiotic economic relationship has, until recently, only made the headlines when it’s a matter of defective toys and toxic foodstuffs. Although at earlier points in our history we woefully mistreated African Americans and Native Americans, we lecture China about its treatment of Tibet and sell arms to what the Chinese regard as a “break-away” province, Taiwan. We compete with China for natural resources and influence in the developing world. Now, the only reliable component of the equation, economic interdependence, is threatened by the global credit crunch, which is closing off China’s export markets and inducing it to spend more of its yuan at home, rather than in buying up U.S. treasury bonds.
Yet there is an issue, the biggest issue of them all if you take the long view, that provides an opportunity for unprecedented and much needed cooperation. 
Sooner rather than later, the two superpowers will have to find a way to lay the foundation for cooperation on the world’s most pressing issue: climate change. And, as challenging as this will be, it arguably represents the most plausible vehicle for coperation between the two countries. The alternative, confrontations about human rights and “currency manipulation,” only promise to exacerbate conflict. Nothing will be accomplished. 
That doesn’t mean that cooperation on climate change will be easy. Only since Obama’s inauguration has the U.S. begun to get serious on climate change, and even so we are unlikely to see a bill pass the Senate and the House before 2010, owing as much to Democratic opposition as Republican. For years the U.S. has refused to commit to emissions cuts if China wasn’t willing to do the same. China has deferred action, claiming that, until recently, it was a developing country making a negligible contribution to the current problem, so it should be allowed to prioritize economic development over global environmental concerns. 
Still, both countries recognize that they have much to gain from assuming a leadership role on climate change. This December, 190 countries will convene in Copenhagen for the third and final round of meetings to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, the existing global framework on climate change. Until recently, many in the international community were downbeat about the prospects of effective legislation to come out of Copenhagen. Yet clean energy figured prominently in Obama’s stimulus package, renewing hope among many that American initiative on global warming might galvanize the world’s other largest polluters to act decisively to cut down on CO2 emissions. As the industrial power of the 21st century, China recognizes that segueing into more environmentally sustainable growth is not only crucial to its internal development but also has great potential of becoming a major export market. 
Having divvied out the perennial “hot spots” in the world to the members of an A-list of special envoys, Hillary Clinton seems to be putting her own imprint and betting her opportunity for an enduring legacy on the China-climate change connection. Watch for this issue to have great prominence for her in the months and years to come.

Who else but the Nanny would roll into Lamont at four on a Saturday afternoon decked out in knee-high boots, dark sunglasses, and a fur coat? No one, of course, but Fran Drescher herself.Drescher came to speak to the crowd in the Lamont Forum Room about her experience as a cancer survivor and her book, “Cancer Schmancer.”“I’ve reinvented myself since ‘The Nanny,’” Drescher explained. “I am a uterine cancer survivor, but it took me two years and eight doctors to get a proper diagnosis.”The actress, author, and activist discussed the importance of awareness and early diagnosis and described the experience of finding out she had uterine cancer. She recalled, “I told my boyfriend, ‘we have to freeze an embryo!’ The doctor had me convinced I had 15 minutes of fertility left, and this with the boyfriend who’s 16 years younger. Needless to say, we’re no longer together.” Michael B. Hess ’09, the former treasurer of the Lampoon, coordinated the event, bringing Drescher to Harvard through family ties. “She’s coming to be indicted as an honorary member of the Lampoon tonight,” Hess said. “Her movement is inspiring and informative for everyone to learn about.”Former Lampoon President Christopher R. Schleicher ’09 agreed with Hess.“It was good to hear her message and see her serious side. Me and ‘The Nanny’ go way back,” Schleicher said. “I am hoping for the biggest Nanny party tonight I’ve ever been to.”Dressed to party indeed, Drescher left in good spirits with some final words of wisdom.“Always consult multiple physicians, and never be afraid to ask questions,” Drescher said. “One of my doctors basically told me, ‘Honey, you’ve got the tits of an 18-year-old—you’re fine. Just drink some gin every night.’ There I was with perky breasts going to bed sloshed. Never be afraid to ask questions and to question your doctors themselves—they’re not always right.”

In what can be called one of the most blatantly ironic financial events in recent memory, the Everything’s Jake store at 36 JFK Street in the Garage—purveyors of the plucky t-shirt brand famous for the “Life is good” slogan—closed its doors last Sunday. According to store owner Glen Tompkins, the economy simply “knocked us out.”But silver lining isn’t hard to find for Tompkins, who has been surrounded by the brand’s optimistic stick figures since the store opened in August of 2006, “It’s not all doom and gloom,” he said. While Tompkins noted a contingent of “die-harders” in Cambridge, a lack of sales and high rent overcame what he described as a “little piece of optimism” from economic reality.“I actually found the other employees to be really negative, and it seemed to me like the management was in a bit of turmoil,” said M. Amelia Muller ’11, who worked at Everything’s Jake for a brief period last year. Muller added that she also worked at a Life is good store in her hometown of Greenville, S.C. which, though still open, is also struggling. Some shoppers at the closeout sale were wary of purchasing the products, despite slashed prices. Mariana Toledo, a Cambridge resident who had heard of the sale, came and left empty-handed. When asked if she would have felt more inclined to express herself through her t-shirt if the slogans had greater variety, like “Life is Average” or “Life is Not So Good Today,” she replied, “Yeah, I probably would.”Although the failure of the Everything’s Jake store may indicate that fewer people are now buying into what the famous stick figures have to say, some customers take comfort in Jake’s encouraging words. “I like what it says,” declared Toledo’s mother, Maria. “I like what that means.”

Most people do their best to forget the awkward glory of middle school social life. Apparently those people don’t live in Pfoho. This past Friday saw the first ever HoCo-sponsored Pfoho Sleepover, replete with scary movies, board games, and gratuitous Britney and NSYNC videos. FM dropped by for a closer look at the pre-pubescent revelry. 11:14 p.m.I wander into a darkened common room as the group of slumber party guests watched “The Ring.” There’s popcorn and cookies aplenty, but only about ten people sprawled around the television.  11:35 p.m.Krista E. Weiss ’09, former HoCo executive and the brains behind the slumber party, enters with both food and wine in hand. “I was sitting in the dining hall with my block mates, and we were talking about funny things we could do in Pfoho, and I just thought of having a sleepover,” says Weiss. According to her, the general response was positive, but the actual turnout fell short of her expectations. 11:54 p.m.A sudden yelp from Michael H. Oshima ’09 sends the room into panic. “Yeah, I actually like scary movies,” he says, although everyone else is too terrified to look at the screen.  12:53 a.m.After the movie ends, a game of Hoopla begins with “Baby One More Time” on an infinite loop in the background. Sameer Lakha ’09 drops by and comments on the relatively empty room. “It’s a great idea, but you know, it’s Friday night.” 1:30 a.m.In the midst of charades: “Strip Club? No? Um... sorority!” 2:05 a.m.Truth or dare time. As Ola S. Canty ’11 prepares herself for a lap dance, I decide to take my leave—after all, I wouldn’t want to intrude on any Pfoho incest. I’m just glad it ended before anyone could suggest a game of Spin the Bottle.

How far would seniors go in this economic recession to ensure a job after graduation? Would any of them, say, risk a jump into the freezing Charles River?For one Kirkland House senior, the answer is an emphatic yes. Radford “Rad” Murphy ’09 sported nothing but swim trunks in his minute-long video entry for Tourism Queensland’s “The Best Job in the World” competition. Video entries are rated by the public on the job’s Web site, and the winner earns the crown title of “Island Caretaker” of Hamilton Island along the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia. The six-month job comes with keys to a posh three-bedroom beach front house and a hefty salary totaling 150,000 Australian dollars.If the compensation isn’t enticing enough, as part of a Tourism Queensland marketing campaign, the caretaker faces the daunting task of exploring this stunning tropical paradise and the underwater world below while chronicling the adventures in a video blog series and photos to be posted online.“I was never going to work at an office job,” says Murphy, whose last summer internship entailed swimming with sharks in the Bahamas. His right hand still bears a distinct scar from an encounter gone awry. Murphy hopes that this past experience will give him an edge amongst over 34,000 competitors, including Cabot House resident Thomas R. Benson ’09. Benson says he applied in the hopes of getting “basically a paid vacation.”On the other side of campus, Lowell resident Zuleyka D. Bonilla ’10, another applicant, made a public plea over the Lowell open house e-mail list, asking house mates to give her the highest five-star rating for her entry video. Bonilla could not be reached for comment.If Murphy doesn’t make the cut, he plans to recover by spending another year in the Bahamas after graduation. Seniors banging at the doors of Wall Street may look on in envy.

And we’re moving.
Welcome, junior parents, to Prestige and Mobility’s Alternative Tour of Harvard, the no-holds-barred, kick-you-in-the-groin, leave-you-sterile-where-you-stand, give-you-expired-coupons look at the seedy, “unofficial” side of Harvard. You know, the side you see when Professor Greg Mankiw wears those “pants.” Before we begin, congratulations on siring America’s best and brightest, who will all go on to be president—even the girls.
We start here at the John Harvard statue. Now, it is a famous Harvard undergraduate tradition to pee on the statue. I say, why stop there? Hell, Christian B. Flow ’10 has been looking for a hole in this thing for years. They call this the statue of Harvard’s three lies. Can anyone name them?—Hey, pay attention! No need to look at the chaches in the straw hats, shouting and making bad jokes. They think they’re earning vacations in the Caribbean, but they’re really just offering lousy and obnoxious guided visits that aren’t as good as the free tours—Well, the three lies are, first, there aren’t just three lies. Second, your friends from Dorm Crew will clean your bathroom every two weeks. Three, you will “take advantage of” Boston all the time. Ol’ Beantown! So many other fun cool teens. What a city. Ol’ Beantown! Four, of course you’ll get a job. You’re the most elite students in the country. Five, the girls here are smoke shows. The cat’s pajamas. Six, you will learn to love having seasons. It’s only cold a few months a year. Seven, yeah, we always have grass in the Yard. Who wants to play some Ultimate?! Eight, your parents’ love is unconditional.
Gazing around the Yard, you can see the many freshman dorms. During the 1960s, social mores shot out the door, and a bonanza of homemade pornography films exploded onto the Yard. Adult video shops are still jam-packed—at least I’m told—with titles like, “Mass Hall: Girls Gone Relatively Wild,” “How Much Are Your Wigglesworth?,” “Green-hos,” “Pennypacker? I Hardly Know Her,” and “Cower at the Tower of Sexual Power as They Plow Her in Mower in Under an Hour, Narrated by Dwight D. Eisenhower.” Surprisingly, Hurlbut, Widener, and Pusey remained untouched.
And we’re moving.
To your right, you will see the Harvard College Women’s Center. Along with the Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and the Delphic basement, this facility continues a long tradition of keeping women underground and safe from nuclear fallout.
And we’re moving.
Did someone have a question in the back? No, those building are not public housing projects, but in fact Canaday, a freshman dorm and home of the “Canaday renaissance,” a movement expressed primarily through Top 40 hip-hop and some seriously awesome pong. I mean, seriously. Seriously, man, you don’t even know.
And we’re moving
If you saw this monstrosity, called the Science Center, and thought, “What the hell? That doesn’t look anything like a camera! All I see is a bunch of mediocre girls with rolling backpacks,” then you’d be right.
To your right, you can see William James Hall, site of the famous Registrarian Monkey Revolt. Proclaiming himself Maestro de Los Monos, Titan of the Tamarins, Oligarch of the Orangutans, Champion of the Chimps, Liberator of the Lemurs, First Secretary of the Democratic Worker Monkeys Popular Banana Front, and Guardian of the CUE, Registrar Barry S. Kane marched on the building and stabbed several security guards with a letter opener, which was marked with the monogram “DGF.” He then released all of the monkeys and led them, as the Pied Piper of Primates, into University Hall. Thus was born the new Harvard calendar.
If you continue down Oxford Street, you will see two of Harvard’s most famous landmarks. Farthest away, you will find Northwest Labs, the inspiration for “2001: A Space Odyssey.” On the first Tuesday after the second Monday after the lunar equinox, the massive basement becomes an underground roller derby arena and home of human sacrifice. [1] 
Slightly closer, one finds the Peabody Museum, home to some excellent exhibits of roma bones. Many visitors remark, “Those are a lot of gypsy bones, but they can’t possibly account for the number of gypsies killed during the construction of CGIS by Our Queen Drew Faust.” That would be astute. Those are only the gypsy elites, accordion players, queens, and humor columnists. The mass graves are beneath the Quad.
And we’re moving.
Finally, feel free to tip us in cash, war bonds, wampum, or your daughter’s phone number. What? Your daughter’s only 14? I’ll settle for her screen name. Oh, come on. At least give me her Xanga page. 

[1] Why do you think those couches are red? If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much room.

Charlie Albright ’11 does not look superhuman. He looks tall. He looks young, or younger than 20 at least. He sits up straight and answers each of my questions politely and honestly. “Don’t you ever feel stressed out?” I ask. “Don’t you ever feel overwhelmed?”“It’s hard sometimes,” he says, matter of fact. You might not guess that Albright is a consummate pianist. He hails from Centralia, a town of about 15,000 people in Washington. His piano teacher, Nancy Adsit, taught him for free. Albright is one of a select few. These are Harvard students who manage an intensive schedule of highly advanced music and academics. As part of an accelerated dual degree program, the sophomore attends both Harvard and the New England Conservatory (NEC). He plans to earn both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Music in five years. In between classes, papers, and problem sets are lessons, concerts, and—the mainstay of any serious musician—hours upon hours of daily practice. Albright’s Web site lists a fearsome litany of international awards, from first prize at the 2006 Eastman International Young Artists Piano Competition to Best Performance of a Liszt Study in Stage I at the 2008 Sydney International Piano Competition. If he knows a song well enough to hum it, he explains, then he can play it on the piano. “I won this international piano competition,” Albright remembers. “As an encore, I played my variations on Jeopardy.” Though he remembers winning these prizes, memories of his musical beginnings—at the tender age of three and a half—are fuzzy. His mother fills in the details for him. “My mom was in the kitchen, and I started pecking out ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’ by myself,” he explains, a little bemused.“I was very surprised,” says his mother, Hyesoo Albright. Albright still competes and performs regularly while taking five classes at Harvard as an economics concentrator. He’s also pre-med.Rising stars of the classical music world such as Albright face a peculiar set of challenges—besides a need for ruthless time management. Along with the delicate balancing act between music and academics, between NEC and Harvard, there lies as larger question. And perhaps this question is the eternal dilemma of the young: what will I do with my life? This is especially pertinent for young musicans in Albright’s position: those who are considering a career in an art that is losing its mainstream appeal. “Classical music is dying. Ticket sales are always declining, symphonies are always begging for money,” Kenric Tam ’12, a joint program pianist, says. “If you go to a concert, you’ll see a lot of white--haired people.” “Even though I have done well in piano, there’s no demand for it,” Albright says. In part because of this ageing fan base, classical music is not seen as a stable career choice.  “I don’t feel safe putting all my eggs in that one basket.” He attributes this more to a lack of connections than a lack of talent.As it turns out, merely possessing and honing a prodigious talent does not make life choices any easier. TWO INSTITUTIONS ARE BETTER THAN ONEThe Harvard/NEC program, founded in 2005, allows students to pursue both academics and music at two of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. For the first three years, students take weekly lessons with an NEC instructor. The fourth year, when participants are seniors at Harvard, they are required to play in an ensemble, a requirement often filled by joining the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. They also begin requirements for a Master’s degree at NEC, while finishing concentration and core requirements in Cambridge. The fifth and final year of the program is spent exclusively at NEC. The joint program is highly selective by any measure. Applicants must survive Harvard’s infamous admissions gauntlet along with getting the nod from NEC’s admissions committee. Beyond that, applicants could receive the thick envelope from both Harvard and NEC separately and still be rejected from the joint program itself. So what distinguishes the crème de la crème from the merely über-accomplished? It all comes down to the audition, which isn’t always guaranteed. There is even a pre-screening process for the more popular instruments, such as violin and piano. NEC aims for a class of four to five each year, according to NEC’s Dean of the College Thomas W. Novak.Novak reports 133 applications to the program this year, a bump from the usual 80-100. He attributes the school’s increased popularity to recent high-profile hires, such as the NEC’s new President Tony Woodcock. There are similar programs at Columbia, with Julliard; Yale College, with the Yale School of Music; and Johns Hopkins, with the Peabody Institute. BONG-IHN KOH ’08: THE POWERHOUSEBong-Ihn Koh ’08, one of the joint program’s inaugural participants, counts Yo-Yo Ma ’76 among his personal friends. The two met at one of Ma’s concerts in Germany. Koh introduced himself to Ma backstage. “[Ma] just handed me his cello and asked me if I wanted to try it.”Koh and I settle down in one of the Cabot House sitting rooms, which doubles as a practice space for Koh. He is currently an “Artist in Residence” for the upper-class house. Koh is calm, really quite serene. He patiently explains both his scientific research and music. He corrects me only once—I accidentally say “celloist” instead of “cellist.” As a high school student, Koh attended an American-German school in Berlin while enrolled at a conservatory for young musicians. There, he studied under legendary cellist and teacher David Geringas. Upon graduation, Koh was accepted at Harvard and intended to enroll in the joint program.“People thought I was committing suicide by leaving that teacher first of all, and dividing my time between biology and music,” he says of his move from Germany to the Cambridge. “People were calling me crazy,” Koh says, smiling. “People still call me crazy.”Though “crazy” may seem a bit excessive for a musician with high aspirations, Koh’s plans involve another, equally ambitious element. He hopes to make it as a world-class cell scientist as well as a world-class cellist. His acknowledges that there are only 24 hours in the day. But he already has the next few years mapped out. After he earns his Master of Music, he plans to attend graduate school and pursue stem cell research, continuing to practice cello while decreasing performance commitments. These days, Koh has orchestra practice at NEC three days a week for three hours at a time. He’s in the classroom four days a week, until 6:00 p.m. After all of that, he spends long nights essentially volunteering at the Scadden Lab he worked in as an undergrad. “Whenever I’m not in NEC, I’m in lab,” he says. Luckily, Koh attributes his scheduling skills to his mother. As an undergraduate, he would practice the cello as his lab experiments incubated. Now, in the fifth year of the program, he says he uses a Google Calendar to arrange his busy days.For Koh, the hectic schedule feels necessary. “I think I really can’t survive without one of the two,” he says. “I think I would utterly depressed. I would be lacking a significant part of me.” He has no plans to choose between his two passions after graduating from the joint program. I ask Koh if he’s ever had any regrets, any instances when he’s doubted himself. He goes quiet for moment.“When I was thinking about my colleagues from my German days, I kept following his careers, wishing that [this could be me],” he admits. It’s the closest he comes to sounding sad.“But then I would come to the conclusion that I’m pursuing my own happiness and mine is a unique road.”SANDY M. CAMERON ’09: THE FREE SPIRIT“I really don’t want to do anything other than music,” Sandy M. Cameron ’09 says without hesitation. “I live and think and breathe it.” Cameron is petite, her curly brown hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She flashes an impish smile. A silver “S” dangles from the black cord around her neck, near a dark smudge where she constantly holds her violin. “Sandra is notable for her enthusiasm and her effervescence,” Professor of Music Robert D. Levin says of his former Music 180 student. Along with Koh, Cameron is part of the joint program’s inaugural class. Koh says of the early years: “To be honest, the program wasn’t really formulated. I really felt like we were being treated like guinea pigs.”Every so often, students would meet with NEC administrators to flesh out what was and wasn’t working in the program. Cameron says that change was understandably slow.“There’s the disconnect between administrators and students,” she says. “As undergrads, we don’t have as much contact as we’d like, and they don’t understand what’s going at Harvard.”However, one of the biggest issues—the misaligned academic calendars of the two institutions—is being resolved with calendar switch next year. Before, Cameron would miss lessons because of the two schools’ different spring breaks. With lessons set at a fixed annual price, “It sort of felt like you would get cheated a few lessons here and there,” she says.Novak points out that communication between the two schools could be improved. And since students only take lessons their first three years in the program, interaction with NEC is limited. “[It’s] very hard to make them feel like part of the community here,” Novak says. “There are no easy answers.” Demanding Harvard schedules prevent members of the joint program from experience life as an NEC student. “I would race to [the Number One bus] and race back,” Koh says of his bus commute each week. The $6,000 yearly fee for lessons also presents an added financial bruden for some. Novak says that NEC grants every joint program student a scholarship, but there’s little, if any, funding for the difference. Cameron says the program has come a long way. “Just about the all the problems have been fixed,” she says. Though Cameron knows the classical music world is tough, she wouldn’t consider doing anything else. As she practices a duet for an upcoming concert, she tells the pianist, “I think we need a change of color.” She associates each note with its own color, though she doesn’t literally see them: “E flat major is a nice burgundy. C major is kind of blue-ish,” she says.As we leave the music building, she discovers it’s snowing. Cameron dances in a little circle in her four inch heels and lime green coat. “I love snow!” she shouts.In a later interview, Cameron turns to me. “I realized since I was twelve that I wanted to be a violinist and do music for the rest of my life.” NICO OLARTE-HAYES ’11: THE ARTIST “I was practicing in Straus C basement,” Yuga J. Cohler ’11 says as he recalls how he met his future roommate, Nico A. Olarte-Hayes ’11. “It was about 3:00 a.m..I figured no one would be there. Then all of a sudden, someone barged into my room.” This, of course, was Olarte-Hayes, a joint program cellist and Physics concentrator, who supposedly lived in Canaday, but may as well have called Straus basement home. “He prioritizes his cello over almost everything else in his life,” Cohler says.Olarte-Hayes’s answers are immediate, eloquent, and honest. I ask him why he doesn’t do many competitions, and he replies, “I find it offensive to everything I do.” Balancing school and music is still a work in progress. When he talks about the difficulties of fitting both in, he cuts a sharp contrast to Albright and Koh. There’s no talk of regular hours, of rigidly regimented days, no mentions of seamless, play-it-by-ear heroic time management. “Last year, it was really difficult,” Olarte-Hayes says. “It was difficult to function normally...there would literally be weeks where I would see very little daylight.”He describes practicing in Straus until four in the morning followed by solitary breakfasts at Finagle.“Then I would go to sleep and do it all over again. It was really difficult last year. It was really lonely,” he says.We walk up the stairs of Eliot tower, toward a pale blue practice room with a romantic Cambridge view. He opens the door, grabs a chair and pulls out the endpin on his cello. As he resins the bow, he lectures on the subtle differences between bows. Like many classical musicians, he began training early in life. From the violin at three to the cello at six, Olarte-Hayes attended the Julliard pre-college program in seventh grade. There, he switched teachers three times to capitalize on their knowledge and learn as much as he could.“What I strive for is four hours a day,” he says, of practice. “The total time commitment is like that of a full time job.” But he wouldn’t switch his life for that of a conservatory student.“There’s just so much I want to learn. I wouldn’t be happy if I just played my cello all day long. I know that there’s all aspects of life that I’m missing out on,” he says. “Cultivating my interests now will lead to richer life experience in general.”This is a point I hear over and over again: that while it is difficult to balance music and academics, the two complement each other. Cameron, who concentrates in Music, and Koh, who concentrates in Biology, both commented on this fundamental benefit of the Harvard/NEC program. “Even if I’m taking a course on dinosaurs, I will find some link,” Cameron says. “Certain anomalies in dinosaur bones...could make me think of certain anomalies in Schubert’s writing.”Academics can also translate in more tangible way. Oliver D. Strand ’11, a composition student in the program, says that studying literature has opened up new ways of thinking about music. One time, Strand read poem by Professor Jorie Graham in his freshman seminar. “It described the sensation of looking at yourself in a mirror. I wrote a piece for guitar and harp,” he says. The piece is a musical reenactment of some of the poem’s themes and ideas. Back in the practice room, I run out of questions for Olarte-Hayes. “How much longer will you be here?” “What time is it?” he asks.I tell him it’s It’s 10:57 p.m.He thinks for a second. “Three.” “3:00 a.m.?” He nods.I leave him alone with his cello.KENRIC TAM ’12: THE REALIST“One of the constant questions during high school I was trying to figure out was: am I going to pursue music, or am I going to decide to go into academics and drop music?” Tam says between sips of his orange mint hot chocolate. “I’m very disorganized,” Tam says. “I write down important appointments on a Post-It note if I remember.” Somehow, he catches about seven hours of a sleep anyway. Tam is still in the first phase of the joint program. If possible, Tam comes across as even more laid back than Albright. He has a certain economy of motion and speech and doesn’t exhibit an ounce of nervous energy. He traces his musical history, from one national competition to soloing with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, as if he were describing grass growing. If he doesn’t emote much, it’s because it goes into his playing.Hans Boepple, Tam’s piano teacher in high school, places him in the top 1% of his 400 students. “Music just runs through him like a current,” he says.“I react to music emotionally,” he explains. “I’m very expressive with my playing.” Tam’s favorite composer is Frédéric Chopin.Tam, like Albright, is pre-med. He reveals this in the middle of the interview, as if it were some trifling detail. “I am giving myself choices for the future,” he explains. “I haven’t decided yet. I feel like I can still try to pursue music, but I have a backup plan.”“I can’t imagine him doing anything in his life other than music,” Boepple says. “He can probably do anything he wants, frankly.” Perhaps Professor Levin expresses it best: “These are uncommonly interesting young human beings,” he says.

Next fall’s freshman class will be the first to graduate entirely under the General Education curriculum, but they may find themselves in classes that are strikingly similar to ones taken by their older peers.The Standing Committee on General Education has recently approved more courses to fill out the eight Gen Ed categories. But currently, the vast majority are drawn from departmental courses and the Core curriculum, with very few newly-designed courses made specifically to suit Gen Ed categories.   Although the lack of brand new courses made some wonder about just how novel the new program is, others argued that natural overlaps between the Core and Gen Ed exist and should be taken into consideration.“Many courses already taught carry out some of the same objectives that Gen Ed aspires to, so I don’t think it is a defect to draw initially on some of these courses,” said History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60, whose departmental course History 1920: “A Global History of Modern Times” now counts for Gen Ed credit in Societies of the World.The College’s new general education program was designed to mirror the traditional underpinnings of a liberal arts education, imparting broad knowledge in a wider variety of categories and encouraging a greater real world application of curriculum, according to Gen Ed administrators.Music and African American Studies Professor Kay K. Shelemay, who teaches Literature and Arts B-78: “Soundscapes: Exploring Music in a Changing World,” said that the new Gen Ed criteria very much affects the way she teaches her course. “The class is now much more connected to music in a changing world,” she said. “It approaches social and ethical issues and questions and includes much more performance and performance activity.”“I have also incorporated significantly more media materials into my lectures,” Shelemay added.Professors have the option of submitting current Core or departmental courses for review by the Gen Ed Committee for Gen Ed credit approval. They can also design entirely new courses that meet the Gen Ed objectives.“Obviously with existing courses we need to work with the most recent syllabus with whatever revision the faculty member suggests,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. “For newer courses we don’t demand a full syllabus but a narrative.” For Folklore and Mythology Professor Maria Tatar, the review process for Literature and Arts A-17:  “Childhood: Its History, Philosophy, and Literature” was surprisingly short.“In terms of content, I was quite surprised that were really no changes or tinkering made to my syllabus at all,” she said.Tatar added, however, her experience may not have been the norm.Because the earliest proposals of the Gen Ed program presented in early 2006 consisted of three broader areas of study—humanities, social studies, and physical sciences—Tatar’s course was originally conceptualized as a humanities course. It was one of approximately 10 courses introduced to fit the Gen Ed guideline while simultaneously serving as Core courses during the developmental stage of the new curriculum.Although the current Gen Ed program now requires students to fulfill eight categories, faculty members are hoping to spark creative pedagogy through the implementation of a new academic structure. “It included more categories than originally envisaged, and that has led to a superficial resemblance to the Core,” Maier said. “But this does not mean that it cannot be a meaningful general education curriculum.” —Staff writer Wendy H.

For people looking to lose weight, paying attention to calorie intake may be just as important as noting where those calories came from, according to a recent study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of Louisiana State University.Though popular culture would lead many to believe that low fat diets are better than high fat diets with the same amount of calories, the study reveals that it is the number of calories that matters most. “I think that people can really pick whatever healthy diet they like,” said Frank M. Sacks, a professor at HSPH and lead author of the study, naming Mediterranean, low-fat, and vegan diets as examples. “Our results say that these diets would work the same.”The researchers said that these findings do not invalidate the effectiveness of any commercial diets, only that no one diet is better than another.“The public might be confused as to what the perfect diet is, and this study suggests people should be focusing... on counting calories,”  said Stephen D. Anton, a professor at the University of Florida who trained the dietitians who helped conduct the study. “It’s hard to predict how the weight loss industry will respond,”The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, assigned over 800 overweight adults to one of four diets, each composed of different ratios of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Results from the two-year long clinical trial showed that all four diets led to clinically significant weight loss and health benefits. Participants, who were recruited from Boston and Baton Rouge, were provided with menus developed by registered dietitians and were given daily feedback on how close their meals were to their assigned diets. Participants could also choose to attend group sessions and learn about diet and behavioral self-management.Results showed a positive association between group session attendance and weight-loss, an interesting point that merits further research, Sacks said.“We’re now trying to understand the basis for...this huge difference between individual responses to the diet. Why are some people so successful at weight loss [than others], despite the same commitment?” Sacks said. “It’s an area that hasn’t been studied well.”The researchers added that they believe their findings will leave a lasting impact on the scientific community. “We’ve shown that any reasonable diet can provide weight loss, as long as caloric intake is reduced,” said Katherine D. McManus, Director of Nutrition at Brigham and Women’s Hospital who headed the diet intervention committee for the study. “It’s exciting—the message encourages long-term healthy eating habits.”—Staff writer Helen X.

Despite economic turmoil, the Cambridge Public School Committee announced a proposed 2.19 percent increase in the budget last night for the 2009-2010 school year, though the school system will still have to cut over $2 million in expenditures to balance the higher budget.Committee and Schools officials repeatedly said no personnel cuts will be made due to budgetary concerns, though a presentation given by Interim Superintendent Carolyn Turk said part of the $2 million would be made up through “adjusted staffing” for curricular or enrollment reasons.“We’re making reductions in every possible non-staff way,” said Schools spokesman Justin T. Martin. “I don’t believe we have any layoffs due to budget cuts.”The proposed budget would also bring nine new jobs to the school system.In addition to staffing changes for curricular and enrollment reasons, cutbacks were made in administrative non-salary items, capital and technology, the budget for substitute teachers, and discretionary funds at elementary schools.Turk and her senior staff met with every principal and every department head to discuss the budget and develop a viable plan, she said. Almost all of the principles of Cambridge’s 12 elementary schools were in attendance at the meeting, in addition to the principal of the system’s only high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin.Nearly three-quarters of the budget—74.5 percent—is allocated to expenditures in schools, roughly the same proportion as last year. The budget would preserve small elementary class size and keep the student teacher ratio at about 18:1. Three new kindergarten classrooms were also included in the budget, as projected kindergarten enrollment in the coming academic year is projected to rise almost 7 percent to 800 children. According to James Maloney, the chief operating officer for the Cambridge Public Schools, these classrooms may be in the Tobin School, the Morse School, the King School, and/or the Cambridgeport School.Overall, the School Committee members responded positively to the proposed budget.Nancy Tauber said that she was “extremely pleased” and Fred Fantini said that this was “the smoothest budget process” he had seen.Patricia M. Nolan ’80 called the financial crisis “the perfect storm for Cambridge,” because a recession could decrease private school enrollment and bring more funding to public school system, which get more funding when their enrollment grows.Nolan said the growing school age population in the city, in conjunction with the financial crisis, could add 20 and 100 children to Cambridge public schools,But both Marc McGovern and Nolan criticized the budget’s lack of funding for additional social workers or psychologists in the school system. A social worker himself, McGovern said the presence of social workers “is directly related to achievement” and “contributes to a healthier student climate.”    The proposed budget will be voted on April 7. —Staff writer Sofia Groopman can be reached at Segroopm@fas.harvard.edu.

Substantial numbers of highly skilled immigrant workers have begun leaving the United States for their home countries, potentially damaging the economy’s ability to recover by removing a key source of talent, suggests a recent study led by a Harvard researcher.Skilled immigrants who have historically stayed in the United States have proved a key source of innovation for the nation’s economy, according to Vivek Wadhwa, a Law School senior research associate who led the study. Wadhwa said 52 percent of Silicon Valley startups and a quarter of startups nationwide were started by immigrants in the last decade.But as the U.S. job market stagnates amid an unprecedented recession and economic opportunities increase in fast-developing nations such as China and India, immigrants have begun returning home, depriving the United States of thousands of skilled workers.“When they go home, they’re going to create new opportunities at their home, bring innovation to their home,” Wadhwa said. “The economic recovery which would have happened in the United States is being exported to India and China.” Returnees who were forced to work their way up through society in the United States now typically see better starting positions in their home countries, bolstered by the prestige of U.S. educations and job experience, Wadwha said.“They don’t have to make sacrifices, they can be close to their friends and families, and be in societies where they’re at the top of the social ladder,” he said. Wadhwa also places part of the blame for the increase in returnees on U.S. immigration policy, which can make finding a job and staying in the country after college difficult for international students.While many of Harvard’s nearly 4,000 international students intend to stay in the United States to work, others, like Ivan Z. Posavec ’10 and Zeina Oweis ’11, echo the study’s findings.“I love the United States, but I miss home, I miss my parents, my brothers,” said Posavec, a native of Serbia. “I cannot see myself spending the rest of my life thousands of miles away from here.”Oweis said that many international students come to the United States planning to go back to their own countries to serve.Some countries, he added, even give these students scholarships, in the hopes of encouraging their returns.Beyond his desire to be with his family, Posavec said his Harvard degree is in higher demand back home than in the United States. “Back home with a Harvard degree you can pretty much get a job anywhere in any bank,” Posavec said.

Administrators at the Harvard Kennedy School say they believe the Obama administration, which has already tapped many of the school’s professors for work in Washington, may also be linked to an unprecedented increase in applicants to the school.
This year the school’s two-year Master in Public Policy (MPP) program received 1,696 applications, up 34 percent from 1,269 applications last year. The two-year Master in Public Administration in International Development, the school’s newest program, saw a 7 percent increase in applications, while applications to the two-year Master in Public Administration program rose only slightly. Applications to the one-year Mid-Career Master in Public Administration program are due Friday, and Joseph J. McCarthy, the director of degree programs, said he expects a good turnout in that program as well.
Several Kennedy School administrators said that the rise in applications is linked both to the economic downturn and the increased interest in public service sparked by the Obama administration.
“I like to attribute it more to the excitement about government now as a solution rather than a problem,” McCarthy said, calling the phenomenon the “Obama effect.”
He noted that, despite the global economic turmoil, other schools saw smaller increases in application volume. Harvard Law School saw a 5-6 percent increase in application volume, according to the school’s admissions blog.
Kennedy School Director of Admissions and Enrollment Management Alexandra Martinez emphasized the role of the economy. “Knowing what’s going on with the economy, we’re not surprised at all that we would be receiving additional applications,” she said.
She added that the increase in applications means that decisions may come out later than usual, although they will certainly be released by April 1 at the latest. Despite the higher number of applicants, the Kennedy School does not plan to increase its class sizes.
The admissions committee selects students by rating each applicant on a scale of one to four in each of four categories: leadership, commitment to public service, academics, and a fourth category that includes special talent, extraordinary background, and diversity.
The application spike will certainly contribute to the selection of a more qualified and heterogeneous class, according to Michael P. Burke, the senior associate director of admissions.
MPP student Benjamin M. Polk said he thought the increase was important for the Kennedy School, “This is an unequivocally positive sign that the Kennedy School has made itself an unbelievably important institution,” he said.

Subscriptions to pornography Web sites are slightly more common in traditionally conservative “red states” than in more democratic “blue states,” a Harvard Business School study reported this week. Benjamin G. Edelman ’02, a professor at the Harvard Business School who conducted the study, found a statistically significant correlation between porn subscription rates and residency in states which have passed conservative legislation on sexuality. Higher subscription rates were also present in states in which people were likely to agree with statements such as, “I never doubt the existence of God.”While the study was originally published as a business analysis of the online market for pornography, it has quickly turned political.Martha “Martabel” Wasserman ’10, the editor-in-chief of H-Bomb—the campus sex magazine—said that the results of the study undermine the traditional conservative position.  “It shows that they’re hypocritical, and that we shouldn’t make pornography and sex work illegal, but should instead make conditions better for the sex workers,” she said.The New Scientist, a weekly science magazine, also ran an article about the study entitled, “Porn in the USA: Conservatives are biggest consumers.”  Despite the correlation between religion and pornography, Edelman downplayed over-politicizing his findings, instead putting an emphasis in his study on the more cautious conclusion that “there’s little sign of a major divide” in porn access across the U.S.  “There are strong correlations,” he said, “and yet you need to be careful about what that tells you. Maybe the liberal people in the conservative regions are getting their porn online rather than at retail because the conservative people have shut down the retail stores.”  Edelman said that he believes his study can offer ammunition for either side of the aisle.“There are facts here that are useful, on both sides,” he said. “To those who are upset about the spread of adult entertainment, I’ve got facts here showing that yes, adult entertainment is being used. On the other hand, I’ve got facts suggesting that, hey, maybe adult entertainment is not actually such a big deal; it seems like everyone is using it.”This isn’t the first time that Edelman’s academic pursuits have led him to the pornography industry.In his research today, he is interested in the adult entertainment industry as a surprisingly innovative, adaptive, and successful business model.  “It’s an interesting management question,” he said. “The adult entertainment industry doesn’t have the benefit of many managers with Harvard degrees or MBAs. Yet time and time again, this industry remains at the cutting edge of new technologies.”

Troubled financial institutions that recruit heavily from Harvard may soon face restrictions on hiring international students if they accepted federal bailout funding.Under a recently passed amendment to the federal stimulus bill, companies participating in the Troubled Assets Relief Program—a government financial-rescue plan implemented last fall—will face more restrictions in hiring H-1B visa holders, foreigners with at least a bachelor’s degree and “highly specialized knowledge” in a particular field.Firms affected by the amendment—including nearly all large investment banks—have consistently hired from Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School in past years, prompting Harvard’s lobbyists to push for a loose interpretation of the restrictions.Firms that have accepted TARP funds would be required to demonstrate that they have made concerted efforts to employ and avoid laying off U.S. citizens before hiring H-1B visa holders, said Kevin Casey, the University’s chief lobbyist.“It may be that employment horizons are slightly smaller for those graduating from some of these programs,” Casey said.Roughly one third of MBA candidates at the Business School are international students, and 45 percent of MBA students enter the financial services industry upon graduation.University Provost Steven E. Hyman recently voiced opposition to the restrictions in a letter to Congressman Michael E. Capuano, who represents Cambridge in the U.S. House. Hyman wrote last month that it was important to keep jobs open to all recent graduates, regardless of their country of origin.“Now more than ever, our country needs to capture the talents of our brightest graduates to work to turn around these troubled industries,” he wrote.Casey said the impact of the amendment on Harvard’s sizable international student body is still unclear, as the number of students employed by investment banks fluctuates every year.In addition, the restriction on H-1B visa holders may not apply to those who are hired while holding a student visa but later apply for an H-1B, Casey said, an interpretation Harvard officials are lobbying the Department of Labor to recommend.Kurt Piemonte, an associate director of career services at the Business School, wrote in an e-mailed statement that companies looking to pick up their newest recruits are “hopeful” that the statute will be interpreted in their favor, but remain in a state of limbo for the time being.“TARP recipient employers are rightly concerned that this new language is counterproductive to helping the United States and the world recover from the current economic crisis,” Piemonte wrote.—Staff writer Athena Y.

The two-year clock has started ticking, and $21.5 billion from Obama’s stimulus package must be spent on research and development before September 2010. The University, hoping to claim its share of the federal funds, is scrambling to prepare preliminary proposals as it awaits further Congressional guidance.University administrators have asked faculty to submit grant proposals so that once federal agencies give the green light on funding, researchers will be prepared to move ahead with projects.While Harvard researchers anxiously await further guidance from federal grant-giving agencies, central administration officials are working with faculty across the science schools to provide the most up-to-date information on University prospects for federal funding, Harvard’s chief lobbyist Kevin Casey said this week.“We’re not directing,” Casey said, pointing out that the bulk of federally funded projects are investigator-driven. “We’re a hub of information.”The stimulus package provides $10.4 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $3 billion for the National Science Foundation. But no agency has provided details on how stimulus funds will be spent, according to a memo distributed to Harvard faculty and administrators last month. The scale of the federal funding allotted for the sciences reflects the Obama administration’s understanding that university-based research plays an important role in driving long-term economic growth and development.Neither the NIH nor the NSF provided comment regarding the timeline for allocating the funds yesterday. The decision depends on further instruction from Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, an NSF spokesperson said.Last year, University President Drew G. Faust testified before a Senate committee in favor of bolstering the NIH budget. Faust argued at the time that the 13 percent loss in real dollars of NIH funding had “a cascading impact that [was] slowing progress and threatening future research that could lead to cures—and even ways to prevent disease.”Faced with a flat budget since 2003, the NIH suffered a backlog of research proposals, and the percentage of grant applications awarded dropped from 32 percent in 1999 to 24 percent in 2007.Now, with the injection of stimulus funds, the NIH may choose to fund projects waiting in the pipeline as well as finance new proposals, Casey said.The two-year window, however, is tight for new proposals to be submitted, approved, and undertaken, said the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Assistant Dean for Research Policy and Administration Dean R. Gallant ’72.“Certainly, it’s a faster rate of spending than we have had recently, so I can imagine that there would be some challenges,” Gallant said. NIH grants are usually funded over a period of three or four years.Gallant also said that added accountability could raise another hurdle.With President Obama’s emphasis on transparency in spending stimulus money, major recipients of federal funding will now be required to report how they are using their grants.“There are going to be more reporting requirements associated with the stimulus dollars than we may be used to,” Gallant said, adding that difficulties could arise because the disclosure process is a laborious process. And given the University’s tight budgets, Harvard is currently not hiring more staff to undertake the administrative work.—Staff writer Alexandra Perloff-Giles can be reached at aperloff@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer June Q.

The Dowling Report, a review charged with the task of considering student governance on campus, was released Monday to mixed reactions from past and present Undergraduate Council members. While some UC members called it a necessary first step for improving the council’s effectiveness and efficiency,  others called it an underwhelming follow-up to a landmark document of the same name that founded the UC.“It’s the report of another committee chair by John Dowling, but it’s not the successor to the Dowling Report,” said Eric N. Hysen ’11, the UC’s parliamentarian. “I was sort of hoping for something a little bit more.”Some members of the UC added that the review did not pay enough attention to student governance at the College as a whole, and disproportionately focused on details about the inner workings of the UC’s structure.Officially titled the “Report of the Committee to Review the Undergraduate Council,” the document prescribes relatively few recommendations that had been reached unanimously by the committee. Instead, the bulk of the 40-page report consists of an “open issues” section which describes the discussion points upon which the committee had not yet reached a consensus, in addition to an internal review produced by three UC members.Though the report did not bring closure to many long-standing debates about the UC’s structure, some conclusions were reached. In what is widely considered to be the most significant recommendation, the Dowling Report proposed restructuring the student-faculty committees.“On the issue of the student-faculty committee, that’s something [UC members] have all agreed on for a while and is something [the UC] should really push for,” said Tamar Holoshitz ’10, chair of the Student Affairs Committee.The change in the student-faculty committee structure suggested by the Dowling Report would be matched by a change in the structure of the UC’s advocacy body. Instead of simply having one advocacy committee, the SAC would be replaced by three committees to correspond with the three proposed student-faculty committees. Along with the changes that would provide a more hierarchical structure, student-faculty committee members would also be given decision-making power, subject to a veto by the Dean that chairs the committee.Changes to the structure of the Finance Committee were also proposed, including a reduction in the committee’s size and a rotating membership drawn from the three proposed advocacy committees.“I don’t see any real drawback to have a smaller committee,” said FiCom chair Sundeep S. Iyer ’11.However, several UC members pointed to the benefits of institutional memory, which would be lost if the membership constantly changed. “FiCom operates on a specific set of policies and requires a knowledge of our precedents,” Iyer said. “The only way to effectively know about grants would be through the experience of assessing grants on a week-to-week basis.”The Dowling Report also faces the same problems that it has been trying to correct: while the report has some firm recommendations, it has no legislative power and therefore depends on the efforts of people not involved in the committee’s affairs to implement it.To move forward, proposals in the report will have to be taken on by separate bodies: the UC, the administration, and the faculty.Judith H. Kidd, associate dean of the College and one of the ten members on the Dowling Committee, said her role will now be to encourage dialogue.“The role that I would play is to make sure that the conversation continues,” she said.Kidd advised that the UC open up discussion with the College.UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said she is currently scheduling meetings with “the appropriate Deans.”Many members of the executive board of the Council—including Flores—added that the UC needs to elicit student opinion on the matter before deciding its course of action.Anthony R. Britt ’10 added that the report needs to be made “understandable” and “digestible” for regular students.While members of the UC generally thought that it was important to address issues brought up in the report, some thought it was important to emphasize that the review would not be the Council’s sole focus for the semester.“The report is good, but it isn’t going to be the huge issue that defines the UC this semester,” said Hysen.—Staff writer Brittany M.

Being on a team whose veterans are nationally acclaimed and often recognized for excellence might seem daunting to an underclassman looking for her moment to shine.  But on the Harvard women’s hockey team, which is spoiled with talent, some people simply can’t help standing out.After a rocky start to the season, the Crimson finally found its footing, thanks to contributions not only from the upperclassmen, but a solid core of sophomores as well.  “I think they’re playing with a lot of confidence, and that’s what’s important at this time of year,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They’ve got a lot of energy, they’re dynamic players, and hopefully their contributions will continue through the playoffs.”Certain second-years have truly reached the potential that they flashed as rookies,  earning playing time during crucial minutes and having a hand in some of the Crimson’s most critical plays. Among the underclassmen, those who have most consistently delivered the goods are Leanna Coskren, Liza Ryabkina, Katharine Chute, and Kate Buesser.“Those four sophomores have definitely stepped it up for us this year,” tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt said. “At the beginning of the season [the captains] mentioned to them that they weren’t freshman anymore and that we were expecting a lot more from them, and we didn’t have to repeat that. They really took it seriously and they really [worked hard] right from the first practice and the first lift session.”Being freshmen on a team that enjoyed a near flawless record last year did not prepare the now-sophomores for the uphill battle that Harvard has faced this season.  It is a testament to their raw talent and unyielding determination that the young players have stepped up, not only assuming more responsibility in play, but excelling in doing so.“We came to realize that this team is a new team and we just have to find our strengths and work with it,” Buesser said. “I think that we have done that this year and our record has definitely shown that as of late.” The Crimson’s recent surge of success can largely be attributed to improvements in the defensive line.  Leading defenseman, Leanna Coskren, is a key player, appearing in 29 out of the 31 games so far this season, and collecting eight points in her career to date.   “Leanna is one of the top defense on our team right now, which is saying a lot [considering] that in the ECAC we are number one,” Vaillancourt said. “So she is one of the top defense in the ECAC, I would say.”The playoffs have seen Chute and Ryabkina also make their mark, most recently in the game against Cornell in which the duo dominated the third period, netting three goals between them.  Picking up impressive totals of 18 and 15 points this season, respectively, the frequency with which Chute and Ryabkina are called upon to perform in games is not surprising.  “Liza is the one that constantly stays on the ice after [practice] when I want to work on stuff and she will always stay with me and work on things to get better,” Vaillancourt said. “I think that has helped her tremendously throughout the season so far.” Vaillancourt’s praise for Ryabkina reflects well on the sophomore, who has developed her game in the same mold as that of her senior mentor.“I watch how [Vaillancourt] plays, and I try to pick out certain things that I wouldn’t be able to do,” Ryabkina said last November. “That’s the biggest thing, because she leads by example.” In the middle of the season, forward Katharine Chute won a spot on the first line with tri-captains Jenny Brine and Vaillancourt, after a series of notable game-changing performances.  These most recently include earning two assists against Clarkson, as well as notching two assists in the win against Cornell. “It’s a pretty big honor for a sophomore,” Vaillancourt said.  “But right from the first game that she played on the first line with us she was ready to go and just did what we told her to do and what the coaches told her to do.”Another key player on the sophomore roster, Buesser is most renowned for her unwavering dedication to the game.  While early on in the season Buesser struggled to put the puck in the net, practice has allowed her to perfect her shot. “Buesser is a player that will always give everything that she has in practice and in the lifting room and obviously in games,” Vaillancourt said. “In the second half of the season, she has been a really important player for us, scoring really important goals and making really important plays all over the ice.”This weekend, the Crimson faces its most important challenge of the season thus far in the final rounds of the ECAC Tournament. Harvard is counting on its second-year standouts to build on their outstanding play of late. If the sophomores continue to show how valuable they are to the current Crimson team’s efforts, they will also put themselves in a position to carry Harvard to future success.“I have no doubt in my mind that they will turn into really good leaders and will keep Harvard hockey the same way it’s been for the past 25 or 30 years,” Vaillancourt said.

For 17 years, Scott Swanay ’87 made a living predicting the future.No, the tools of his trade weren’t decks of cards, crystal balls, or maps of stars and constellations.Swanay worked as an actuary for insurance companies, and armed with spreadsheets, formulas, and a degree from Harvard in applied mathematics and computer science, it was his job to analyze what had already happened in order to figure out what was to come.Then, in 2004, everything changed when Swanay was laid off for the second time in his career as a result of a corporate merger. Contemplating his next move, he felt a sense of disillusionment with the path he had chosen.“I had always gotten stellar performance reviews,” Swanay says. “I still had my parents’ generation’s mindset that if you work hard and do well people are always going to appreciate you and reward you. But life was different than that.”Realizing that a change of course was in order, Swanay turned to his first love—baseball—for a push in the right direction.Having grown up in New York in the 1970’s, Swanay fondly recalls memories of his early trips to Yankee Stadium, where he watched childhood idols like Thurman Munson, Bobby Murcer, and—Swanay’s personal favorite—Cliff Johnson play ball during the tumultuous yet exhilarating “Bronx Zoo” era in Yankees’ history.As Swanay’s passion for baseball developed, so did his fascination with numbers.“Like many kids, I taught myself division by figuring out batting averages,” Swanay says. “I was always keeping track of baseball stats or political delegate counts. If there was a way to track something with numbers I was doing it.”It should come as no surprise, then, that after Swanay was let go in 2004, he found solace through a medium in which he could combine his two biggest interests: fantasy baseball.The Average Fantasy Joe puts together a league with his buddies and picks up players whose names he recognizes or who have done well for his favorite team. But Swanay—with nearly two decades as an actuary under his belt and a deep reservoir of baseball knowledge—had no intentions of being average. When Swanay began playing fantasy baseball, he didn’t rely on gut instinct or subjective judgments to form his teams. He plugged countless numbers into spreadsheets, using advanced quantitative methods to value players and to create rankings that would allow him to objectively put together the best team possible. As Swanay started having success in fantasy leagues, he realized that what he had thought of as a hobby was actually the key to the career change he had been seeking.“I finally got over that mental hurdle [that tells you] if you’ve been doing something so long, you can’t go in another direction,” Swanay says. “I wasn’t going to reach my potential unless I made a change.”So a change was made, and Swanay now operates a growing fantasy baseball advice website called FantasyBaseballSherpa.com (along with a pigskin counterpart, FantasyFootballSherpa.com).Swanay’s site uses statistical analysis to predict players’ performances for upcoming seasons and rank the players accordingly. Subscribers can then reference these rankings as they draft their fantasy squads.Other sites offer similar services, but Swanay has taken measures to distinguish himself from the competition. For example, one feature of his site is a forecasting system that continues to adjust and make new predictions throughout the season, instead of making one prediction of a player’s performance for a season at the beginning of the year. He also has created a model to quantify position scarcity, or the idea that there are more players of high fantasy value that play certain positions (like first base) than others (like shortstop).“I quantify stuff that a lot of other people just guess at,” Swanay says.This quantitative approach continues to gain popularity in fantasy circles, but it has also pervaded the thinking of front offices in professional baseball, along with other sports.More and more, general managers supplement the advice of scouts with computer-generated projections and analysis. The trend has sparked resistance from old-school hardliners who contend that the statistical approach takes away from the human side of sports.“That’s really the big thing that emerged in the past few years,” says Jason Rosenfeld, Co-President of the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective (HSAC). “You have people with a computer figuring out something and giving an answer and people like scouts giving an answer and it might conflict. [The scouts will say] you don’t know what you’re talking about, you never played.”But Rosenfeld believes that thinking about sports quantitatively simply adds a new perspective.“It’s really just people who love the game like everyone else but are trying to add a factor in there to add an edge,” he says.And to those who claim that focusing so intently on statistical analysis detracts from the more lyrical aspects of athletics, Harvard Professor of Statistics and Faculty Advisor to HSAC Carl Morris provides a response.“I feel that a lot of people feel passion about sports because of the statistics,” Morris says. “All these numbers tell stories.”For proponents of the quantitative approach to sports, finding new numbers to tell those stories with is the goal that they constantly strive to reach. And for people like Swanay, Rosenfeld, and Morris, the growing demand for sports statistical analysis ensures that they can use the their abilities with numbers to explain the games they love.“It was liberating that I had accumulated skills that I could use in the sports world,” Swanay says. “Plus, I was much more passionate about sports than I was about insurance.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

Dear Hillel Community,
Hillel is in a budget crisis.
So began an e-mail plea sent over the Hillel-Undergrad list last week for the organization's leaders to reevaluate talk of getting rid of some of Hillel's rabbis.
Rumors of such budget cuts have been circulating since early January. But when asked at the time if Hillel was considering the possibility of letting rabbis go, Hillel Executive Director Bernie Steinberg denied such talk in an interview with The Crimson.
"The rabbi thing is absolutely false," he said. "Absolutely false. We're looking very seriously into hiring a rabbi."
Well then. Mazel tov?
Let's just hope they spare the Manischewitz.

You know “that guy” from section? Imagine an entire class full of 120 “that guys.” That class is Gov 1300, David King’s notorious Congressional simulation. I would know. I'm in it.
When these kids watch Meet The Press, they don’t see politicians. They see career options.
And why just day dream of Sunday Mornings with George Stephanopolous? Take King’s class, and you too can revel in being called “Congressman.”  Committees meet and heatedly discuss legislation. Ambitious legislators run for leadership positions. Almost everything is the same as being a real member of Congress. Except, instead of being an actual elected official, you’re a tool.
But let’s give credit where credit is due.  One legislator has taken his fake responsibility to provide fake services to his fake constituents in California with unparalleled humility. According to the press release from his “office” Representative Jonathan Padilla D-California Winthrop has launched a website in order to “help inform my constituents about what I’m doing in Congress and how they can get involved in helping to make America a better place”

Last night's "Witness" event in Memorial Church--meant to celebrate the intersection of the arts, humanities, and human rights--featured Toni Morrison reading from her 2008 novel, A Mercy. But Princeton's Nobel Laureate didn't join in the dancing (more on that after the jump.) Morrison, who recently turned 78, read from her wheelchair.
"Sorry for all the theatrics," she told the audience grimly. "It's called sciatica, but what it really is, is decay.
"Witness, was serious and elegant, but it had an unexpected introduction: the sound of 1,000 people assuming the first position.
Ballet superstar and Kennedy School grad Damian Woetzel led the audience in the opening few movements of a Balanchine classic. There was, as Wotezel described it, the "shield your eyes against the sun" gesture, the "I have a headache gesture," and then the sound of a churchfull of winter boots sweaking against the floor: heels together, toes apart--ballet's first position.

Oh, selecting a house t-shirt...few activities can so effectively divide a House while trying to bring it together.  It's nearly the peak of shirt season, so we would like to share our picks of the winners and losers so far:
The Jerry Bruckheimer Award for "Same S***, Different Day"


This has to go to Dunster, which picked a tweaked Coke logo over a fairly inspired "The Office" shirt (Dunster Mifflin).   C'mon, guys—as one poster said:
Word to that. Granted, the writer actually was supporting a different shirt, but criticism is a universal language (more of that after the jump).
The Van Gogh Award for Tortured Artistry and Self-Loathing
The Winthrop House shirt, which features a "Lion King" inspired play on words ("Oh I just can't wait...to move in") is pretty weak.  What makes it even more weak is that the artist who made it thinks it's weak.
That's right, the designer of the t-shirt—who also happens to be Crimson Business Manager, and claims the idea was his roommate's—voted against his own shirt, and was heard expressing sentiments too vulgar for print upon learning of his victory in the design derby.
That's how you know your t-shirt is really bad—when the guy who designed it thinks it is.  It's almost meta.
The Beatrix Potter Award for Impressive, if Childish, Illustration
This is probably the coolest design from an artistic perspective ("Where the Wild Things Are"), but we don't really see the Mather connection. Last we heard, the Wild Things (roaches, obvi) made their home mostly in Lowell and Winthrop. Maybe those stalwart creatures have finally found a way to live in solid concrete.
Mather, surprisingly, has so much house spirit that residents are clamoring for prints of the runners-up—including one celebrating "34 years of Soviet Bloc Housing" in "Mathergrad." Rock on, Commies.
