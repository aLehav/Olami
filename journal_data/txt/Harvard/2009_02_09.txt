After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Black Students Association kicked off Black History Month Friday with its fourth annual Crimson & Black Banquet in Kirkland House, honoring CNN political correspondent Soledad M. O’Brien ’88.Entitled “The Good Fight: Champions and Political Change,” the banquet celebrated student public service initiatives and political efforts surrounding the campaign and inauguration of president Barack Obama.“This time we were history. This time we changed history,” said George J. J. Hayward ’11, the BSA’s political action chair, who is also a Crimson editorial editor, speaking of the Obama presidency.Group by group, each student organization in attendance recounted its political involvement from the past year—a list of engagements that included phone banks, weekend canvassing trips to New Hampshire, voter registration drives in Dorchester, and fundraising for the Obama campaign.“Change starts at the bottom and trickles its way up,” Hayward said. There was also great excitement surrounding the Harvard chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was reactivated by students from across the University on Wednesday night. Jarell L. Lee ’10 emphasized the enormous impact that the Harvard NAACP could have on the larger Boston and Cambridge areas.“We have made progress, but our communities are still plagued by dilapidated schools with teachers who do not care, jobs that do not pay enough and a host of other issues,” Lee said. “There is still work to be done, but we must get up and do it.”With performances by the Kuumba Brothers and Sisters, the banquet also focused on striking a “healthy balance between art and activism,” according to Matthews K. Mmopi ’11, the business manager of Kuumba. This year, Kuumba collaborated with the Brattleboro Area Hospice in Vermont, raised over $15 thousand for charity, and established a pen pal program with children in South Africa.At the conclusion of the student program, the BSA presented The Cecilia Ekperi Scholarship Award, an honor commemorating Cecilia C. Ekperi ’09, a leader of Harvard’s black community who died in 2006.This year’s recipient was Tineisha A. Lozanne, a junior at New Mission High School in Roxbury. Lozanne, who excels both academically and athletically, has her sights set on Harvard, due to dedicated mentorship from Harvard students.    “My mentor has taught me so much about how to prioritize, stay on track, and prepare for college,” Lozanne said.—Staff writer Courtney P.

Soledad M. O’Brien ’88 is the host of the CNN Special Investigations Unit and anchored the July, 2008 CNN special, “Black in America.” Of Afro-Cuban descent, O’Brien is a member of both the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Prior to her keynote address at the Black & Crimson Banquet, O’Brien spoke with The Crimson by phone about her career as a journalist and her undergraduate years at Harvard.The Harvard Crimson: How does the election of Barack Obama fit into the narrative of “Black in America?”Soledad O’Brien: He wasn’t the story and he has never been the story of “Black in America.” He is one part of the story... he is yet another milestone along a road of progress for African Americans. THC: Do you have a favorite  course or professor at Harvard?SO: Roland Fryer, a professor at Harvard, has become a very good friend of mine. I’m a big fan of his work. I probably spend more time, as a grown-up alum, thinking about courses and coursework because a lot of stories come right from Harvard professors.THC: As a journalist, how was this political season?SO: As a journalist, it was the gift that kept giving because every step of the way it was an interesting story, from the primaries to the election,  into the inauguration and the first 100 days.THC: Did you find a particular niche within the Harvard community? SO: I did a lot of sports and intramurals. I played on the rugby team. I did a lot of work in the government of my House. I did a lot of public service. I never felt you could define who I was with one word.THC: At Harvard, did you ever feel torn between the black and Hispanic communities?SO: Never—the reason not to join was never the identity issues or concerns or conflicts.... I grew up in an all-white neighborhood and so the story of my life was always navigating both worlds very easily. THC: Did you have a favorite final club?SO: My husband was in the A.D., so I probably hung out there a little bit. I wouldn’t say that I had a favorite. I do remember people in the A.D. sledding on cushions down that big stairwell.THC: Do you have any advice for students?SO: Use the Malkin Athletic Center. They were building that while I was there, and it’s fabulous. Take advantage of all the speakers that come and freebies that you get on campus... You don’t really get those opportunities outside of a great institution like Harvard.—Staff writer Courtney P. Yadoo can be reached at cyadoo@fas.harvard.edu.

Responding to a growing concern with the way universities invest their money, Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement and Yale’s Responsible Endowment Project co-hosted a two-day Responsible Endowment Conference in Cambridge this weekend with the aim of demystifying university fund management. The conference, which was also attended by Wellesley and Bowdoin students, included presentations from students from both organizing schools, Harvard faculty, and several individuals who work in the field of responsible investing. “It became very clear early on that there was a lot of interest in endowments, even before the economic collapse,” said conference organizer Jonathan F. Bowman ’11. The Harvard and Yale student groups that co-hosted the conference first connected through a nationwide campaign against investment in HEI Hotels and Resorts, a private equity company that buys and sells hotels. The company—which faces ongoing labor disputes for mistreatment of its workers—draws 80 percent of its funding from endowments, including those of Harvard and Yale.“HEI is a piece of evidence, but the broader picture is responsibility for the whole endowment. [Bowman] put together this conference with some help from us basically to just train students in research methods,” said REP co-founder Hans J. Schoenburg. “We focused on transparency, or the lack thereof, around university endowments.”Bowman called Boston “the epicenter” of socially responsible investing firms in America. “There was a huge need, coupled with a lack of understanding, coupled with a huge amount of expertise available in Boston,” he said. “These factors provided ripe conditions for a conference here at Harvard.”The conference began in Boylston Hall on Saturday afternoon and continued throughout the weekend. Between 40 and 50 students from the four schools were in attendance, organizers said. “I think the most inspiring thing is seeing how much participation there is from other schools,” said Bowman. “When you’ve got kids from four different colleges all coming together and sharing, you really can see that the interest in endowments and investing responsibly is a broad, broad movement.”The conference represented a “new kind of activism coming to Harvard,”  said SLAM member Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09.“Even though our endowment is currently down, the way to rebuild is to make new investments, and it’s really important to make sure that Harvard does that as responsibly as it can,” she said.—Staff writer Evan T.R.

Economics professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61, President of the Harvard Board of Overseers Roger W. Ferguson Jr. ’73, and Penny S. Pritzker ’81, a former Overseer, were named as advisors to president Barack Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board in a press conference held in Washington on Friday.Feldstein, a former Reagan administration economist, served as President of the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1977 to 2008. NBER studies the U.S. economy and is the well-respected authority on markers of recessions. Ferguson was the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1999 to 2006 and is currently serving in his final year as a member of the University’s governing body. Pritzker, an heiress to the Hyatt dynasty, is the founder and CEO of Hyatt Classic Residence, and was named as one of the wealthiest people in the United States by Forbes Magazine. Pritzker served on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body, for a six-year term that began in 2002.The Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which Obama first announced in Nov. 2008, will be headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. Volcker’s supporting cast is a collection of premier economists from academia and Washington, as well as wealthy Wall Street representatives.“We’re tapping a broad and diverse range of opinion from across the country, because an historic crisis demands an historic response,” Obama said according to a posted transcript of the Friday press conference.Feldstein will maintain his Harvard teaching duties while advising the president.He is one of several board members whose economic views may conflict with dominant policy-makers in the Democratic administration.“Not everyone is going to agree with each other, and not all of them are going to agree with me—and that’s precisely the point,” said Obama, according to his transcribed remarks.Feldstein also serves as a director of American International Group, an international insurance company which received billions in government funding from the TARP bailout approved by Congress last summer.—Staff writer Elyssa A.

With a burst of firecrackers and a platter of fried rangoons, Harvard Square rang in the Year of the Ox yesterday.A group of about 50 people—accompanied by two multi-colored lions who performed a traditional lion dance—paraded from Winthrop Park on JFK St. to the Hong Kong Restaurant on Mass. Ave.The advent of the Chinese lunar calendar came on Jan. 26, but the celebration typically continues for about a week. The event was organized by the Hong Kong Restaurant and the Harvard Square Business Association.After the procession, families piled into the Kong for food, Chinese-themed arts and crafts, and a puppet show. This year marks the third year that the HSBA has partnered with the Kong for a Chinese New Year parade and celebration—although the Kong has been sponsoring the lion dance, performed by the Wah Lum Kung Fu Association, since 1986.Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the HSBA, described the partnership with the Kong as a means of “exploring the cultural heritage in Harvard Square.”“We bring in people from communities all around who are not necessarily Chinese or Asian but love the idea of exploring these cultures,” Jillson said. Among the procession of parade-goers were many families eager to expose their children to Chinese culture.Kristen Sopko, a resident of Waltham Mass., came with her four-year-old daughter Katherine, who sat on her father’s shoulders to get a better view of the festivities.“We only read about it or saw it on TV,” Sopko said. “We want to get her used to different things.”This year marks the Kong’s 54th birthday. The family-run business is currently managed by the children of Sen and Buoy Lee, who opened the restaurant in 1954. In an interview yesterday, Buoy Lee, who is no longer directly involved in the business’ daily affairs, recalled when she and her husband did all the cooking and washing in the business’ early days. When asked how her family celebrated the Chinese New Year in the past, Lee said it was always the “same thing”: an early closing and a party for the staff.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

In response to guidance from the University, several of Harvard’s schools are planning for a decline in endowment income for the next fiscal year, according to University administrators interviewed this weekend.Earlier expectations had been for a flat payout—or the same dollar amount in endowment income as last year—a School of Public Health spokesperson wrote in an e-mail.The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board, has yet to set next year’s endowment payout rate—a figure generally announced in December—leaving schools to plan their budgets without definitive numbers while decisionmakers attempt to get a better idea of market conditions.Though the Corporation is meeting today, University administrators declined to discuss the topics on the agenda this weekend.In the meantime, schools are taking various approaches to prepare their budgets, which are generally due in April, despite the uncertainty over payout.The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is planning for budget scenarios ranging from a flat payout to a five percent decrease, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith. A five percent reduction in endowment income would translate into an $80 million decline for the entire University from the $1.6 billion paid out last year.Harvard officials have projected a 30 percent decrease in the endowment from its June 2008 value of $36.9 billion. Even with a five percent decline in spending, the payout rate would be nearly 5.9 percent—a number that would be the University’s highest in over 20 years.Similarly, the School of Public Health is now expecting a two percent reduction in endowment income for the coming year, the school’s dean Julio Frenk wrote in an e-mail to faculty and staff on Friday.In an effort to meet the challenges posed by the financial crisis, Frenk wrote that the University had also issued a directive in December to freeze all salaries for faculty and non-union staff.In line with the University’s recommendations, the School of Public Health will form a committee to review the posting of non-research funded job posts.“This is indeed an opportunity to look at our staffing levels and structures, in order to make sure that they are as efficient and productive as possible,” Frenk wrote.Approximately 35 percent of the University’s operating budget is dependent on income from the endowment, though certain schools rely more heavily on this income stream than others.The School of Public Health relies on the endowment for only 13 percent of its spending needs, but the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, at the other end of the spectrum, receives 83 percent of its budget from the endowment. The Divinity School—which receives 71 percent of its budget from the endowment—has planned more extensive belt-tightening measures than many of its peers.The school will cut its annual budget by four to eight percent and is already “reducing sharply” the number of visiting and adjunct professors, according to a letter from Dean William A. Graham to the community late last month.—Staff writer Athena Y. Jiang can be reached at ajiang@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard’s plans to launch a long-delayed capital campaign are once again in limbo, even though alumni donations have held largely steady through the current financial crisis, the University’s chief fundraiser suggested in an interview Friday.
Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 cited economic uncertainties in declining to give any current schedule for the campaign, marking a departure from this fall when she said the campaign would have a tentative 2011 launch date.
“Given the present economic situation, I cannot speculate on the timing of a campaign,” Rogers said Friday.
Despite the unprecedented financial crisis, recent fundraising has been relatively stable, with gift receipts from December falling just two percent relative to the same month in 2007, according to Rogers. The University received $651 million in gifts, the second largest haul in Harvard’s history, over the last fiscal year, which ended in June.
The comparative monthly figures come at a time of financial uncertainty, as the University struggles to right itself from a projected 30 percent loss in endowment value.
“This is quite good,” Rogers said, “though I cannot predict whether these results will hold for the rest of the year.”
The relatively strong fundraising figures may not yet reflect the full impact of the economic downturn—there is often a significant lag between economic trends and changes in giving.
Harvard’s last capital campaign, which ended in 1999, raised a record-breaking $2.6 billion ($3.3 billion in today’s dollars)—then the largest total in the history of higher education. The University had intended to gear up for another campaign with a 2006 or 2007 launch date, but the 2006 resignation of then-University President Lawrence H. Summers forced Harvard to put a temporary hold on its plans, at least until a new president had been chosen.
The campaign was further delayed when University President Drew G. Faust entered Mass. Hall with several school leadership positions vacant, complicating an immediate start to campaign planning, which requires top administrators to provide input on long-term strategic initiatives both at their schools and across the University.
Faust has since filled nearly all leadership positions across the University, including deanships at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Medical School.
Currently, only the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has yet to find a permanent dean, though Harvard Law School appears likely to need a replacement for Dean Elena Kagan, who may soon be confirmed as U.S. Solicitor General.
While the University has not decided upon a definitive start date for the next capital campaign, Rogers said that the University will “continue to prepare,” and has appointed a director for the project.
Real estate mogul and major donor Peter L. Malkin ’55 wrote in an e-mail yesterday that he was not surprised by donors’ “extraordinary demonstration of loyalty” to Harvard in tough financial times.
“My guess is that some alumni are ‘stretching’ to complement the reduced capacity of others to give,” Malkin wrote.

Harvard Management Company—the investment group charged with managing the University’s endowment—announced Friday that it will reduce staff levels by roughly 25 percent in the coming months.In an effort to “re-balance and re-engineer the organization,” reductions will include investment professionals as well as “back office” and support personnel, according to University spokesman John D. Longbrake.HMC—which currently employs more than 200 people—has faced heightened scrutiny in recent months as University officials prepare for a projected 30 percent decline in the endowment for the year ending June 30.Harvard’s endowment, valued at almost $37 billion last June, was reported to have lost over $8 billion—or roughly 22 percent—by the end of October. But other market indices posted even worse returns, with the S&P 500 falling 24.6 percent in the same period.HMC chief executive Jane L. Mendillo wrote in a statement that an analysis conducted by the firm’s management team to evaluate the size and structure of the company in light of current market conditions had concluded that “the time was right for a significant rebalancing of our staff and our functions.”But she added that the analysis was conducted more as a standard procedure than as a response to unprecedented losses in the endowment.“This type of thinking and rebalancing is done, and should be done, continuously, in organizations that are and that want to stay at the top of their field, through all kinds of market cycles and economic conditions,” she wrote.Because of the recent losses in the endowment, HMC has drawn renewed criticism from some alumni, who called for the University to withdraw the multi-million dollar bonuses paid to top managers in a letter to University President Drew G. Faust. Former endowment chief Mohamed A. El-Erian and his five highest-paid associates received a total of $26.8 million in compensation for the year ending last June. In 2003, the same group of alumni from the College’s class of 1969 led a charge to reduce what they saw as exorbitant compensation, ultimately contributing to the departure of several top HMC managers including long-time CEO Jack R. Meyer. The alumni had also voiced concerns about the cost-effectiveness of HMC’s reliance on expensive internal investment managers, arguing that schools like Yale outsource most of their endowment work to hedge funds and external firms and achieve comparable returns.According to Longbrake, external firms now manage roughly 70 percent of Harvard’s endowment—a marked increase from only a few years earlier. When Meyer left Harvard in 2005 to start his own hedge fund—taking with him 30 employees, four top managers, and $500 million in start-up cash from HMC—the University had half its endowment under outside management. Mendillo—a 15-year veteran of HMC and the former manager of Wellesley College’s endowment—wrote that Harvard had no plans to change the current allocations, which had been in place before her tenure began in July.“The business model at HMC—the internal platform combined with a selectively chosen external set—is the right one for our future,” she wrote.—Staff writer Peter F.

Bleary-eyed students reaching for a midnight snack in Lamont Library may have more pressing concerns than assignments and deadlines: as late as last Thursday, the library’s café still stocked nutrition bars that had been recalled during a nation-wide salmonella outbreak. Clif Bar & Company announced a voluntary recall of various CLIF and LUNA bars on Jan. 30, citing “concerns that the recalled bars contain peanut products that were manufactured by Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), which is the focus of an ongoing Salmonella investigation.”  Clif’s Web site lists Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch bars with sell-by dates between Oct. 9, 2008 and Dec. 31, 2009 as one of their recalled selections. Bars of that variety with a sell-by date of July 25, 2009—well within the affected date range—remained on Lamont café shelves last Thursday.“It’s kind of disturbing,” said Iram A. Nadroo, a second year Divinity School student who says that she often sees students buying food from the café. Harvard University Dining Services spokeswoman Crista Martin said that HUDS, which counts Lamont Library cafe among its retail dining locations, uses a “sophisticated system of notification” to receive information from the Food and Drug Administration and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health about the ever-expanding list of recalled products. Martin also stated that HUDS “continuously checks” that none of the items are offered by the University. “In the case of CLIF bars, we immediately contacted every operation and told them to pull them off the shelves,” Martin said.  But the implicated CLIF bar was still stocked at Lamont on Thursday Feb. 5—six days after Clif’s press release on Jan. 30. Martin initially said she was unsure whether any HUDS-offered product was even affected by the recall. “I know that we stocked Clif bars, but frankly, I don’t know if we even had the implicated flavors,” she said. Later on, Martin confirmed that Lamont had indeed offered the tainted bars, and said that the box had probably been mixed up in the store room.  She said that multiple recalled CLIF bars had been sold to students, but that the rest of the stock had been thrown away. “In theory they had all been removed,” she said, calling the Lamont Library instance an “unfortunate mistake.”Martin said that students could return the recalled bars to any of HUDS’ retail dining locations, where they would be refunded for purchase price. David S. Rosenthal, the director of University Health Services, said he was “surprised and disappointed” that HUDS had missed some of the recalled items. “People need to be cautious about eating peanut products at the present time,” he said. According to Rosenthal, UHS has not yet seen any cases of salmonella poisoning attributed to peanut butter.Harvard first saw the effects of the salmonella outbreak in mid-January, when vending machines had to be restocked after the recall of Austin brand peanut butter crackers. Martin said that residential dining has been “impacted very little” by the salmonella outbreak since the peanut butter available in dining halls was not implicated in the outbreak. —Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

University President Drew G. Faust clarified plans for making the arts more prominent on campus at this weekend’s “Passion for the Arts,” a two-day career showcase event that she said was the first large-scale event Harvard has hosted to encourage careers in the arts and humanities.Speakers during the two-day career showcase event included famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and Harvard Law School Professor Noah R. Feldman ’92, both of whom joined Faust in arguing for the importance of an education in the arts and humanities—a focus that Faust has repeatedly stressed over the first year and a half of her presidency.The event represented a collaborative effort spanning various sectors of the University, from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Dean of Arts and Humanities to the Office of Career Services.In her speech on Friday evening, Faust announced the actions the University plans to take towards fulfillment of the recommendations made in December by the Task Force on the Arts, a committee that she commissioned in the first months of her presidency.The Task Force’s report called for increased art production in the curriculum and a greater presence for art on campus.“Arts abound at Harvard,” Faust said, noting that nearly half of all extracurricular activities at the University are dedicated to the arts. But she said that Harvard has separated art production from theory and criticism for too long. “It is time to recognize that arts practice and performance contribute to knowledge and learning as much as any other intellectual inquiry,” she said.Faust acknowledged that the Task Force report “has not appeared at the most propitious of times,” given the effects of a current financial downturn that has constricted University coffers. Harvard’s endowment fell 22 percent—or roughly $8 billion—in the four months prior to Nov. 1, and is projected to fall 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.While the Task Force’s report will need to be subject to some financial concessions, Faust said, Harvard is making “a small beginning” to ensure that the University capitalizes on the report’s momentum.Faust did not mention increasing investments in physical spaces for arts creation and collaboration—one of the Task Force’s major recommendations—but announced that the administration is moving forward with other Task Force goals.Following the Task Force’s emphasis on the need for art in the curriculum, Faust said that her goal is to offer at least five General Education courses and five freshman seminars next year that involve arts practice. The History of Art and Architecture concentration is planning a new track for students interested in architecture, with courses on design as well as the theory and practice of urban planning.She also said that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will begin to explore an undergraduate concentration in the dramatic arts and that the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will look into how a graduate Master of Fine Arts programs might be created. In addition, Harvard students will now have free admission to Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Institute of Contemporary Art, in addition to the Museum of Fine Arts, which is already free for students. Task Force leader and English Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt said on Friday evening that while he did not expect Task Force recommendations to go forward unhindered by financial troubles, he is pleased that “the University has decided that it will actually embrace this opportunity and move forward.”Faust’s announcements were greeted with frequent applause, but not all audience members were satisfied. In a question-and-answer session on Friday, one student asked why video and new media were neglected in the Task Force’s report. Another audience member asked why the report paid little attention to the Graduate School of Education’s “Arts in Education” program.Others were ready to give Faust credit for improving the arts’ profile on campus. According to Office of Career Services Interim Director Robin Mount, the OCS is diversifying its programming to place less weight on finance and consulting. Mount said that Faust’s influence helped spur the changes.—Staff writer Alex M. McLeese can be reached at amcleese@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s basketball team pulled out a hard fought 70-63 win at Yale (9-11, 2-4) on Friday, in a game marked by a tough Crimson comeback. Harvard (12-7, 4-1) trailed the Bulldogs in the first half, but mounted an aggressive second half attack to walk away with the win. Sophomore Jackie Alemany had a career game off the bench, spearheading the comeback.“It was a fight out there,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Yale is really good at playing up the rivalry.”The game saw three Crimson players in double-digit scoring, including Alemany, who posted 13 points. Senior Emily Tay led the team with 19 points and five assists, followed by freshman Brogan Berry who tallied 18 points. Along with contributing to the point total, Alemany led the Crimson’s defensive efforts with a career-high six steals and seven rebounds. Harvard came out of the locker room aggressively, taking a 4-2 lead off a Berry jumper only two and a half minutes into the game. Yale was relentless as it went on an 8-0 run to take a 10-4 lead two minutes later. A jumper from Tay, followed by a pair of Berry free throws, brought the score to 10-8. The Bulldogs created an eight-point margin, with 10 minutes remaining. The Crimson tallied six straight points to cut the lead to 24-22. Yale quickly responded with a 10-2 run in a minute and a half to make it 34-24 with 5:38 remaining.“They were really aggressive defensively,” Tay said. “They made it pretty hard to get shots off and hurt our three-point shooting.”Alemany kicked off the five-minute comeback with a mid-range jumper. She then found Emma Markley open in the paint for an easy two points. Still on a run, Alemany intercepted a Yale pass to retain Crimson possession. Tay and Berry capped the comeback with two free throws to tie the score at 34-34. Harvard took the lead off a Tay free throw. The Bulldogs tallied only one point in the final 5:12 of the first half. Harvard dropped two more jumpers to close out a 15-1 run and head to the locker room with a 39-25 advantage. “They took away our three-point shot,” Smith said. “But we were still able to take it the basket and adjust to their defense.”The Crimson shot 50 percent from the field during the first half, outshooting the Bulldogs, who hit 42.9 percent. Tay posted 15 points for the half, while Alemany tallied six in eight minutes of action.Harvard looked to hold onto its lead in the second half, immediately scoring four points in the beginning of the half. Berry then stole an inbound pass for another jumper to make the score 43-35 in the first minute and a half. Yale managed to close the margin to 47-43 with 14 minutes left. Alemany tallied six points, allowing Harvard to take a 57-47 lead with 10 minutes remaining.“There were a couple moments where we thought we could pull away, but they kept with us,” Tay said. The Bulldogs managed to pull within 57-51, but Harvard held on to the six-point lead with a quick layup. Yale dropped a three-pointer to make it a three-point game, but two free throws from sophomore Claire Wheeler increased Harvard’s lead to 63-58. The Bulldogs then tallied a bucket and two free throws to make it a one-point game at 63-62.  Harvard made 7-of-8 from the charity stripe in a 45 second span. With the score at 68-63, The Crimson denied Yale a field goal in the last 4:27 and prevented them from scoring for three minutes and 26 seconds.“We try to treat every ivy game the same,” Smith said. “You can’t predict outcomes or what teams can do.”The Crimson shot 45.1 percent from the field and 72.7 percent from the free-throw line, while Yale went 42.9 percent from the field and 73.7 percent from the charity stripe. Harvard won the battle on the glass, outrebounding the Bulldogs 34-32. —Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at kendall@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coach Jason Saretsky pumped his fist into the air with satisfaction as he watched the last member of his 4x400 relay team sprint across the finish line. Immediately, chants of “Crimson” and “Number One!” were heard from both the track and the stands, as athletes and spectators alike made their approval loud and clear after realizing that the men’s track team had just pulled off an upset in nail-biting fashion. Such was the atmosphere on Saturday afternoon at Gordon Indoor Track, as the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams participated in the second annual Battle of Beantown meet, finishing first and second, respectively, against competitors from Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern.“I’m really, really excited,” Saretsky said. “It was another good step for our program. On the women’s side, we really gave Boston College a good run for their money. As for the men, the fact that we started off last but finished first says it all.”“It was an awesome meet overall,” junior Chas Gillespie said. “So many people scored points and stepped up.”The men’s team, just a half a point behind Northeastern going into the final event, captured the Beanpot trophy with a dominant race in the 4x400 relay. All eyes were on the foursome of freshman John Dingus, junior Justin Grinstead, freshman Jonathan Meminger and senior Derek Jones, and they didn’t disappoint, setting a new meet record with a time of 3:19.18.“I was feeling pretty good about our guys [going into the final race],” Saretsky said. “We had Jon Dingus, who was the record holder at his school in the 400, running off as a leadoff leg. Those other guys just did a great job.”“We just needed to beat Northeastern in order to win but to do it in a dominant fashion and to win the meet was a great note to end on,” he added.While the 4x400 relay was clearly the defining event of the day, it was the men’s 3000-meter race that really gave the Crimson the momentum it needed to win. “We knew that was going to be a big event for us where we can score a lot of points,” Saretsky said.“You could tell that after that event, the momentum really started to shift, and we started to believe that we could win this thing.”Gillespie and freshmen Stephen Couch and Dan Stiles finished 1-2-3, earning a crucial 24 points for Harvard.“Coach said that we could be top three, and that the race would be decided in the last 800 meters,” Gillepsie said. “So we just had to be there and get ready to go.”Other notable events in the men’s events were the mile, 1000-meter, and weight throw. Dan Chenoweth continued his strong sophomore campaign, winning the mile with a meet-record time of 4:13.23. Freshman Darcy Wilson also stepped up for the Crimson by winning his first event of his career in the 1000 meter, clocking in at 2:29.83. It was also important for Harvard to place well in what Saretsky called the “bread and butter” event for the men. The Crimson finished consistently and placed a solid second, third, and fourth place in the event, with junior Jack Brady throwing a personal best of 16.71 meters.  The women’s team also had an impressive showing over the weekend, finishing only 11 points behind champion Boston College. Overall, the Crimson set seven ECAC qualifying marks and won a total of six events. One of those events was the 800-meter run, in which sophomore Hilary May blazed to a first-place finish with an NCAA-qualifying time of 2:08.70. “Hillary has had a great indoor season,” Saretsky said. “She really spent the summer committed to training. As a result, she has continued to gain strength and confidence.”Senior captain Becky Christenson—who just last week earned an automatic bid to the NCAA championships in high jump with a personal best of 1.86 meters—continued to dominate, clearing 1.75 meters. “Becky is, well, Becky,” Saretsky said. “She’s just a great competitor, always gives it her all, and never gets too high or low.”Sophomore Claire Richardson, a standout in cross country as well as track, and freshman Kailyn Kuzmuk also fared well in the meet. The duo finished first and third, respectively, at 4:50.30 and 4:54.37, both ECAC qualifying times. Harvard hopes to build off of its strong start this season, as both the men and the women get ready to host Princeton and Yale next weekend at home.  —Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The steady train known as Harvard women’s basketball is back up and running—and just in time.Saturday night’s dominant 71-46 victory over Brown (3-14, 1-5 Ivy) at the Pizzatola Center in Providence made it two straight weekend sweeps on the road for the Crimson. Harvard (12-7, 4-1) will put its four-game winning streak to the test this weekend in two huge conference games against Cornell and Columbia, both of which are nipping at the Crimson’s heels in the Ivy League standings.Saturday night’s matchup with the Bears, on the other hand, wasn’t much for drama.After opening its Ivy slate with a gritty two-point win at Yale, Brown has dropped its last five games: all five at home, all five to league opponents. The night before the Crimson came to town, the Bears had dropped an embarrassing 58-27 decision to Dartmouth on just 18-percent shooting from the field.Harvard was able to coast even without production from two of its most dependable scorers. Senior forward Katie Rollins, who was injured in Friday night’s win at Yale, did not play against the Bears. Co-captain Emily Tay, the team’s second-leading scorer at 11.4 points per game, had just three points on 1-for-5 shooting from the field.But the Crimson’s bread and butter this season has been sharing the load: in each of its 12 wins this season, Harvard has had at least three scorers in double figures. Saturday night was no different: freshman point guard Brogan Berry led the way with 17 points, and sophomore guard Christine Matera came off the bench to chip in 16 points. Co-captain Niki Finelli and sophomore forward Emma Markley added 11 and 10, respectively.“All we’re looking for on any given night is seven or eight players,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “The way this team is evolving, we don’t feel that any one person has to have a big game. If you want to take one thing away from us, you can. But you have to give something up to do that.”That something seemed to be perimeter shooting, most of which came courtesy of Berry and Matera’s hot hands. Berry made an efficient contribution on 5-for-6 shooting from the floor (including 2-of-3 from long range), and Matera connected on 4-for-9 attempts from beyond the arc.But to compete with Harvard, Brown would have needed sharpshooting guard Karly Grace to match Berry and Matera basket for basket. The Crimson zeroed in on Grace on the perimeter, limiting her to 10 points on 3-for-13 shooting (2-for-9 from distance). Bears point guard Courtney Lee (four points) also struggled offensively, frustrated by Harvard’s ability to keep her out of the lane.“As always, we focused on defense,” Markley said. “The offense just happened to click. We knew we had to come out with a strong start.”The cellar-dwelling Bears hung with the Crimson in the early going, but a 13-0 Harvard run during the middle of the first half put a quick end to any thoughts of an upset in Providence. The run included eight points from Matera (including two three-pointers) and put the Crimson up 27-12 with 5:35 to play in the half.By the break, the game was all but wrapped up. Harvard had shot over 48 percent from the floor, and Brown had committed 15 turnovers.[Brown] took a lot of chances,” Delaney-Smith said. “They just went for a lot of things and missed.”The Crimson scored the first eight points out of the locker room, reaching its largest lead of the game (27) on a jumper from sophomore forward Claire Wheeler with 16:20 to go in the game.—Staff writer Emily W.

Difficult conditions led to a tough weekend for the Harvard skiing team, as the nordic and alpine squads continued their trend of tenth-place finishes at the University of Vermont Carnival in Stowe, Vermont. Despite the new race trail at Spruce Peak, the Stowe course maintained its reputation as one of the most challenging races of the collegiate season. The snow proved to be very dry and grippy, leading to deep ruts at the base of each gate on the course for the alpine events. Also, a white-out of intense snow and booming thunder welcomed the Crimson contingent when it first arrived up north. “The snow acted like styrofoam, crumbling away a little more with every racer that sliced into it,” said men’s junior alpine captain Chris Kinner. “The further back one started, the rougher the course became.” The women’s nordic team led the way for Harvard, accounting for 97 of Harvard’s 203 point total over the two day meet. That squad was led by sophomore Cara Sprague’s 19th-place finish in the women’s 10K Classic, where the Pfoho resident was followed closely by nordic captain Anna Schulz in 21st place. Sprague also led the way for the Crimson in the women’s 5K Freestyle event, finishing in 36th place. “This weekend was one of the best performances the women’s nordic team has had in years,” Schulz said. “It was great to see so many of us finish in the top half of a very competitive field.” The men’s nordic team was paced by captain Dave McCahill’s 45th-place finish in the men’s 10K Freestyle event. In the men’s 15K Classic race, junior Trevor Petach, McCahill, and freshman Joe Tofte finished together in 54th-, 55th-, and 56th-position, respectively, to collect 27 points towards Harvard’s efforts. In the men’s Giant Slalom event, the Crimson alpine team was paced by freshman Kevin McNamara’s 38th-place effort. Kinner failed to finish the race, as he broke one of his skis at the tenth gate of his first run, slamming into one of the many ruts on the course, which released his binding. But he bounced back to be the lone Harvard finisher, placing 32nd in the men’s Slalom event. “Slalom courses tend to get even more hacked up than Giant Slalom courses in soft snow, so that contest was even more of a rodeo,” Kinner said. “Of 72 men that started, only 34 finished [32 of 67 for the women]; the spectators and fans got quite a show as nearly every other racer was launched head over heels out of the course.” The women’s alpine squad failed to earn any points over the weekend, despite the efforts of freshman Caroline McHugh. She had a great first run, but fell victim to a crucial technical mistake on her second run and failed to finish the race. Schulz was hardly surprised by the women’s nordic team leading the charge for the Crimson, as that is the only squad out of the four men’s and women’s nordic and alpine teams that currently maintains a full roster of greater than six members, boasting seven active team members. “The women’s nordic team is the team with numbers,” Schulz said. “We have the depth necessary to deal with both injuries and illness.” Both the men’s nordic and alpine squads currently have four team members due to recent injuries, and McHugh is the lone member of the women’s alpine team that competed at the meet this weekend. “Hopefully, all four squads can improve next weekend,” Schulz said. “I think we should be able to improve each carnival the rest of this season.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

Freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle made a career-high 45 saves on Friday against Yale, but it was the five shots he could not block that cost the Harvard men’s hockey team the win.With a barrage of attempts on net and an aggressive offensive assault, the Bulldogs downed the Crimson (5-13-4, 5-7-4 ECAC) in a blowout to complete the season sweep of Harvard. Hoyle limited the damage, but his effort was in vain. No. 14 Yale (16-5-1, 11-3-1) triumphed, 5-1.“My overall impression was that after having a great game against BU, we really took a step back,” junior Alex Biega said.  “We didn’t come in with the same mentality.”The Elis dominated in all facets of the contest, but the Crimson’s ultimate downfall was the power play. Yale converted on four of its six chances despite converting just 19.1 percent of power plays on the season. Harvard could not convert on its three man-advantage attempts.“The biggest thing for us is just staying out of the box,” junior Doug Rogers said. “Not our best game on the penalty kill, but sometimes it’s just the luck you get.”The Bulldogs opened the scoring a little more than eight minutes into the game. After an interference call sent junior Chad Morin to the penalty box, Yale took advantage as defenseman Mike Matczak fired a wrist shot past Hoyle for the first of his two power-play goals.“[Yale’s] just very highly skilled,” Biega said. “They transition the puck very quickly. If we give them odd-man rushes, they’re going to capitalize.”The Crimson responded just a minute later to tie the game at one. The scoring play started when sophomore Michael Biega preyed on a failed Bulldog clearance. He collected the puck and guided it across the ice to fellow sophomore Matt McCollem, who one-timed it past netminder Alec Richards. The goal was McCollem’s fourth of the season.“In the first 20 minutes we played pretty well,” Rogers said. “After that Yale took over the game and dominated us. They’re very fast and stick to their game plan very well.”The McCollem score was one of the few bright spots Friday night. Yale took the lead on a power play later in the first period after a couple of precise passes led to an open one-time shot. The Bulldogs increased the margin in the second frame when a bid on goal was redirected into the back of the net.All night long, Yale sent flurries of shots Hoyle’s way. The freshman delivered an impressive performance, but the number of tries was just too much. The Bulldogs out-shot Harvard 17-to-2 in the first period and 50-to-15 overall.“[Hoyle] made some unbelievable saves last night,” Rogers said. “When you give them so many power plays there’s only so much you can do. When you give a team 50 shots it’s going to catch up with you.”The shot margin was Yale’s largest of the year and the 15 attempts on goal by the Crimson were the fewest the Elis had allowed this season. Yale punished the Harvard in both zones, and offensive troublemakers kept the play around the Crimson’s net.In the third period, the Bulldogs continued their attack and slid pucks past Hoyle two more times to make the score 5-1. The fourth goal, coming off the stick of Matczak, was very similar to Yale’s first score of the game. The final goal, which came with less than two minutes remaining, was a rebound that was stuffed into the net. Bulldog Kevin Limbert took home first-star honors by recording a goal and three assists.This is the second time Yale has overwhelmed Harvard this season. In early January, the Bulldogs controlled the Crimson and came away with an easy 6-2 victory at the Bright Hockey Center. The result was similar this time around at the sold-out Ingalls Rink in New Haven.The Yale win extended the Bulldogs’ unbeaten streak to six games, and made Harvard look like a team far removed from the squad that challenged No. 1 Boston University in the Beanpot last week.“I guess we disregarded how big of a game [Yale] was,” Biega said. “Obviously they’re the biggest rival of ours, but unfortunately we didn’t come out ready to play.”The Crimson will hope for sharper play when the team faces off against No. 12 Boston College tonight at 5 p.m. in the Beanpot Consolation Game.—Staff writer Jake I.

The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams began postseason play yesterday in a two-weekend tournament at Levien Gymnasium in New York City, where the No. 5 women (15-1) went undefeated on the day. The No. 7 men (8-8), on the other hand, were unable to carry the momentum from last week into the matches, falling to No. 5 Princeton 17-10, Yale 15-12, and No. 4 Columbia 16-11. “It was a real team effort,” co-captain Emily Cross said. “Everyone contributed in a really great way and we were all really at the top of our games, especially facing Columbia. It feels really great.” The women’s team prevailed in all four of its matches, beating Princeton 14-13, Cornell 21-6, Yale 18-9, and Columbia 15-12, as it began to pave its way to another Ivy League title. “When we needed people to pull through they pulled through,” Cross said. “Everyone performed as much as they needed to.” Led by freshman sabre Caroline Vloka, who went 12-0 on the day, Harvard edged out the Tigers first, who had beaten the Crimson at an earlier meeting in the season. With easy wins over Cornell and Yale, the women’s team was unstoppable, culminating with a victory over undefeated rival Columbia. “Columbia was certainly our biggest win today,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It was the match of the undefeated in the Ivy League. [The win] puts us over the top right now.” Other standout performances for the Crimson included Cross and freshman épée Noam Mills, who each only lost one bout. Cross, along with foil teammate junior Anna Podolsky, led the foil for Harvard. “Our primary objective, especially against Columbia, was to win big time in the foil squad,” Brand said. “They sure turned up big time for us.” The sabre continued to be the Achilles’ heel for the women’s team, pushing the épée and foil to make up the difference. Still, Brand acknowledged the effort of all three sabre fencers, noting sophomore Yunsoo Kim’s two victories and close matches throughout the day, despite her inexperience.  “It’s a great credit to her,” Brand said. “She’s never really fenced before she got to Harvard.” Brand hopes to practice with the sabre team this week in preparation for the second part of the tournament. Still, the Crimson eyes Feb. 22’s continuation of the tournament in a comfortable position. With a win against Brown, they are guaranteed a share of the Ivy League title. With another win against Penn, Harvard will win the tournament and be Ivy League Champions. Freshman sabre Valentin Staller and co-captain épée Benji Unger led the Crimson on the day for the men’s team, both posting a 3-0 record against the Tigers. Staller also won two of his three bouts against the Bulldogs.But it was not enough for the team to notch the win.  The closest match of the day for the men was against Yale, where co-captain Kai Itameri-Kinter and junior Karl Harmenberg won two of their three bouts. The Harvard women’s team will travel to Providence, R.I. in pursuit of its third Ivy League championship, while the men’s team will look to improve its postseason record against Brown and Penn.—Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.edu.

After months of anticipation in a rollercoaster season, the Crimson opened Ivy League competition by continuing its up-and-down trend.Harvard wrestling (2-8, 1-3 EIWA) traveled to Penn and Princeton on Saturday, bringing mixed results as it split the dual contests. After a morning 35-12 defeat at the hands of the Quakers, the Crimson rebounded to overtake the Tigers, 32-9, in the afternoon.“We wrestled okay against Penn and a lot better against Princeton,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss explained. “We had more intensity [in doing] some of the things we worked on during the week.”Despite the inconsistent weekend performance, the Crimson’s stars continued to dominate as junior co-captains No. 4 J.P. O’Connor (157 lbs.) and No. 10 Louis Caputo (184) earned two wins apiece in addition to an undefeated effort from freshman Walter Peppelman (149). Harvard also ushered new grapplers into the win column, with rookie Sean Murphy (197) and sophomore Andy Olsen (174) enjoying their first victories of the year against Princeton.The squad showed excitement after notching its first Ivy win, but Caputo suggested that the Crimson have a long way to go.“We’ve taken our licks in past duals, so it was good to get that win,” he said. “We’re going to build off of this. We’ve definitely got a few more wins in us, so it will be exciting to go from here.”Harvard will look to make similar strides in terms of health, as Caputo and Olsen made encouraging returns to the mat Saturday, but No. 3 Corey Jantzen (141) remains sidelined by injury. The sophomore standout has not competed since Jan. 3.With a slew of grapplers who are constrained to the bench or held to limited action as they recover, the Crimson has struggled to demonstrate its full potential. As the season progresses, though, Weiss maintains that his squad will close the gap on programs like Penn.“Everything’s gearing up for the end of the year, and when we get Jantzen back that’s huge,” he said. “Our tournament team is better than our dual team, and I’m excited about going to NCAAs with three guys in the top ten.”HARVARD 32, PRINCETON 9The Crimson dominated its slate of bouts against the Tigers (2-13, 1-5), dropping only one of the seven contests. Harvard transitioned quickly from Philadelphia to Princeton, N.J., showing vast improvement at Dillon Gymnasium in the afternoon. O’Connor (21-2) and Caputo (21-4) logged shutouts to cap undefeated days, while Peppelman (9-7) and Knapp (4-6) ground out impressive victories to put the match out of reach.Perhaps the most thrilling efforts, though, came from two grapplers who have struggled to find success. Olsen (1-1) competed for the first time in nearly a year and a half, and delivered in the afternoon session. After shaking off a morning defeat, the Crimson grappler cruised to a major decision, dismantling Princeton’s Michael Erdman, 10-0.“Andy wrestled really well,” Caputo said. “Considering it was his first time back, I thought he did great.”But Olsen was not the only Harvard competitor to claim his first victory, as Murphy posted a rousing 7-5 overtime win with a last-second takedown. After trailing the Tiger’s Zachary Morse for much of the bout, Murphy (1-12) battled to a late tie before overcoming his junior opponent in the extra frame.“Sean Murphy got a huge win tonight,” Weiss said. “He’s been coming along hard and with that come-from-behind win I couldn’t have been happier.”Jantzen and senior Tommy Picarsic (5-2) also earned forfeit victories.PENN 35, HARVARD 12The Crimson began the day in dubious fashion, falling hard to the Quakers (10-5, 5-1) at the Palestra.Caputo earned six points for Harvard, as his opponent suffered disqualification while trailing 5-1. Peppelman and O’Connor rounded out the scoring with 8-4 and 4-1 decisions respectively.O’Connor’s narrow win over No. 18 Matt Dragon not only sparked an impressive day for the junior grappler, but also served as a reminder that he remains one of the nation’s top competitors. O’Connor was the only Crimson wrestler to defeat a ranked opponent on the weekend.Despite the stellar performances of both captains and Peppelman, the rookie’s classmates did not fare as well. Harvard’s other four freshmen—Murphy, Johnny Motley (1-8), Bryan Panzano (0-7), and Spencer DeSena (2-8)—suffered two technical falls, a fall, and a loss as the match shifted in favor of Penn. Olsen and Picarsic also dropped decisions,—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

Outmanned and outshot, the Harvard men’s basketball team extended its losing streak to four straight games Friday night, falling 87-66 to Yale (8-11, 3-2 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion. Down by only five at halftime, the Crimson (9-10, 1-4) went 30 percent from the field in the second half, making just one three pointer in the final twenty minutes. Junior guard Jeremy Lin led the way yet again for Harvard with a game-high 23 points, but he didn’t get much help—as captain guard Andrew Pusar was his only teammate to reach double-digit scoring, tallying 11 points.
Harvard’s front court, depleted by injuries, was overmatched by the Bulldogs’ rotation of big men. Yale captain Ross Morin and fellow forward Travis Pinick scored 15 points each, and four others, averaging a height of 6’8”, each saw significant minutes. The Bulldog bench outscored the Crimson’s 35-18. 
“The strength of our team is our guys inside,” Yale coach James Jones said. “They need to finish for us, and they did tonight.”
Crimson senior Evan Harris was effective with eight points in his first game back from a knee injury, but Harvard’s pair of freshman forwards found little success on the offensive end. Forced to defend taller and heavier players, Peter Boehm showed spirit but had a cold shooting night, making only one triple in seven attempts. Despite pulling in a game-high seven rebounds, Keith Wright scored four points and did not make it to the free throw line in a game filled with 48 fouls. Yale had 40 points in the paint to the host’s 22.
“[The Bulldogs] did a tremendous job of being physical and strong around the rim, and that was the Achilles heel for us this evening,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.

Along with the mismatch down low, Yale’s shooters spread the floor, making 5 of 10 three-pointers.
“Hitting some outside shots really opened the ball up inside,” said Morin, who scored 11 of his points in the second half. “We executed some plays well, got some easy buckets.”
The Bulldogs opened the night on an 8-3 run, until the home team answered with a 10-2 spurt to take a three-point lead just under five minutes into the game. After four Crimson turnovers in two and half minutes, an emphatic Pinick dunk gave Yale the lead at 12:21. A Pusar triple and senior guard Drew Housman’s two free throws tied things up four minutes later, but thirteen straight Bulldog points gave Yale the lead for good. Harvard closed the half on a 10-4 run to cut the deficit to five.
Both teams shot well in the first half, the visitors making 17 of 29 shots (58.6 percent), while Harvard was an even hotter 63.6 percent (14 of 22). But the Crimson made 11 turnovers in the period, leading to 13 Bulldog points.
Harvard kept it close early in the second half, down by three after Lin’s layup two and a half minutes in. The ensuing 21-8 Yale run, an eight-minute span during which the Crimson made only one field goal, put the game out of reach. Leading by 14 midway through the second half, the Bulldogs extended the advantage as high as 24, making the most of high-percentage opportunities inside as well as free throws.
The hot hands of the home team went cold after halftime, as Harvard missed 10 of its final 14 field goal attempts and eight of its final 10. Crimson freshman Oliver McNally’s steal and dunk as time expired were of little consolation for the raucous home crowd.
After struggling offensively last weekend in losses to Columbia and Cornell, Yale shot 55 percent from the field and scored a season-high 87 points.
The loss was Harvard’s seventh-straight to Yale.

Unfortunately for the No. 4 Harvard women’s squash team (7-1, 4-1 Ivy), close only counts in horseshoes. After an impressive 7-2 win Saturday over No. 2 Penn (8-2, 4-1 Ivy), the Crimson came up just short Sunday against No. 1 Princeton (10-0, 5-0 Ivy), falling 4-5. With the victory, Princeton won its third consecutive Ivy League title and completed a perfect 10-0 regular season.Despite the setback to the Tigers, victories over the Quakers and No. 3 Trinity last week ensure that Harvard will be a favorite in the season-ending Howe Cup Championship next weekend to be held in Cambridge at the Barnaby Courts.“I am hoping that having home court advantage will make a difference next time,” Crimson coach Satinder Bajwa said of facing Princeton again. Harvard next takes on Yale (9-3, 3-3 Ivy) Wednesday evening at the Barnaby Courts with a chance to secure a runner-up Ivy League finish.PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 4Princeton spoiled the Crimson’s undefeated season by the slimmest of margins Sunday afternoon, escaping with a 5-4 victory, with five of the nine matches going to a decisive fifth game.Bajwa pointed to both physical and emotional fatigue as possible culprits for the loss.“Yesterday’s match may have taken the wind out of our sails a bit today,” he said. “After playing so well yesterday, we had to come out and try to do it all over again. That is always tough.”Freshman No. 4 Emily Park and junior team captain No. 7 Johanna Snyder both recorded 3-2 wins for their team. Each alternated games with their opponents before seizing control to take the fifth games, 9-2 and 9-5, respectivelyNo. 5 junior Katherine O’Donnell also won 3-2, rallying from a 2-1 deficit to take the match 9-1, 4-9, 6-9, 9-3, 9-5. O’Donnell improved her season record to 8-0.With a victory on Wednesday against Yale, she will be the first Crimson player to go undefeated in the regular season since Kyla Grigg ’07 in 2007.“I’ve been concentrating on squash the entire year,” O’Donnell said. “My hard work is paying off and it feels great.”Freshman No. 2 Nirasha Guruge fell to Princeton’s Neha Kumar in a tight five game match, 7-9, 9-6, 9-10, 9-3, 9-1. Guruge appeared to seize momentum after winning a lengthy third game, but was unable to close out the match, dropping the final two games by wide margins.Freshman No. 8 Cece Cortes won her third match since making the starting nine, 3-2, but Sophomore Bethan Williams fell, 3-1, to the Tigers’ Mary O’Toole for her first loss of the season.Freshmen No. 1 June Tiong and Sophomores No. 2 Alisha Mashruwala and No. 9 Alexandra Zindman all fell, 3-0, to complete the scoring.Princeton has had its way with Harvard for the past three seasons, defeating the team handily, 6-3, both last year and in the Howe Cup title match the season before. But yesterday’s performance was the most competitive match the two have played during that span.The Crimson is confident that the next time the two play, which could very well be next weekend, the result will be in its favor.“We will be back at the Howe Cup with a vengeance,” O’Donnell said. “They should be scared.”HARVARD 7, PENN 2Harvard defeated Penn 7-2 Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia in a match that was much closer than the final score indicated and featured three five-game thrillers. As they did against No. 3 Trinity last Wednesday, the Crimson jumped out to a 6-0 lead and hung on for the 7-2 victory.“This past week has been a culmination of all our hard work the entire year,” O’Donnell said. “We feel it paid off and we got what we deserved.”Despite the final score, the match was not short on drama.Mashruwala found herself in a 2-0 hole after the first two games of her match 5-9 and 7-9, but rallied to take the next two 9-4 and 9-7 and set up her second five-game match of the week. Against a dispirited Alisha Turner of Penn, Mashruwala dominated the final game, 9-1, to take the match, 3-2, and raise her career fifth-game record to 3-0.At the No. 2 flight, Guruge bounced back from her first defeat of the season against Trinity last Wednesday to upend the Quaker’s Sydney Scott in a back-and-forth five-game battle. Guruge played around disappointing showings in the first and fourth games to take the match, 4-9, 9-4, 9-7, 3-9, 9-6.—Staff writer Barret P. Kenny can be reached at bpkenny@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday night, all of Lavietes Pavilion knew who would have the ball for the Crimson with the game on the line.
Junior Jeremy Lin has been the hero for Harvard game in, game out this season. Against Brown (6-14, 0-6 Ivy), it was more of the same, as the Ivy League Player of the Year candidate scored his 27th point when it mattered most—with zero seconds remaining on the clock—as his final free throw propelled the Crimson to a thrilling 64-63 comeback victory.
The surprise of the night: Harvard (10-10, 2-4 Ivy) would never have been in that position had it not been for the effort of a senior—who has been injured since December with a knee strain—and his sensational effort.
In the play of the night, senior Evan Harris, bad knee and all, rose up for a thrilling block to deny Brown’s offensive MVP, junior center Matt Mullery, from getting his 29th point. 
In the final three minutes of play, the Bears called Mullery’s number on every possession, feeding him in the deep post. With good position, Mullery tallied four points and set up an open three, as Brown took a 63-61 lead.
After Lin went down the court and nailed two free throws, one of them the front end of a one-and-one, to tie the game at 63-63, it was Mullery time again—the whole crowd knew it, and so did Harris.
“It was just pure instinct. There was a timeout before, and coach Wade told me, this is what you have been working for,” Harris said. “I worked my tail off to get here.”
Sure enough, the ball went down to the post, and Mullery looked to have position set for the lay-up finish. Out of nowhere, the injured Harris flew above Mullery and the rim, swatting his shot attempt cleanly to the top of the key. It was one of the biggest blocks of the season, and considering Harris did it with an injured knee, it proved all the more dramatic.
“It was up to me to do something, and I was just happy I could get high enough and my knee held up to get up there,” Harris said.
“We were hoping that eventually we could make a stand,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker added. “Evan made a tremendous play, timed it, and sized it up very well.”
The ball kicked out to the top, but with just fifteen seconds to play, the Crimson blew a transition opportunity, only to see the ball get kicked out to Lin with seven seconds to play. The rest was Crimson history, as the drive, pump fake, foul, and free throw completed an astonishing 11-point Harvard comeback over the last ten minutes of play. 
“I was staying aggressive and trying to attack the defense,” Lin said. “On the last play, I knew I couldn’t get to the basket, I tried to go left to right crossover for a pull-up. But he was there with me, so I pumped him and got the foul.”After the referees conferenced to confirm that the foul had occurred before time expired, Lin stepped to the line—by himself—needing to make one of two to seal the win. The first went up, rolled around for a split second, and then slid in, as the team stormed the court to embrace its clutch star.“I just didn’t think, and I just went up there and focus on my routine and shoot the ball,” Lin said. “I got lucky with that roll at the end.”Lin was unconscious on the offensive end in the second half, tallying 22 points to close the game. The stats are staggering: 7-of-10 from the field, 3-of-4 from downtown, and 5-of-5 from the stripe. Mullery, for his part, finished with 27, notching 21 of them in a dominating second half effort that saw the big men answer Lin every time down the court. But for Harvard, that one point between the two stars’ second half totals was all the difference.“What can you say about Lin, the way he has been playing for us,” Amaker said. “He’s willed us to some victories with his play sometimes this year, and that was evident tonight…[on the last play], we’ll go with that all day, and twice on Sunday, with Jeremy.”After a miserable first half performance that saw the Crimson fall behind 32-20 to the Bears, a repeat of Harvard’s poor showing against Yale a night before seemed inevitable. The team shot 30 percent from the field and tallied nine turnovers in that first frame.But the second half was a different story, as the squad shot 52 percent from the field, limited itself to two turnovers, and picked it up on defense.In the first four minutes of play, behind a pressing defense, big shots from the likes of senior Andrew Pusar—who finished with 10 points—and of course, the leadership of Lin, Harvard posted an 11-0 run to draw within three at 36-33.Brown stretched the lead back out to 11 at 50-39 with ten minutes to play, but from that point, the comeback was on, as the Crimson, with Lin driving the team, stormed back, salvaging the game, and perhaps the season.“We weren’t able to score against Yale, just couldn’t put the ball in the basket, and tonight, we still had trouble guarding their bigs, but then on the other end, we were doing pretty well.” Amaker said. “We made some shots to keep their energy up to allow us to get to the end game situation.”—Staff writer Walter E.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with consecutive matches against two of the nation’s top squads, Harvard men’s squash began the weekend in stunning fashion but could not sustain its momentum.The fifth-ranked Crimson (6-3, 3-2 Ancient Eight) notched a thrilling 5-4 comeback win over No. 7 Penn on Saturday, but fell 9-0 to No. 2 Princeton yesterday.“They were two very different matches,” junior Frank Cohen said. “Penn was a very good match for us, but Princeton is tough. It’s difficult to play back-to-back when we had such a hard one [Saturday against Penn]. We thought we had a good chance, but it didn’t work out.”Despite the disappointing Sunday result, Harvard showed tremendous mettle in its first match, converting a 4-2 deficit into victory by closing the contest with three straight wins. Junior Colin West, sophomore Eliot Buchanon, and Cohen reeled off consecutive victories as the first, fourth, and seventh seeds to overcome a stunned Quaker team.“It was nice because we definitely came together as a team,” Cohen said. “Usually we rely on the top of the ladder for wins, but it was towards the middle and end of the ladder that we were stronger.”With victories from the fourth through seventh positions, the Crimson demonstrated enough depth to make a strong showing at the CSA National Team Championships in two weeks. But, after running out of gas against a stellar Tigers squad, Cohen acknowledged that Harvard must prepare for more grueling efforts if it hopes to go far in the tournament.“I think we know what we’re capable of, but we need to work harder,” he said. “At nationals we have to play back-to-back and we weren’t up to that today. “We feel like we’re capable of doing better,” he added.PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 0The Crimson could not topple its second “Killer P” opponent, dropping each match in straight sets at the Jadwin Squash Courts in Princeton, N.J.Coming off of stellar victories against Penn’s Thomas Mattsson and Trinity’s Gustav Detter, the second-ranked West (8-1) suffered a setback against the Tigers, falling to senior Mauricio Sanchez. West likely could have overtaken the nation’s top spot with a win, but will continue to stand as one of the best in the country heading into Wednesday’s season finale against Yale.The day’s best efforts came from the third and fourth seeds, as senior Niko Hrdy (6-3) and Buchanon (3-4) fought tenaciously despite weary legs.Hrdy took his opponent to 9-7, 9-2, 9-7, showing energy even in the final set, while Buchanon found himself on the wrong end of a 9-5, 9-5, 9-6 loss. While the rest of the Crimson endured more lopsided defeats, Harvard coach Santinder Bajwa expressed little concern.“We had a tough 5-4 match [the night before] that left everyone a little flat,” he said. “If anything else we can feel good about the fact that we were playing a tough team. “Hopefully now we’ll get good rest and these guys will bring their best against Yale,” he added.HARVARD 5, PENN 4The weekend’s first match yielded more success for the Crimson. Harvard trailed after six matches but stormed through the closing moments to trump the host Quakers at the Ringe Squash Courts in Philadelphia.Following early wins from sophomores Richard Hill and J. Reed Endresen, the Crimson stumbled at the two, eight, and nine positions, dropping all three matches in straight sets. After a tight loss by Hrdy, the Crimson found itself in a deep hole, but West responded with characteristic calm in a methodical win. Harvard’s top seed cruised to a 3-0 victory.Buchanon evened the match at 4-4 with a 3-9, 9-3, 10-8, 9-2 thriller, placing the team’s fate on Cohen’s shoulders.The junior seventh seed proved very much up to the challenge, dispatching Penn’s Drake Porter 3-1.“[Cohen was] unbelievable,” Bajwa said. “Frank literally took over the responsibility of the team and pulled out a very tough match. He played like a junior with three years under his belt and I was very happy for him.”With inspirational play up and down the lineup, the Crimson will look to bring a revitalized squad to Yale next week and mirror its early weekend brilliance.—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you think about the Harvard-Yale rivalry, it’s probably images of The Game, not women’s hockey, that come to mind. After all, the Crimson leads the all-time hockey series by an astonishing 57-8-2 record.
Someone forgot to tell the Bulldogs that.
After two heated periods of scoreless hockey, Harvard (12-7-3, 11-4-2 ECAC) broke through on a power play in the third to defeat Yale (9-14-0, 5-11-0), 2-1, at Bright Hockey Center.
“It was typical Harvard-Yale, a great rivalry,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “It was back and forth, and it was just such a small margin, but special teams were huge for us today.”
Tri-captain Jenny Brine tallied the game-winner, putting a rebound of tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt’s slapshot in the net with six minutes to play.
But the offensive frenzy of the third period was preceded by two periods of Bulldog defensive dominance.
Harvard controlled the early going, but the team’s offense—which has been prolific of late, exploding for eight goals in Tuesday’s Beanpot opener—was completely stumped by Yale freshman netminder Genny Ladiges and her defensemen.
“Their goalie was in the zone today,” Stone said. “We had some great looks at the net and she was right there lined up most of the time.”
The Crimson got 28 shots on goal in the first forty minutes of play, including a couple of chances on its first three power plays.
But the Yale blueliners were aggressive, playing the Harvard skaters close and blocking a game total of 18 shots before they could even get to Ladiges. The Crimson defense, by comparison, blocked just five.
On the attack, sophomore winger Katharine Chute got some of Harvard’s best looks in the second period.
At 17:34, Chute received the puck at the left post but couldn’t poke it past Ladiges’ pads. Just over a minute later, Vaillancourt fed her linemate a long pass and sent Chute on a breakaway. Good defensive pressure and a body save from Ladiges halted the opportunity.
“The last three games we’ve been putting a lot of pucks in the net, and to start off without getting a goal until the third period, came out in the third period and figured out how to.”
Once the final frame began, it didn’t take long for the Crimson to crack Ladiges.
Bulldog Danielle Kozlowski was called for her third penalty of the night at 1:29, this one for checking.
Harvard set up its offensive pattern quickly, and at 2:09, Vaillancourt crossed the puck to junior Cori Bassett. Bassett lifted the puck into the top left corner of the net, where it crossed the goal line before bouncing out. Though play continued for a few seconds, the referees belatedly ruled in favor of the Crimson, putting the team up, 1-0.
The intensity of the game only increased from there, as Harvard played through a long stretch of penalty kill in the first half of the period. But it was at even strength that Yale found a way to tie the game.
Bulldog Bray Ketchum skated in from the right, skirting two defenders before placing a shot over junior goaltender Christina Kessler’s left shoulder. 
Caroline Murphy was credited with the assist.
Harvard caught a break with 8:08 to play, as Yale’s Samantha MacLean was whistled after she tripped up Brine on a breakaway chance.
As the power play wound down, senior Kati Vaughn sent the puck in from the blue line, causing chaos in front of the net. Harvard got a number of shots off on a disoriented Ladiges, with Sarah Vaillancourt finally taking a hard slapshot that ricocheted off of Ladiges’ pads. 
Brine was waiting to tip the rebound in for the game-winner.
“You just have to wait, you have to play good defense and wait for those openings and then you have to take advantage,” Stone said. “We made an adjustment in the third period on the first unit’s power play, and we scored two goals. It made a difference.”
Kessler had an excellent night in net, stopping up 27 shots. Ladiges finished with 37 saves.
The Crimson went 2-for-5 on the power play, while its penalty kill unit held Yale scoreless in its five chances.
“I thought that was one of our more exciting games,” Brine said. “A lot of power play, a lot of penalty kill, and it was great to come out on top.”

With a Beanpot final, Ivy League games and decisive ECAC fixtures on the horizon, Harvard certainly didn’t need further motivation to achieve this season. However, it was provided with exactly that—courtesy of the Crimson’s illustrious past.In front of the 1999 AWCHA national championship-winning Harvard team—reunited and honored as part of the 30th anniversary of the women’s ice hockey program—the current Crimson (13-7-3, 12-4-2, 7-2-0 Ivy) marked the occasion with a 4-0 win over Ivy League rivals Brown (5-18-1, 4-13-0, 1-7-0 Ivy) in Bright Hockey Center.Two goals and two assists from senior tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, a goal apiece from senior tri-captain Jenny Brine and senior Sarah Wilson, and two assists from sophomore Katharine Chute tamed the Bears and ensured that Harvard stretched its winning streak to seven games.It is also the second win over Brown this season, following a 5-3 win in Providence in early January.“It was a good game—I thought that Brown played really hard too,” said the Crimson head coach Katey Stone. “In the first period, there were times when they were outworking us, but we were able to capitalize on our chances.”In a closely contested opening period, Harvard worked hard for an opening against a well-organized Brown defense.Vaillancourt—continuing in her rich vein of form and searching for a second hat-trick against Brown this season—went close for Harvard at 5:24, beating a defender and blazing a high shot into the hands of Brown goaltender Stock. In a 5-on-3 opportunity, the Bears’ goaltender was called into action again, with two excellent saves denying Harvard the opening goal.At the other end, a Crimson penalty at 9:15 provided Brown with a chance to open the scoring. The Crimson defense held firm to kill the power play, with junior goaltender Christina Kessler finally grabbing the puck following a melee in front of the net.“I thought we played very well on our defensive end today—we didn’t give them a lot,” Stone said.Five minutes later, Harvard made the breakthrough.In a swift counter-attack, Chute moved into the Brown half and passed the puck to Vaillancourt on the left wing. The forward raced through the middle, supported by Brine coming up on her left for a 2-on-1 play for the Crimson. With only Stock to beat, Vaillancourt slid a neat pass into the path of an onrushing Brine to finish—the tri-captains combining to put Harvard up, 1-0.As the first period drew to a close, the Crimson doubled its advantage. Intercepting a pass from a Brown defender, Chute drove past her opponent on the Bears, the Harvard tri-captain clipped the puck over Stock and into the net, increasing the lead at a crucial time for the Crimson.“I think it was a really good win for us...we started right from the first period which, for the first half of the season, was kind of a struggle for us,” Vaillancourt said. “I don’t think we were starting right from the beginning of the game...and I think that what’s been helping us is that we start right from the beginning of the game.”After intermission saw Harvard’s 1999 AWCHA national championship-winning team take to the ice for a standing ovation, the Crimson of 2009 gave its own tribute with an intense second period.Harvard earned and capitalized on a third power play at 6:49—Vaillancourt again at the heart of the action. Controlling the puck at the bottom of the left faceoff circle in the Brown area, the forward passed to Wilson, at the left side of goal. Instinctively, the senior forward hammered the puck beyond Brown’s Stock to make it 3-0 for the Crimson.At 11:23, the final blow to Brown was delivered through a dazzling Vaillancourt solo goal, her second of the game. From the Crimson blue line, the tri-captain waltzed past four Bears defenders, hurdling the last one and maintaining her composure to slot the puck past Stock.The goal also saw the senior forward move above Angela Ruggiero ’03-’04 into fifth place in Harvard’s all-time career scoring—an achievement she credits to her teammates.“Everyone else in the team is getting open, and I think the lines are really clicking together right now,” Vaillancourt said. “I think that’s wahere the success is coming from.”In a dominant display, the Crimson recorded 6-for-6 on the penalty kill and won 28 of 50 face-offs, in addition to out-shooting Brown 45 to 27.For Stone, it was indicative of a stronger collective performance.“In some ways, we shared the puck better today than we did yesterday, and it makes a big difference,” Stone said.The win also moves the Harvard head coach into second on the all-time Division I women’s coaches win list with 313 victories—first among active coaches.—Staff writer Allen J.

Coach Tommy Amaker might moonlight for a certain energy drink company. With a 32-20 deficit glaring on the scoreboard at halftime, his players needed a major pick-me-up to reverse the tide of the game and construct a substantial comeback against a cruising Brown team. And in a few short minutes, Amaker gave them wings.To start the second half, junior guard Jeremy Lin first drove the ball in for a layup before accepting a pass from senior guard Drew Housman and launching a three pointer on Harvard’s next possession.  Lin’s five points started a 13-2 run that brought the Crimson to within one possession of catching Brown.“The phrase we used was trust your shot and stop overthinking it or guiding it,” Amaker said.More importantly, it gave the squad some momentum heading into the rest of a game that it would ultimately win in the final second. Such momentum represented a dramatic difference from the first period, when Harvard shot 30.4 percent from the field despite a number of open looks.“We knew that we were getting good shots on offense and they just weren’t falling,” senior forward Evan Harris said. “That first real series kind of catapulted us to a nice run.”After going 1-for-6 on three point attempts in the first period, Harvard hit 6-for-10 from long range in the second. Field goal percentage jumped up to 51.7 percent, and the Crimson went 8-for-9 in free throws including a 5-for-5 performance from Lin.Increased success on offense boosted defensive play; after allowing Brown guard Peter Sullivan to score 15 points in the first, Harvard put the kibosh on the guard and limited him to only five points in the second. The Crimson also limited turnovers. “Taking care of the ball leads to that offensive efficiency,” Amaker said.    Prior to its amped-up play in the second period, though, things looked bleak for the men’s squad. Harvard was 7-23 from inside the arch in the first and coughed the ball up nine times to the second lowest-ranked scoring defense in the Ivies. A lack of communication was evident in several misdirected passes and quick, failed possessions.SENIOR SURVEYAt the helm of the team’s second half comeback were three seniors: senior captain Andrew Pusar, Housman and Harris.Harris dropped a monster block in the final few seconds of the second half to secure the next game-winning possession.  But Harris contributed far more than one play. After watching from the bench for several weeks due to a knee injury, the senior stepped up and onto the court for 36 minutes against Brown.Harris earned a double-double by going 5-for-12 from inside, 2-for-4 on the free throw line and grabbing 11 rebounds. In addition to the climactic stuff of Brown forward Matt Mullery, Harris contributed two more blocks during the second to maintain the Crimson’s hyped-up defensive rhythm.“Evan was doing a really good job for us,” Amaker said. “At times we were kind of four perimeter players and Evan.  We kind of put him in the hole there.”Housman and captain guard Andrew Pusar also put up big minutes for the Crimson in the midst of a shallow bench, playing for 36 and 27 minutes, respectively. The two combined for 13 points in the second period, nine of which came off of tres that were instrumental to Harvard’s comeback.      STREAK SNAPPEDThe team’s first home win halts a disappointing start to the Ivy season. After starting out with a tight win over Dartmouth, the men’s team lost the ensuing four conference games—all at home. The series of losses was all too similar to last year when Harvard opened Ivy League play by falling in seven games before it finally earning a victory against Princeton last Feb. 22.  The Crimson tied for last in the conference in the 2007-08 season, a feat that none of the players would like to see repeated. A fifth straight loss to a Bears team that had yet to win an Ivy matchup could have sent Harvard down a similar disappointing path this season, but the second half heroics prevented a slide equivalent to that of last year.  “We were in a slump and we had one half left this weekend,” Lin said. “We took it upon ourselves to be tough, to get boards, to make plays.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Friday night’s game with Yale, the frontcourt match-up was a big concern for Harvard. A foot injury to junior forward Doug Miller left the Crimson without its most consistent post player as it went up against a Bulldog lineup loaded with talented big men. Yale captain Ross Morin is the most dangerous of this bunch. The forward, a second team All-Ivy selection, was averaging 13.1 points-per-game before Friday’s game. “He’s our captain. He’s our leader, and we go as he goes,” Bulldog coach James Jones said. Morin’s teammate, senior forward Travis Pinick, is an equally capable threat. Also a second team All-Ivy selection, Pinick entered Friday averaging 9.4 points-per-game and 6.2 rebounds-per-game, good for fourth in the Ivy League. “That’s the strength of our team, our guys inside,” Jones said. “We need to go inside to those guys, and they need to finish for us.” Harvard got a lift from senior forward Evan Harris, who made his return after missing eight games with a knee injury. Despite this effort to stop Yale’s frontcourt, however, the Bulldogs owned the paint en route to a 87-66 victory. Morin scored 15 points, hitting five of nine shots, and Pinick added 15 of his own, connecting on six of his eight attempts.  Yale also received valuable contributions from its bench. Junior center Paul Nelson, sophomore forward Michael Sands, and freshman forward Greg Mangano combined for eight rebounds and 12 points in 34 minutes of action. “We’ve got a lot of bodies,” Jones said. “I was able to sub guys at will to try to give us a boost, and they did.” Yale’s advantage on the interior was most critical when it came to controlling the boards. Coming out of halftime, Yale only led 45-40, but five offensive rebounds in the first nine minutes of the half helped extend the lead to 63-50, a deficit from which Harvard never recovered.  “They did a tremendous job of being physical and strong around the rim,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. “That was the Achilles’ heel for us this evening.”  OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION Yale entered Friday as the second lowest scoring team in the Ivy League at 61.4 points-per-game. In fact, the previous weekend Yale managed to score only 42 points against Columbia and a paltry 36 points against Cornell. Against Harvard, the Bulldogs scored more points than it had in its past two games combined. “I thought our guys really worked on our offense,” Jones said. “We were much more efficient this weekend.” Yale shot 55.2 percent from the field, including 50.0 percent from beyond the arc. In addition to Morin and Pinick, two other Bulldogs scored in double figures. Junior guard Alex Zampier scored 12 points, and sophomore guard Porter Braswell added 13 points off the bench. “Tonight we shot the ball well,” Morin said. “The guys hitting outside shots really stretched the floor for the inside guys.”  SCORING LOAD Harvard’s offense came from one place Friday night: junior guard Jeremy Lin. Lin, who continues to prove he is one of the best players in the Ivy League, scored 23 points on seven of eleven shooting. He also tallied four rebounds and five assists. “Jeremy’s been a good player,” Amaker said. “We didn’t have much help for him.” Team captain Andrew Pusar, who scored 11 points, was the only other player in double figures.  “If we’re not going to get some production out of a few of these guys, its going to be tough for us,” Amaker said. “Jeremy can’t just put everything on his shoulders and expect to carry us to a victory in a game like this.”—Staff writer Timothy J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Considering the Harvard women’s hockey team’s recent offensive explosion, it is all too easy to overlook what the Crimson has accomplished on the other side of the ice lately—particularly in the net.Harvard junior goalie Christina Kessler made 27 saves in Saturday’s 4-0 win over Brown, notching her second clean sheet in three games—a span in which the Crimson has also scored 14 goals.“Goaltending has been huge too,” Harvard tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt said. “Kessler has been doing a tremendous job for us, and I think that’s key.”Kessler’s run of success evokes memories of last season, when she set the NCAA single-season record with 12 shutouts. She hasn’t sustained the same level of dominance this year, but if recent play is any indicator of future performance, the Crimson certainly has reason to feel secure about Kessler’s ability to protect the net.“Kessler played well, and when we needed her, she was there,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.The rest of the Crimson defense followed suit, allowing 27 shots, but never letting Brown make any legitimate threats to get on the scoreboard.“I thought we played very well on our defensive end today,” Stone said. “We didn’t give them a lot.”OLD TIMERS’ DAYWhile the Crimson improved its present situation with its sweep of Yale and Brown this weekend, the team also found time to acknowledge its past.During the first intermission in Saturday’s game, Harvard honored the 1999 AWHCA national championship team that finished 31-1-0 on its way to the title.Alumni from that team came out to center ice in a red carpet ceremony, and then watched a video montage celebrating the 30th anniversary of Harvard women’s hockey.“It’s awesome to see everybody,” Stone said. “We had 42 people out for our alumni game earlier today, which was a great turnout.”Harvard put on a good show for the Crimson alumnae, taking down Brown, 4-0, and allowing Stone to celebrate with the 1999 squad with a clear conscience.“The kids were fired up, and we’re looking forward to a great evening tonight,” Stone said. “It’s nice to win two games, so I can go and enjoy myself a bit.” CHANGE IT UPHarvard found itself frustrated heading into the second intermission on Friday night. No offensive play could fool Yale netminder Genny Ladiges, and the Crimson had been held to just five shots on its first three power plays.In the locker room, Stone decided to make a change. The Crimson came out for the third period with a new man-up game plan—and found a lot of success.Harvard converted on both of its power plays in the final frame to win the game.“Last year it came easy, this year we have to work a little bit harder, but tonight was just a great example of how we try to improve things,” tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “Coach gave us a new system coming out in the third period, and it worked. And that’s how it’s going to have to be the rest of the year, just adapting to what teams play against us.”The Crimson was finally able to escape Yale’s zone defense to find the back of the net.“It’s something we’ve done before against Yale, because they don’t come out and pressure you too much,” Stone said. “We adjusted and we were able to score two goals.”Harvard’s special teams also came through on the defensive end, killing a key penalty in the last two minutes of the game to preserve the victory.“When your special teams are working, everything just seems to run a little bit smoother,” Brine said. —Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—To think what might have 'bean.'
Faced with the chance to avenge last year’s Beanpot championship loss and to upset the defending NCAA champions, Harvard (5-14-4, 5-7-4 ECAC) came up just short, yielding to No. 15 Boston College (13-9-4, 8-7-4 Hockey East), 4-3, in the final minute of the Beanpot consolation round last night at TD Banknorth Garden.
“With the struggles we had earlier this season, this game was for pride,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91. “We just weren’t able to stay in our game plan for a full 60 minutes.”
With less than a minute left in regulation play and the score knotted at three, BC senior Benn Ferriero intercepted a clearing attempt by a Harvard blueliner and sent the puck straight down the chute to score the game-winner, sealing the win for BC at 4-3.
“One of our defenseman made a breakout pass to a man in front of the net, and I saw a BC player come and attack our player,” said sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll, who made his first collegiate start last night. “I lost sight of the puck and when I saw it again, it was on his tape right in front of the net, and he just put it past me.”
Both last night’s consolation round and last year’s title game were tied entering the final two minutes. 
Harvard remained neck-and-neck with the Eagles, and broke every tie of the game except the one that really mattered.
“Carroll gave us a chance to win the game, and unfortunately we just had a tough turnover at the end,” Donato said.
The Crimson made a strong start, establishing its forecheck in the offensive zone and putting the pressure on the Eagles’ net. 
BC was whistled for back-to-back penalties, allowing Harvard over a minute of 5-on-3 play. 
Co-captain Brian McCafferty and junior Alex Biega took several shots as time ran out on the double man-advantage, but couldn’t get the puck past Eagles goalie John Muse. 
But as soon as the first penalty expired, sophomore Pier-Olivier Michaud redirected a bounce on another McCafferty shot to give Harvard a 1-0 lead.
The Crimson forfeited its momentum with a pair of consecutive penalties, handing BC its own chance to score with the 5-on-3 advantage. 
And sure enough, Ferriero hammered a shot from the center point through the Harvard defensemen to tie the score at one.
After the first intermission, sophomore Matt McCollem carried the puck down the right boards and jumped over his defender’s skate to take a shot on Muse. 
The Eagles’ netminder deflected the attempt, but Michaud finished off the rebound at 13:16 for the tiebreaker and his team-leading sixth goal of the season.
Junior Doug Rogers tried to capitalize on the Crimson’s momentum and sped down the center for a clean shot, but Muse got in front of the puck and no Harvard player was at the back door to finish it off. 
The Eagles returned with another goal of their own, as the puck was knocked into the net off of BC center Brian Gibbons’ skate.
Although Donato argued that Gibbons kicked it in, the officials still counted the goal, leveling the score in the Eagles’ favor, 2-2.
“I actually thought he kicked it in when I watched it...and when I saw the replay, I was sure that he kicked it in,” Donato said. “[But] I don’t blame the officials because it was spelled out pretty clearly before that there would be no replay.”
Harvard retaliated a minute later with a shorthanded goal by senior Nick Coskren. Michaud set the play in motion by intercepting Muse’s clearing attempt and firing off a shot. Coskren challenged the BC goaltender and nailed the rebound shot to put the Crimson back on top, 3-2.
The Eagles attempted to even the score before the final intermission, outshooting the Crimson, 23-9, in the second period. With 3:45 left in the middle frame, BC made a fast breakaway shot. Carroll blocked it with his body and swiped the puck out of reach just before another Eagle swooped in for the rebound, one of 21 saves in the period.
But with 1:24 on the clock, BC’s Ben Smith finished off a wraparound pass from a teammate to light the lamp and tie the game at three.
It was anyone’s game in the final period, but the Eagles held a 10-3 shooting edge throughout the period and finished off the Crimson with Ferriero’s tie-breaker.
Harvard now faces a six-game stretch against ECAC opponents, beginning with this weekend’s home contests against Colgate and Cornell.
