After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
KATHMANDU, Nepal—I found Kathmandu very different than what I had left about a year ago. The earthquake seems to have shaken a lot of things.
Along with substantial physical destruction, the earthquake has left a severe impression among the survivors. Talks about the earthquake dominate general conversation, newspaper articles, and television talk-shows. A month after the disaster, the atmosphere still echoes the terror and fear caused by the disaster.
The people have lived through two big quakes and more than two hundred after-shocks. Vigilance has become a part of life. Many still live outdoors, afraid to enter their homes. A month of apprehension has made people very sensitive to anything out of ordinary. The sound of dog barking or a ripple in the water is enough to raise panic and anxiety.
Apprehension hasn’t stopped yet and a well-circulated rumor causes widespread panic. When I arrived home, I found myself listening to rumors that a big quake would strike at noon two days later. Apparently, some astrologer found something sinister with the stars. These unfounded rumors, conjured by some fame-thirsty pseudoscientists or covetous thieves, who break into houses when people leave them for safety, beguiled the public into terror for the first few weeks after the disaster.
Yet while minor shocks are still coming in, public life is starting to normalize.
The reopening of schools last week made national headlines. Children have been among the worst-affected in the disaster. Not only has their education been disrupted, they have been left with an immutable imprint of terror and fear. The resumption of education serves to herald the beginning of reconstruction.
This quake, despite causing a massive devastation, has nonetheless pushed the country towards preparedness.
The last major earthquake that hit this country was in 1934. Very few witnesses of that incident survive. Though the Himalayan fault, where Nepal is situated, is geologically prone to earthquakes, an incident-free 80 years had led the public to downplay the peril in which it was living.
An example of poor urban planning, the over-populated Kathmandu city was utterly underprepared to handle a crisis of this magnitude. Some of the most crowded areas have streets as narrow as ten feet — a fire engine or an ambulance would have a hard time rescuing people. The city lacks open spaces, and many houses, residential as well as commercial, were built against the building codes. Weak governmental oversight and public negligence had created an extremely vulnerable city.
Now that the general consciousness is shaken to its roots, things are beginning to change. For instance, schools, which had hitherto put disaster preparedness among their lowest priorities, have started holding quake-drills and are initiating plans to form an organizational framework for responding to such a crisis.
The dust is settling down and the terror is waning. Given the fresh public awakening, now is a good time to undo certain poor decisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HARMONY, Indiana—Whenever I find myself back home in Indiana for a few weeks, I always reacquire two habits that help to pass the seemingly interminable days: smoking and bike riding. These I alternate freely, puffing here, pedaling there, until my schedule becomes a rhythmic blur of healthy practices and their antipodes. Sometimes, when the urge strikes me, I say a quick prayer for my lungs, and do both at once.
As the weeks pass, this compound action begins to dominate my time. I describe long arcs about the town on my brother’s bicycle, waving to everyone I pass and trailing a vaguely festive flurry of ash-flecks, as though I’m late to the annual Misanthropes’ Parade. When I’ve had my fill of our commodious vicus, I move out onto the highways outside of town, where the wind is freer and unruly and my cigarette, its coal perennially charged to a conical blaze by the onrushing air, begins to lose what little value it had once had as a measure of time.
One day, in the midst of one of these excursions, I turned off the highway onto Old Green Road; surrendering to the path, I allowed myself to be carried past fields of damp earth stippled with virile switches of green, over a small creek whose languorous waters and muddy banks emitted a fetid wall of air, and, to my relief, right up to a line of trees, which I promptly entered. After a few curves, I emerged into a sort of grove. I paused, appreciating the stillness of the air, and noted with alacrity that my cigarette had once again assumed a steady burn; the chain of smoke that streamed from its tip drifted upward, executing impossible turns in the green half-light, its manifold ends tugged hither and thither like a marionette, until, utterly spent, it dissipated, and was lost to my eye.
At first unsure of my location, I pedaled on, but when I began to encounter a series of ramshackle domiciles—huts, trailers, cabins, all sagging and ill-kempt and bearing on their siding, like some edificial eczema, great curtains of lurid green moss—it occurred to me that I must have stumbled upon Black River Bottoms, a backwater and source of local humor whose tableaux seem torn from a mid-century report on rural poverty. There were refrigerators and washing machines lying in desuetude on front lawns, aggressive dogs chained with actual chains to the trunks of wilting trees—and, most noticeably, an air of complete stagnation, of a habitat secluded and immune to the pressures of time.
With a dull ringing in my head, I took my time here, luxuriating in the foreignness of a place wholly untouched by any number of exterior reagents, and when I began to exit the Bottoms I realized, with some surprise, that my cigarette, which I’d forgotten to puff, seemed untouched, just as full as when I’d looked at it nearly half an hour before.
Of course, time worked differently here—how could I know that a whole hour had truly passed? Regardless, I’ve recently sent a missive to Pope Francis—wax seal and all—in the hopes that this putative miracle can be consecrated by official decree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was sunny, it was warm, and May was lazily giving way to June when I opened my copy of Virginia Woolf’s “Mrs. Dalloway” in Regent’s Park.
I can’t always remember the places I read books, but I remember this because I was there in the park right along with the characters: calling Peter Walsh and Lucrezia and Septimus Warren Smith into being beside me—albeit with 90 years and a gold-rimmed page between us. And when the summer sun shone over London through Virginia Woolf’s prose, it burned my skin.
Later that day I saw “Peter Pan” in the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre.
In this production, the story of the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up was entirely re-envisioned and reframed: It began in a World War I-era hospital, where nurses tended to wounded soldiers; a lonely mother paced the same (and yet somehow completely separate) space, singing strains of old children’s songs.
Then Neverland was built from the detritus of war.
The wounded soldiers transformed into Lost Boys and Captain Hook—nurses into Wendy and Smee. Hospital beds were overturned and became grassy knolls, a house, a lagoon. Tinker Bell was a puppet made of metal rods and lightbulbs; the croc’s mouth was a ladder and his eyes lanterns; the mermaid puppets were crowned with eerie gas masks.
I was also impressed by the pirates, who were clothed not in the Disney-fied seaman’s stripes and patches, but in fully-realized versions of the villains from the backyard make-believe games of my childhood: the black-clad mercenary, the knight with a crested helmet—villains of those same games where my brother’s faded black t-shirt worn belted over black tights (and plastic sword) seemed, to us, to stand for all that was daring and heroic and adventurous.
This was a “Peter Pan” full of nostalgia, of longing, of loss, of the immediacy of the Neverland summer mixing with the air of Regent’s Park. I was transported, and I was not the only one.
As Hook shouted to the Pirates to kill Wendy, the script received an impromptu rewrite that summed up the beauty of live theater:
HOOK: Kill the girl!
PIRATES: Yes! Hurrah! (etc.)
SMALL FEMALE CHILD IN THE AUDIENCE, cutting through the silence in desperation: NO!
The rest of the audience laughed.
I turned to look at the unintentional comedienne, but she had buried her face in her mother’s chest. She could not watch cold-blooded murder.
I love moments like this, when the lines between truth and fiction are blurred somewhere between the stage and the audience, when the investment of the audience matches – or surpasses – the investment of the actors onstage. A few years ago, when I was acting in “The Chronicles of Narnia,” the fight sequence that ended with the slaying of the White Witch’s hench-wolf would almost always be met with wild cheers and laughter from the audience. But there was a day when, as the laughter ebbed, a toddler shouted into the darkness of the 350-seat auditorium in tearful outrage: “It’s NOT FUNNY, somebody DIED!”
I wandered through Regent’s Park before heading home, mulling over the play and the little girl who had believed just a bit too much. But had she really? Hadn’t she been asked – just minutes before – to believe in Tinker Bell, the same way we’re all asked to believe whenever we take our seats in an amphitheater or a darkened auditorium?
In the middle of a path off to my right, I saw a red-haired kid gleefully brandishing a long stick while his father demanded that the youngster hand over his sword. When he would not, the father wrestled the sword out from out of the kid’s fists, held it over his head with both hands, and then—knowing, but not quite believing, what was coming—I saw him break it in two and fling the pieces into the big trash bin beside him. The kid stared up at him, disbelieving, and started to sob—huge, abrupt, wracking sobs, as if an actual adversary had actually triumphed by breaking a sword over his head.
Had that happened?
Had that really happened, or had it not—and, if not, why did it feel so real to me? Why did it feel so real to the tiny red-headed soldier, whose crumpling face I could still envision, while, disoriented, I made my way out of the park with the words of Virginia Woolf layered over the mother’s singing children’s songs and Peter flying on ropes, and that girl shouting “NO!”, and Septimus with his fantastical visions of dogs becoming men, of learning the truth of life, while his wife wished his madness would stop?
And I thought back to the summers we spent in the backyard, where my siblings picked onion grass and wild strawberries and jousted with long, crooked sticks, half-believing the hammock-turned-vertical truly had the power to imprison us, as our fingers grasped the netting and we shouted for the villain to set us free.

Theodore “Ted” J. Gilman, who served for 10 years as the executive director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, will lead the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs as its next executive director.
Gilman was selected from a group of 52 applicants—“a very deep pool,” according to the center’s incoming faculty director, Michèle Lamont. Gilman and Lamont will step into their roles on July 1, just two years after Beth A. Simmons, a professor in the Government Department and then the head of the center, resigned in protest in 2013.
“I’m excited because my background is in comparative politics and international relations, and this is an institution, this is a unit of the University that is all about those topics,” Gilman said. “And so to some extent, for me personally it’s a return to that broader field that I enjoy so much.”
Lamont, who led the search committee to replace current Weatherhead Center Executive Director Steven B. Bloomfield, said the team was looking for someone with a strong research background, good judgment, and a close relationship with faculty.
“We had a really strong pool, but Ted really stood out in part because of his experience at the Reischauer Institute,” Lamont said. “I was particularly eager to have someone who had good knowledge of the internal dynamics of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and who had a lot of experience managing staff.”
As the Weatherhead Center’s executive director, Gilman will play a crucial role in the administrative management and faculty communication within the center, which is the largest international research center within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In an interview on Friday, Gilman said that through his position, he aims to find and create new leadership opportunities for faculty, continue close engagement with the research and teaching mission of the University, and expand the center’s focus on transnational and international themes.
“The Weatherhead Center already does a lot of things very well, but we also think that there are some new directions that could be explored, and we look forward to finding partners and creating new relationships to do that,” Gilman said.
For her part, Lamont said she looks forward to working with Gilman to lead the Weatherhead Center.
“It’s a really exciting moment now at the Weatherhead Center because it’s a bit of a new beginning after a couple of years of hiatus,” Lamont said.

Paul L. Choi ’86, a Chicago-based lawyer, has been elected president of the Harvard Alumni Association.
A former Crimson editor, Choi will be charged with overseeing Harvard’s vast alumni network. Choi served as the Alumni Association’s vice president for engagement and marketing this past academic year and will succeed Cynthia A. Torres ’80 for a year-long term.
Choi takes the reigns of the association during a University-wide $6.5 billion capital campaign—the largest in Harvard’s history that would be a record in higher education. Despite the huge fundraising push, Choi said in an interview that wooing donors is not his priority.
“It is not a main focus,” Choi said. “I think it complements the capital campaign when we really focus on engaging alumni and reconnecting alumni to Harvard.”
As part of the ongoing capital campaign, the Alumni Association has rolled out its “Your Harvard” event series, which University President Drew G. Faust has headlined, to promote the fundraising drive. These events have drawn hundreds from Chicago to Beijing.
Historically, the head of the Alumni Association is a well-connected or prominent donor, with famous Harvard names such as Thomas W. Lamont, Class of 1892, A. Bronson Thayer ’61, and Carl H. Pforzheimer III ’58 on the roster of former HAA presidents.
For the Alumni Association, the past year was not without a few roadbumps. In October, former HAA vice president Brooks P. Newmark ’80—the favorite for this year’s presidency—resigned in the midst of a sexting scandal in the U.K., where he was a member of Parliament. In April, supporters of environmental activist group Divest Harvard staged a two-day sit-in in the HAA offices protesting Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
Choi said he is looking forward to working with Faust and Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 to manage the Alumni Association.
“It’s about the engagement of alumni back to Harvard, being a resource to students, and connecting people back to the school,” Choi said. “The alumni network is extremely diverse; it’s very stimulating."

Late Monday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team scored its first victory of the 2015-2016 season when four-star Class of 2016 recruit Seth Towns announced his commitment to Harvard.
Towns, a 6’7” forward from Columbus, Ohio, turned down offers from local rivals Ohio State and Michigan in favor of going to Cambridge. Towns will join top-100 recruit Chris Lewis as a member of the Crimson’s 2016 recruiting class, which is shaping up as one of the best in not only Harvard, but Ivy League history.
The rising high school senior who averaged 21.4 points and 11.5 rebounds per game this past season for Columbus Northland informed Scout.com’s Brian Snow that he chose Harvard based on the direction in which the program has been going.
“I just fell in love with Harvard,” Towns said. “Me and the coaching staff are really close, and I trust what they are saying. I think it’s a great opportunity to move forward in basketball and school.”
In the same interview, Towns—who carries a GPA north of 4.0 and competes on his school's math team—noted that at Harvard he would receive “the best education” and called the Crimson “the right fit.”
Beyond his inspired connection to the campus—the lifelong Harry Potter fan once said he enjoyed his visit to Harvard because it reminded him of Hogwarts—were significant basketball motivations; Towns told Snow that he believes the Crimson basketball program is better than it is given credit for.

If you follow NBA star Dwyane Wade on Snapchat, you know he was a far cry away from the NBA finals a few days ago.
Instead, Wade took a trip down to the bustling metropolis of Allston to visit Harvard Business School for a four-day course in “The Business of Entertainment, Media, and Sports”—and documented it all on Snapchat.
Under the username “mrwade82,” Wade shared videos of himself lounging in Harvard dorm rooms, exploring campus, and as no visitor can resist, stocking up on Crimson merch at the Coop. (After his visit, Wade shared a Snap declaring that he had purchased a “Harvard Tee.”)
Some other highlights: his selfie over the Charles with the Dunster bell tower in the background and the picture of him walking the grounds with the unfortunately spelled caption “Havard ish.” What is “ish,” Dwyane?
