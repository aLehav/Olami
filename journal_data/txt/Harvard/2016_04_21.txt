After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a society, we look at the female body in two completely conflicting ways. On one hand, society loves looking at half-naked female bodies. We love it so much that we put it on the advertisements all around us, place it strategically in movies and television shows, use it gratuitously in video games—bare legs and exposed cleavage and “tasteful sideboob” and glistening flat stomachs and barely-concealed buttocks. Body parts that are packaged and prepared for our consumption.
But at the same time, society hates seeing the female body. When a mother breastfeeds in a restaurant, we cringe and tell her to put her breasts away. When a businesswoman wears a blouse that reveals just a little too much cleavage, we talk about how unprofessional she is. When a schoolgirl wears a skirt that is an inch too short, we ask her to please go back home and change because she is distracting her male classmates and her male teachers, and a man’s right to not get aroused in school is much more important than a woman’s right to an education.
We ask women who dress “provocatively” why they don’t respect themselves. We ask them to be modest, to cover up a little, to “leave something to the imagination.” Yet at the same time, we don’t want things left to our imagination. When we are watching movies or advertisements, we want to see a woman’s naked body, or as close to her naked body as we can get. Sex sells. What explains this dichotomy, this love-hate relationship?
I have an inkling that it’s because society—that is to say, heterosexual men—hate women’s bodies for the very reason why they love them: Women's bodies turn them on. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with being titillated by a woman’s body. However, there is everything wrong with feeling entitled to a woman’s body. Male entitlement makes men believe that they should be able to access women’s bodies whenever and wherever they so desire. Many men in our society have been socialized to believe that women’s bodies are for their consumption, and that they deserve it—and when they are denied it, that they are the victims of cruel “friend zoning.”
But on the flip side, male entitlement also means that when they don’t want to see a woman’s body, it should be covered up for the man’s benefit. When they don’t want to get aroused—such as in a restaurant, in the workplace, or at school—they believe that women’s bodies should be removed from their sight.
It is entitlement that makes so many men believe they can tell women what to do or what not to do with their bodies. It is entitlement that leads to strict dress codes that disproportionately police women for not wearing “appropriate” clothing, and societal disapproval of public breastfeeding. Breasts, shoulders, legs, butts—those are all great to see, but only when men want to see them. When men don’t want to see them anymore, or when there is no man around to see them, then those things should be put away. And even when men aren’t the ones to explicitly police women’s bodies, even when unfair dress codes are being applied by female teachers, it still stems from this same idea: that women’s bodies serve as a “distraction” to men.
This is all part of a larger cultural attitude that overvalues male sexuality and expects women’s bodies to exist for male pleasure. The idea of a woman’s body existing in isolation, outside of the male gaze, is simply bizarre—and it’s the reason why social norms prevent women from breastfeeding in public or peeling off their shirts on a hot day, the way men often do. A woman using her body to feed a baby, or a woman unclothing her body to cool down on a hot day—these are all ways in which women are using their bodies for a purpose other than serving male pleasure. And that’s when women’s bodies become unacceptable, inappropriate, taboo.
My friend was telling me the other day about his sexual exploits, and recounting in glorious, loving detail the parts of women’s bodies he interacted with. Then, upon learning that women often walk around naked in front of each other, he immediately became disgusted. He said that was inappropriate, and asked me why we couldn’t just cover up in front of each other.
That’s the crux of the issue: the belief that women’s naked bodies should only exist if there is a male audience. That is why lesbian porn is one of the most popular searches for heterosexual men, but lesbians in real life are stigmatized by and some are even sexually assaulted by heterosexual men who wish to “correct” them. That is why so many men love looking at girls making out with each other on the dance floor, but those same men feel uncomfortable at the thought of girls making out with each other in private with no man to watch them and enjoy the show. And that is why my male friend loved women’s breasts when he was the one doing sexual acts to them, but felt disgusted at the thought of women’s breasts when they existed in a completely non-sexual context.
It seems that we are far more comfortable telling women what to do with their bodies than asking men to simply stop sexualizing women’s bodies. In the same vein, we are more comfortable telling women to lengthen their skirts to “stop boys from getting ideas and create a good work environment for male staff,” and much less comfortable telling men to stop thinking that women’s bodies are inherently sexual and therefore distracting.
Women’s bodies are not a distraction, and women’s bodies do not exist for the comfort and convenience of men. And most importantly, no one is in any position to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. That is up to her, and her alone.

“Hi, I ordered an Oreo shake a little bit ago. Is that on its way?”
“Yeah, I’m working on it right now. It’ll be out shortly. So sorry about the wait!”
I scramble to scoop ice cream fast enough into the blender to satisfy my customer’s request. I look down at my list of orders: five chicken quesadillas, three orders of chicken tenders, four orders of mozzarella sticks, two smoothies, a root beer float, and an Oreo shake. A Griller can’t get a break at 12:30 A.M. on a Saturday night.
At the counter, two girls debate whether the curly fries I am plating are for them before I confirm their suspicion.
“YES!  Oh my god, I don’t think you know how much of a service you’re providing here,” one of them says. “You’re feeding the future leaders of this country.”
I look down at the blender so I can pretend I didn’t just hear these customers arrogantly imply their superiority over me because of my job. I pour the shake, give it to its owner, and turn to the fryers.
I am a Co-Manager of Quincy Grille. As of this month, I will have been serving our signature mozz sticks and chicken quesadillas for two years. I started working at the Grille my freshman spring, and have worked at least one shift a week since then. I was promoted to Assistant Manager and then to Co-Manager at the end of last semester.
As a fourth generation food worker and an avid amateur cook, working at Quincy Grille has given me the opportunity both to do something that I love and to learn about the business side of the food industry. I have been able to get to know House staff, other grillers, my Faculty Dean, and my customers pretty well over the course of the past two years.  Some of my favorite memories from the past two years have been my interactions with our customers: my fellow students. And I truly believe that the Grille provides an important service not only to Quincy House, but to the broader Harvard community as well.
But I’d be lying if I said that this job is easy. It’s been far from it. In fact, I bet that few of my customers understand just how difficult it is, and what doing it means. Physically, it’s been demanding: I have quite literally shed blood, sweat, and tears while on the job, and have effectively given up my social life. Working shifts not only involves cooking, but also efficiency, customer service, and cleaning. As manager, I have other duties—making sure that every shift is filled, that we have food in our freezers, and that everything is clean and up to code. Needless to say, I don’t get much sleep.
Even more trying than the physical are the emotional stresses of the job. Although interacting with customers is mostly a pleasant part of working at The Grille, they sometimes get under my skin. While working shifts, I have overheard misogynist comments, experienced racial microaggressions, been solicited for sex, and been heckled by impatient customers, among a litany of other cringe-worthy situations. It’s moments like these where the stereotype of the elitist, out-of-touch, unappreciative Harvard student does not feel too far off the mark.
Of course, I want my classmates to understand how hard everyone at Quincy Grille works. But it’s not just Grillers whom I want them to appreciate. More important are the hundreds of HUDS staff who work tirelessly to make sure we get food three times a day, or the other food workers out in the world like my father, my grandmother, and my great-grandmother, who inspired me to work in the food industry.
As Harvard students, we can sometimes forget how much labor goes into making sure our lives are comfortable, to the point that we demean the labor itself. Harvard is set up so that students don’t have to think about these things and can go through their four years oblivious to the issues both student and non-student employees face. It is imperative, however, that we recognize these inequalities and actively work to eliminate them—a process that begins with learning to respect and understand the experiences of these unsung campus heroes. Working in the service industry, especially when it comes to food, is dignified, and we need to treat it as such. If you were in our shoes, I’m sure you’d want the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Monday, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts marked Patriots’ Day with historical reenactments of the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the 120th running of the Boston Marathon. Numerous schools and universities in the Boston metro area celebrated with a day off from classes. This list of institutions, however, did not include Harvard. By not celebrating the state-wide Patriots’ Day as an official university holiday, Harvard is hindering its ability to foster a strong university community and to integrate within the wider Greater Boston community.
Thirteen undergraduates ran the Marathon this past Monday with the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, while others ran with a different affiliation. Some volunteered for the Boston Athletic Association, and many went to spectate and support their friends. But many students could not join the festivities due to their course schedules—a regrettable conflict that we hope will not exist in the future. Harvard should join many of its fellow Boston area institutions of higher learning in declaring Patriots' day a university-wide holiday.
Of course, it is not feasible for Harvard to cancel classes every time some of its talented students participate in a world-class event, nor should it cancel classes for every holiday. However, we believe that Patriots' Day—a commemoration of the Revolutionary Battles of Lexington and Concord—calls for special treatment due to its importance to Boston and the surrounding region.
As the Admissions Office often points out to prospective students, the University is an integral part of the wider Boston community. The University’s students should thus be free, if not encouraged, to join in the day’s traditions, whether that participation entails seeing an early morning reenactment in Lexington, sitting in the bleachers at Fenway Park, cheering at the finish line, or actually running in the Marathon.
Administrators often speak about the need to foster a sense of community, and that mission must focus on the community both within and beyond the gates of this institution. In the past, we have called for the administration to move Housing Day to help foster House community; today, we ask that, moving forward, the administration move classes from Patriots’ Day to help foster community on an even larger scale.  This change would also give faculty and staff the opportunity to spend the day with their communities.
The College is already examining its daily class schedule in anticipation of the Allston campus' completion; it would be appropriate to consider its academic calendar as part of the same process. If this day must be replaced by an extra day elsewhere, it is a small price to pay for the opportunity to celebrate our region’s traditions on Patriots’ Day—a point of pride and source of communal strength, especially after the Marathon bombing three years ago. Harvard should show its support for Boston and the wider region by allowing its community to be fully present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A. J. Maxwell’s was an archetypal New York steakhouse on the corner of 48th and 6th in the heart of midtown Manhattan. There, a few weeks after my middle school graduation, my family splurged on a celebration of our first road trip to America. I distinctly remember the forty-dollar entrées that dotted the menu (the opulence of it all!), and sinking my teeth into a steak that the Old Spaghetti Factories I was used to could only dream of serving.
Today, A. J. Maxwell’s is closed after years of poor reviews, with references to overpriced food and jerky-like steaks dating back to far before my visit. Though I can’t say for certain, I suspect the steak I had eight years ago was not, in any particular way, noteworthy in the grand scheme of beef. But somehow that steak remains in my mind, more vividly than any steak I’ve had since, as close to perfection as a slab of meat can be.
Diminishing marginal utility is one way to understand this seeming contradiction. Loosely, this is the idea that the marginal (read: additional) utility (read: benefit) of extra stuff diminishes as we have more stuff to begin with: We would love an extra dollar if we only had ten dollars to our names, but could probably care less about the same dollar as millionaires. For similar reasons, my very first fancy steak—though not incredible per se—was far more memorable than my tenth. The first let me peek into a whole new world of fine dining, while the tenth probably wasn’t all that special next to the nine other fancy steaks before it.
As thoroughly broke college students who in the median will earn between $50,000 and $69,999 upon graduation and likely even more later in life, our marginal utility is high now relative to our expected marginal utility 20 years down the road. In other words, as we become older and richer, things and experiences that amaze us now will probably lose their luster. We might understand this as a sale on happiness: Today, it would almost certainly take more than forty dollars to buy a steak as incredible to me as the one my 13-year-old self savored so dearly at A. J. Maxwell’s.
In more concrete terms, imagine we knew that, like the average American, we would be spending $55,000 every year by the middle of our lives (note, for the record, that the argument here works even if we’re not planning on being a big future spender). If we had the power to move a thousand dollars of that spending to today, we almost certainly would. Imagine if we had an extra grand today! Instead of a trip into Boston, we could take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Paris; instead of celebrating semester-end with instant noodles, we could treat our best friends to dinner at the city’s finest restaurant. On a smaller scale, instead of brain break, we could satiate a late-night Kong craving as soon as it materialized without guilt (at least of the monetary kind). Cheap Chinese food hits the spot in a way only college students can truly appreciate: There is a reason—diminishing marginal utility—our parents don’t like the Kong as much as we do. And we could do all of this in exchange for the negligible sacrifice of consuming $54,000 instead of $55,000 worth of stuff over one year, many years from now. Even Macklemore couldn’t find a better deal.
It turns out that financial markets have created a way for us to move money through time in exactly this way: debt. We can borrow money from the bank today and pay it back with our higher incomes in the future, effectively taking out a loan from our richer, future self. The logic of introductory economics would say that we should squeeze every last penny out of the happiness sale in this way, borrowing large amounts of money to finance increased spending today until we could expect to consume roughly the same amount at every point in our lifetimes.
But perfectly spreading out our consumption like this is impossible in practice and probably undesirable to boot. Few banks would be willing to issue the large loans we would need, and we might be worried about the risk of being saddled with debt if we ended up earning less than we expected to. Furthermore, consumption is often positional, in the sense that what matters isn’t necessarily how much we consume, but how much we consume relative to those around us. In other words, your 20-year class reunion might not be a lot of fun if you’re paying down debt while your classmates are busy buying nice houses.
On the other hand, it is easy to veer too far in the opposite direction. We’ve been taught since childhood to spend when we know we’ll have more and save precisely when we have little. Though this seems fairly reasonable, it certainly doesn’t sound right to teach farmers to gorge themselves during good harvests and only attempt to store grain in bad harvests. Rather, they should be saving excess grain in good years so that they have more to eat in bad years. While a perfectly smoothed consumption profile is non-optimal, there is no reason to believe that the extremely jagged consumption pattern that we naturally fall into is any better. The sweet spot is likely somewhere in between; hence, spending a little more today than we otherwise unreflectively might and buying marginal utility on clearance should move us closer to where we optimally ought to be.
This is not an argument for financial profligacy. Taking out a loan for $10,000 against our future income to buy a new Hermès purse today is probably a bad idea. Spending for the sake of spending isn’t likely to make us substantially more content with our lives. But there will likely never be another time in our lives when happiness today can be found for so cheap relative to happiness tomorrow. From the crab rangoons that we’ve been craving all night to the unforgettable college adventure abroad we’ve always wanted to take, life’s sale on happiness awaits.

Adam Hochschild ’63 has made a living as an author and scholar. He began as a journalist, was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and co-founded Mother Jones magazine in the mid-70s. In recent decades, Hochschild has been especially notable as a historian, having published half a dozen narrative histories. His 1998 book, "King Leopold’s Ghost," won both the Mark Lynton History Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize. Hochschild recently visited the Harvard Bookstore to discuss his most recent work, "Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War."
Fifteen Minutes: It’s always exciting to meet another graduate of the College. You studied History and Literature while you were here and really have blended the two in your career. Did you have any idea you wanted to do that as an adult back when you were in college?
Adam Hochschild: Not this way. At that point, I felt I was destined to be a novelist, but soon learned otherwise, unfortunately.
FM: As an undergraduate, you wrote a piece for The Crimson about college students in the Soviet Union and your travels there. You wrote a great deal about some student journalists there. Did meeting them spark an interest in journalism?
AH: My belief when I was a student was that what I really wanted to do was write fiction, but like Hemingway, and like Stephen Crane, [starting with journalism] could be a path. So I did start looking for newspaper jobs pretty quickly after I graduated, and I had some other things to do first. In those days we faced the draft and I avoided the draft by going into the Army Reserve for sixth months. I was briefly a civil rights worker in Mississippi in the summer of 1964, and then started looking for newspaper jobs.
FM: You’ve written a lot about communism and socialism, be it in Mother Jones or The Unquiet Ghost or Spain in Our Hearts or that article for The Crimson. When did that continued interest in these political trends start and how has it grown with you?
AH: You couldn’t be anywhere in the 1960s, especially Cambridge, without feeling that there were promises of great change in the air. The civil rights movement was a huge thing here; some students were going off and becoming freedom riders. Of course, by the mid-60s we had the Vietnam War, and I was very much involved in the movement against the war. I think of myself as being a child of the 1960s. If I had graduated from here in 1953 instead of ’63, heaven help us, I might have been a Wall Street lawyer or something.
FM: You’ve created a wonderful portfolio of writing that brings history to life and breaches the bounds of its typical consumers. What is your philosophy in writing these bright, colorful moments in history and making them appeal to people who might not necessarily jump for them?
AH: History is about people, and too many professional academic historians forget that. For me, it’s all about finding the right cast of characters. If I can find a group of people who lived through an extraordinary time and bring those people alive, then I feel I’m doing my job.
FM: You’ve participated in human rights campaigns and you’ve helped raise awareness of atrocities against the marginalized—I’m particularly thinking of “King Leopold’s Ghost” here—and so I’m curious as to what you think the role of the author, historian, and journalist—particularly the author and historian—can be in sparking change, action, and awareness?
AH: I wish I could say it always worked, to tell a story that needed to be told. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it does. I’m fascinated by those historical moments where it did work, and certainly in “King Leopold’s Ghost” I was fascinated by the effects of those very dedicated human rights campaigners had and the journalism they did. Similarly, in a book about an earlier time—“Bury the Chains,” about the British abolitionist movement—these people in a way invented investigative journalism and they realized that people were more moved to action by eyewitness accounts of great atrocities than they were by biblical argument, and that was a huge discovery. I’m excited when I can find those moments, but at the same time I find a lot of good journalists writing about terrible scandals that don’t succeed in moving people to action. There’s no rhyme or reason to when something takes off and when it doesn’t.
FM: Moving to “Spain in Our Hearts.” I hate to fall prey to the terrible trap of historical hypotheticals, but what do you think would have happened if Franco had actually been defeated?
AH: A lot of people say we wouldn’t have had World War II but I don’t think that’s true, because Hitler was always aiming eastward. He wanted to conquer Eastern Europe; he wanted to show the Russians who was boss; he wanted the Balkan and Caspian oil fields—that wouldn’t have changed. But, if Franco had been defeated, the people of Spain would not have had to live under a very harsh dictatorship for 36 years, and Hitler would not have had a de facto ally in World War II. Spain supplied a constant stream of strategic minerals to Germany. Franco encouraged 45,000 Spaniards to volunteer for Hitler’s army. He gave Hitler a submarine base for 21 attack submarines on the Atlantic Coast. None of that would have happened
FM: Have you found any parallels in the story of American sympathizers with Republican Spain in any contemporary political or social movements?
AH: Well, sure. I think we all need political ancestors and I think it can be inspiring to focus on people who did something courageous, going against the grain, years ago. If there was a comparable thing today, I would say it’s the battle against global warming. There are hundreds of other good causes, you know, reducing the enormous inequalities in this country and around the world, but that won’t do much good if we’re all under water. For me, that’s the number one battle today and I admire people like the activists of 350.org and so on who work on that issue.
FM: You’ve described the Spanish Civil War as being “the first battle of World War II,” which is not a way I had ever learned about the war before, although it’s not my area of expertise. Can you expand on this idea?
AH: Where else were Americans in uniform being bombed by Nazi pilots, four years before the US entered World War II? Hitler and Mussolini were sending an enormous amount of support to Franco, and clearly saw him as an ideological ally. The Spanish Republic was a democracy, a chaotic one, a disorganized one, but it still was a democracy. I think the people who went there certainly sensed that there was a large war coming and saw this as the first sign.
FM: Two of your books, “Halfway Home” and “Finding the Trapdoor,” have focused on your own stories as opposed to those of people in recent and not so recent history. Can you describe the difference in the authorial process for writing personal narrative and historical nonfiction?
AH: It’s hard to say. In both cases you just have to do your best to tell a story honestly. Sometimes with the personal narrative it takes a long time to figure out just what the story is. The history is a little bit easier because it’s sort of at arm’s length and writing about people long ago, but I like to do both things. I don’t know if I have any personal stories left to tell, but there’s certainly plenty of history out there that needs writing.
FM: When you look at archives and material in archives, how is your viewfinder different when thinking in a pure historical bent versus as an author looking to gather audience appeal?
AH: I think of myself as in those archives with a journalist’s eye. A lot of historians—and historians come in every conceivable flavor—some people are looking for the same kinds of things as I am. I’m looking for human voices. I’m not looking for the history of tax policy on this or that. It’s when I can find human voices that excite me. Diaries, letters, something that lets me know how somebody acted, thought, and felt at a particular time and place. That’s the goal.

As a joint physics-math major at the University of Auckland with no knowledge of astronomy, Charles Alcock stumbled upon a volume of papers from the mid-1960s about rotating neutron stars. A graduate student had noticed pulsations from these stars—the smallest and densest known to exist—when looking through the data from a radio telescope, and subsequently (and accidentally) made one of the most important discoveries of the decade. “It just blew my mind,” Alcock, who is now the director of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, recalls. “I thought, wow—this is what I want to do.”
So, despite never having taken an astronomy course, Alcock applied and was accepted to multiple graduate schools in the U.S. He’s honest about the criteria that led to his final decision. “I went to the Auckland Public Library, I looked up the weather records and decided that I would not survive a New England winter, let alone upstate New York,” he explains, and so he turned down Harvard and Cornell, heading instead to the balmy Pasadena campus of the California Institute of Technology.
Though he planned to return to New Zealand after receiving his degree, Alcock took to his new home quickly, and within a few months, he knew he would stay in the States. “It was so different,” he recalls. “The sense of possibility and optimism, also generosity... people have been consistently generous with me ever since I got here.”
In 2004, after stints at MIT, the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and the University of Pennsylvania, Alcock came to Harvard to serve as director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CFA).
Alcock explains why the CFA is a particularly special place to work. “It’s both extraordinary in quality... also breadth,” he says, noting the nearly 300 Smithsonian and Harvard scientists that work there. Since joining as director, Alcock has overseen some groundbreaking discoveries. Scientists researching extra-solar planets made the first detection of the thermal-radiation of a planet going around another star. Another researcher showed how, with a telescope that Harvard is building in Chile, astronomers will be able to detect oxygen on other planets.
In his own work, Alcock tells me he is particularly interested in “looking for objects which don’t put out enough light to be seen with a telescope.” Though these objects emit little to no light themselves, their gravitational fields will bend the light of a bright background object—when one passes between Earth and a star, it can make the star look five, 10, or even 100 times brighter. During his time at National Lab in California, Alcock collaborated on a project to detect this effect, which is called gravitational microlensing.
These events are extremely rare—you would have to follow millions of stars to even “have a prayer” of seeing this effect, Alcock explains. At the time, people would use telescopes to measure 100, or, at best, 1,000 stars, “so to go out and say you could do millions was a stretch,” he recalls. “But we did it, and we found this effect.”
Alcock is currently engaged in a new project attempting to observe the historically un-observable. Back in 1960, Jan Oort published his hypothesis of the Oort cloud, a theoretical shell of trillions of icy objects that lies light years away from the sun. “Long-period” comets are thought to originate in this cloud.
“For 66 years, we’ve believed that this population is out there, we’ve done a lot of theoretical work on it,” Alcock explains. “I have no direct evidence for it.”
Now, that might change. Alcock and his colleagues are working on a technique in which they try to detect these objects when they pass between us and a bright star. This is no easy feat, as objects  typically pass by the stars in less than a second, and stars need to be followed for 10,000 or 100,000 hours before you might see one event. The rarity of these events means that any measurement error can ruin the whole study.
The project faces other challenges, too. “When you look up at a star in the night sky and it twinkles, that twinkle is caused by the atmosphere, and astronomists hate it because it messes up our images,” Alcock explains. “For this project it’s particularly bad because it changes the brightness of stars and we want the stars to look completely uniformly bright so that the only reason they change is because something passes between us and the background.”
Though doing their best from the ground, Alcock and his collaborators have also proposed a space mission to NASA in order to do the project “the right way,” but the selection process for such missions, which can cost half a billion dollars, takes time.
In considering what astronomers at the CFA and beyond may discover in the future, Alcock is confident that we will find evidence for extraterrestrial life in our lifetime. “It’s getting close. There’s a very good chance we’ll find it with this telescope we’re building in Chile using an instrument that we’re building here in Cambridge,” he says.
In a field where theories and ideas may take many decades to find evidence to support them, persistence is clearly a virtue. But Alcock notes another aspect of the study of astronomy. “There’s a strong sense of wonder which we tend to associate with youth,” he tells me. “But honestly, I’d say that in my case it’s just gotten better with time.”

Another year passes, and another series of bizarre, contradictory, yet oddly poignant speech acts have been enunciated by our faculty members and section kids. They popped up in shopping weeks and late-semester seminar rooms, in courtyards and library stacks. It’s my third year compiling such snippets, and, each time, I’m reminded why Plato privileged speech over the debased art of writing: Something lucid rings in those oratory moments, something between genius and accident, a small event or schism escaping the socially-coded interactions that otherwise reign supreme. Luckily, though, I’m a Derridean disciple of the grapheme. So those oral phonemes were safely transposed to moleskin, then culled and packaged for broad circulation. Enjoy this final round of paradoxical ideologies spied in codified linguistic ruptures!

Toni Morrison, author of 11 novels and recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, the American Book Award, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, delivered a series of lectures on race and identity as the Norton Professor this past year. She spoke to The Harvard Crimson during her stay in Cambridge.
Fifteen Minutes: What are the central concepts that you see running through all your work?
Toni Morrison: Well, [the books are] so very different. It was only very recently that I began to think of them as connected in any way. I don’t read them after I write them. I sometimes read sections if I’m with an audience, but to read a book over and over—I don’t do that. Because the next book is so—for me in my mind—so different. The reasons for its existence are so varied. Some books I start and then I can’t go forward for some reason; I abandon them and write another book. The last book, I think, that was published, “God Help the Child,” I started that a long time ago. Before I wrote “Home.” But I couldn’t get the language that was contemporary, you know? It’s so different; so full of weak words…. It got hard to write in the contemporary world the way I write, which is more lyrical, I think, than some others.
FM: Like most of your books, “God Help the Child” has a focus on shifting narration and the same events viewed from different perspectives. What interests you about that pattern?
TM: Well, I started earlier, I think, with—not just different characters, but with different voices. And some of the books, like “Jazz” and some of the others, have no person connected to the overwhelming voice. Someone just starts talking and knowing things, whether they’re right or wrong. And no one realizes that they don’t know anything or that they’ve learned something else. But that’s kind of a speakerly voice, not overpowering and not authentic because they’re also vulnerable and also make powerful mistakes. And then, from that, there was an evolution—I guess, evolution, but certainly a difference—in having multiple characters comment on the other characters and the situation. And they may be entirely different. It’s a little more dramatic for me, like a play, where you have different characters circling each other or impressing one another. And then the book, hopefully, pulls the central idea together.
FM: How do you decide what the central theme of your books are, if that makes sense?
TM: It does make sense. But it doesn’t make sense for me, because I never write—well, I do write towards something. My happy endings. All my books have them. Happiness, to me, is knowledge. Knowing something that nobody in the book, including the voice, knew before. So the book is a process towards some big resolution: you now know something that, other than this book, you wouldn’t have known. So it’s not just closure, nothing like that. It’s just… wisdom. Some of them arrive at wisdom, some just get the knowledge. But the possibility of moving from data to information to knowledge to wisdom is the track of everything I have ever written.
FM: You’ve said that you don’t want your books to be read as “mere protest or advocacy.” How do you want your readers to be reading and approaching your books?
TM: Open. I want them to dwell in the language, the sound of it. I hear it myself when I write. And then I don’t want to tell them anything. I want them to realize their connection with the ideas and the themes, perhaps, of the characters. So that you and I—you, the writer; me, the reader—are doing something together. It’s like a chorus. Some of these singing places where you have a lead singer and then you have the chorus and then you have—maybe somebody, say in churches, they step out, take over. Or you have a very formalized musical rendition, you know? And that stays with me, I think because my mother sang all the time. She was a really good singer. I was just used to constant music in our house.
FM: With respect to social issues of identity and race, you’ve said that literature can do things that politics and science can’t do. What can literature accomplish that nothing else can?
TM: Well, the first thing was point of view. The point of view of an African American person or persons. Not as told to, but from the inside out. And I eventually sort of took that for granted. As I wrote, I didn’t have to stress it the way I did in “The Bluest Eye,” which was about race and the horror of believing that your self is ugly and totally disastrous. And it’s all in the realization at the end that the reader gets a sense of what the author feels. But subsequent to that, when I was writing “Sula” [and] “Song of Solomon,” I just gave it up. They were not black books, to me. They were books with black people in them, told from a black person’s point of view. And now I was having a little argument, I think, here with somebody, about not identifying race at all… “They shot the white girl first, and took their time with the rest,” which is the opening of “Paradise.” But I never say who the white girl is, ever… that was very deliberate, because I flagged race and didn’t make it disappear. The all-black community’s all about that purity… [but now] I don’t want to signal it.
FM: You’ve said that when you were teaching, you told your students to stop writing about their ‘little lives.’ Why is it important that things be invented?
TM: It’s a very self-regarding period of life.... When I taught creative writing the last few years that I was at Princeton, I told them, I don’t want you to write [about yourself]. So I would give them these wild scenarios—this woman in Paris, she used to be famous, and she’s older now and her lovers have all died. Write about her. Or, my favorite was, this is about a girl who’s in Texas and she’s an immigrant and she doesn’t speak English, but she works at a restaurant. What about her? I have to tell you, those Princeton students blew it out of the water. Once they were free to not say, “Oh, my girlfriend,” or whatever—get over it. Let’s go to where the imagination is rife!
FM: What was it like when the country desegregated?
TM: When the civil rights thing came, and after, I was very much involved in the Martin Luther King thing, and… that to me was powerful, and extremely important. Although it didn’t seep yet, down into the culture.... And also, the other thing—my last year as a student at Howard University, the faculty organized a troupe, a traveling troupe. Nine of us, they selected, and I was one. And we traveled the South and played our plays at the black colleges that had a budget for summer performance…. It was fascinating. Because the South, for me—like Ellison said, the South is black people. The South is lovely…. So I’m going down there, and we have some difficulties. They have arranged for us to stay at a certain place, a motel. And when we arrive there, we find out that it’s really a whorehouse.... So [a professor] goes into a phonebook, the yellow pages, opens it up [to] where it says churches, black churches or African-American churches, and he goes down the line and he calls up these black preachers… and [one] preacher says, "Come on over here." He has found six or seven people who’re willing to take us in. Just folks. And the girl that was playing this other part, she and I had gone to this one house—and this woman, she welcomed us—this was in the middle of the night. Welcomed us. And her sheets—I can never forget those sheets, because she had dried them on juniper bushes outside. And the odor! No spray could…. This was it. White, white sheets. Clean, clean, clean. And ironed. But they still had flowers in them. We offered her money; she wouldn’t take it. Please? No. So we put the money in the pillow slip so she could find it. The point being, I had such a good time, and it really was being in that neighborhood in the South where there was that honesty and comfort and shared…. I don’t know, it was like being at home. Only better, because it wasn’t your home where your mother was fussing. Anyway, that was—now as you look at it, or as I see it, on television, it’s like all those women are gone. All those women who took care of us, strangers, took care of us as children. Stars and things, but anyway, it’s difficult for me. I’m 85. I’m just picky. Seriously picky.

When I was a senior in high school, I imagined that the cinematic adaptation of my college experience would feature dappled sunlight streaming through crisp foliage, a soaring Adele soundtrack, and, most importantly, a sweeping love story. My hand clasped tightly with his, strolling through Harvard Yard, cozy sweaters brushing up against each other. There we are again, this time at a football game, swaddled in a flannel blanket and taking nips from a flask. We’re not quite Oliver and Jenny, but I have her hair.
As it happens, this film would turn out to be, for the most part, entirely fictional.

Here’s a central confession from my four years in Cambridge: I never fell in heart-wrenching, breathtaking romantic love.
That’s not to say I committed to a monastic lifestyle. There were several restless nights, achingly lonely despite the ember-like body next to me. Boys who were neither friend nor quite boyfriend. There were hours—too many—spent attempting to decode signs and text messages and awkward dining hall interactions. Cozy dinner dates and moonlit kisses on Mt. Auburn and just a few fleeting moments of genuine connection. There was, however, no great love.
Here’s what I did find in Cambridge: enough female friends to form a coven.
At some point, perhaps halfway through college, I realized I didn’t need to fall head over heels in love because I already was in love. I was in love with the dozen or so women whom I depended on then and still lean on now. Many college relationships would come and go, but even then, I knew these people were forever. Armed with wit, white wine, and, admittedly, lots of whining, we fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, gracefully complementing one another—flaws and all.
I suspect this is something many Harvard students can relate to. Good friends are, or at least should be, aplenty in the university setting. Still, I am continually struck—dazzled and mesmerized, even—by the sophisticated, complex, wise, snarky, thoughtful, stubborn, and glamorous young women I am surrounded and supported by. I have relished my open-ended independence over the past eight semesters. These friends have made that independence breathlessly entertaining too, and I’m not so sure I could have ever given just a little bit of that up for just one person. Especially in the age of “Girls,” Amy and Tina, and Mallory Ortberg, female friendship and the power of the single woman are at an all-time high in the media. It’s been a joy to experience that independence and camaraderie first hand.
A few weeks ago, four of us stumbled out of a loud party in a frenetic blur. Buzzing with lots of energy and a little too much gin, we collected ourselves on Holyoke Street and watched our freshman selves exit the Owl basement, feeling older than we should. A joking suggestion to go for a joyride in a car one of us keeps on campus turned serious when we realized our designated driver was, in fact, entirely sober. Clad in formalwear, we piled into her car and sped off in pursuit of a midnight snack. We found it at Doughboy Donuts & Deli in Southie, an establishment described as “very Good Will Hunting” on Yelp, which at 2 a.m. on a Sunday mostly serves glazed pastries to heavily armed members of the Boston Police Department.
Between bites of a butternut donut and sips of iced tea, I watched the other three giggle and gesticulate wildly, and something hit me like a wave. They tell you that Harvard’s about the people, and they certainly are right. What they don’t tell you is exactly how those people, the ones who matter, will make you feel: whole again. As we drove back to Cambridge, one friend declared that this was exactly where she wanted to be in that moment, with this group of people. I couldn’t have agreed more.
And so dearest lady friends, as we often call ourselves, this is truly a love letter to you. In the face of personal disappointment and unrequited affection, family emergencies and endless embarrassing moments, it has been your open arms and biting humor that have held me up and kept me going. When I’m bedridden and senile, I hope it’s the mostly-rosy memories of you all that come flooding back. Memories of sunset bike rides back to the Quad, impromptu trips to Somerville and Savannah and Prague, summer weekends at the beach, morning power walks around Fresh Pond, rapid-fire group texts, Valentine’s Day at the Brattle Theater, and bottomless feasts of pad thai and cold beer. I don’t think I’ve said this enough over the past four years: Thank you for being my Harvard family, and, at this point, my real family too.

The actual movie version of college goes a little more like this. A group of young women sit at a table in a dining hall or Clover or, if it’s a Thursday night, Hillel. There are somewhere between three and seven of them. They’re usually dressed rather similarly: grey and navy sweaters, black pants, white sneakers, horn-rimmed glasses, waxed cotton coats, french braids and ponytails. There is laughter, uproarious laughter, laughter that makes your chest hurt and eyes water. They gossip, for hours at a time, swapping lurid stories about acquaintances at a breakneck pace. There’s a rhythm that an impartial observer might describe as exhausting, and a distinct vernacular: jobs are “yobs,” friends are “fronds,” and being single is really being “songle.” More often than not, a quick dinner stretches on for hours and homework is avoided. As darkness falls, they finally disperse for pressing commitments, voices lilting like fireflies fluttering in the night.
This film, of course, is as real as can be.

The total comes out to $4.78 for 13 books. On balance, a “good haul” for Richard Scarbrough, proprietor of Harvard Square’s honor system book table.
Today’s take skews chick-lit (“most of my customers are girls”) but also includes some less mainstream gems (“An Illustrated Guide to Cacti” and “Chinese Cooking: the Food and the Lifestyle” among them). All in all, Scarbrough estimates the expedition will net him 50 bucks.
We’ve just finished the check-out process at a factory outlet associated with a well-known chain of national thrift shops. If something doesn’t sell at the thrift store, it gets moved to the outlet. If, after about a day, nobody buys, then the item moves on to landfill.  It’s mid-morning on a Thursday, but there are easily over 50 people here intently rummaging through bins of clothing, furniture, DVD’s, Cassette tapes, and VHS’s.
But Scarbrough is really only interested in the four small dumpsters brimming with books. Turning them over in his hands for only a split second, Scarbrough either adds books to his bag or tosses them into a different tub. Occasionally, he stops to explain why he’s made a certain decision.
“So this book right here sells really fast because it’s about Massachusetts, by a popular writer. He wrote a book about Belmont,” Scarbrough says of Sebastien Junger’s “The Perfect Storm,” before ultimately pitching the too-tattered volume into the discard bin.
Unlike his book table in patrician Cambridge, which sits just opposite an expensive chocolatier and a pricey Italian clothing shop, the outlet is located in an economically depressed neighborhood, inside the yawning abyss of what clearly used to be a factory floor. Under the lazy, scalloped blades of industrial ceiling fans, customers mill about in an area about half the size of a regulation basketball court.
There are a few things Scarbrough keeps an eye out for: books that have recently become movies, books that have won any sort of prize, Oprah book club books, and Library bindings (which, unbeknownst to me, are hardcovers that have the covers printed on even below the book jacket).
Dressed in jeans, a black sweater-turtleneck hybrid, and a tartan scarf, Scarbrough cuts an odd figure alongside his fellow customers. Unlike most patrons, he is white, male, and (college journalist tag-along notwithstanding) alone. Only a couple other people poke around the book barrels, and most of them mechanically scan bar codes with their smartphones to check if the book is worth anything on Amazon. More often than not, it’s worth just one cent.
According to Scarbrough, most shoppers are here, like him, to find things they can quickly flip for a profit.
“This is the stuff that they’re throwing out at the Goodwill stores,” Storey says. “This is like the last gasp. But sometimes there’s real treasure in here.”
This last bottleneck before the landfill is nothing unique for a city. Scarbrough compares outlet shoppers like him to the Zabbaleen in Cairo, a group of mostly Coptic Christians. The city’s informal trash collectors, they make their living by sorting and reselling garbage.
“They collect all the trash, but then they also go through it and make a good living from that,” Scarbrough, who lists a pistol and a solid bar of silver among his best outlet finds, explains.
It’s either a sign of our culture’s stunning wealth or its immense wastefulness (probably both) that our scavenger/reseller class is sifting through books rather than discarded rubber or landfill.
But books are just the tip of the iceberg for Scarbrough, who says he broadly defines his profession as “arbitrage,” buying goods in one market and selling them for more in a different market (books, currency, furniture, and sometimes, but not so much recently, bitcoin).
“You know, you might as well act like you’re in prison and just always have a hustle. Always make some money on the side somehow,” Scarbrough says. “I’m involved in a million things. Not just books, but I trade all kinds of things.”
In Cambridge, as in similarly upscale urban areas, “hustlers” like Scarbrough are easy to ignore in the face of more noticeable extremes: the pregnant panhandler in front of the perennially-overpriced foodie coffee shop, homeless folks queuing up for a chance at a shelter bed yards from a store selling $7 ice-cream cones.
It’s harder to see people like Scarbrough, by his own description “semi-homeless” and often sleeping in his car to avoid the long drive to his tiny Western Mass. bookstore/apartment. But Scarbrough prefers it that way.
“I’m like sort of a solitary person,” he says. “I do my work.”

When Alexandra C. Tartaglia ’17 tells her friends she’s a conservative, they’re often surprised.  “How could you ever be conservative?” some ask. “Don’t you support women?”
For Tartaglia, this experience is not uncommon. “What’s never happened to me,” she explains, “is a friend just sitting down and saying, ‘Hey, I’m not conservative but I’m interested in knowing exactly why it is that you are.’”
Such inspired Tartaglia to found a chapter of the Network of Enlightened Women (NeW).
NeW is a national organization, and was founded in 2004 by Karin Agness, a conservative political commentator. While it originally began as a conservative book club at the University of Virginia, it now has more than 25 chapter at colleges around the country.
This March, Tartaglia met Agness through the Institute of Politics. NeW’s mission to “educate and train the next generation of conservative women leaders” along with its book list and national connections convinced Tartaglia that NeW might be the way to combat many of the problems she saw on campus.
Starting a conservative club on a predominantly liberal campus isn’t easy. Emily Hall ‘18, another founding member, said that it was “inherently challenging to found an organization where you have so few people who might identify with it.”
The already limited number of conservative women who may be interested in NeW are also often hard to find. “So many people feel that they have to be quiet about being conservative,” Hall says. At their first club meeting, about 10 women gathered to discuss “Disinherited: How Washington is Betraying America’s Young” by Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a conservative female author.
So far, NeW has about 30 sudents on its email list. Those who have expressed interest in NeW are not all adamantly conservative; some are looking to explore conservative opinions they feel are left out of their Harvard experience. “At Harvard, if you don’t find an organization like this,” Munoz warns, “you could be in an echo chamber of liberalism.” NeW strives to include diverse viewpoints and avoid becoming yet another echo chamber. “The only way you can...strengthen your opinions and strengthen your arguments is really by constantly challenging them,” Tartaglia explains.
NeW is looking to broaden its audience, however. “One of the main goals I have for NeW is not just to make this a place for conservatives but also for people who just want to challenge themselves and challenge their worldview,” Tartaglia says. “We want to be a space that’s open to people that are open.”
Despite its desire to have broader appeal, NeW is, at its core, designed to be a space for conservative women. To Munoz, who originally met Tartaglia through their sorority, Alpha Phi, the most appealing aspect of NeW was the access to “a community of girls that understood what you’re going through on a day to day basis.”
On a liberal campus with few conservative outlets, Munez says “the best word I can use for [NeW] is just: refreshing.”

Campus conversations about social spaces often surround a lineup of usual suspects, from dorm rooms to final clubs to Houses to Felipe’s rooftop and back. While these spaces may represent how most students at Harvard experience the party scene, some have turned to offbeat locations that are open a little later into the night.
While there is no universal definition of a “rave,” frequent attendees like Connor Cook ’17 say that a rave “feels more like a community organized thing. “It wouldn’t really be at a club,” Cook adds. “A lot of times it would be in some random warehouse or vacant building space… but community I think is a really big word. Even if you don’t know any of these people, everyone’s there to dance and have a good time.”
Peyten M. Sharp ’18 defines a rave as an event where “there’s a lot of EDM playing, people are dressed in like neon, or whatever they want to be dressed in. People dress for themselves, basically, so you can wear whatever you want,” Sharp says.
According to Harvard’s rave experts, the most important aspects of the events seem to be time and energy. Raves start late and they go on until the sun rises in the morning. Energy keeps rave-goers going—it takes stamina to dance for upwards of eight hours. “If you think about it on an energy scale or a metaphorical volume dial, a rave would definitely be in the max region with lots of gain... It’s definitely the energizer bunny-esque realm,” Lana A. D. Harris ’18 says. Sharp describes the energy level as “beyond hype,” while Cook describes the mindset as “I’m not done. I need to keep going.”
Students coming to Boston from areas where rave culture is more prevalent may be disappointed with the city’s offerings, though. With venues and clubs closing by 2 a.m., the city doesn’t prove to be conducive to super-late night activities. But students make do with what Boston does offer, and that seems to be a thriving music scene.
Electronic, House and Trance are the typical genres heard at raves, and while there aren’t any raves in Cambridge proper, venues around town frequently put on events featuring these types of artists. Cook regularly attends electronic shows in the area and emphasizes the culture of these events: “There is a community there.”
Sharp and some of his friends enjoy attend ing iExperia, which is at the House of Blues, and they do it once a semester…. It’s probably the closest thing to a rave in Boston,” he says. Cook, on the other hand, uses websites to keep track of rave-esque, one-time and late night events that take place in the area. This past weekend, he went to an event he found on a website called ResidentAdvisor.net, dedicated to advertising specialized, late night events. “The one I’m going to is organized by something called ‘Dusk ‘till Done,’” Cook says. “It’s at a secret location, so they don’t release the location until the night of,” he explains, a typical strategy for most of the events posted on websites.
Cook recalls another memorable rave he went to in London. A couple of Spaniards he was splitting a house rental with led him to a forested location 45 minutes outside of the city at around 1 a.m. What Cook describes next could only have happened in the funky, obscure world of raves.
“A glow stick trail leads you into the forest, and there was a clearing of full DJ setup, full lights, 100 to 200 people just in the middle of this forest,” he says. “I just danced till the next day.”

Seafood terrifies me. It always has. The taste (sweet, cloying, thick) makes me cringe. The scent (pungent, oily, sharp) makes me tremble. The texture (veiny, dense, taut) makes me weep. Mussels, oysters, prawns—I fear them all.
I try to keep quiet about my ichthyophobic leanings, though. I just want to be treated like everyone else. Luckily, this is pretty easy: College students can’t afford to go out for seafood, and nobody asks questions if I skip the Catch of the Day.
Then, last Monday, everything changed.
“Hey, Laura,” my editor asked. “Can you do a clam chowder tour of Cambridge?”
“No, thank you,” I said, fighting to suppress a surge of panic. “I take my fish oils in gummy form.”
She was unmoved. “Write it,” she said, a piscine gleam in her cold, glassy eyes.
1. Grafton Street
“Why Grafton Street?” you’re probably wondering. “That’s not a seafood place. Do they even have chowder there?”
Exactly.
I arrive on a Thursday at 3 p.m.—off hours—half hoping that they’ll have run out of food. Sure, New England clam chowder is on the menu, but supplies run low all the time.
Unfortunately, my soup arrives at record speed. “Your chowder!” my server announces, presenting me with a bowl the size of a child’s bathtub. I look pleadingly into her eyes. Unable or unwilling to probe the depths of my distress, she scurries away, leaving me only a packet of oyster crackers and a sudden awareness of my own fragile humanity. I am alone.
My chowder is glutinous and pale yellow, dotted with chunks of mysterious white and red. Fearful, I dip a spoon into the depths of the dish, probing for answers or at least the bottom of the bowl. I find neither.
“What is this stuff, anyway?” I say to no one.
“Don’t think,” says a voice deep in my head. “Only eat.”
It tastes like terror, with a hint of onion.
2. John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House 
By 4 p.m., I’m ready for round two. John Harvard’s is hardly a chowder joint, but it strikes me as marginally more nautical than Grafton Street. The brewery does, after all, serve calamari, cod, and fish and chips. It’s also slightly closer to the River. I can almost hear them—the clams!—gnashing and flapping in the fridge.
I approach the bar and sit next to an older man with an empty bowl. “What’s in the New England clam chowder?” I ask him.
“Blood. Sweat. Clams,” says the man, with a thousand-yard stare. He’s seen the other side of the bowl. I nod and flag down a server.
My chowder comes in a little china bowl with a saucer. Chives dot the lumpy surface. The man and I clink bowls like teacups, disrupting the chives and burying them in the chowder’s creamy depths. I tip the bowl to my lips.
Clams. I taste clams. My eyes shoot open.
“You can do it, Laura,” the man murmurs encouragingly. “You’ve come so far. Don’t quit now.”
He’s right. I straighten my back and take a second bite, and then a third, spooning faster and faster until my body tenses up and I quit, dropping my spoon with a clatter into the empty bowl.
Empty?
 3. Legal Sea Foods 
Emotionally drained and physically bloated, I approach my final destination.
Inside, Legal Sea Foods smells faintly of the sea. Anchors and compasses line the dark oak walls. Weathered sailors crowd the long oak bar, clinking grog and spinning yarns. A door in the back swings open with a bang, and a burly fisherman staggers out of the kitchen, a clam the size of a small dog thrashing desperately in his embrace.
I blink. The server proceeds calmly down the aisle, platter of wriggling shellfish in hand. Warily, I take a seat, and place my order for the third and final time. “New England clam chowder, please,” I say. He nods, grave.
When the bowl comes, I stare into its chowdery depths. The chowdery depths stare back.
“Pull yourself together,” the diced potatoes whisper. “You’ve been training for this.”
“Strong as the sea,” the black pepper sighs.
The surface of my chowder boils and churns. “You’ll never win,” the clams jeer.
Closing my eyes, I plunge my spoon into the heart of the bowl, so hard I hear the muffled clink of stainless steel against ceramic. The chowder meets my tongue in slow motion. The moment takes on a shocking clarity, my brain and my taste buds sharp as a gooseneck barnacle.
That night I dream of clams, those squishy bivalves from hell, mouths snapping and clacking in a cacophony of chitinous, aquatic loathing.
The chewing sounds echo my own.

Photographs of Dr. Alexander Hamilton Rice Jr., class of 1898, are pretty much exactly what you’d expect.
A sepia tint of Rice in an unnamed exotic locale portrays the quintessential turn-of-the-century explorer. Squinting eyes hovering over a full white beard and mustache, Rice sports a wide-brimmed hat to shield him from the sun beating down on the makeshift camp. Rice, a wealthy Amazon adventurer, smiles and gazes somewhere out of frame, an imperialist hero straight out of Kipling.
Rice spent much of the first quarter of the 20th century exploring and mapping swaths of the Amazonian basin, a pursuit that would bring him glory, fame, an honorary third degree from Harvard, and the hand of Titanic survivor Eleanor Elkins Widener, who met Rice at Harvard when she bequeathed the library named for her drowned son. In 1929, Rice made a donation of his own, adding Divinity Ave. to his growing list of conquests by founding the Harvard Institute of Geographical Exploration.
Over the next two decades, the Institute launched several expeditions to various unexplored corners of the world and came back with new maps. Courses in cartography, aerosurveying, field communications, and “exploration in general” were offered, reported the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Perhaps most importantly, the Institute amassed a collection of mapping tools to rival any in the world: some 102,000 maps, 20,000 books on exploration, and a variety of cartographical instruments.
In concert with Harvard’s already formidable Geography Department, the independently operated Institute put Harvard near the center of the mapmaking world. But by the late ’40s, things had changed and the department closed.
“So there’s some scandal involved and some politics,” David Weimer says, a specialist at Harvard’s Map Collection. “Depending on who you ask about it, they’ll emphasize different parts.”
There are three theories.
The first is one of divisive interdepartmental politics. At the time, the field of geography was undergoing a schism from which many believed it could not recover: While some geographers were staunch believers in a more traditional, geology- and topography-based approach to study, others, including head of Harvard’s Geography Department Derwent Stainthorpe Whittlesey, practiced “human geography”—a more blurry (and, at times, ethically questionable) discipline that attempted to more or less link racial and ethnic differences to contingencies of geographic location. (In the ’40s, Whittlesey published papers on the “Environmental Foundations of European History” and “German strategy of world conquest,” among others.) As the divide grew, professors became entrenched, and squabbling for resources and academic superiority brought the department to a close.
The second theory comes straight out of a spy novel: “People say it was a part of the Cold War—the CIA wanted to be in charge of mapmaking,” Weimer says, so the government shuttered Harvard’s department.
The third and most widely accepted theory is something uglier. In the mid-20th century, a number of Harvard’s geography professors—including Whittlesey—were gay. The story goes that, to avoid openly firing the professors, Harvard quietly disbanded their department. The closure of Geography as a study at Harvard touched off a wave of similar moves at universities across the country; effectively, for some, it was the death of a field.
To this day, the circumstances around the end of the Geography Department remain shrouded in uncertainty. The excuse given to the Crimson in 1948 seems almost comically unspecific and dismissive.
“Harvard cannot hope to have strong departments in everything,” the University is reported to have said. In any case, Geography was gone for good.
Or so it seemed.
MAP COLLECTION
The closures of the Geographical Institute and Geography Department, of course, did not signal the end of cartography-related pursuits at Harvard (just as it failed to bring an end to interdepartmental squabbling or gay professors).
The back rooms of Harvard’s Map Collection in the subterranean levels of Lamont are a trove of all things cartographical. Shallow metal drawers (from standard to “ultrasize”) contain neat piles of maps and charts dating back as far as 1493. Rolled-up wall maps stack all the way to the ceiling, looking for all the world like ancient scrolls containing some obscure magic. One room is full of atlases—some 20,000 of them—ranging in size from a deck of cards to massive poster-sized leather tomes.
The underground archive is not without some whimsy, as well. In the atlas room, there are two boxes full of postcards from around the world and across time that no one has gotten around to reading yet. There is also, delightfully, an “Official Map of the Harvard Map Collection” hanging on one wall, helpfully discrediting the many Imposter Maps of the Harvard Map Collection which doubtless abound.
When Rice’s Geographical Institute was dissolved, its holding of maps and map-related objects were absorbed into the already formidable Harvard library collection and now make their home amongst the Collection’s half million maps and atlases. This collection started in 1818 upon the donation of a wealthy maps merchant, says Weimer.
Weimer is the collection’s newest hire. He works, he tells me, on “vision, visualizations, and space”—in part looking at maps for the blind whose mountains and valleys and borders are physically embossed into the page, creating slightly 3D maps which can be tactilely read.
Among the Collection’s holdings, there are early outlines of the Yard inked in spidery hand, maps of Africa looped over with ornamental arabic, facsimile mappa mundi depicting monstrous human-beasts in unexplored corners, globes Mercator, atlases Ptolemaic.
Today, some of those maps are being taken to new frontiers.
UNCHARTED
Harvard’s Center for Geographic Analysis is surprisingly difficult to find.
Nestled in the basement of CGIS Knafel building, the collection of monitor-lined offices is perhaps a far cry from Rice’s literal brick-and-mortar institution and even from the labyrinthine archives of the Map Collection.
But here, too, there’s cartography at work which that likely astound Rice. Monitors at the Center’s main entrance display brilliantly lit, pulsating digital maps. On one, feathery white lines representing wind sweep across the continental U.S. in real time; on another, world cities emit ominous spears of light at one another while a scrolling stream of data below logs the impacts.
Professor of Anthropology Jason Ur is the faculty director of the CGA, a support network for students and faculty undertaking geographic and spatial research.
“Students and faculty are interested in using these digital tools, but they don’t know how to,” Ur says. “But they have these questions. For us, we’re interested in the questions coming first.”
Ur also co-teaches Anthropology 2020, an archaeology course in which students overlay old inked maps, many from the Collection, with high-tech satellite and computer images to pinpoint potential archaeological sites. The result is a layered image where “peeling” back each layer reveals different strata of history.
In the constellation of pixels that emerges, Ur’s students are able to effectively build maps of not just place but also time. “We’re trying to bring all of this together so that we can have a very rich mapping of the modern landscape, but [also] the past landscape,” Ur says. One of his students is working on locating Aztec settlements today buried beneath the urban bustle of Mexico City, another on Viking-era settlements dotted along the edges of massive Greenland glaciers.
For Weimer and Ur, the shuttering of the Geography department in 1948 still casts a shadow.
“Geography is important,” Ur says. “This is something that you’d never guess from being at Harvard since we don’t have a geography department.”
In Weimer and Ur’s work, there are echoes of a philosophy which would have been familiar to those Harvard geography founders, even if the technologies they use would have been alien. Ultimately, Ur comes down on a side that perhaps both Rice—Panama hat and charting implements in hand—and Whittlesey—tying the peculiarities of topography to the turbulence of history—might have approved of.
“Increasingly, especially as these new digital tools become available, in the social sciences and the humanities, scholars are realizing that geography matters,” Ur says. “It’s not really possible to approach these questions without a good set of tools.”

Three decades after the then-obscure scientist Charles Darwin quietly sketched his now-famous finches aboard the HMS Beagle in the Galapagos, influential Harvard professor Louis Rodolphe Agassiz set out with much greater fanfare on a lesser-known expedition. In 1865, Agassiz and his wife, accompanied by a small group of Harvard scientists and students, set sail from New York to Rio de Janeiro on The Colorado.
In a lecture en route to Brazil, Agassiz challenged Darwin’s revolutionary theory of evolution on the grounds that the theory relied too much on argument and too little on fact. Agassiz posited that evolution was not plausible according to the geologic record. The trip to Brazil was an attempt to disprove Darwin once and for all. Agassiz saw in the unique biodiversity of Brazil a perfect laboratory to test his counter-theories of phylogenetic embryology and glacial catastrophe in the tropics.
But for Agassiz, the trip to Brazil was about more than science. Not only was evolution—a process not immediately observable to the human eye—deeply antithetical to Agassiz’s staunch empiricism, evolution was profoundly at odds with his perceived world order. Though only moderately religious, Agassiz believed in the existence of a creator in all his work. Fortunately for Agassiz, this belief fit well with comparative zoology, which at the time focused heavily on hierarchal classification.
Agassiz applied this penchant for classification to his views on race. Part of the expedition involved sketching and describing mixed-race Brazilians. Agassiz saw the rampant miscegenation in Brazil as a “mongrelization” of pure racial types that would ultimately result in sterility. Agassiz categorized humans into different “species.” In his book on the Brazil trip, Agassiz notes, “the fact that [the races] differ by constant permanent features is in itself sufficient to justify a comparison between the human races and animal species.”
Director of David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Brian D. Farrell says that Agassiz’s trip typified the paternalistic approach of Latin American studies at the time. In an essay appended to his wife’s travelogue, “Journey in Brazil,” Agassiz gives his general impressions on Brazilian society and suggestions for improvement. Though he felt a “warm sympathy, a deep-rooted belief in her future progress and prosperity,” he didn’t see “among them something of the stronger and more persistent qualities of the Northern races”—a distinction that fit his divided view of nature—“as ancient as the tropical and temperate zones themselves.”
For Agassiz, the expedition was also profoundly personal. Agassiz’s founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in 1859 coincided with the publishing of the momentous “On the Origin of Species.”
The high point of Agassiz’s professional career and physical culmination of his particular brand of empirical pedagogy in a museum also marked the beginning of a professional fall from grace. At the time of the expedition, Darwin’s theory of evolution had gained significant intellectual traction at Harvard. According to Museum of Comparative Zoology director and OEB professor Jim Hanken, even the students in the unofficial Agassiz Zoological Society (a kind of Agassiz fan club) were beginning to embrace Darwin’s theories.
Hanken describes Agassiz as a “sensational figure in his day” for his unique pedagogy which combined engaging lectures with specimen-based study. One of Agassiz’s students, Samuel Scudder, wrote that on his first day of class Agassiz simply gave him a fish to describe and draw. After three days, Scudder turned in his assignment. A nonplussed Agassiz advised him to “look again. Look again!”
Under the patronage of Nathaniel Thayer and Emperor of Brazil Pedro II, Agassiz set out on his  16-month long expedition to Brazil with the aim of proving Darwin wrong. According to Louis Menand’s “Metaphysical Club,” Agassiz got a hero’s welcome in Rio, even though he arrived with his entire academic career at stake.
Agassiz travelled along Amazon for over 2,000 miles. Over the course of the trip, more than 80,000 specimens were collected and shipped to the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge. In his final lecture,  Agassiz claimed that the fact that fish do not migrate upstream disproved Darwin’s idea of evolution by exposure to different environments. His unlikely observations drew criticism from his colleagues, and his findings were disproved shortly after publication. Agassiz’s attempt to save his career became its death knell.
In Farrell’s mind, Agassiz “saw what he wanted to see.” The autocratic Agassiz, darling of the Boston intelligentsia and the face of American professional science, never acknowledged his mistakes.
Among the students in Agassiz’s lectures was future psychologist and philosopher Henry James, who was largely disgusted by the way Agassiz’s biases infused his passion and professed empiricism. In James’s view, according to Menand, Agassiz should have opened possibilities for inquiry in Brazil rather than try to close them. James also believed that science was never properly independent of a society’s interests and preferences—no one could ever profess pure empiricism.
On his deathbed, the man who failed to see the truth in Darwin’s theory was asked to name his greatest achievement. His response? “I have taught men to observe.”

“Every day there’s somebody who walks in with their jaw literally to the floor,” Ashley Graham tells me. Graham is describing the customer experience at “Bodega,” a corner store nestled on a side street in Downtown Boston, whose shelves hold Jarritos sodas, Frosty Flakes, and a sign that reads “God Hates Streetwear.”
As far as traditional general stores go, Bodega is gastronomically underwhelming, with no sandwiches, candy, or even flavored contraception to offer. “I wouldn’t recommend you buy food, ‘cause it’s been there since like 2006,” employee Oscar Aquino laments from behind the cash register. But Bodega’s culinary woes are not due to a lack of customers or poor inventory, since Bodega is not, in fact, a functioning bodega. The grocery store is a front for a much cooler operation. 

When customers approach the Snapple vending machine towards the back of the store, the wall slides open, and guests are teleported into a radically different environment: a luxury sneaker and streetwear shop. 
The walls and drawers are filled with gold shoes, $250 hoodies, $70 plain t-Shirts, and anything else you could imagine a super cool 15-year-old—or a slightly less cool 25-year-old—wearing. Customers eagerly comb through these racks of clothing, equal parts giddy and self-satisfied. The layout of the store is ripe for a Jason Bourne action sequence, but the vibe is more Wes Anderson than Anderson Silva.
Escobar explains that the concept for Bodega comes from similar corner stores in New York City, where “you have to know a password or you have to know somebody in order to get behind [and] gamble or buy illegal car parts and stuff.” As Taylor Swift once said after moving to The Big Apple, “You can get almost anything in a bodega.” Who knew that a sick pair of kicks is on that list? 
Many guests do not realize Bodega’s true identity until they’ve spent a significant amount of time in the store—a trend that breeds confusion and entertainment. “I remember this one girl came with her boyfriend, and she knew this was Bodega, and he didn’t know,” Aquino says. “So he was just looking around, and she walked right through [the Snapple vending machine], and the door closed. He was like, ‘Where’d my girlfriend go?’ And I’m looking at him like, ‘What you talking about?’ And he was just creeped out.” According to Aquino, the man left the store thinking his girlfriend had disappeared. 
Once you become aware of of Bodega’s identity, though, hints of what makes the store special reveal themselves. There’s the ironic aforementioned “God Hates Streetwear” sign behind the cash register; there are employees DJing as they sit nonchalantly in the front of the store; there’s even a distinct sense of conspiracy amongst everyone in the know. 
“Inside and out, it’s a dope atmosphere,” Aquino says. “There’s no other store like this in the world, so people are very attracted to this place.”
As Escobar puts it, Bodega is cool because it is “hidden in plain sight.”

From student IDs to the flags in the Yard, Harvard’s seals appear everywhere. Each of the University’s various branches has its own, from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—which unveiled a new design in 2007—to the Law School, which recently came under heavy scrutiny because of its apparent connection to slavery.
Despite this public controversy, few have heard of the man behind the seals: Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, a celebrated heraldry expert and member of the Class of 1895. While serving on the Committee on Arms, Seal, and Diplomas, he designed the seals of all the graduate schools and most of the residential colleges of the University. “[Rose] had a vocation,” his obituary in The Crimson reads, “heraldry. His ability and knowledge were of the first order, and his consequent reputation was international.”
La Rose’s fascination with family history didn’t come out of nowhere. His parents allegedly changed his name from Peter Ross to better represent their French heritage. La Rose inherited their interest: After Harvard, he would spend time reconstructing his family tree on the walls of his rooms. According to his obituary, “He was proud of an ancient French lineage, and his walls were hung with old family portraits.”
After studying at Phillips Exeter Academy, la Rose enrolled in Harvard College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1895. On the surface, he was a typically overcommitted Harvard student, joining the Hasty Pudding, the Signet Society, and the Harvard Monthly. He was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa, supposedly “without ever taking a single lecture-note.”
His freshman year roommate, Daniel G. Mason, respected la Rose’s excellent taste. “Of all my friends,” he wrote in 1936, “he had the surest nose for the best, whether in letters, music, the graphic arts, or the more general arts of life.” He would observe as la Rose pontificated about “doctrinal subtleties” of the Bible to his close friends, played piano in their suite, or energetically officiated at tea gatherings held in their room, chatting about a range of topics and often carrying the conversation. In contrast, la Rose’s passion for the “graphic arts” shone through when he was alone. He spent much of his free time designing and perfecting bookplates, or the personalized designs printed in the inside covers of books.
After graduating, la Rose taught in the English Department at Harvard for seven years before resigning in 1902. For the next three decades, he would occupy himself writing literary and artistic criticism, mostly, anonymously or under a pseudonym.
In 1933, he would put his heraldic skills to use. As a member of the Committee on Arms, Seal, and Diplomas, which was created to review the history of Harvard seals in preparation for the University’s tricentennial celebration, la Rose embarked on a project to create designs for the new seals. For the residential colleges, he drew inspiration from the family seals of the individuals after which the colleges were named. His compositions were often derived from the family seals of the benefactors of the different schools.
Eighty years later, this practice has generated some controversy. The Law School’s seal, which is derived from the slaveholding Royall family’s coat of arms, was conceived in memory of Isaac Royall, whose gift endowed the first professorship in law at Harvard. After much deliberation, the Harvard Corporation discarded this design in March and is currently in the process of drafting a new one.
Other seals have been updated to reflect transitions in the institutions themselves. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences debuted its new seal in 2007. Its design is based on la Rose’s but reflects the growth of SEAS from a division to a school.
La Rose could not have anticipated the many changes and controversies that would surround his creations. He lived a quiet life near Harvard Yard, in what is now the Knafel building. Although he interacted regularly with the students and faculty, he was regarded as lonely and spent much of his time in isolation. Before he died, he commented on the ever changing nature of the institution, perplexed at its ability to morph and yet remain the same.

I was in high school the first time I fell in love. I quickly found that this romantic love was very similar to the platonic love I had with friends or family. As I wanted for them, I wanted her to be happy and wanted to comfort her and understand her. I wanted to be comforted by her, too, and share my insecurities with her.
The new part of love came after a year-and-a-half. I found myself falling out of love. How could I have gone from loving someone to snubbing someone, from warm kisses to cold hugs, from joyful to fearful?
I remember clearly one afternoon—we were lying in my bed and I began to feel an urge to run away. Not in the way one runs away from a tiger, but from a crime scene. It was fear. It was the same feeling I get when I walk into a test unprepared, or the moment after the wine glass slips from my hand. Thinking back to high school, it was the same feeling I got when the police would come through the park my friends and I used to hang out in at night, and we ran away from them and their flashlight beams. I was scared then, in my room, and I didn’t tell her. I let the first iceberg melt. While I was doing that, she probably turned to me and said something like: “Hey, you’re pretty cute.”
And then came the slow dissolution, the underwater run away. At first, I did what most people would do. I ignored the feeling I had. I would snap out of it, I told myself. I’m a good person, I told myself. I thought if I tried hard enough, the good feelings would come back. I sent more “I love you” texts and spent more lunches talking about her life, which I found more and more uninteresting.
Looking her in the eye became harder. I felt like I was lying to her all the time—every sentence, even the ones that could not be lies (like, “Practice was good today!” or “I’m having pasta for dinner”) felt like they were. Everything I did with her felt wrong.
I remember the first time we found ourselves uncomfortably silent together. We were out to lunch at Eunice’s Café, eating turkey sandwiches. She’d look at me and I’d give a half smile to tell her it was alright. Afterwards when we were walk back to school, she started crying. “You always talk,” she said.
When we finally broke up, we hadn’t spoken in almost two weeks. When we met for “the talk” I kissed her hello, and then when I saw her to her car, I gave her a hug. I did not like that hug. We talked about how it wasn’t working. We talked about growing apart. Yet had we changed that much? We seemed like the same people, so how could the same people be at one point so in love and in the next so out of it? Was it all just a hormonal trick? Were we actually just from the start incompatible?
I look back now at my texts from around that time. I was so mean. She would send me kind and worried messages, full of love and insecurity. They all went along the lines of—“Please talk to me, did I do something wrong? I just want you to go back to the way you were before.” I would respond, “It’s fine.” Or “nothing’s wrong.” Six months after we broke up, she texted me to say happy birthday and I didn’t even respond.
Why does love change so violently? Why do divorced people scream at each other and fight in court over nothing? Why is the world filled with estranged spouses? Why is it every time I think about her, I’m on-edge and want to run away? My reality and these examples are extremely different cases of a similar phenomenon in love. It’s as if all the intense emotions are in the same part of the brain.
My first relationship taught me how dangerously irrational and unstable love is and how flawed people are—or at least how flawed I am. I can wake up one day and stop liking a person. Then all I can do is try to explain myself in retrospect. Maybe it’s the clash of chemicals. Maybe it’s a brain defect. Maybe it’s what I ate that morning. Or maybe I’m scared because I failed at love, and every time I see her I see my failure.

Heading west out of Boston along Route 2 will take you—eventually, when the mingled sights of wood and water by the roadside have just begun to bore—to the town of Petersham, Mass., home to the Harvard Forest.
The forest’s main entrance, a sloping driveway that leads up to a long brick building housing administrative facilities and a museum, stands like a bulwark before the rambling mass of the woods. Paths broad and thin lead outward, along curt fields and by white colonial homes that shelter researchers and students.
I arrive early one day—the researcher I’ve arranged to meet is still an hour out—and go for a walk with Tom, the photographer. The path we choose is broad, of tamped earth. We pass a group of students from Quincy House on a weekend outing, shooting bows and arrows at nothing by a maple syrup distillery, its planed pine siding gray with age. Turning, we walk by a sawmill; gargantuan stacks of logs, their severed ends patchy-white with the drippings of their sap, rest deeply in the grass. In front of the mill, arranged in geometrical ranks, a fleet of solar panels face the sky.
The path we follow is deep-set, traced and trod endlessly. It’s a cold day, and the muddy divots that dot the road are edged with frost. A golden streak of dribbled sawdust occasionally enlivens the center of the path. Wiry palisades of weed and bush jut out from the verge. Strips of birch bark, white as bandages, stipple the path. More than a century old, the Harvard Forest still bears traces of its past—stone fences, ancient oaks. Yet changes have come, too, subtle but significant. In the past few decades, the forest has come to play host to invasive species and parasites, like garlic mustard, the wooly adelgid, and southern pine beetles. Its growing seasons have lengthened, and its average temperatures have increased. The hemlocks are dying, and new, thinner growth has only recently begun to fill the voids left by fires.

Then, there are the traces of the researchers studying these changes: the solar panels, the neon ribbons that denote foliage, the occasional humming metal box that funnels electricity to stations throughout the woods. A few weeks from now, the forest will be crowded. Researchers will arrive from all over the world, mingling with graduate students, undergraduates, daytrippers, hikers, and nature enthusiasts; they will note the effects of climate change in the forest and attempt to make sense of them.
But the woods are very quiet now. Only the sound of a chickadee and its drooping, half-step cry. Out of nowhere, walking toward us, we spy two women, middle-aged. They signal us and ask if we’re coming from the road.

As far as its mission is concerned, the Harvard Forest has changed little during its 100-year existence. Founded in 1907 as a research and field laboratory for students and as a model of sustainable forestry, the forest continues to fulfill these aims. Today, students can research at the forest over the summer, and many groups, like the students in Quincy, visit for short trips.
“The goal was always to be a remote part of Harvard that could fully immerse students and faculty in the New England landscape,” David R. Foster, the current director of the forest, explains. “That was the intent in 1907, and that’s what it currently is as well.”
Foster assumed the directorship in 1990, though his relationship with the forest extends as far back as 1983, when he became an assistant professor of biology at Harvard. In his nearly 30 years as director, he hasn’t seen the forest change so much as he’s witnessed the broader research world attempting to catch up.
“In many ways, the forest was established in advance of its perfect role,” he explains. “[The founders] knew that intensive, local, long-term research was important. What’s happened in the last 30 years is that the whole globe has come to realize the same thing.”
This highly particular approach, grounded in a specific environ, is one that Foster has long championed. “All the [climate change] research that goes on should be really strongly grounded in local places, in very intensive local research,” he says. “You have to go into whatever landscape you’re going to be working in and realize that where you are is just one point in time, and there’s this whole flow of history that has shaped what you’re seeing. And you have to begin to explore that.”
One of the unique aspects of the New England landscape, as Foster points out, is its melding of the cultural and the natural. The Harvard Forest itself, like many forests in New England, shows evidence of its past as farmland. Centuries ago, the land was cleared for agriculture. When farms began to disappear in the middle of the 19th century, nature reclaimed the land, resulting in the forest of today, a thicket of new growth spotted with old stone fences and paths once used in farming.
The Harvard Forest’s importance to global climate change research, as it stands today, derives from its long history and extensive backlog of both natural and manmade change. “The great advantage that we have is more than 100 years of measurements and observations that we can bring to bear to understand what’s happening today,” Foster says. “When you look at long-term ecological research, there are new programs that are addressing this, and we’ve got 100 years of perspective to bring to that.”
But the forest does more than just export a particular research method. Its extensive record of scientific data aids research the world over. “With the forest, there’s a complete openness for anybody anywhere—student, public citizen, or world class scientist—to come and do research here,” Foster explains. “And no matter who you are or what you do, all of your data and information gets collected and embedded into an archive that’s available to the entire world.”

According to former Interim Dean of the College and professor of systematic botany Donald H. Pfister, the Harvard Forest provides unique resources for researchers engaged in hurricane tracking, tower monitoring, and soil warming investigations among other types of studies. “I have several colleagues involved in cutting edge research there,” Pfister says.

Julia A. Wheeler studies the small things.
At the moment, she is kneeling by a ribboned-off plat of leaves, inspecting the lonesome sprigs of red maple that shoot up from the greater gray. She looks for bite-marks—the angled snips of deer, the furry stripping of mouse-teeth—and points them out when she finds them.

The maples seem a sorry sight. A foot or two in height, nearly all have been nibbled at. The color of the saplings, dense from overwintering, is unpromising, at least to the novice’s eye.
But it’s not animal browsing that worries Wheeler. With unpredictable temperatures this spring, sudden chills after sudden warmth, many plants have been tricked into budding too soon. “We’re basically here to check damage,” she says. “Because the maples were bud-swelling, ready to put out their leaves—and that’s when they become vulnerable to cold.” With some species, Wheeler explains, you could place the winter-hardened buds in liquid nitrogen, and they’d come out still alive, still waiting for warmth. It is the first attempt at growth that is a gamble, when the sensitive, striving material of buds can be killed by a frost, by a long cold night.
But for the most part, the maples seem to have weathered well. As Wheeler hops about, crouches, looks, and cradles the slender wood, she exalts: “Beautiful!” Or: “Wonderful!”
Wheeler is Canadian by birth (crooning Os crop up sporadically in her speech). She did her undergraduate work in marine ecology at Memorial University in Newfoundland before making the leap to plant ecology in Labrador. From there she went to Switzerland and took her Ph.D. at the University of Basel; she subsequently worked with the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, studying the alpine arctic willow—a tiny thing, she says, pressing her two thumbs together: “About the size of two thumbnails.”
Wheeler’s work in the Harvard Forest is concerned with phenology—the measuring of climate change’s effects on annual phenomena, as budding or flowering. Beyond the red maples, she’s also here to examine a few patches of garlic mustard, an invasive species that has been present in North America for roughly 150 years. Wheeler has been studying how plants like garlic mustard have reacted to the changing climate: how fast they’ve spread in higher temperatures, for instance, and where exactly they’ve spread. In many instances, climate change might accelerate the diffusion of invasive species.
With shorter growing seasons comes an understandable danger: Plants produce fewer leaves, they photosynthesize less, and as a result less and less carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere. If a sudden cold comes on and damages emerging buds, the plant will produce fewer leaves, and the problem is exacerbated. With increasingly variable growth seasons becoming a standard reality, the interactions of native species and garlic mustard—which is poised to take advantage of shorter growing windows—need to be understood.
The SWAN (Soil Warming and Nitrogen) plots are a set of 24 three-by-three meter plots engaged in what’s known as a factorial field experiment—essentially, the interactions of multiple elements are examined in conjunction with one another. Some of the plots have been dosed with extra nitrogen; others are warmed an extra five degrees Celsius by buried cables; the red maples and garlic mustard share their ground with other plant life, even, in a few plots, colonies of ants, as small flags stuck in the ground make clear.
Crouching down, Wheeler brushes back a mat of leaves and points to a purplish burst of leafage: a tuft of garlic mustard, its tendrils shriveled-looking, its leaves clearly veined. It seems an insignificant blot in the matte mass of leaves, but, as Wheeler explains, it’s a clever plant, and well-equipped to harm its neighbors. Like all good invasive species, garlic mustard comes equipped with sundry unfair advantages. It’s capable of photosynthesizing during the winter, which allows it to get a head start when the growth season begins in earnest; it couples this precocity with the deployment of phytochemicals, which it pushes out through its roots, that inhibit the ability of nearby plants to absorb water and nutrients.
Though the experiment may seem small-scale or picayune, Wheeler insists that it’s unique, a project only possible in a research institution like the Harvard Forest. “It’s the sort you can only set up when you have the infrastructure available for it,” she says. “You need water; you need electricity—it just makes things logistically simpler when you have a very nice field research system.” In addition to the boon of material resources, Wheeler cites the forest’s community as a key resource—in the summertime, undergraduates and researchers come from all over the world to work and study.
One of those researchers, Anne Pringle, who is currently an associate professor of botany and bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, points out that not all invasive species are necessarily dangerous—besides, they provide good models of research for changes in biodiversity, in landscapes, and in the movement of species across environs. She notes, though, that garlic mustard does not fall into this gray area. It’s particularly dangerous, she says, because it has “the potential to disrupt natural environments and plant growth.”
As we exit the SWAN plots, Wheeler seems to be a in a good mood (cries of “Ah, poor maples!” were heard only sparingly). She looks up at the trees and gives us a reminder: “The stuff I tend to work on is very low to the ground,” she says. “But in plant ecology you can work on a lot of different levels.”
“The scale I have to think on is so small,” she says, before pointing up: “It’s easier to work when you don’t have to climb up there.”

For decades now, John F. O’Keefe ’67 has kept to the same path.
Every four or five days in the springtime, he comes out to the forest and notes the status of buds. His trees, scattered along a rambling path through the woods, are marked with pink and black flagging. He looks for leaf-out, his chosen signifier of growth.
With his tan winter cap, clean white beard above silver-lined spectacles, and earthen-hued jacket and pants, O’Keefe resembles a gnome ambling through the alternating sunlight of the forest. Since 1990, he has annually observed many of the same trees. Some, of course, have died. When this happens, O’Keefe replaces them with similarly situated specimens, under the guiding philosophy that, for many intents and purposes, a tree is a tree. He has gradually stockpiled a long-term dataset that acts as a sort of backbone to other research taking place in the forest.
Normally, O’Keefe would not start making visits to the forest until early April. This year, he made a few trips in late March because the winter had been mild, but when a cold snap hit he postponed the rest of his planned visits. “What I think that weather points out,” he says, “is that what climate change really means is more extremes.” Though this past year was the warmest on record worldwide, O’Keefe explains, “What we’re also seeing is more variability.”
O’Keefe’s phenological observation work with buds underscores general trends in the forest. Though damaged buds mean a plant will likely take up less carbon dioxide during the growth season, O’Keefe has actually seen earlier springs with the passing years, and lengthening growth seasons, in which plants are removing increasingly more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While this may seem at first blush like a benefit, it introduces new problems, among them the availability of other resources necessary for growth, like water. In addition, it’s unclear how different species will react to longer growth seasons and earlier springs—a delicate balance might be upset.
In essence, O’Keefe’s notes provide a grounding in particulars, a reference log that helps corroborate, complicate, or make real the claims and research of other scientists in the forest. Nowadays, he continues his observations under contract for OEB professor Andrew Richardson, who works with phenocams—cameras, set about the woods, that track leaf canopy development. As O’Keefe explains, his notes provide another way of looking at data; they are malleable; they could almost contribute to any project. It’s difficult to say how his observations will be used in the future. The important thing is to keep recording.
O’Keefe’s extended observations speak to a great strength of the forest as a research resource—research projects within the forest have a long history, the backlogs of data are extensive, and this extension is understandably critical when one attempts to draw conclusions about long-term developments. “It’s probably one of the better ways to track the plant community’s response to climate change,” he says of his own observations. “It’s such a variable from year to year—with all that annual weather noise—you need a really long-term dataset to actually track any climate signal.”
O’Keefe’s metric is simple. He checks the progress of leaf growth, and when 50 percent of the leaves have come out, he marks it down. While other researchers might parse phenophases, O’Keefe believes that full leaf emergence is the most useful and important data point to track.
His observation walk is ponderous. O’Keefe stops abruptly to inspect nondescript wayside foliage and jot notes down on a datasheet, then he moves a few feet forward and repeats the process. Every now and then he cants back his head and raises a pair of neck-slung binoculars to his eyes and attempts to discern, against the noontime sun, tiny buds wavering 50 feet above. He looks up nowadays because he once looked down.
At Harvard College, O’Keefe concentrated, because he didn’t want to concentrate in anything at all, in the now defunct catch-all subject of Social Relations. After spending two years with the Peace Corps in Lesotho, he returned to an America still embroiled in the Vietnam War. He joined the Massachusetts Air National Guard and spent six years as a pilot.
“What got me interested in forest ecology was flying over New England, looking down and it’s all forest—well, it got me intrigued.” He began to take ecology courses through the Harvard Extension School, moved on to graduate school, and eventually ended up as Director of the Harvard Forest’s Fischer Museum.
Though his email signature clearly identifies him as retired, he stumbles every now and then, describing his current state of employment as something more like semi-retirement. In many ways, O’Keefe seems habit-bound. Though the construction of an upstream weir several years ago has made stream observations essentially unnecessary, O’Keefe continues to take notes on flow rates, on obstructions. “It’s something I got used to doing,” he says, “so I just keep it up.” He takes a pleasure in seeing, in noting the forest’s myriad subtle tells. For instance: “When the leaves emerge on the trees, and they start drawing up water, you see a drop in the flow of streams.”
Everything catches his eye. Behind his glasses, a refined form of vision is at work. He identifies endlessly: Here is shadbush. White birch. Witch-hazel. When I absentmindedly remove a fork of needles from a bush, he notices and calls out, “Red pine,” because the needles of that tree, tellingly, grow in pairs. With time spent in the woods has come sight, or a new form of it.
“Having done this for 27 years, you get to observe things pretty closely,” O’Keefe says. “You learn a lot just from that, and just by walking the same loop again. You notice subtle changes that would otherwise go by you.” As if to prove his point, he directs my attention to a small rug of mayflowers—a splash of green and little more—in which are hidden soft, shadowed blue blooms that give off a briskly sweet scent. “It’s really unobtrusive. I probably didn’t notice it for the first five or six years,” he laughs, before continuing: “And then I did.”
O’Keefe’s steady output has become more and more important: “In 1990, I don’t think he anticipated the significance his work would have,” says Plotkin. “I think in the past few years its importance has really blossomed.”
At a certain point we take a left off the main road and enter into an older section of the forest, one that’s now been closed to ordinary hikers, because the hemlocks that populate it have been beset by a parasite, and the fear is that they might fall suddenly, dangerously. O’Keefe flips a hemlock frond and points out, clustered on the bottom of the leaves, a close-set grouping of cottonous white dots. Inside these cocoons wooly adelgids—a type of aphid—are draining the hemlock’s sap.
But as O’Keefe points out, most of the trunks that crisscross the path are natural deadfall; the adelgids have yet to wreak too much havoc. Yet this part of the woods still feels senescent, vaguely insidious. It is noticeably cooler beneath the spray-like leafage of the hemlocks, the air still with a finger-numbing chill. The path is humped with moss-shrouded roots and stones, and the sinister limbs of the hemlocks—sliding out horizontally from the trunks, so that it seems they are foreign boughs that have impaled the tree—dominate the view.
Before we leave him to the rest of his walk, O’Keefe brings us to a hollow in the hemlocks which shelters a still pool, above which presides a toppled tree. He points to the center of the water: “Do you see those grayish blots?” Beneath the green glass surface of the pool we can make out a cluster of milky globes. “I suspect those are wood frog eggs,” O’Keefe says.
“Gosh they’re loud at night,” he goes on, laughing. “It sounds just like ducks quacking.”

The early spring is a strange time to visit the Harvard Forest. As we leave it on a Wednesday, the parking lot is empty beneath a chilled gray sky. Fields of grass are still crisp and matted beyond the post-and-rail fences that gird them; the light green fronds barely turn in the cool wind.
With the welter of summertime research still a few weeks off, the plants are beginning their slow emergence into life, preparing for the work of growth, while projects stir from their own hibernations.
There are variables yet. The transition into warmer weather has become in recent years a bit of a toddle. Impracticable fluctuations slow the progress of projects that are in turn meant to investigate these changes.
But the researchers remain, gathering their data and storing it. They take notes and simply look, discovering more about the forest, in the grandest and smallest scales. Even with 100 years of research behind them, the changing never ends, and there’s still plenty more to learn.

The journeys we undertake with Harvard’s shuttle drivers are typically short, repetitive, and mundane: rolling from the Quad to the Yard, getting a lift to the iLab, making it home to Mather for dinner. However, the journeys undertaken by Harvard shuttle drivers are a different story entirely—take, for example, Danny Bariagaber, who drives the Allston Campus daily route. Bariagaber also ran the full Boston Marathon on Apil 18, over 30 years after making an overseas voyage from Eritrea to the United States.
To catch up with Bariagaber, I hop on his bus to make the loop from Memorial Hall to Allston and back with him. He pulls a classic dad joke right away: When I check to be sure he’s Danny Bariagaber, a grin comes over his face. “Depends—is it a good thing or a bad thing?” With a wiry runner’s figure and dynamic voice and personality, Bariagaber captains his bus (and life) with a clearly active, positive philosophy. 
Bariagaber grew up playing soccer but had to quit when he tore his ACL. He rationalizes his running as healthy and fun, but he’s also driven: “As you get older, you want to get healthy, you know?” he says. “So I started running—from 5k to 10k to half marathon to full marathon, it gets addictive.” He did his first marathon five years ago for fun with some friends, and qualified for this year’s Boston Marathon during the nearby Lowell Marathon. Bariagaber attributes some of his recent success to being able to practice on a course that’s only 20 minutes from home—as a parent with a day job, that convenience factor is important. 
Long before he was a marathoner, a bus driver, or a dad, Bariagaber lived in Eritrea. Bariagaber migrated with his family from Eritrea to Boston in 1983 because of the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. He went to high school here in Boston, and lived in California for a while before returning to the city. Though Bariagaber’s parents have both gone back to Eritrea, where he visits every other year for two to three months, Bariagaber and his siblings all reside in the Boston area: “We’re all Americans,” he says. 
Bariagaber’s bus driving is smooth and skillful, perhaps in part due to his training as a pilot: While he lived in California, Bariagaber attended Mason College and earned an aviation degree. “I was an aviation major, and I wanted to go back to Eritrea to start my own aviation industry, a tourism type of thing,” Bariagaber says. “So I came back here to save enough money, but after 9/11 things have changed around the world, and I can’t go back there for that, so now I’m driving buses instead of flying planes.” Though Eritrea has returned to stabler times and Bariagaber is able to go back and see his family, he’s continued to  work as a bus driver ever since: first at MIT, then at Harvard, which he says offers better benefits for a dad “trying to put bread on the table” and care for his son. 
Bariagaber has taken advantage of Harvard’s other resources as well: He has a Harvard gym membership, which he uses to crosstrain and cycle to maintain his marathon-ready fitness. He cites the Murr Center as his favorite gym. He also intends to start taking advantage of other facets of Harvard: “My goal is also to start finding my way around, and to take some classes at the Extension School,” he says. When I ask about his interests, he expresses an enthusiastic open-mindedness to various subjects, along with interest in some vocational courses.
As Bariagaber’s shuttle makes its longest sitting stop (it’s pulled over to a curb on the Business School campus), he opens a binder and pulls out a card. It’s a photo of professional runner Meb Keflezighi, autographed by the athlete himself to Bariagaber’s son, Issay, with a note reading, “You have great parents. Best wishes and Run to Win!” Keflezighi was the man to win the Boston Marathon the year after the 2013 Bombings, and, Bariagaber points out with pride, Keflezighi is Eritrean-born, a second cousin, and the first American to win the Boston Marathon since the early 1980s. Danny beams with pride at the photo before tucking it away.

“If you’re finding tempo challenging, that’s totally normal,” Jill Johnson announces to her Wednesday Movement Lab. “Especially in our frenetic, really fast lives.”  Students sit around Johnson in a semi-circle, watching dance clips projected on the screen behind her. A box of chocolates is passed around, but the students stay focused on the projection.
Johnson’s Movement Lab is one of many classes offered this year as part of Harvard’s newest concentration: Theater, Dance, and Media. The class aims to teach, practice, and research various styles of dance in an innovative and interactive environment. The “lab” component of the course consists of the students studying their own movement, including practical and creative analysis.
“I think this is at the core of the pedagogical mission of TDM, to integrate theory and practice,” Chair of the Department Martin Puchner says. Puchner, one of the main figures involved in the founding of the concentration, began planning the introduction of TDM five years ago. At that point, his committee, the Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts, brought in chairs from various established theater departments to learn from their experiences.

“We knew we were late to the game, but we thought there are advantages to that; we learn from the mistakes of others,” Puchner says.
Deborah Foster, TDM’s Director of Undergraduate Studies, also felt that Harvard was late to the party. “There are theater majors all over the country, why didn’t Harvard have one until now?” she asks.
Both students and administrators acknowledge the lack of precedent and established structure as potential drawbacks of a brand new concentration. “What we have to offer instead,” Puchner says, “is a very active involvement in shaping the concentration.” Student representatives sit in on TDM meetings and have the ability to influence everything from class offerings to performance styles.
“They’re open to our ideas, asking us about our ideas, trying to see how our ideas can work,” Derek P. Speedy  ’18, a TDM concentrator, says. Foster calls TDM’s collaborative ethos “a concentration of energies.”
“TDM, since it’s a new thing and we’re the first class, has this exciting energy of newness and focus and attention that drew me in,” Samuel A. Hagen ’18, a joint concentrator in TDM and History of Art and Architecture with a secondary in Russian Studies, explains. “That exciting energy of something new at an old institution where people have been doing the same things the same way.”
Hagen, who originally planned on studying math or economics, decided to reroute his focus toward TDM this year. Since then, he helped found a TDM magazine, published biannually to cover all aspects of the concentration. The title of the magazine is still “up in the air,” according to a proposal Hagen presented to the TDM Committee, but possibilities include the standard, if unimaginative, “TDM Magazine” (other ideas include “Live Art” or “Performance”).
Unlike Hagen, Speedy entered Harvard knowing he would make theater a large part of his life. “I think Harvard taught me that theater is not just this abstract thing that is fun to do... It is a real concrete medium that has power to make people think,” Speedy says.
When comparing Harvard’s method with those of other schools, Speedy found he appreciated the concentration’s academic and practical approaches to theater. “Theater, Dance, and Media, I think, is Harvard’s way of saying we want this to be something different,” he says. “[TDM] can change and adapt and look at art in a way: intellectually, academically, that nobody else is doing right now.”
Similarly, Marisa N. Salatino ’18, an inactive Crimson Editorial Board Editor and joint concentrator in TDM and East Asian Studies with a secondary in Economics, says that TDM adds legitimacy to the arts at Harvard. “People involved are already very serious about the theater that they do,” she says, adding that TDM “could be seen as more pre-professional… as opposed to just extracurricular.”
It’s not all so serious, though. Johnson gets up in the middle of the Movement Lab to demonstrate “Gaga” movement, arms gesturing sweeping, stepping from side to side. “This predates the Lady,” she says.
Puchner believes that the growing emphasis on performing arts at Harvard will impact not only current concentrators, but also prospective applicants to the College. “There are a lot of students with an interest in theater, dance, and media who wouldn’t even apply to Harvard, because they knew that there was no concentration,” he explains.
For a certain group of potential students, the addition of TDM changes both Harvard’s image and its appeal. Lindsay T. McAuliffe, a incoming member of the Class of 2020, is certain she will concentrate in TDM. “I chose Harvard because it would allow me to immerse myself in my craft,” she explains, also noting the combination of theoretical and practical learning as a draw.
According to Puchner, incoming Harvard classes will include more and more art-focused students. “We’ve also talked to the admissions office to educate them and work with them to make sure that students interested in theater, dance, and media actually get admitted,” he says.
McAuliffe cites “the excitement and the possibility of being in the first or second class of such a new concentration” as a major benefit. As classes of students like McAuliffe come through Harvard, they bring with them an enthusiasm not only for performance, but also for the learning styles it promotes.
“The students gain a great deal by working in these different areas,” Puchner says. He notes that the recent educational trend of practice-based learning lies at the heart of TDM. Learning by doing, as Puchner puts it, is applicable to everything from the humanities to engineering.
Foster also comments on the importance of performance to the college as a whole. “Performing arts are so vivid and vibrant and–” her voice drops to a theatrical stage whisper, “ephemeral. They come and you have to remember them, you have to be a part of them and be present to witness them.”
As Johnson’s class shifts its focus from the monitor to Johnson herself, she mimics the clawing motion of the hands on the screen. In translating the material from the source to reality, Johnson points out the somewhat out of sync movements of the dancers the class is watching. “The delicacy of the little details of how people are different” are what makes the dance successful, she says.

Attorney General Maura Healey '92 is the highest ranking Democrat in an elected position in the State of Massachusetts. She began her term on Jan. 21, 2015 and has taken on issues ranging from transgender rights to student debt. After speaking in the Kirkland House Senior Common room, Attorney General Healey sat down with FM to chat about her first year in office. 
Fifteen Minutes: Who’s someone you greatly admire, and do you think you emulate yourself after that person in some way?
Maura Healey: I admire Hilary Clinton for what she has done in her life and her career. What she’s withstood, the ways in which she’s been tested, her perseverance, her intelligence, and her willingness  really from the time she was in college to commit to public service and to try to make a difference in people’s lives. So, she’s somebody who I deeply admire and it’s why I’m working hard in hopes that she becomes president.
FM: You played basketball at Harvard. What do you think athletics taught you? And how do you use the skills you gained in athletics in your job today?
MH: Basketball is a team game, and I learned a lot about teamwork, discipline, hard-work, practice is what it’s all about....You are going to lose, you are going to win. But there are lessons in all of that. I probably learned more from losing than I ever did from winning. But I think with sports and athletics, there’s a chance to work as a team, have a goal, commit to something, and work hard to achieve it. It helped me tremendously in the campaign, in the way we built our grassroots campaign and ran our campaign. It was intense, had a lot of energy.... To me, it helped having had those experiences playing sports. Leaving the Attorney General’s office here in Massachusetts, those are lessons that I draw upon constantly, again about teamwork and collaborating, and having goals, and driving forward with an agenda. It’s important to me, and also it was a part of my life that was fun. I had a lot of passion for basketball. I think it’s important to keep something in your life no matter how old you get, or what you are doing, to keep something going in your life that gives you joy and fun.
FM: What do you think your biggest accomplishment has been since you took office over a year ago?
MH: I’ve just got an amazing team of people in that office that work so hard and bring energy every day to so many different issues, working to combat the heroin and opioid crisis, addressing issues of domestic violent and sexual assault, taking on student loan debt, fighting against healthcare costs. You name it. One of the things I really am pleased with this year is that we started a community engagement division. For us to be the people’s lawyer, people’s law firm, we need to be present in neighborhoods and communities across this state. So we started a community engagement division, Rodrigo [Plaza ’13] is part of that division, and we are out in the neighborhoods, at events, hosting community action hours in multiple languages, where people can come with their complaints. If you got a civil rights complaint, if you got an employment complaint, if you feel like you’ve been taken advantage of by a car dealership, or an insurance company that you are dealing with isn’t being fair to you, bring us your complaints and we’ve got lawyers and mediators right there on the spot in those community action hours to serve people of the state. I’m really pleased about that.
FM: Changing gears slightly, what have you done specifically to help student with debt over the last year? 
MH: Well, we have, as an office, made this a top priority because student debt is $1.3 trillion and growing right now in the country. It exceeds, I think, all forms of debt that are out there. This is going to have a crippling effect on our economy if we don’t get this under control. Already, so many students and families are just crushed under the weight of debt, and it’s limiting their life-choices and options and it’s really terrible. So we’ve done a few things. One, we’ve worked really hard to get after predatory for-profit schools. We’ve gone after unlawful student loan servicing practices, unlawful student loan debt practices. And we’ve worked really hard to advocate that the U.S. Department of Justice provide discharges for student loans where students were taken advantage of by some of these practices. My team has been leading negotiations, recently securing an agreement whereby the U.S. Department of Education is going to start to discharge loans students of certain schools. That’s the kind of advocacy that we are bringing to this. It’s a top priority for our office.
FM: Another one of your top priorities was addressing prescription drug and heroin abuse. Why do you think that is such a prevalent problem in the United States?
MH: Well, I think a few things have contributed to it. I think that the rise of opioid prescriptions over the last 15 years has helped create what is now a public health epidemic. I think that drug cartels are out there and have figured out ways to not only get heroin in but also to manufacture new drugs like fentanyl that are coming into our communities that are incredibly potent and lethal. And I think that for far too long in this country we haven’t paid enough attention to issues of substance use, mental health and behavioral health, and we need to better address those issues. If there’s going to be a silver lining in this crisis, it's that we are going to have a real conversation in this country about substance use and about mental health, and recognizing that most all of us have one or another or both in our families. For far too long, people have not wanted to talk about it and kept it under the rug, and we got to bring it out into the open, so that people can get help. People need education. There can be better prevention efforts going on.... That’s why we’ve made it top of the agenda.
FM: I know transgender rights is a big priority for you. Why would someone oppose the transgender rights bill, and what would you say to them?
MH: I would say, don’t we want to treat others the way we’d want to be treated? I don’t understand the opposition to this bill. To me, it’s a simple matter. We respect one another. We respect one another’s privacy. We shouldn’t discriminate based on race, sexual orientation, gender, age, ability-disability, I could go on—or gender identity. It’s as simple as that. And I think unfortunately there is bias, there’s prejudice, there’s hate. And I think that forces that are opposed to LGBT equality have generally used this as an issue to essentially manufacture, mischaracterize, what this is about. And it’s been to the detriment of transgender people here in the state.
FM: As the first openly gay Attorney General in the United States, did you ever believe sexual orientation would hinder your pursuit of public office?
MH: No, there are any number of things that could hinder me. You know, I say that sort of kiddingly, but when I ran it was interesting because my sexual orientation was not talked about in this race here in Massachusetts. I take that as a positive sign. That said, I think it’s important that we support people running for office no matter their race, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation, their gender, their gender identity. This should be about who wants to serve and help people. So, I don’t view it as a limitation. I recognize that there has been a lot of prejudice out there. Look at the current issue, we are dealing with around gender for example. If you look at Congress, less than 20 percent are women. My point is that you can look at any number of examples whether in government, whether in business, where there are just too many disparities, whether they are racial or gender or other. We want a society where everybody feels like they got an opportunity to compete, to be considered. They shouldn’t be held back, based on anything but their imagination or their ability.

In recent years, concern over the health of football players has led to a number of changes in the way the game is played. Most recently, the Ivy League has moved to put an end to full-contact practices during in-season practices.
While football is a violent and intense game, safety has been at the forefront of discussions in the football community recently. Harvard’s Head Coach Tim Murphy understands the decision behind such a ban. “I think everyone at our level of football is trying to do [their] very best to maximize the health and welfare of our student athletes,” Murphy says. “Rather than waiting potentially a long time for [this ban] to happen on a national level, we [the Ivy League] elected to do it on a league level.”
Most players believe that the sport should make a space for both safety and zeal. “We’re really trying to strike a balance to maintain what we all love about football—the physicality and going to field and enjoying ourselves... and balancing that with player safety which is something that’s really important to everybody,” defensive end Langston E. Ward '16 said.
Middle linebacker Eric J. Ryan '17 agrees. “I haven’t heard any complaints really," he says. "I think for the most part everyone understands that the... intensity of practice isn’t going to change. Not actually tackling forces you to work on your footwork, on your fundamentals, that much more. Games are a different environment and practice is definitely more controlled. The essence of football, the games, will be what you’ve come to expect from it.”
The ease of the compromise might originate, in part, from the fact that, at least at Harvard, practices hardly ever involved live tackling or scrimmaging. Murphy expects that the change will have very little impact.
Not only will practices remain much the same, but players also seem unconcerned that this new rule will impact the mentality of the game. “Regardless of any policy that may be in play, everyone is in their zone on the field not really thinking about what admin decisions are being made in the Ivy League,” Ward says.
Ryan echoes a similar sentiment: “Going into games is… a no-hold-back kind of mindset, you’re allowed to let loose. I think once we’re actually playing and everything is live... the nature of the game will be relatively untouched. It’s just leading up to those games that it’s a different process.” Going forward, the team is looking to experiment with mobile virtual players that simulate tackling.
While the team plays about three out-of-league games each season, players and coaches are not worried about a mis-match given the change in practices. Harvard has the second highest winning percentage in all of Division 1 football and, according to Murphy, has effectively been practicing this way for the last 15 years.
While Murphy does not believe the ban will do much to affect the performance of the players, he does see it as an indication of the future of the sport. “In the last decade the culture [of the sport] has changed dramatically," he says. “Rule changes have changed the game we play for the better. I’d be surprised if in the very near future this wasn’t a rule for all of college football.”

Back in April 2014, Fifteen Minutes covered a mystery of philosophical proportions: Blaise Pascal’s missing death mask. Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly had planned to feature the artifact, cast at the time of the 17th-century philosopher and mathematician’s death, in his class. After a visit to the archives to retrieve the mask proved unfruitful, Kelly conferred with Eric Johnson-DeBaufre, the department librarian. Both were dismayed to realize that Pascal’s mask—donated to the department by the late philosopher and Harvard professor William James—was missing.
After a few more futile search efforts, Kelly decided to open up the wild goose chase to his students, offering an automatic “A” to anyone who was able to find the mask. Meanwhile, Johnson-DeBaufre kept up the search on his own. A few weeks ago, he reached out to us to deliver breaking news: He had the mask—well, sort of.
“I started thinking shortly after the first Crimson article appeared on the death mask, ‘I wonder if we could get a copy made from the original,’” he tells us. “It’s not the same as having the one William James gave us, but it’d be close.” Johnson-DeBaufre reached out to the Parisian organization that owns the original mask. They weren’t willing to make a copy, he was informed, but they had an extra one that they were happy to send him. “I like to think of this as the sibling of the death mask that William James gave us,” he says. “Made from the same original, just not James’s.”
For all the students who have been holding out for that easy A, the dream is not yet dead. Johnson-DeBaufre believes that although this sister mask serves its purpose, Kelly’s offer should still stand if any student can locate the department’s missing treasure. The mask may crop up yet—after all, the two other items Johnson-DeBaufre had listed as missing were both discovered gathering dust atop a department administrator’s shelf. Oddly enough, one of these items was a silver cup also belonging to William James, given to him by his students after his last lecture at Harvard.
Beyond being used in Professor Kelly’s new course, the mask may soon find a new home in a small exhibit that Johnson-DeBaufre plans to set up on the second floor of Emerson. “The plan eventually,” he says, “is to install three cases along this wall that will tell the story of the department’s history.” He has received approval from the administration and is now looking for funding to acquire the cabinets.
In these displays, Pascal’s death mask would be accompanied by artifacts such as William James’ silver cup, brass scientific instruments from the era when psychological experiments were under the domain of philosophy, and letters from the Philosophy department petitioning to give a female professor at Wellesley College a Ph.D at a time before women were eligible to receive degrees.
The mask’s immediate future, though, is in Kelly’s course. Johnson-DeBaufre described the purpose of the mask as a memento mori—a somber reminder of our own mortality.  “Contemporary philosophers are making a return to some of the big questions, like death, as a kind of imaginative retrospective standpoint.” he says. “[It] might reveal aspects of what it means to live a good life that might otherwise be concealed for us.”
In a follow-up email, Johnson-DeBaufre shared a quote from Michel de Montaigne that encapsulates this idea: "Let us rid [death] of its strangeness, come to know it, get used to it. Let us have nothing on our minds as often as death. At every moment let us picture it in our imagination in all its aspects… He who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave."
Whether haunting Harvard’s archives or its classrooms, Pascal’s mask—in all its versions—seems ready to teach us these lessons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will formally recognize the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program Friday, renewing relations decades after the University expelled the program during Vietnam War-era protest.
With official recognition from the University, Air Force ROTC will join the ranks of both the Navy and Army versions of the program on campus. University President Drew G. Faust and Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James will sign an agreement in Loeb House on Friday morning to renew the relationship between the two institutions, according to an email from the Office of the President sent to Harvard ROTC cadets and obtained by The Crimson.
While recognition may not change the day-to-day experience of many Harvard Air Force ROTC cadets—much of Harvard’s ROTC training across the branches takes place at MIT—it is the latest symbolic gesture the University has made to the military under Faust. During the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s, the University stripped ROTC of its previous academic standing, and all programming was phased out soon after. For years, Harvard students who still wanted to participate in the program enrolled in ROTC at MIT.
After President Barack Obama signed legislation repealing the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy towards gay and lesbian service members in the winter of 2010, Faust welcomed Navy ROTC back to campus; in 2012, the University also officially recognized Army ROTC.
Now, Harvard has completed its symbolic rapprochement with each of the military’s ROTC branches, long a demand of Harvard undergraduate and graduate students affiliated with the armed services.
“It’s been a long time since Air Force has been recognized at Harvard, and as a cadet I am super excited,” said Zander E. Farrow ’16, an Air Force ROTC Cadet who only speaks for himself and whose views do not represent those of the military. Four students at Harvard are Air Force ROTC cadets, and the Air Force ROTC program is the smallest of the ROTC programs at Harvard. Farrow said he hopes official recognition will help grow Air Force ROTC.
“Even if we gain one or two cadets from this who wouldn’t have considered it otherwise, that would be really valuable,” Farrow said.
“ROTC students bring different and important perspectives that enhance and enrich the educational experience for the entire Harvard community, and we are delighted to have Air Force ROTC represented again at Harvard,” Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in a statement.
Charley M. Falletta ’16, an Army ROTC cadet, said that while Harvard’s decision to recognize Air Force will likely not make many logistical changes to the program, it sends a positive message to every ROTC student at Harvard.
“To all of Harvard ROTC, we’re officially here, we’re all here. We’re not just a partial program, we’re not just semi-recognized. We’re recognized 100 percent,” Falletta said.
In addition to restoring relations with ROTC programs on campus, Faust, some of whose family has served in the military, has taken steps outside Harvard’s gates to express her support for the armed forces. Last month, Faust traveled to the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., urging the cadets to study the humanities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Houghton Library exhibit  “Shakespeare: His Collected Works,” which features a wide array of collections about the playwright from Harvard and around the world, will come to and end this month. 
The exhibit, which has been on display since Jan. 19 and concludes on April 30, coincides with the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death and displays many artifacts from the Harvard Collections.
“It was an unexpected gap in our calendar that allowed us to create this exhibition to commemorate Shakespeare, because it’s an anniversary year,” Harvard College Library coordinator of programs and exhibit co-curator Peter X. Accardo said.
Noting that curating the exhibit on Shakespeare’s work was a “daunting” task, Accardo said the library prepared for about a year ahead of the opening.
“We started in March of last year for preparations,” he said. “Unlike some collections that reside on shelves, the Shakespeare collection is all over.”
Accardo, who worked with co-curator Dale D. Stinchcomb, said the exhibit’s primary purpose was to “show as much of our holdings as we could.”
“I suspect this is the first time that Houghton has created an exhibition that draws from all the departments of Houghton,” Stinchcomb said.
Stinchcomb and Accardo said they also hoped to showcase the University’s history with Shakespeare. According to Stinchcomb, the collection features a rare copy of Shakespeare’s First Folio, collected by Harry E. Widener, a member of the class of 1907. The exhibit also contains materials that detail the history of performances of the Bard’s plays at Harvard.
“We tried to answer the fundamental question about performance at Harvard, which is when did students first perform [Shakespeare] here on campus,” Accardo said.
In addition, the exhibit displays numerous artifacts on women and African Americans appearing in Shakespearean productions. According to Stinchcomb, the exhibit’s centerpiece is a life-size portrait of Paul Robeson, the first black actor on Broadway, performing “Othello.”
The curators said the exhibit also aims to serve as an educational resource for students.
“There’s a pedagogical perspective to all of this,” Accardo said. “And lots of interesting projects might derive from this. We always encourage Harvard students to explore our collection and have gifted staff work with them.”
Several groups from Harvard as well as other local institutions have visited the exhibit.
Bethany L. Donovan ’16 said her section visited Houghton for “English 121CG: Shakespeare After Hamlet.”
The curators are also collaborating with the Hyperion Shakespeare Company on April 26 for “Bard in the Yard,” an event co-organized by Sabrina G. Yates ’19 and Kier W. Zimmerman ’19, a Crimson news editor.
According to Yates, “Bard in the Yard” will feature a compilation of five scenes from well-known Shakespeare plays that the company has performed previously, as well as a monologue. The event will mark the exhibit’s closure and commemorate the anniversary of Shakespeare’s death.
Donovan, who is also a member of Hyperion, said organizing the event provided the performance group with a unique theatrical challenge.
“It is always interesting to think about how interpretations and approaches to putting on Shakespeare's plays have changed over the 400 years,” Donovan said.

University Professor Stephen Owen completed an eight-year-long project to translate Chinese poet Du Fu’s 1,400 poems into English, aiming to make the works more accessible.
Du Fu, who Owen described as one of China’s most prolific poets, wrote about 1,400 poems during his lifetime. While scholars have previously translated some of Du Fu's works to English for anthologies, Owen's work marks the first  time all of Du Fu’s existing collection has been translated into English.
“This project is something I’ve always had in mind doing. Du Fu is actually a very strange poet,” Owen said. “That strange Du Fu is left out of all the anthologies.”
Owen said a $1.5 million grant the Mellon Foundation awarded to him in 2005 made it possible for him to undertake the project.
“[The Foundation] wanted me to do something big and I hate to waste money,” Owen said. “So I thought I would do something that would really leave a mark. And this is just not itself for itself, it’s also the first volume of the first title in a library of Chinese humanities.”
Owen hopes the translation will reach a broader audience and that people with limited knowledge of Chinese will enjoy the collection, as well.
“In the United States, we have a lot of people both non-ethnically Chinese and ethnically Chinese who are curious about traditional literature, have studied some Chinese,” he said. “But studying some Chinese and reading Du Fu are two different things. So this helps to create a kind of a bridge where you can at least try your hand at it.”
The Poetry of Du Fu, Owen’s six volume book, is available not only in print but also in a free online PDF version.
“A lot of the Mellon [funds] went into… getting this, and the first few volumes all open access on the Internet,” Owen said.
Harvard affiliates praised Owen’s translation of Du Fu’s poems.
“This makes teaching Chinese literature, teaching Du Fu so much easier. It very much facilitates the research, the reading, and the learning,” Chinese literature professor Xiaofei Tian said.
Wai-Yee Li, another professor of Chinese Literature, also lauded the translation.
“People will be able to find a way to Du Fu and I think it will do a great boost to the study of classical poetry in general” Li said.
Lucas R. Bender, a graduate student studying Chinese literature, noted the importance of the translation in raising awareness of Du Fu in the West.
“He is under appreciated, underrepresented in the western world, partly because his collection is so big,” Bender said. “Chinese poetry isn’t well known. When people will have access to the full Du Fu, they will see how much more compelling the individual who is writing the verse is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Lemann Foundation, a philanthropic organization created by Brazilian billionaire Jorge P. Lemann ’61, will give additional financial aid money to Harvard students from Brazil.
The donation will build on Lemann’s years of support for Brazilian students at Harvard. In 2007, he endowed Harvard’s then-year-old Brazilian Studies program for an unspecified sum—the first major donation during University President Drew G. Faust’s tenure. Lemann also funds nearly 100 fellowships for students across Harvard’s graduate schools who intend to work in Brazil’s public sector.
Lemann’s most recent gift, an undisclosed amount, will support financial aid for students from Brazil, a population that has grown “fourfold” over the past 10 years, according to a press release this week. Sixteen students from Brazil were enrolled at the College during the 2014-2015 academic year.
“This year alone, more than 300 Harvard students conducted research in Brazil — exploring everything from climate change in the Amazon rainforest to improving educational systems in the fast-growing urban centers,” Faust said in a statement. “With the Lemann Foundation’s continued support, this important work will continue for generations to come.”
The gift also includes a provision for projects based in or relating to Brazil, offered with the the help of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
The gift comes during Harvard’s record-setting capital campaign. The University recently met its $6.5 billion goal, a higher education record; Harvard will continue the fundraising effort for the next two years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When five alumni launched a renegade bid for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, four of the names made good, if not immediate, sense on a platform dedicated to abolishing undergraduate tuition and scrutinizing admissions practices.
Leading the charge was Ron K. Unz ’83, a conservative intellectual and entrepreneur who was at the forefront of the fight against bilingual education in California. Joining Unz, who also recently announced a bid for U.S. Senate, was Lee C. Cheng ’93, a lawyer who filed a Supreme Court amicus brief against affirmative action, and Stephen D. Hsu, a physicist advocating “merit, not race, in college admissions.” The ticket was rounded out by journalist Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., who co-authored a book on “mismatch theory”—the theory that affirmative action places the students intends to help in overwhelming academic settings.
Then there was Ralph Nader. A five-time U.S. presidential candidate and longtime public figure, Nader—a Harvard Law School graduate who built his career on consumer protection activism and environmentalism—seemed an odd fit for a University governing board, much less as a member of Unz’s “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket. Beyond the outsider candidates, eight other alumni are vying for the Board’s five open spots. 
First, Nader wholeheartedly supports race-based affirmative action on a ticket mostly skeptical of the admissions practice. And while he now supports the group’s call to use Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment to pay for undergraduate tuition, much of his activism and public life has focused on mandating seat belts and reducing carbon emissions.
Ideological differences aside, Nader brings needed star power to the ticket, Unz said. Ending tuition at Harvard, he added, “really would be a tremendous capper to Ralph Nader’s long career.”
“And his role would have been a very important one, because no one’s heard of the rest of us,” Unz said.
Unz and Nader knew each other for years before Unz recruited him for the Overseers slate this year. The two got in touch in 2013 after Unz began promoting a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage, arguing that such a move would curb government welfare spending.
Nader reached out to Unz seeking financial support to lobby Congress on raising the minimum wage, and Unz agreed. In 2013 he donated $50,000 to Nader’s organization, the Center for the Study of Responsive Law.
Now, the unlikely duo is working together again to earn spots on the University’s second highest governing body. As he recruited candidates to join him on the ticket, Unz realized Nader’s Harvard connection—Nader has publicly criticized the Law School of servicing corporate greed—and pitched him on the ticket. Within 10 days, Unz said, Nader was sold.
“I wouldn’t look up all the rules of the Overseers and the petitions. I’ve got too much else to do here,” Nader said. “But if someone says, ‘look here are the rules, here are the forms, here’s what you have to do to run for the Board of Overseers,’ I said ‘fine.’”
Nader said his place on the ticket does not indicate complete agreement with all the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” candidates, who have faced criticism for their controversial platform since they entered the race. Unz has been scrutinized in recent weeks after his tax records revealed contributions to far-right individuals and at least one group that Unz called “quasi-white nationalist.”
“We agree on disclosure, and we agree on no tuition,” Nader said. “I’m not responsible for the others, or for [Unz’s] positions.”
Nader said he wants to make tuition free at both the College and the Law School, citing the size of the University’s endowment. “It’s just inert money that keeps piling up and piling up and they keep asking us for more and more and more,” he said.
Nader added that he supports more transparency in admissions and wants to look into how legacy students, athletes, and children of the wealthy might be privileged in the process. He expressed concern that Harvard weighs standardized testing too heavily, potentially disadvantaging lower-income students.
“It makes sense: you grow up in an inner city, there’s sirens, rats, leaking roofs, bill collectors harassing you, crime around you,” Nader said. “You’re not exactly likely to do well on the SAT as someone who lives in Scarsdale or Belmont, Mass.”
Ballots for the Board of Overseers went out to Harvard alumni earlier this month; they are due May 20.

UPDATED: April 21, 2016, at 7:22 p.m.
It’s late on Sunday night when House Committee Co-Chairs Kristen Y. Shim ’17 and Muhammed Ors ’17 wait for a handful of students to settle into the Hastings Room of Pforzheimer House. The group reviews its 5 v. 5 Bubble Soccer games held the previous evening and discusses final preparations for Quad Formal, the third annual collaboration between Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses.
Every week, groups of students in all the Houses will do much the same, coming together during their “HoCo” meetings to take a central role in planning their Houses’ social programming.
Since the induction of the House system in the 1930’s under then-University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877, Houses have selected students to serve as leaders within their residential communities. Addressing issues ranging from hot breakfast to security guidelines, the House Committees have historically been active participants in the residential experience at the College.
“Harvard has long valued student leadership in shaping the undergraduate experience and the Houses have been vibrant centers of intellectual [and] social life for students,”  Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich said.
College administrators have for ages hailed the House system as the cornerstone of the undergraduate experience, a tenet the recent push to shift social life back toward the Houses reflects. But as student House Committees seek to carry out this initiative, challenges—including disparities in available space and engaging busy undergraduates—remain.

INEQUITIES OF SPACE AND SPENDING
Despite similar sources of funding, however, disparities continue to exist among the different House Committee budgets, with some Houses’ projected expenditures totaling five times more than others.
According to current budget data available from the Undergraduate Council, Eliot House is projected to spend the most of the House Committees this semester at $43,350 while Dunster House is projected to spend the least at $12,481. Broken down per capita, Eliot will spend approximately $100 per resident, while Dunster will spend only about $31 per resident. 
The UC provides each House Committee with a semesterly $6,000 grant, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the UC’s annual budget.  The majority of the UC’s budget is financed by the student activity fee requested from every student, and Houses are able to use the funding as they choose. In addition to the UC grant, laundry revenue, merchandise sales, and ticketing from events like House formals make up other significant sources of funding for House Committees.
Despite the disparity in budgets for House Committees, the College has long promoted the importance of maintaining a balance between consistency and individual experiences within each of the Houses, giving discretion to each House in how it spends its money.
“It’s really important that the House leadership, based on their history, culture, traditions, [and] architecture, really think about how those funds are best used to promote the distinctive experience that comes along with being a part of that House community,” Friedrich said.
However, the diversity of experiences extends beyond budgets. Inequities continue to persist in the availability of large social spaces across Houses.
According to Kirkland House Committee co-chair Francesca E. Childs ’17, Kirkland House lacks sufficient space to hold a diversity of social events, with options limited to venues like the Junior Common Room.
“I think Kirkland’s challenge is we don’t have a very ideal space for these parties,” she said.
As the College continues its long-term House renewal project, some student leaders pointed out that discrepancies in available social spaces are becoming more apparent. Quincy House’s Stone Hall, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and most recently, Dunster House have already undergone renovation, and now feature improved common spaces. Renovations on Winthrop House will begin this summer and Lowell House will undergo its two-year renewal starting in summer 2017. 
 
Some Houses yet to be renovated have already responded to the need for more social spaces. Last fall, Adams House opened the “Molotov,” a private space for students to hold parties, and Cabot House opened “The Aquarium,” a renovated version of the Junior Common Room in which students may convene or host events.
Despite its new venue, Adams House still receives requests for space that far exceeds the availability, according to Adams House Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67.
“We just don’t have those venues yet and our hope is that the House Committees will be very active in House renewal planning,” he said.
AN EFFORT IN COLLABORATION
Although House Committees are largely autonomous, their work often requires coordination with College administration to secure additional funding and other Houses to plan larger events.
Alongside a $3,000 grant from the UC, the Office of Student Life recently allocated money to each House neighborhood for a pre-YardFest “block party” that aims to create an inclusive social environment.
“In working with student leaders, we came up with this plan to try out for the first-time this year these neighborhood events that can be open, welcoming, inclusive events just prior to the start of YardFest,” Friedrich said.
The Office of Student Life declined to specify how much money the College has allocated for the block party events. Still, many House Committee leaders said that funding for the pre-YardFest block parties represents a new step toward promoting social life in the Houses and hope to see the progress continue.
“It’s been really nice to see the College rally around these pre-YardFest events for various neighborhoods,” Leverett House Committee Co-Chair Alec K. Reed ’18 said. “They’ve been pretty generous in providing a lot of funding for all the House Committees to have these kind of group events together as a community.” 
In addition to the pilot funding for the pre-YardFest events, the College Dean’s Office and Office of Student Life allocated new funding this year for “student initiated programming,” “student-faculty engagement,” and retreats led by faculty deans that also promote the College’s reinvigoration of House life.
The Office of Student Life also created a new position this year to focus its efforts to bolster students experiences in their Houses. Fellow for House Programs Emily S. Rutter ’13, a former Crimson sports editor, oversees the collaboration between the House Committees and much of the new pilot programming funded by the Dean’s Office.
The Office of Student Life also works closely with House Committees to coordinate city licensing, emergency medical services, security, and ticketing that House formals often require, Rutter said. House Committees also receive funding from the Office of Student Life to cover some of the bartending and Harvard University Police Department costs of House formals each year.
Co-chairs of the 12 House Committees meet approximately twice a month to plan campus-wide events that involve multiple Houses, including festivities like the Harvard-Yale Tailgate and Housing Day.
House leaders frequently cite the relationship between students and House administrators as critical for effective House event planning.
“The House Committee is our right hand to be one, or two, or three steps closer to as many of the House members as they can,” Palfrey said. “They are one of the layers of administration, they meet with us every week.”
SEEKING ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE HOUSE
While Houses remain an important part of the undergraduate experience for many students at the College, House Committees still face challenges in engaging House residents.
In a 2015 survey conducted by the Crimson, only 55 percent of respondents said they were “somewhat involved” or “very involved” in House life. Additionally, when asked about involvement in the House Committees themselves, a plurality of respondents— 33 percent—said they occasionally attend House Committee meetings, while 9 percent always attend, 26 percent sometimes attend, and 32 percent never attend meetings.
As an officially-sanctioned group directly under the supervision of House administration, House Committees often face the challenge of breaking down stigmas surrounding their social events.
“When you put a HoCo name on something, or a House name on something, it automatically takes the coolness factor down a bit,” Winthrop House Committee Co-Chair Matthew T. Disorbo ’17 said. “Our job is to combat that, to try and get people to buy in.”
Additionally, House Committees acknowledge that it is difficult for many students who simply do not have time to participate in House life because of other commitments.
“Harvard is inherently a busy place,” Reed said. “I think this is a broader challenge of other Houses as well is to encourage and promote attendance at House events.”
Despite the limited amount of time some students can spend on House activities, House Committee members said they do not see themselves as competing with other student organizations. Rather, they see their role as providing a space where all students feel they are included and welcome.
“It’s really on the onus of the House to promote a greater sense of inclusivity because we are some of the larger organizations on campus and having House spirit is a way to bring a lot of people together,” Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Nicholas D. O’Brien ’17 said.
Similarly, Shim emphasized the importance for students to have some community at Harvard, no matter what form it takes.
“All that matters is that people feel like they can come home to something,” Shim said. “HoCo is so great because it can encompass so many types of communities.”
In approaching their residential experience, Shim said students should ask themselves how they can contribute to their House communities.
“Freshman year we’re like, ‘What is Harvard going to do for me?’ and it shouldn’t be like that,” Shim said. “It should be like, ‘What am I going to do for my community? What am I going to do for my House?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women students continue to fall behind men in select indicators of academic performance at the Law School, according to a recent report from the Harvard Women’s Law Association.
The report focuses on two metrics to assess student performance: membership in selective student organizations seen as de facto “honor societies” at the school, and receiving Latin honors upon graduation. The Harvard Law Review, a prestigious student publication, is composed of roughly 64 percent men, compared to 36 percent women. Conferred degrees also reflect a split: 49 percent of men received honors compared to just 31 percent of women. 
Discrepancies in gender are not a new issue for the Law School. An imbalance in the number of male as compared to the number of  female faculty members continues to generate concern, and 2014 was the first year in which women made up 50 percent of admitted students. In 2013, the Women’s Law Association Shatter the Ceiling Committee uncovered statistics pointing to imbalances in the performance of men and women at the school, and soon afterward, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow insisted that she and administrators were “already committed to addressing these issues.”
Two years later, data in the latest Shatter the Ceiling report indicates the school has not succeeded in mitigating the problem. “The data collected suggest that if…steps have been initiated, they have had negligible (or even negative) effects on the gender disparity in academic performance,” the report reads.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said she appreciated the work of the Women’s Law Association, and that this is an area of concern for her.
“This work points to issues that are of concern to me and to the faculty as we strive to make progress in ensuring that all members of the community participate fully in the academic, clinical and extracurricular programs at HLS,” Minow wrote in an email statement provided by Law School spokesperson Michelle B. Deakin.
First-year Law student and Shatter the Ceiling committee member Mollie Swears looked at publicly-available membership records of three extracurricular groups—the Harvard Law Review, Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, and the Board of Student Advisers— for the classes of 2016 and 2017. Swears cross-referenced a list of 2015 Latin honors recipients with biographical information to determine the gender breakdown of awardees.
Swears found statistically significant gender gaps in Law Review and HLAB membership, as well as Latin honors awarded. While HLAB has significantly more women than men, the Law Review has grappled with low female participation for years.
Law Review President Michael L. Zuckerman ’10 suggested in the report he thinks persisting disparities are likely due to women opting out of going through the selection process, rather than the process itself. All applicants are required to complete a blindly-graded writing competition. Twenty spots are allocated purely based on writing competition scores, 14 through a mixture of grades and scores, and the remaining 12 are chosen through a holistic review process that takes into account personal background. In 2013, the Law Review amended the third process to consider gender.
Still, fewer women are entering the writing competition in the first place. This may be partly due to prevalent misconceptions about the rigor of the selection process and the group’s environment, Zuckerman wrote in an email, narrating a story of a close female friend on the Review who nearly decided not to hand in her completed writing competition entry out of concern that it was not good enough.
“It terrifies me every time I think about it, that if there had maybe been one more nudge in a negative direction, she might not have turned in her packet at all,” Zuckerman wrote in an email. “We want everyone who would be interested in joining to take a shot at it.”
Zuckerman said Law Review editors are intensifying recruitment and outreach efforts to encourage more women to enter and complete the writing competition.
While the Shatter the Ceiling report cited some progress in recent years towards gender parity on the Law Review, data shows that inequality in Latin honors recipients has increased. The report references a 2004 study showing that between 1997 and 2004, eight percent more men than women received honors. By 2015, Swears found the gap had grown to 18 percent.
Administrators have declined to release data on academic performance broken down by gender, according to the report, so identifying the underlying causes behind this disparity is difficult.
“One ongoing roadblock in solving the gender disparity in grades at HLS is the lack of transparency from the administration and faculty concerning both the gender disparity in grades and any measures to combat it,” the report stated.
Women’s Law Association President Natalie D. Vernon said the Law School’s attitude toward rectifying gender inequality stands in marked contrast to the Business School’s approach. In 2011, the Business School launched a series of initiatives to combat its gender gap and remake the school. By 2013, data indicated that disparities had mostly disappeared.
“What HBS did in their intensive work...where they essentially eliminated their gap, to me it just shows how much change is possible when you have everybody deeply committed to that change, and I don’t see that at the Law School,” Vernon said.
Minow said administrators have and will continue to work on eliminating gender disparities at the school.
“The issues have been studied in the past and have guided changes already in course offerings and instructional methods, but there is more to do,” she wrote. “I look forward to working with both students and faculty as we pursue more detailed research, based on more data, and for promoting opportunities for success for all students in school and beyond.”
After Shatter the Ceiling released its report, members of the group Yale Law Women published a letter in the Harvard Law Record expressing solidarity with women at Harvard Law School, and writing that a study at Yale had recently exposed similar problems. “Both Harvard and Yale can and must do better by their women law students,” the letter read.
Vernon said the Women’s Law Association hopes to create partnerships with other law schools to address widespread gender inequality in law schools.
“This is not unique to Harvard Law School,” she said. “This is something that women in law schools across the countries face almost universally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the unexpected resignation of former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde only days before the beginning of the spring semester, a committee is now actively searching for his replacement.
The search committee is composed of four students, two Faculty Deans, one House Resident Dean, and two College administrators, according to University spokesperson Rachael Dane.
A search firm specializing in academic hires will also be involved with the process, according to the College’s Dean of Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba.
Now that the search committee has been formally convened, the group will identify a list of characteristics they hope to see in the new Dean of Student Life.
“We see this as part of a holistic education and we want to use this as an opportunity to continually intertwine our holistic view of the intellectual, social, and personal transformation,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 took over as interim dean of Student Life on Feb. 1, leading both the Freshman Dean’s Office and Office of Student Life for the majority of this semester.
“I don’t have a clearly defined agenda,” Dingman said of his new position when he began in early February, adding that launching initiatives as an interim dean would be inopportune. “I know work that I’ve inherited, and I will be focused largely on that in the short term.”
Dingman wrote in an email Wednesday he has had no role in the search committee, and has not been involved in the search process “in any way.”
Khurana said he values the student input the committee has received, and that the process is proceeding for the most part on schedule. He did not specify an end date by which he hopes to have the position filled.
“The most important thing is that we get the right person,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: APRIL 21, 2016, at 4:52 p.m.
As of March 1, Harvard Medical School had raised $531 million, achieving just over 70 percent of its goal of $750 million. This marks an additional $64 million in contributions since October, and includes donations from 8,900 people, according to a release from the Medical School.
The Medical School was one of the last schools to join the general Harvard University capital campaign, which recently passed its overall target of $6.5 billion. Several individual schools, however, have not finished their fundraising campaigns. The Medical School’s target of $750 million is the third highest of individual school campaign goal, following those of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Business School. 
The campaign, called “The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine,” launched in November 2014 and has four stated overarching goals: Discovery, Education, Service, and Leadership.
Discovery, which refers to research, constitutes the majority of the campaign’s overall goal. At the launch, Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said the goal for research fundraising was $500 million.
Education, the next largest category was given a target of $150 million. Education includes reforming the curriculum as well as modifying physical spaces where learning takes place. The main push for the Medical School has been launching the “Pathways” curriculum.
The curriculum, which students and faculty alike thus far positively received, pushes for a flipped classroom model. Students complete most of their preparatory work outside of the classroom by reading textbooks and watching videos, with class time used for work on case studies and application of concepts.
The educational portion of the campaign will also contribute to the Medical School's tradition of being “one of the only top-tier medical schools that still adheres to a need-blind admissions policy,” Flier wrote in a statement about the capital campaign.
The final two categories, service and leadership, were given targets of $50 million each. The service aspect is intended to help the school partner with various organizations to pursue global health initiatives.
Several new centers and departments have also been established.These include the Center for Primary Care, the Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Evergrande Center for Immunological Diseases.
The Medical School has six priorities it will emphasize for the remainder of the campaign, according to the release. Among these are plans to complete the vision of the Pathways curriculum, bolster the financial aid program for students, use funds to address healthcare inequities through various centers, expand the faculty involved in therapeutic and regulatory science, strengthen collaborative and interdisciplinary work, and amass funds for pursuits that may arise in the future.
The leading donors to the Medical School with gifts of $10 million or more were listed in a release. They included the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Fund for Cancer Research, the Warren Alpert Foundation, the Bertarelli Foundation, Evergrande Group, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, as well as two anonymous donors.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION: April 21 2016 
A previous version of this article indicated that the leading donors to the Medical School had given gifts of $10 million. In fact, those donors had provided gifts of $10 million or more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard's international students, remaining in the United States after graduation can be complicated.
But for students in science, technology, engineering, and math, the process just became less stressful, because the federal government decided last month they can stay in the country for an additional seven months of on-the-job training.
International students enter Harvard with a student visa, known as the F-1 visa. Students can then apply for Optional Practical Training, which allows for one year of on-the-job training in an area related to their degrees.
Under the old program, students in STEM fields had an additional 29-month extension. Now, they can stay for 36 months as they push for the main object of desire a couple rungs below the coveted green card: the H-1B work visa.
Rohan Mazumdar, a master’s student from India studying statistics, said the process is “pretty unnerving.”
“Planning for the future is something that becomes very tricky with all of these things kind of in the air,” he said.
While there is no cap on student visas, there is a cap on the H-1B. Sixty-five thousand undergraduate applicants and 20,000 students pursuing advanced degrees are selected annually. Last year, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services received 233,000 H-1B applications. The agency then used a computer-generated random lottery to decide which applications get considered.
Mazumdar said he was fortunate enough to get an H-1B on his first try. But he added that the acceptance rate was a bit more promising several years ago when he applied.
For international students trying to beat the odds, Mazumdar said their best bet is to pursue an advanced degree in a STEM field. This grants the extra three year extension, allowing for an extra shot at the H-1B.
“It definitely impacts life choices, you know, choice of major, choice of career and industry,” Mazumdar said, adding that visa concerns probably amounted to “30 or 40 percent” of the reason why he is studying statistics rather than pursuing an MBA.
Aleksandra Kudryashova, a Ph.D. student from Russia in the German Department, spoke of the divide between STEM and humanities she felt at an event geared toward filing taxes.
“Half of them were from STEM and they were very happy that something had improved. But the other half were from humanities and they were really depressed that they still have only one year,” Kudryashova said.
But even with a STEM degree, sometimes it all comes down to luck, Ph.D. student Chinmay Shukla said. Shukla, an international student from India pursuing a degree in biological and biomedical sciences, said his friend at Carnegie Mellon, who had a STEM degree, did not get an H-1B and had to leave the country.
“The luck of the draw did not work in her favor,” Shukla said.
Mazumdar said he also has peers who had to return to their home countries. He added that some simply have to reconstruct their lives, while others apply to master’s programs as a backup plan to ensure that they at least can stay with a student visa.
Shukla said that more and more international students are looking to places like Canada and Europe for opportunities.
“I want to move to Canada because I feel like the country does not want me here,” Shukla said. “If someone doesn’t want you at a certain place, then you don’t stay there.”
According to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall, international students can use the Harvard International Office, which works closely with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as a resource. There are 1,427 international students in GSAS, hailing from 87 countries, according to the HIO.
Aside from University offices, international students are now also turning to the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers. The HGSU-UAW hosted several visa seminars in March, featuring an immigration lawyer.
Kudryashova, a supporter of the union effort, attended a seminar and said it was “very helpful.” She added that as a third-year student, it is important to know about the immigration system ahead of time.
“We’re sort of thinking everything’s golden and we’re fine, and not really realizing how much stress it will be to actually apply for it, to wait for the lottery, and then maybe not get it,” Kudryashova said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team entered its midweek fixture seeking to bounce back from a close loss to Penn last weekend and perhaps establish some momentum.
However, the Crimson (7-5, 3-2 Ivy) accomplished neither goal as it ultimately fell to local rival No. 14/15 Boston College (10-6, 2-5 ACC), 16-9, at Harvard Stadium on Wednesday night. Over the years, Harvard has won this matchup 27 times out of 38; however, the defeat marked the sixth time in as many years that the team has lost to the Eagles.
“[Boston College] is a real fast, up-tempo team and I think defensively we weren’t really ready for that,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I think we needed to adjust to the speed, and if we had started at pace earlier we would’ve been fine.”
The Eagles came out guns blazing in the first half of the game, and after fierce clear attempts by both sides, BC attacker Kate Weeks put the first goal on the board, her 32nd of the season, just 3:27 into the contest.
A little over two minutes later, Eagles attacker Kate Rich doubled her team’s lead with a quick goal. Then immediately off the ensuing faceoff, sophomore midfielder Kenzie Kent capitalized on a breakaway and quickly got the ball back to Rich, who scored her second consecutive goal of the game merely 10 seconds after her first to make it 3-0.
After a successful clear attempt, Crimson freshman midfielder Keeley MacAfee managed to fire one past BC goalie Zoe Ochoa, reducing the Eagles’ lead to two goals, 3-1. However, the squad from the other side of the Charles showed no indication of letting its lead slip. With 21:01 left in the first half, Rich squeezed in her third score of the game, and BC was hardly finished.
For the remainder of the first half, the Eagles continued to get the upper hand. Winning twelve draw controls, compared to the Crimson’s two, BC dominated the period offensively, putting heavy pressure on the Harvard defense and racking up six more goals before the break.
As the first half neared an end, Crimson junior Maeve McMahon managed to soften the blow by putting one past Ochoa with 26 seconds to go, but Harvard returned to the locker room behind, 10-3.
At the start of the second half, the Crimson came out playing a more aggressive game, and junior midfielder Alexis Nicolia tallied the team’s fourth goal just 31 seconds into the period.
“In the second half, we definitely started to focus more on the ground balls and just coming out more aggressive,” sophomore attacker Caroline Ashford said. “We really focused on draw and possessions because we knew we could score if we had the ball.”
Harvard’s burst of momentum would not carry on through the rest of the stanza, however. Two minutes later, BC attacker Laura Frankenfield matched Nicolia’s score, returning the margin to a seven-goal deficit for the Crimson, 11-4.
Despite facing a steep uphill battle, Harvard continued to play deep and spent much more time in the offensive zone than it had in the previous half, outshooting BC, 19-9, in the frame.
After another Eagles goal, Nicolia tried to keep the Crimson in the running, successfully scoring two consecutive goals, her third and fourth of the game.
But in the end, strong attacking play from BC stifled any shot of a Harvard comeback bid. By the final whistle, three Eagles players had scored hat tricks, including Weeks, who finished with six goals on the night, and Kent, who contributed seven assists and a score of her own.
Although disappointed with the result, the Crimson is already focusing on improving before its next contest.
“We need to work on the shooting before our next game,” Miller said. “We ended up outshooting them at the end of the day, but I’d say that of the 27 shots, 25 of them went high… You figure you shoot a little bit better and you start on the draw circle, you’re in the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking three of four from archrival Yale this past weekend, the Harvard baseball team rolled into Wednesday’s Beanpot consolation game against UMass with the momentum it had lacked all season.
Despite the hot streak, however, the Crimson was unable to shake its midweek woes as Harvard fell to the Minutemen, 6-2, at the New England Baseball Complex in Northborough, Mass.
Freshmen Kevin Stone and Simon Rosenblum-Larson turned in strong pitching performances when the two intrastate foes squared off over spring break in Clearwater, Fla., as the Crimson took those contests, 5-1 and 9-5.
On Wednesday, junior Kevin Rex got the ball for Harvard (12-20, 5-7 Ivy), but he would not make it out of the second inning.
UMass (9-17, 2-7 Atlantic 10) scattered two runs on three hits in the home half of the first and ended Rex’s day when Ryan Lever and Vinny Scifo continued the singles barrage a frame later. Lever came around to score on a Dylan Morris sacrifice fly, but the Minutemen’s edge sat at just two despite five hits through the two innings.
The Crimson jumped on UMass starter Casey Aubin for a run in the first, but the freshman settled in once he rolled through the Harvard lineup once.
Crimson senior second baseman Mitch Klug doubled out of the two-hole and scored on a throwing error following a Matt Rothenberg single. However, the Crimson would only get one run and four more hits before Aubin exited in the sixth with his team still up by two.
“It’s tough [playing catch-up],” Rothenberg said. “We did a good job getting guys on base, getting some innings going, and then we just never found a way to capitalize and get that big hit with runners in scoring position. So that’s something we’ll definitely be looking to do going forward.”
The one Harvard hitter Aubin and the rest of the Minutemen’s staff could not figure out was freshman designated hitter Patrick McColl. The Los Altos, Calif., native had four of the Crimson’s eight hits on the afternoon, raising his batting average to .284, good for third among the team’s regulars.
“It was great for him to get off his feet a little today,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “I think he had a great game, which is great in terms of as a confidence booster and getting his swing where it needs to be. I know he’s feeling great about where he is now, and these midweek games definitely help to boost your confidence going into this weekend.”
However, the team was unable to consistently get runners into scoring position, and when it did, it struggled to bring them home. Harvard manufactured a run in the third as a Rothenberg sacrifice fly plated junior shortstop Drew Reid, but in total, the Crimson left 12 runners on base and went 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position.
After its lead was cut to one in the third, UMass added a run in the fourth off senior Sean O’Neill.
Harvard had multiple baserunners in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings but was unable to get anything across. After throwing a perfect sixth inning, senior Joey Sliepka ran into trouble in the seventh as UMass senior catcher John Jennings went yard.
Minutemen junior Mike Geannelis then doubled before senior T.J. Laurisch pitched the Crimson out of the inning without allowing another run. However, like Sliepka, Laurisch ran into some trouble of his own in his second inning of work, surrendering three hits and a run that pushed the Minutemen’s lead to four. Yet, Sanders found positives in both hurlers getting innings under their belt.
“It’s definitely helpful [for the weekend pitchers to get game action],” Sanders said. “You practice all week, but especially with pitching, it’s tough to put yourself in a game situation when you’re throwing a bullpen. It’s great to face some live hitters and mentally put yourself in a game situation.”
McColl picked up his fourth hit in the top of the ninth, but the rest of the Harvard order could not muster a hit against Geannelis, who moved from first base to the mound for the final inning.
Geannelis is hitting .343 in 35 at-bats this season and has also made five appearances out of the UMass bullpen. Sanders is the only Crimson pitcher with an at-bat this season.
Harvard will now have to wait for 2017 to have a shot at another Beanpot title, which the Crimson has won three times in its 26 year history, most recently in 2014.
“Looking back on my for years here, one thing I’ll never forget is winning the Beanpot [in 2014],” Sanders said. “It’s one of those things that’s tremendously exciting. It’s fun to compete against these teams and see where you rank. It’s a great event.”
