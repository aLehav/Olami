After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a year after the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority drew harsh criticism for its faltering operations during Boston’s historic winter, a new report published by a Harvard Kennedy School fellow details how the system can improve its service and stay financially viable.
The report, authored by Charles Chieppo, a fellow at the Ash Center who previously served on the MBTA’s Blue Ribbon Committee on Forward Funding, outlines several steps that the transportation service should take to reduce costs and increase ridership. The recommendations include improving customer service, ending expansion projects beyond those required by law, bringing MBTA workers into the Massachusetts State Pension Fund, and ending the power of their worker union to leverage final and binding arbitration in their favor.
The MBTA, and in particular, its rail service known as the T, faced criticism after experiencing crippling delays, cancellations, and suspensions last winter, which saw record-breaking snowfalls. These failures can partly be attributed to a lack of maintenance upkeep on the MBTA’s equipment, according to the report.
According to Chieppo, the MBTA faces two major problems: a multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog and immense debt. As of October 31, the MBTA owes more than $5 billion in debt, according to a recent report from the transportation service’s Fiscal and Management Control Board, which Massachusetts governor Charles D. Baker ’79 convened in July to advise the MBTA on sustainable management, operations, and finance.
“You’ve got a problem where a lot of money has been spent to fund expansion, and it has come at the cost of maintaining the current system,” Chieppo said in an interview.
MBTA spokesperson Jason B. Johnson wrote in an email that the government is working with the MBTA to address these issues.
“Since its formation, the [Fiscal and Management Control Board] has aggressively examined opportunities to reduce the T’s structural deficit and operating costs,” Johnson wrote. The T aims to raise its revenue to $100 million, from its current annual level of $60 million, Johnson wrote.
Johnson also wrote that the control board has also “made quick moves to address costs on the Green Line Extension, a major expansion project.”
Chieppo’s report, which also provide plans to increase the T’s revenue, includes recommendations that fall into two broad categories: improving customer service and decreasing costs.
“If you want people who have other options to ride the T, then you need to have good customer service,” Chieppo said. “It gets to where you have more revenue and more riders, and gets you to a place where you can have discounts for lower income people.”
The main cost-cutting measures he proposed include ending expansion projects for the T beyond those required by law. Chieppo's other proposals involve mitigating the power of the worker union and putting workers on a state-run pension program.
“The MBTA pension is a mess,” Chieppo said. The MBTA retirement fund is private and separate from the state pension, and the fund does not  disclose much of its information to the public. Chieppo said that taxpayers, though, pay for part of the MBTA retirement fund.
“If the fund is in as bad a shape as we think it is, then the taxpayers are on the hook for that,” Chieppo said.
Chieppo also said the government should remove the worker union’s ability to have final and binding arbitration. According to the report, arbitrators’ rulings on the worker  union’s behalf are not subject to approval by another entity, such as a “city council or board of selectmen.”
Johnson wrote in his email that the MBTA has already considered many of the reforms suggested in the report. In a report from November 30, the MBTA’s Fiscal and Management Control Board considered reforming The RIDE—a transportation service for the elderly and disabled—and reducing expenditures for bus maintenance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when she faces immense pressure to address what some have alleged is racism at Harvard Law School, Dean Martha L. Minow challenged a crowd of about 900 graduating students from the University of Michigan on Sunday to stand up against injustice in their post-graduate lives.
Minow, who received her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1975,  traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., Sunday to speak at the university’s winter commencement ceremony. Minow gave her speech, which focused on activism, a month after a racially-charged incident occurred at the Law School involving the taping of black professors’ portraits, which officials are investigating as a hate crime. Student activists, in the meantime, have protested against what they characterize as the Law School’s inadequate treatment of minority students.
Minow began her address by congratulating students and thanking the University of Michigan for inviting her to speak before her former adviser and other colleagues. But her tone quickly became serious as she asked, “What does it take to stand up against what seems wrong—and when and how should we?”
Minow urged students not to be bystanders, or people who do not speak out or act against perceived injustices. Instead, Minow encouraged students to be “upstanders”—a term she said she first heard from Samantha Power, her former student and current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Upstanders, Minow said, are people who take action against wrongdoing like bullying or racism, despite potential social or financial costs.
“We all know it is easier and more familiar to do nothing and say nothing,” Minow said. “We often fail to speak out simply out of fear. We fear for our own safety, our own reputation.”
Throughout her speech, Minow referenced historical instances of discrimination, including the South African apartheid and a 1957 incident in Little Rock, Ark. in which the Arkansas National Guard tried to prevent nine African-American students from entering a formerly segregated school.
Drawing an analogy to bullying in schools, Minow called on the audience to collectively confront injustice.
“Taking even seemingly small acts in one’s own school can build the culture that prevents violence, bullying, sexual assault, and racial microaggressions,” she said.
Minow has come face-to-face with student activism herself in the past month, after the taping incident in November sparked debate about broader issues of race and diversity at the Law School. Student activists at the school have continued to protest and criticized Minow for her response to their demands, which include instituting a race theory program at the Law School and removing the school’s controversial seal— the family crest of a former slave owning family. Minow has taken some steps to address these demands; in particular, she created a committee to reconsider the Law School’s seal.
The activism at the Law School is one of many student movements that have emerged on college campuses across the nation this fall, as student activists at universities including Yale, Princeton, and the University of Missouri have called on administrators to address racial tensions on their campuses. Earlier this month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said  Harvard’s residential House Masters unanimously decided to change their title, which some students criticize as associated with slavery. In late November, a group of Latino students met with University President Drew G. Faust to present a series of demands aimed at better including students of color on campus.
Graduating University of Michigan student Thomas M. McBrien said Minow’s speech was timely and well received.
“I thought the emphasis on activism was a really important one given the current climate in our nation,” McBrien said. “It was a topical, powerful message, especially for recent graduates. It gave us something to think about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 22, 2015, at 9:37 p.m.
The Harvard men’s basketball team last faced Brigham Young 37 years ago, falling by a score of 113-72 in Provo, Utah. But as ESPN’s Cory Alexander proclaimed during the broadcast at the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic, “This is not your father’s Harvard team."
Behind a night to remember for junior forward Zena Edosomwan, who logged career-bests of 23 points and 17 rebounds, the Crimson (4-6) defeated the Cougars (7-5), 85-82.
Forty minutes were not enough to decide a winner, however. After a three by BYU freshman Nick Emery gave the Cougars a four-point lead with 2:17 to go in regulation, senior forward Patrick Steeves evened the score with a jumper and two free throws on consecutive possessions. Then after BYU’s Chase Fischer hit two free throws after being fouled from behind the arc, Steeves delivered again, hitting a runner in the lane to tie the game with 29 seconds to go. Steeves scored all nine of his points in the final 6:07 of regulation.
“Pat was dynamic for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He was really the guy we went to and leaned on to make some offensive plays for us…. I thought his play was very much needed for us to come out with the W.”
With a chance to take the lead and send the Crimson packing in the final seconds of regulation, Fischer took a straightaway three which fell short as the clock wound down. Captain Evan Cummins grabbed the rebound out of the air, but not without controversy. The Cougars contested that a goaltend should have been called as Cummins grabbed the senior's shot before it could hit the rim, but the officials stood by the call on the floor.
In overtime, Harvard struggled to get stops. Led by senior guard Kyle Collinsworth, the Cougars picked apart the Crimson defense on nearly every possession. With Edosomwan on the bench after fouling out with 1:16 to go in the extra frame, BYU sent the ball down low often. Collinsworth tallied nine points in the overtime period, all from the paint or the free throw line.
But with Edosomwan on the bench, it was the team’s veterans who sealed the victory. After Steeves’s timely scoring kept Harvard in the game at the end of the second frame, it was Cummins and senior forward Agunwa Okolie who came up clutch for the Crimson in overtime. Harvard trailed by three late, but Cummins scored four consecutive points to bring the Crimson within one with 49 seconds remaining, before Okolie did his damage from the charity stripe.
With Okolie, one of Harvard’s weaker free throw shooters, on the floor in the waning minutes, the Cougars targeted the Ajax, Ontario native. But Okolie was perfect when it mattered most, hitting four free throws in the final 17 seconds of play—two with four seconds left—to increase Harvard’s lead to three. Collinsworth’s subsequent last-second heave from beyond the arc fell short, marking the only shot BYU would miss from the field in overtime.
“Free throws is one of the biggest parts of practice,” Okolie said. “We shoot probably 100 free throws in every practice. It’s just like stepping up, being confident, and taking your shot.”
Despite taking a 19-3 lead to open the first half, BYU slowly cut away at Harvard’s lead. A three by freshman guard Zac Seljaas capped a 19-5 run and gave the Cougars a one-point lead with 38 seconds to go in the half. But junior guard Corbin Miller, who had a season-high 17 points in the game, returned the favor with a baseline three assisted by freshman guard Corey Johnson to send the Crimson to the locker room up two.
The second half was a different story. While the first frame saw both teams go on huge runs, Harvard and BYU traded baskets in the second, with neither team going up by more than five.
BYU shot 50 percent from the floor on the game, much higher than the Crimson’s season average of holding opponents to 37 percent shooting. But Harvard's key to limiting the Cougar offense was defending from deep. BYU shot just 3-of-13 from beyond the arc.
“Our kids were locked in with their shooters, and that’s easier said than done,” Amaker said. “For the most part we did that…. We talked about trying to take away the three and trying to limit their opportunities on the backboard.”
Though the teams have nearly opposite playing styles, the Crimson managed to set the tone on the defensive end. Coming into the night, Harvard boasted the longest average possession length in the country—20.6 seconds, while BYU had the seventh shortest at 14.1. While both teams kept to their standards, with the Crimson averaging 19 seconds per possession on the night compared to 14 for the Cougars, BYU scored below 70 points for just the second time all season.
The Crimson does not have much time to rest, as it returns to action Wednesday for the tournament semifinals against Auburn, who defeated New Mexico, 83-78 in its first round matchup. Despite its gutsy victory, Harvard is already zoned in on the next game. In response to questions about fatigue, Okolie had no concerns.
“We have to figure it out for 40 minutes,” Okolie said. “We have to tough it out.”
“Get back at it,” Edosomwan added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard advanced to the semifinals of the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic with an 85-82 overtime victory over BYU on Tuesday. Despite trailing by as many as 16 points in the first half, the Cougars (7-4) had the Crimson (4-6) on the ropes several times in the final minutes of regulation. Key defensive stops and clutch shooting down the stretch ultimately were the difference for Harvard, which posted its first two-game win streak of the season.
DOUBLING DOWN
A balanced offensive attack catapulted the Crimson to a 19-3 lead to start the game. Each of Harvard’s starters scored, with many of the buckets coming on open layups or three pointers. BYU switched to zone defense after the game’s second media timeout in order to compensate for the Crimson’s hot shooters.
The strategy allowed junior forward Zena Edosomwan to have the most productive game of his collegiate career. Edosomwan finished the contest with a career-high 23 points and a Diamond Head Classic-record 17 rebounds. Edosomwan was quiet in the first half on offense, gathering nine rebounds on the defensive end but only finishing with five points.
“I really believe in this team, I know they’re going to look for me to make plays and make good reads,” Edosomwan said. “The guys just kept pushing me like, ‘we’re going to be fine.’ Just getting the confidence to continue to fight out there.”
That confidence was evident after the intermission. The junior continued to be a force on the glass but was much more efficient on the offensive end. Edosomwan went six-of-eight from the field and did not turn the ball over in the second half or overtime. Unlike in most contests this season, Edosomwan was not double-teamed by the opposing defense, and the Los Angeles native took advantage.
While the hot shooting of Harvard’s guards opened up the Cougar defense for Edosomwan early on, it was the offensive play of Edosomwan and senior forward Agunwa Okolie that allowed the Crimson to hit key shots down the stretch. After Edosomwan hit a free throw to tie the game at 49 with just under 10 minutes to play, classmate Corbin Miller buried a three on the next possession to give Harvard the lead. A few minutes later with just over six minutes to go in regulation, it was senior forward Pat Steeves following Edosomwan’s free throws with a three.
DIGGING IN DEFENSIVELY
On the surface, the offensive styles of the Crimson and BYU could not be more different. The calling card of coach Tommy Amaker’s Harvard teams is defense and preventing teams from scoring in transition. The Cougars pride themselves on spreading the floor and having their sharpshooting guards hit open jumpers. The Crimson’s victory was indicative of which style won out on Tuesday.
“We tried to do our best with staying locked in with their shooters,” Amaker said. “For the most part, we did that.”
Despite allowing more points than it has in a game all season, Harvard was able to hold BYU to just 3 three-pointers and two fast break points. Entering the game, the Cougars were averaging 8.4 three-point field goals a contest to go along with nine fast break points. Despite allowing BYU to shoot 50 percent, the Crimson had one more shot attempt than the Cougars.
Junior forward Kyle Davis torched Harvard for 23 points, but the Crimson was much more willing to concede points inside than treys to BYU’s dangerous outside shooters.
“He was really crafty,” Edosomwan said. “He was really hard to guard because that shot’s so consistent and so automatic and he hit a lot of those. He’s really tough, he played a heck of a game, a lot of credit to him.”
The bend-but-don’t-break defense of Harvard may have been most on display with the game on the line. The Crimson was down by as many four in the extra session and the Cougars’ potent offense finally looked like it was hitting its stride.
BYU had come away with points on its first eight possessions of overtime. Cougar baskets on possessions nine and ten would have put the game out of reach, but the Harvard defense forced Collinsworth and freshman guard Nick Emery into turnovers that led to four made free throws by Okolie and a spot in the semifinals for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s basketball writer Theresa Hebert picks three things to watch in Wednesday’s contest between Harvard and Auburn in the second round of the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii (4:30 EST, ESPNU). The Crimson (4-6), took down Brigham Young in overtime Tuesday to advance, while Auburn (6-3) beat New Mexico in a back-and-forth affair to win its first round game.
CONTAINING CANTY
Coming into the first round, it was BYU senior Kyle Collinsworth who was Harvard’s biggest concern. Turning to Auburn, the Crimson will once again look to senior Agunwa Okolie to bottle up Tiger point guard Kareem Canty, who had 27 points against the Lobos on Tuesday.
Canty is especially threatening from behind the arc, hitting five treys in the first round game. Perimeter defense was a strong suit for Harvard against the Cougars, limiting BYU to 3-of-13 shooting from deep, and it will need to do the same to keep Auburn in check.
MAKING THE EASY SHOTS
Though it hit them when it counted, the Crimson has struggled all year from the free throw line, and it continued Tuesday. Harvard shot just 61 percent from the charity stripe, including 5-of-12 shooting for junior forward Zena Edosomwan.
Edosomwan scored 23 points and snagged 17 rebounds against BYU, both career highs, but consistently clunked shots off the front of the rim from the free throw line. The junior has been Harvard’s most dominant player all season and is currently the only Ivy League player averaging a double-double, but free throws have been his Achilles heel.
Buckets from the charity stripe sealed the victory for Harvard against the Cougars, with Okolie sinking four in the last 17 seconds of the game, but clutch free throw shooting has not always been the case for the Crimson. Against a tough competitor like Auburn, Tommy Amaker’s squad can’t afford to leave easy points behind.
NOT SO EGI-CELLENT
While Edosomwan has taken the brunt of the work in the paint for the Crimson, sophomore forward Chris Egi has been lackluster off the bench when filling in for Edosomwan. Egi failed to score in his 13 minutes on the floor Tuesday, but was flagged for four fouls in that time frame.
Egi, who was a four-star recruit coming into Cambridge, has averaged just 2.2 points per game this season. Especially glaring is his free throw shooting percentage, which makes Edosomwan look good. Egi has hit just 25 percent of his shots from the line compared to Edosomwan’s 46 percent shooting.
With Okolie likely spending his time guarding Canty, if Edosomwan finds himself in foul trouble, the Crimson needs someone it can turn to in the paint.

Oh no—it’s the day before Christmas Eve, and you were so busy scrambling to do your Course Evaluations (due at 11 p.m. tonight!) that you completely forgot to buy something for your Secret Santa. You’re broke, you’re panicked, and your parents are mad at you for sleeping past noon every day since you’ve gotten home. We at Flyby would hate for you to disappoint, so we’ve collected some last-minute gift ideas that won’t break the bank.
For the friend of a friend that you don’t really know:
Unlucky you—for this year’s Secret Santa, you were assigned the one person that you literally have never had a conversation with. Honestly, how did they end up in this gift exchange anyway? Wasn’t this supposed to be blockmates-only? You barely know this person’s last name, so trying to buy a cute, personal present is out of the cards. When in doubt, opt for a couple of chocolate bars from CVS, preferably the ones that come wrapped with foil in a fancy box, therefore making it look like you tried. Just hope your Secret Santee isn’t lactose intolerant.
For the estranged linkmate:
You two were super close for most of freshman year, but the years have not treated your friendship kindly. No longer sharing a dhall, combined with some internal drama amongst your linkmates, has put you in the awkward position of buying a gift for someone you used to know. Even worse, half the people in the room are still mad at them. Go for the ever-harmless, yet functional and necessary, gift of socks. A warm wool pair will help them survive Boston’s ice and slush, while a cute patterned pair will show how thoughtful and fashionable you are. Either way, it’s a win-win situation.
For the picky sibling:
You really want to get something your brother or sister will like, but their tastes are hard to pin down (or prohibitively expensive). Consider buying them a subscription to something you know they’ll like: whether it’s Netflix or The New York Times, Spotify Premium or Rolling Stone, they’ll be reminded of your sibling love once a month for a year—or until the student discount you used to buy it runs out.
For the new significant other:
Cuffing season hit you, and it hit you hard. You’ve gone into winter break with a new relationship, plane tickets to visit them in January, and no clue what to get them for the holidays. Concert tickets to see their favorite band, while on the pricier side, are a good way to show you care (and that you approve of their music taste). Plus, you’ll have a fun date to look forward to next semester, assuming you survive meeting the parents.
For the close friend who you inexplicably forgot to buy something for:
