After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the last Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting of the semester this past Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust announced that the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted to keep the original May 2016 social group policy proposed by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. Under this policy, undergraduate members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations will not be allowed to hold leadership positions on athletics teams and recognized student groups. This announcement ostensibly brings to an end a protracted 19 months of debate over the merits and faults of the sanctions among Harvard College affiliates. After this tumultuous and occasionally acrimonious period, we are relieved that we will finally see a concrete policy in action.
This unprecedented intervention of the Corporation in undergraduate social life may appear as an overstep of its power. Nevertheless, the exceptional circumstances surrounding the sanctions justified this input from the Corporation. For one, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences already rejected an opportunity in November to pass a motion presented by Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 intended to obstruct the sanctions. Moreover, as outlined by Faust and senior fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72, the potential implications of the sanctions go far beyond student life at the College, and for that reason the Corporation is responsible for providing input. Lastly, the Corporation’s move will prevent President Faust’s successor from easily altering this policy, thereby guaranteeing the longevity of the policy and enabling the new president to concentrate on more urgent issues.
Regardless of the process behind its implementation, we reiterate our support for sanctions on single-gender social organizations. This measure serves as an initial corrective to the outsized influence of final clubs over undergraduate student life while helping combat their discriminatory practices. Moreover, though Greek organizations are not as deleterious to students’ experience at Harvard as final clubs, we believe with the Faculty view that Harvard should not become a Greek school, and this policy will aid in re-centering social life at the College around the 12 undergraduate Houses.
Sanctions are a start to shifting power dynamics within these organizations, but diversity and equity will require more time and effort. Although the decision to keep sanctions may induce some male final clubs to become co-ed, the issue remains that the leadership of these organizations, including the graduate boards, will still be entirely composed of men. This asymmetry of power could result in the marginalization of the new members, thereby maintaining the historic gender imbalances in final clubs. Though final clubs cannot instantly change the composition of their leadership, we urge them to quickly promote new members into leadership positions in order to ensure that their new diversity of membership is reflected in their corridors of power.
Moreover, though this policy will advance Harvard’s continued efforts towards inclusivity, it does not address many of the pervasive issues that students belonging to historically marginalized groups face on campus. In the announcement of the Corporation’s move, Faust cited the final clubs’ history as overwhelmingly white, male, and affluent as a driving force behind the sanctions. However, these sanctions will likely have little effect on the racial and socioeconomic makeup of the final clubs, to say nothing of other historically marginalized groups such as the BGLTQ+ community. We hope that these sanctions will further stimulate campus dialogue on issues of inclusivity and that the administration will continue to be aware of exclusion on campus and support further measures in support of marginalized students. Indeed, perhaps the conclusion of the conversation around sanctions that has dominated campus dialogue for the past 19 months will create space for these conversations to flourish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago I was searching for a document on the Google Drive of Satire V, a satirical campus publication of which I am an associate editor, when I found some troubling articles that had faded from institutional memory. The first article I read, “Male Rape: the Real Prisoner’s Dilemma,” has since been deleted from the Satire V website but followed an economist who developed an “eloquent model” for inmate rape based on game theory. Calling the rapee a “scrawny b****,” the article concludes: “No matter what the rapee chooses the raper is better off raping, and this is, therefore, his dominant strategy.”
The other articles were less violent, but equally appalling—crude, dehumanizing, and viscerally misogynistic. “Harvard Student Expands into Allston Girl,” which parodies Harvard’s expansion into the neighborhood of Allston, describes a man who wants to “forge a blazing path of glory right into every Allston girl” after a breakup with his ex-girlfriend. “Al Gore Blames Global Warming on Hot Babes” quotes a fictional prostitute who remarks “Guys want something raw and savage, something displaying lots of skin and a vagina, not an amorphous sack.” “WHO Gives Paris Hilton Head” features a picture of a half-naked Paris Hilton with the World Health Organization logo photoshopped onto her bra cups. UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon is quoted saying: “we unanimously agree that the heiress, actress, singer, model, and designer that is Paris Hilton will warmly fill our eager holes.”
Like many comedic spaces, up until a few years ago Satire V was overwhelmingly white, heterosexual, and male. To be sure, women and people of color have held important positions within the club, even at the time these articles were written. But it takes more than a few people to change an institution. Even when you’re in a position of power, it’s hard to raise objections—you don’t want to be the one who ruins the fun. It’s not too difficult to imagine how these articles passed editorial review. Any 13-year-old boy who has played the penis game can tell you that sexual jokes are easy humor, especially when they’re introduced in inappropriate contexts. It feels wrong to mention an international institution like the World Health Organization in the same sentence as oral sex. And because it’s wrong, it’s funny. (This is the premise of dead baby jokes and the game Cards Against Humanity.) There’s something satisfying about disrupting the sacred, about bringing the powerful down to a place where they don’t belong.
Lately, I’ve been thinking about my status as a woman in comedy. What it means to be a part of an organization that only five years ago so casually trivialized rape—how to interpret this history when every day generates a new stream of sexual assault allegations against once-untouchable men. What it means to be afforded a platform that allows me to confront the structures that have made women feel powerless. How I feel lucky but also guilty, even undeserving, of this kind of access.
When you parody the thing you fear, you loosen its control. The exercise of writing satire is my way of taking power, of convincing myself that I have a voice.
But the more I read the news, the more I am scared of trying to use that voice in an industry that seems so fundamentally resistant to change. Comedy has the unique power to normalize. By directing our laughter, it tells us what behaviors to accept. But too often, the ability to reshape our norms is excluded from the people who need change the most. For each man whose legacy crumbles, there are thousands of others who accepted his behavior—who assumed their “progressiveness” meant everything was fine.
There’s this tendency among comedians to assume that because we’re the underdogs, we’re incapable of being wrong. I see this even in my most liberal comedy groups. We’re supposed to be the “good guys”: the ones who call out power imbalances, not perpetuate them. We’ve learned to cut out the worst of our humor, soften our voices, refer abstractly to “the patriarchy.” The notion of progressiveness inspires a tendency to dismiss objections with blithe remarks that “you can’t please everyone.”
But if we’ve learned anything recently, it’s that comedy suffers from the same pathologies as everything else. Comedians hurt people. They abuse their power. Sometimes their transgressions are smaller: They speak over women, respond solely to men, or host social events that are too “bro-ey.” Good intentions are hollow consolations in the fight for a culture where women feel not only safe, but empowered to vocalize their opinions.
Over the past five years, Satire V has seen serious changes, both in content and representation. Sixty-three percent of the members we initiated this semester were women—as are our president and two out of four of our associate editors, including myself. In the past two months alone, women in Satire V have written articles criticizing gender bias in Harvard’s math department, the reductive categorization of women’s body types, and the disproportionate burden on women to shoulder emotional labor in heterosexual relationships. And in the wake of revelations about the pervasive abuse of power by men in the entertainment industry, we’ve written articles responding to figures like Louis C.K. and the cultural attitudes that enable their bad behavior.
But we can’t allow this progress to convince us that our work is done. Numerical representation doesn’t say anything about whether the presence of women is valued, whether they feel comfortable speaking, or whether they feel empowered to communicate in their own voice. The question is never if we can do better, but how.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As someone who calls Nebraska, a deeply red state, home, I am sometimes too sympathetic towards President Donald Trump’s supporters. At times, I’m too willing to assign the best intentions even to the most extreme of them. Other times I’m too unforgiving. I’m sick of trying to rationally explain why they think and act and vote they way they do, even when none of it seems to deserve an explanation or make sense.
Regardless, I realize that just because I grew up in Nebraska doesn’t mean I know everything about Trump’s constituency, and neither does my reading of polls and studies about them. It takes effort to try to understand both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of this demographic, and I hope that columns like mine, one that I’ve tried to make as research-based but approachable as possible, help us accomplish this. This effort is especially necessary at places like Harvard, where so much of the student body—and the school’s most visible culture—is made up of well-off, liberal students from highly educated families in the Northeast. Republicans are rare and Trump supporters are next to nonexistent. Harvard needs to be a part of the discussion about a region and a people who, for several decades, were largely dismissed as politically irrelevant, but now demand our awareness and commentary, for their sake, and for our own. Our agency as Harvard students is powerful, and we should use it to benefit their communities and make us more informed and worldly. At a school whose motto is “truth,” we owe it to ourselves to learn as much as possible about the world we live in.
As Democrats, we can’t only focus on what’s wrong with Trump. We spend 24 hours a day of television and thousands of words in hundreds of op-eds reporting on and analyzing the President’s speeches, actions, and tweets. Trump’s behavior is worthy of our attention, but we can’t let his four-year term slip by without spending time looking at our party introspectively. In the wake of Trump’s startling election, we briefly realized this—when nearly every major poll and newspaper incorrectly predicted a win by Secretary Hillary Clinton, Democrats and political pundits realized that something was gravely wrong, not only with our polling, but also with our understanding of the political landscape of the country. That sense of urgency has disappeared. It’s hard to focus on our own faults when something goes wrong in the White House every day, but we should use the faults of Trump, the Senate, and the Republican National Committee to motivate us to recognize and fix our own.
Democrats have to find grounding, and we need a palpable objective other than criticizing Trump—not because it isn’t deserved, but because if we continue, we will otherwise find ourselves lost in 2018 for the House and Senate elections, and in 2020 for the presidential race.
Practically speaking, 2018 House and Senate elections could be massively fruitful for Democrats. Several Senate and House seats have the chance to go blue in the Midwest alone. Debra S. Fischer, a first-term senator from Nebraska whose voting patterns align with Trump’s over 90 percent of the time, will be up for re-election. In Missouri and Indiana, two senators, Claire C. McCaskill and Joe S. Donnelly, respectively, will also be up for reelection. Each is a Democrat, but their seats are listed as “toss-ups” by election-predicting website 270ToWin, underscoring the importance of those elections. House races in the Midwest are also important. In what 270ToWin places as the only “toss-up” election in any Midwestern state besides Minnesota in 2018, Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District will likely have the choice between incumbent Republican Donald J. Bacon and a Democratic opponent. There are fewer and fewer swing states and districts, and we have to take advantage of the opportunities that we have; other “competitive” House elections will take place in Illinois’s 6th and 12th districts, as well as Iowa’s 1st and 3rd.
To win seats, Democrats need several strategies, as well as a a leader. Since the election, there has been no one to lead the party in a unified resistance, or to pitch a plan of action. Democrats must also convince former Republicans that they have a place in the party.  New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote last week that, “More and more former Republicans wake up every day and realize: ‘I’m homeless. I’m politically homeless.’” These “homeless” former Republicans have to be convinced that they should vote Democrat rather than either abstaining or voting for independents.
Voting participation continues to become more and more important. As we (hopefully) learned in 2016,  it’s not safe to stay at home and assume that the election will work out the way we want it to. Especially in midterm elections, the turnout among younger and less-wealthy people is low.
While there are a ton of reasonable ways to contribute politically, and each member of the Harvard community and beyond should find where they can contribute. Some areas are more in need than others. Canvassing and campaigning in the Northeast is valuable, but we have to remember the communities that need it most: the forgotten cities and counties in the Midwest that not only have potential to turn blue, but are clearly in political distress. We have to remember what allowed Trump to happen—from his persona, to his appeal to evangelicals, to his exploitation of the Midwest—and we have to truly internalize it. Otherwise, we can’t move forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it prepares to implement the College's social group penalties, the Office of Student Life will seek to dispel uncertainty and combat a lack of knowledge about the policy among undergraduates, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in an interview Monday.
Last week, the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—formally voted to maintain the original sanctions on social groups first announced in May 2016. The decision capped over a year of extensive debate on a policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups, varsity athletic team captancies, and several prestigious fellowships, such as the Rhodes or Marshall scholarships.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also said last week that the College will finalize a plan to enforce the penalties by the start of next semester and the Office of Student Life will oversee implementation.
O’Dair, who leads the Office of Student Life, said that the plan for implementing the penalties is still under discussion, but that her office is receptive to further student feedback.
“We are committed to transparency, our efforts are going to be geared toward clarity of the policy,” O’Dair said. “We want to reduce student anxiety.”
O’Dair added that students will be involved in the implementation, but “what that exactly looks like is to be determined,” she said.
While the policy technically took effect when the Class of 2021 came to campus in August, the Office of Student Life has yet to enforce the penalties on members of single-gender final clubs or Greek organizations. The office has not expected recognized student organizations to enforce the policy’s restrictions up to this point, according to O’Dair.
She echoed Khurana’s comments that implementation of the policy will be guided by two reports produced by committees tasked with reviewing the penalties, as well as a letter issued by University President Drew G. Faust and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, which announced the results of the Corporation’s vote. O’Dair served on both these committees shortly after arriving to the College in August 2016.
But it is still unclear which recommendations from the committees’ reports will ultimately be implemented.
“We’re still in the process of determining the process for the next steps on implementation and once it’s ready to share, we’ll announce that,” she said.
The letter from Faust and Lee also noted that the Committee on Student Life—a body that includes Undergraduate Council representatives, House Faculty Deans, and OSL administrators—will be tasked with providing interim reports to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and other University administrators.
O’Dair, who also chairs the Committee on Student Life, said the committee will assess implementation, the impact on extracurricular and social life, and their charge to grant recognition to student groups.
While College administrators finalize the policy’s implementation, Office of Student Life staff continue to meet with leaders of unrecognized social groups.
“We have been doing work prior to the policy announcement with groups who are interested in exploring what it looks like to become gender-inclusive, so that work will continue,” O’Dair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College has changed House resident deans’ titles back to “Allston Burr Resident Dean”—the fourth time administrators have revised the title in little over a decade.
The decision to revert to an older title reflected widespread confusion about the previous title of “Allston Burr Assistant Dean,” according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. The 13 House resident deans report to O’Dair, who oversees the upperclassmen residential system, along with the respective Faculty Deans of each House.
“The resident deans, former Allston Burr Assistant Deans, reported to me that their title was confusing to students, and so they asked that it be reverted back to the former title,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair added that the live-in administors’ roles and responsibilities did not change with the retitling.
Several other College administrators carry similar titles that contain “assistant” or “associate dean.” The resident dean position was last retitled in 2014 following a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee review that sought to clarify the chief welfare administrator's role within the College hierarchy.
The official title of the Adams House resident dean, for example, is now “Allston Burr Resident Dean of Adams House and Assistant Dean of Harvard College.”
Each resident dean lives in one of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses, acts as a liaison for students with academic departments, serves as an adviser for personal or academic difficulties, and represents students on the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.
The Freshman Dean’s Office also employs resident deans of freshmen with similar responsibilities, who each oversee one of the four Yard neighborhoods.
The College appointed new resident deans for Dunster, Eliot, and Winthrop in July, along with the non-residential Dudley House. Several resident deans did not return requests for comment on this story.

When Lowell House resident Jessica C. Levy ’18 decided to stay in Cambridge over the summer, she didn’t have to worry about finding an apartment. After contacting an administrator in her House, she made a connection that led to house-sitting the entire summer for a local professional affiliated with Lowell.
The professional turned out to be a member of Lowell’s Senior Common Room.
“I actually am a really big proponent of the SCR, and I think it’s one of the more underutilized aspects of House life,” Levy said.
This experience is one example of an interaction between students and faculty members that the House system was established to facilitate.
While several administrators and graduate students live in each House as residential staff, the Senior Common Room also includes a group of non-residential affiliates, including Harvard faculty members, alumni, and people working in the Boston area.
Both a physical space and a group of people, the Senior Common Room system is meant to facilitate interactions between undergraduates and people who can provide mentorship, job opportunities, and House-wide camaraderie in an informal setting.
Harvard’s Senior Common Room system as it exists today was conceived nearly a century ago, but since its inception, many argue that implementation and quality vary widely among the 12 upperclassmen residences.
While some Houses boast black-tie dinners where students rub shoulders with famous professors, many students interviewed for this story were unaware of the existence of their House’s Senior Common Room beyond a physical space.
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences worked through the planning stages of their more than $1 billion House Renewal project in 2009, an extensive modernization of the upperclassmen residences, its initial report noted that the Senior Common Room is “an outdated concept that in many cases is not working well for current students and faculty.”
One line from the report simply reads: “There is presently a lack of clarity about what the group known as the SCR is and what it is supposed to do.”
While the 2009 report suggested several recommendations to structurally improve the program, evidence of these changes is lacking, and many students and SCR affiliates raise the same critiques that the report identified almost a decade ago.
Like Harvard’s House system as a whole, the Senior Common Room draws its inspiration from the residential college systems of Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom.
According to Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck the concept of a Senior Common Room is as old as the House system itself. 
Eck said that the first House Master of Lowell and an early senior tutor had “quite a significant exchange of letters” about developing the SCR. They asked questions like, “Who should be a part of this? What kind of people?”
“They wanted people who really were engaged with and cared about undergraduate education, not just the smartest scientists in the world,” she added.
In Lowell House, one vestige of the British model is an event known as “High Table” dinner for seniors—a black-tie affair where students dine with the Harvard faculty members and local professionals in their Senior Common Room.
“People have gotten jobs at High Table, and made connections with people in London or Bolivia,” Eck added.
According to the House renewal report, one of the key aims of the House system is to “promote meaningful faculty-student interaction, with the understanding that House life should engender an intergenerational community of scholars.”
“I think we have a larger and more active Senior Common Room than many other Houses, and it’s one of the things that brings to life the idea of the residential House system,” Eck said, referring to Lowell.
Lowell resident Natalie I. Swartz ’20 said that SCR members often eat in the House’s dining hall and attend formal events, like the Yule Dinner.
Swartz recounted meeting an SCR professor at breakfast in Lowell’s dining hall and speaking with him about the seminar, which she didn’t get the chance to take her freshman year.
“It was so cool to finally meet him, and this whole year whenever we run into each other, I get to talk to him, ask him how the seminar's going. He asks me how sophomore year's going, so it's been a nice relationship to have this semester,” Swartz said.
For alumna Caroline K. Lauer ’14, a first-year master’s degree student at the Graduate School of Design, connecting with members of her House’s SCR facilitated meaningful relationships with experts in her field.
“One of them ended up being incredibly informative for me thinking about graduate school and actually ended up being one of my professors last year at the Graduate School of Design,” Lauer said.
In addition to Harvard professors, House Faculty Deans invite a combination of non-resident professionals and alumni to participate in Senior Common Rooms.
Aspen Institute CEO and famed biographer Walter S. Isaacson ’74, a former resident of Lowell House, said that he returns to Harvard every few months to spend time at Lowell.
“When I come to Harvard, I often eat in Lowell House with some of the students and go to the tea in the Masters’ residence,” said Isaacson, also former member of the Board of Overseers.
Daniel C. Cohn, a lawyer living in Cambridge, said that he regularly attends Adams SCR meetings, participates in House-related festivities, and gives talks on contemporary issues. 
He said, however, that the most meaningful part of his SCR membership has been developing one-on-one relationships with students.
“I don't like the word ‘mentorship’ because it implies a one-way relationship. I'd rather call it ‘friendship’ because I get at least as much from the students as they get from me,” Cohn said. “Whichever term you want to call it, it's definitely the most rewarding aspect of the position.”
But Cohn said that this degree of personal outreach does not necessarily characterize the majority of regularly attending SCR members in Adams.
Cohn estimated that roughly a dozen of Adam’s Senior Common Room members are “actively involved with students,” while most of the others are less engaged.
While some students have reaped benefits ranging from career opportunities to informal mentorship, the quality of Senior Common Rooms—and what students get out of them—varies widely across the House system.
Several House leaders and SCR members interviewed for this story said that some Houses’ Senior Common Rooms are characterized by affiliates’ meek involvement, low student engagement, and inconvenient program scheduling, all of which are possibly symptoms of decentralized implementation at the College.
Some students interviewed for this story did not understand the SCR to be anything more than a physical space in their House.
“I’ve been in there, like, once for a study break,” Eliot resident Molly S. Zeme ’20 said.
“I know what the Senior Common Room is; I have never been in there. I’ve only ever been in the Junior Common Room,” said Quincy resident Marisa R. Trapani ’20. “I have no idea where it is, at all.”
Still, Eck said that she does not believe the SCR concept is “outdated,” as the 2009 report on House Renewal suggests.
Instead, she hopes to make changes to Lowell’s SCR to fix the issues that it faces. But according to Eck, other Houses have been deciding to deal with the SCR’s problems by just doing away with them completely.
The Committee on Student Life, a student-faculty committee that oversees residential policies, discussed the issue of student-faculty engagement at length during their November meeting. Some of the House Faculty Deans in attendance acknowledged that they had disbanded their SCRs due to problems with implementation.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, whose role includes oversight over the residential House system, said that the decentralized nature of the SCR system allows for significant flexibility in its implementation.
“The Houses each, independently, run their own Senior Common Room. So, they have different processes for inviting faculty and alums, or friends of the House,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair added: “I have participated in senior common rooms in Lowell House and in Mather House, and they do it slightly differently in each place that has a Senior Common Room.”
Lee Gehrke, Faculty Dean of Quincy House, wrote in an emailed statement that Quincy holds events for faculty to interact with students and hosts several visiting scholars each year who live in the House and participate in programming.
“We host a regular afternoon social time, called the ‘Quincy Kettle,’ which has been running for several years, and highlights faculty and Quincy alums,” Gehrke wrote. “This event was initiated in response to students who wanted low-key interactions with faculty and alums to hear about their lives and career trajectories.”
But even for the Houses that have chosen to continue their Senior Common Rooms, the involvement of the faculty members and non-resident affiliates, themselves, is inconsistent. For example, Isaacson said that there is no specific requirement for annual involvement of a Lowell SCR affiliate.
“You know, it’s something where you’re not paid and you don’t get any free benefits, so you just sort of come when you want,” Isaacson said.
Though the Lowell House Handbook lists 26 resident tutors and more than 160 non-resident faculty members and professionals as SCR affiliates, Eck says that fewer than two dozen regularly attend its weekly meetings.
Cohn echoed Eck’s sentiments, noting that Adams SCR meetings  are attended by a “core group” of roughly 15 members, with the majority of the affiliates rarely in attendance.
Some also note that student attendance at events hosted by SCR affiliates is dismally low.
Eck said that during a recent evening SCR talk with a renowned faculty member, the crowd consisted of  “one or two students we dragged in from the dining hall at the last moment.”
At Adams, Cohn said that after inviting around 15 or 20 students to one of his talks, the Senior Common Room event had “around half a dozen students there listening to the thing, too.” Cohn added that was the highest turnout for an SCR event, in his experience.
Eck said that maintaining a robust SCR takes work and that some Faculty Deans may not deem the task of maintaining a Senior Common Room to be worth it.
“It does take time. It does mean that you’re committed to this vision of having faculty engaged in a House community, as well as simply providing for students,” Eck said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 12, 2017 at 9:51 p.m.
Harvard will likely have to hold a new election to determine whether eligible students can form a union after the National Labor Relations Board ruled against the University’s appeal Tuesday.
Harvard had appealed a previous NLRB decision requiring the University to hold a new election, arguing that the outcome of the Nov. 2016 election—the initial results of which showed more students voting against unionization than in support of it—should stand.  Since August, the federal NLRB—a panel of presidential appointees—has weighed the University’s arguments, deciding Tuesday morning to uphold the previous NLRB ruling that the election results were invalid.
Tuesday’s ruling means a new election could take place as soon as January 2018, former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said in an interview Tuesday. At stake is whether or not eligible graduate student research and teaching assistants and undergraduate teaching assistants at Harvard will collectively bargain with the University.
HGSU-UAW representatives were quick to celebrate the decision Tuesday. Echoing labor law experts, unionization advocates had worried that the NLRB’s majority Republican membership would sink their chances after a more than year-long legal fight.
“We’re excited to have a new election,” said Andrew Donnelly, a graduate student and union organizer. “This ruling shows what we’ve known all along about the election.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven said that Harvard stands by the results of the original unionization election.
“The University continues to believe the November 2016 student unionization election was fair and that well-informed students turned out in high numbers to vote. It is disappointing that the NLRB has not upheld our students’ decision to vote against unionization in that election,” she wrote.
This decision comes as the labor law precedent that allowed graduate students at private universities to unionize is under challenge on campuses across the country. Yale and the University of Chicago have filed briefs with the NLRB arguing that a 2016 Columbia University case that set the precedent for student unionization at private universities should be overturned. Both briefs argue that graduate students should not be considered employees.
If the NLRB strikes down the Columbia decision, it could stop student unionization at Harvard, according to Gould.
The Harvard appeal the NLRB struck down is more narrowly focused—it centers not on the broader issue of student unionization but around a voter list Harvard generated before the Nov. 2016 election. NLRB case law dictates employers must provide a complete and accurate list of eligible voters before a unionization election.
After voters went to the polls in November, HGSU-UAW filed an appeal with the NLRB, arguing Harvard’s list was inadequate in part because it excluded some eligible voters.
For now, the Yale and Chicago challenges will likely not affect the timeline for Harvard’s unionization effort, Gould said.
Only three of the five members of the NLRB chose to rule in Tuesday’s decision. Marvin E. Kaplan, a Trump appointee, and Philip A. Miscimarra, a Republican and the board’s chair, did not sign onto the ruling.
Gould said it is normal for only three federal NLRB members to rule on any case. He said the entire board rules on “major policy cases,” but since Harvard’s appeal did not challenge the Columbia ruling, it did not qualify.
In a press release, Julie Kushner, Region 9A Director of the United Automobile Workers, wrote that the NLRB’s ruling was an encouraging development.
“This is another great victory for graduate workers in the UAW and a shot in the arm to this growing movement,” Kushner wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 12, 2017 at 8:35 p.m.
Three sororities at Harvard will host a recruitment process open to all freshmen women next semester, reaffirming their membership status after Harvard finalized its penalties on members of single-gender groups.
In a joint statement titled “We Believe Women Should Make Their Own Choices,” Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta wrote that they will be conducting rush next semester.
Denouncing Harvard’s penalties on members of single-gender groups, the statement argues that the sanctions will undermine the choices available to female students on campus.
“While Harvard’s sanctions claim to support women’s right to make their own decisions, these sanctions actually force women to choose between the opportunity to have supportive, empowering women-only spaces and external leadership opportunities,” the statement reads.
Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma was the only sorority on campus absent from the statement. Earlier this semester, the group considered shuttering if the College went through with the penalties.
The College’s social group sanctions prevent members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations on campus from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships. University President Drew G. Faust first introduced the penalties in May 2016, and the Harvard Corporation voted to retain the policy last week after a year and a half of heated debate.
In an interview last week, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said that plans to enforce the policy will be released before the start of spring semester, when recruitment for sororities begins.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 12, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Kappa Kappa Gamma considered shuttering last semester. In fact, the group considered shuttering earlier this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

University President Drew G. Faust rebutted criticisms that the Harvard Corporation’s decision to uphold a controversial College policy on social groups will curtail her successor’s autonomy in an interview Friday.
Last Tuesday, the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—voted to keep the College’s policy in place and mandated a review of its implementation in five years time.
The vote seemed to put to bed months of uncertainty over the fate of the penalties, which were first announced in May 2016. Some said the Corporation’s vote strongly limits the next president’s authority to revise the sanctions if they wish and marks a departure from the Corporation’s traditionally hands-off approach to undergraduate life.
In an interview last Friday, though, Faust argued the Corporation’s intervention will secure the policy—which, starting with the current freshman class, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups and receiving endorsements for prestigious fellowships.  Faust said the Corporation’s intent was to allow her successor to “focus on other matters” during the first few years of their tenure.
“I think this does my successor a big favor to have this stabilized for a period of time,” said Faust, who is set to step down from her role in June. “The thinking was we didn’t want a new president having to face dealing with this whole issue all over again in the first weeks or months or year or two of office.”
Faust said the Corporation, which typically “defers very explicitly on academic matters to faculty,” intervened because it believed the policy had implications for “the basic character of the College.” Further, she argued the body’s role in the final decision will establish “continuity” for the next president.  Faust added that the Corporation’s 12 members voted unanimously.
“As it seemed inevitable that this would be very close to the end of my term, we all thought it was important that it not just be seen as something that was coming from me, that you could wait out or hope to disappear,” Faust said. “But rather it be a judgement that was shared by the Corporation as a whole in order to establish continuity and make it really the decision that it is rather than just a kind of last comment from a departing president.”
Faust hinted at the possibility that the next president could revise the sanctions within five years if they believe it does not address the policy’s aims.
“There’s time to choose a different solution in the future if this one doesn’t address the variety of issues,” Faust said. “This one gives students choice about what their priorities are. It gives the organizations choice and seems to balance the different imperatives that we’ve been trying to reconcile.”
The Corporation may not, however, be the final word on the policy. A proposed amendment in Republican-led legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act would ban schools that have “a policy allowing for the official recognition of single-sex student organizations” from penalizing members of those groups. It is unclear whether the language would apply to Harvard, which does not formally recognize the College’s final clubs and Greek organizations.

The Cambridge City Council discussed possible changes to city funding as a result of the proposed Republican tax plan, future affordable housing initiatives, and the installation of several new bike-sharing stations.
At their Monday meeting, councillors asked the City Manager for clarification on a report detailing the steps Cambridge is taking to protect local programs in the event that Cambridge’s sanctuary city status leads to cuts in federal funding.
The report suggests creating a fund to protect sanctuary cities, which some were worried could be impacted by changes to the city budget.
“You have been wonderful in making up for tax cuts in other places,” Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, “But do we want to make a call out to the public in making some sort of legal defense fund for those facing deportation?”
“We’ll do what we need to do,” DePasquale said.
Councillors also addressed potential increases to the required percentage of affordable housing units in a new development after receiving a preliminary report from DePasquale on how such a change would be implemented. The percentage of affordable units per development is set to rise to 15 percent in 2018.
“We’re just first starting to talk about this,” DePasquale said. “When we have some more accurate and realistic numbers, and I think that’ll be soon, we’ll be happy to discuss that.”
Also at the meeting, the Council approved a $1 million development project by bike-sharing program Hubway to install 10 more stations once acceptable locations are identified. The councillors also discussed snow removal for bike infrastructure.
Monday’s meeting opened with a ceremony granting the Mayor’s Luminary Award to a number of Cantabrigians who have positively impacted the city this year.
Dozens of residents were recognized, including Cambridge Police Department officers for their recent charity drives and Cambridge’s firefighters for their actions in responding to last year’s 10-alarm fire. The ceremony also recognized individuals, from community spiritual leaders to educators.
The Luminary Awards recognize individuals who have had  positive impact on the city, its institutions, or the people of Cambridge.
Mayor E. Denise Simmons, who started the awards, McGovern, and DePasquale said that the Luminaries' work for the city was made possible an engaged community. The trio also reaffirmed their care for the city.
“We do great work not because it’s our job, but because it’s our passion,” DePasquale said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College notified 964 students of their acceptance into the Class of 2022 Tuesday, representing 14.5 percent of the 6,630 applicants for early admission.
This year’s acceptance rate for early applicants is roughly equal to last year’s rate—the lowest since the return of the early admission program in 2011. The overall early applicant pool was the largest since the program’s reinstatement.
“The one thing we can say with certainty is that the numbers rose this year,” William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, said in an interview Tuesday. “In general terms, it appears that more institutions had increases than the reverse… Early admission, in one form or another, is the new normal.”
In addition to the 964 students accepted early, 4,882 students were deferred to the regular applicant pool and 611 students were rejected, reflecting 73.6 and 9.2 percent of the early applicant pool, respectively. The remaining 173 applications were marked incomplete and will be reviewed alongside regular decision applications when completed.
In September, Fitzsimmons announced that the College would accept fewer students into the Class of 2022 after a record-high yield produced crowding in freshman dorms this year. The Admissions Office is aiming to eventually admit “40 to 50 to maybe 100 people” off the Class of 2022 waitlist this year, Fitzsimmons said at the time.
Despite the relatively large pool of students accepted early, Fitzsimmons said the admissions office “will certainly be mindful of coming in on target” for class size when reviewing the regular applicant pool.
The group of early admits to the Class of 2022 reflects an overall increase in non-white students from previous years. African American students comprise 13.9 percent of early admits, up 1.3 percentage points from last year, and the percentage of Latino students increased slightly to 9.8 percent of the early admit class. Native American and Native Hawaiian students make up 1.8 percent of early admits combined, up marginally from 1.1 percent last year.
The percentage of Asian American early admits grew the most, increasing from 21.7 percent last year to 24.2 percent this year. Harvard is currently facing scrutiny from both the Department of Justice and a separate lawsuit accusing the College of discriminating against Asian Americans in its undergraduate admissions processes.
Women comprise 47 percent of admitted early applicants, a small decrease from 48 percent for the Class of 2021.
Additionally, the College saw an increase in economic diversity among both applicants and admits. So far, almost 58 percent of admitted students have applied for financial aid—up slightly from last year—and roughly 13 percent have requested application fee waivers, an increase from 10.7 percent for the early admitted Class of 2021. First-generation college students make up almost 10.6 percent of early admits, compared to 8.7 percent last year.
According to Fitzsimmons, the pool of early applicants is typically less diverse than that of regular applicants, though he believes recent efforts to increase awareness of the early admissions program have served to mitigate some of the disparities.
“Traditionally, early programs have tended not to reflect the excellence and diversity that you see out in the world, so one of the real pushes over the past decade or so—and part of it was giving it up and then bringing it back—is to make certain that people from all of those backgrounds do consider early,” Fitzsimmons said. “We’re delighted to see that we had greater economic and ethnic diversity not just in the pool, but in the admitted group.”
Although Fitzsimmons said earlier this semester that he was unsure about how natural disasters could affect prospective applicants earlier this semester, the geographic and regional distribution of students remained similar to previous years. Among admitted students, 10.2 percent applied from outside the United States, including 2.3 percent of students who applied from Canada.
Also during Tuesday’s interview, Fitzsimmons addressed concerns that alumni involvement in recruitment and admissions processes could have unintended consequences. In early November, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported, a San Diego-area alumnus accidentally sent private applicant information, including interview ratings, to several prospective students in the area.
Fitzsimmons said he continues to support the role of alumni in the Admissions Office’s work.
“We have had this robust alumni network helping us for many, many years, and I think it really makes an enormous difference,” Fitzsimmons said, “Certainly with our high yield on admitted students, but also on the excellence and the quality of the people who end up applying.”
Students applying regular decision to the College have until Jan. 1 to submit their applications. Decisions will be released to regular decision applicants in late March, and all admitted students have until May 1 to reply to the College.

“You sleep very little,” Sufia Mehmood ’18 said of the assortment of jobs she juggles both off-campus and on-campus.
Between working as a manager at Lamont Cafe, a tutor at Harvard Student Agencies, an English tutor for students in Japan, a babysitter, and a campus tour guide, Mehmood’s schedule quickly fills up.
Though she said she values her work experience as an important part of her personal and professional development, Mehmood acknowledged that her work can heavily affect her social life. With numerous jobs, spare time is sparse, affecting her friendships. Spending time with her friends and family, she said, often means studying or working together.
“Thankfully, my boyfriend is very supportive,” she added.
Mehmood is one of thousands of Harvard students who balance their academic commitments with term-time employment. According to the Student Employment Office, 78 percent of Harvard students are employed during their undergraduate years. Just under 60 percent of Harvard students find their work through the Federal Work Study program, according to Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue.
Many of those students find their jobs on-campus, either at one of Harvard’s libraries, campus cafes, or through programs like Dorm Crew. But for some students every year, going to work means leaving Harvard Yard and venturing into Cambridge and the Boston area.
Harvard students can only work 20 hours a week at their on-campus jobs, according to the Student Employment Office, meaning that working off-campus allows some students to work longer than the University allows. Off-campus jobs also offer some students employer benefits even as they pose their own set of logistical challenges.
“I’m currently applying to grad school. Grad school is expensive; applying is expensive; interviews are expensive to travel to,” Mehmood said.
When Nick C. DiGiovanni ’19 arrives at his job at Waypoint, a nearby seafood restaurant where he works as a line cook, he begins by chopping chives, preparing proteins, and simmering sauces.
“I do all my prep work for 2 hours until 5 p.m., and then the doors open so we dim the lights, and we clean the floor again,” DiGiovanni said. “Service is from 5 to 11 but usually servers start cleaning up at 10-9:30 if it gets a little quieter at the end—and you get out of there at like 11 or 11:15.”
Every Wednesday, DiGiovanni is in charge of every component of six or seven dishes for the night. While he said he enjoys cooking and sauteing, he especially looks forward to presenting the final product.
“The best part, I think, is probably the art and the actual plating of the stuff,” he said. “When you actually get to go out and plate the food in the way that you want, to some extent—you can’t go crazy or anything—that part’s a lot of fun.”
While Harvard offers students a variety of employment options on campus, the wider Boston and Cambridge area allows students to pursue opportunities beyond those available in a campus library or cafe. DiGiovanni, who is considering becoming a chef in the future, reached out to Waypoint last year hoping to earn some experience at a top local restaurant.
“I’m thinking about the possibility of being a chef when I grow up, and I’m not sure, so I just wanted to sort of get out there, throw myself into a real top restaurant in the area and see what I thought,” DiGiovanni said.
When overtaken by the hustle and bustle of Harvard life, swapping out job hours is one way many students manage their time. Eric W. Chin ’19, who works as a youth ice hockey referee in the Boston area, said he appreciates the added flexibility of his off-campus job.
“I schedule it the way I want to,” he said. “I have been pretty busy this semester, so I haven’t done a lot.”
Chin said he simply tells his boss what hours he can work on any given week and is then assigned work that best fits those hours.
Oliver Q. Sussman ’21 coaches Lincoln-Douglas debate for The Harker School in California. He works as a private contractor, getting paid per tournament and for every research assignment he completes for the school.
“I will do mostly internet research. Basically in debate you have to create lined down pieces of evidence where you underline all the words that will be read by the debater,” Sussman said.
Sussman said he chose this particular job over several other coaching offers for its flexibility, which allows him to pick up assignments in accordance with his schedule.
“I didn’t know how busy I would be during first semester, and now I’m very glad that I did that because if I had to do a lot of debate coaching at the very beginning of college, that would have been very difficult to deal with,” he said.
Despite its flexibility, the job does not come without certain difficulties. When he travelled to California to help coach the team during a tournament, Sussman said he was up all-night on a red-eye flight back to campus.
“I had to take a red-eye flight back from California and I landed at 7, and then I came here and I slept for an hour and then I went to class. So it’s not super—I would say travel is the biggest burden so far,” Sussman said.
Not all off-campus jobs offer the same autonomy. DiGiovanni is a member of the sailing team; he has practices with his team each Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, with competitions on the weekends. Working all afternoon and night at Waypoint on his day off is a large commitment.
“I’ve got a lot of work, a ton of texts, a certain amount of emails, and there has definitely been random things that have popped up,” he said. “It can be kind of difficult when there’s some other commitment I’d really love to go to, or have to go to, and I have to somehow figure out what to do.”

Beyond the added flexibility and opportunity to pursue new interests, students point to more tangible benefits of off-campus work as a reason to escape the Harvard bubble.
Megan E. Sims ’18 has worked at JP Licks on Massachusetts Avenue since leaving her job at the Harvard Square Starbucks. She said that discounted coffee was her favorite part of working as a Starbucks barista.
“There were times over the summer, especially, where we would try to come up with the weirdest, most convoluted drinks possible,” Sims said. “My favorite thing I crafted is a vanilla bean frappuccino with java chips and a shot of espresso poured on top, affogato style.”
At her new job, tourists and students alike line-up for ice cream, frozen yogurt, baked desserts, and coffee. Like at Starbucks, Sims said she can regularly enjoy her favorite brews. But for Sims, working at JP Licks also offers a supportive work environment.
“JP Licks has a very positive environment,” she said. “There’s also discounted coffee there, so I’m back to getting my caffeine.”
“I considered campus jobs, but I realized I got tired of working with primarily Harvard students, and I liked working with other people,” Sims added.
For some student employees, free coffee and a friendly work environment are only the beginning of the perks of off-campus employment. Some employers offer health insurance and stock options to employees who log enough hours or rise into manager roles.
Working at JP Licks is not Sims’s only commitment, though. She holds a number of positions on campus that allow her to stay involved with both communities. She said that even working on the other side of Mass Avenue lets her escape the Harvard bubble, which she says can feel isolating.
“I feel much more a part of the Boston community now than the Harvard community,” Sims said.“Get out of the bubble; make friends; get jobs off campus; get to know people who don’t go here.
“It was amazing starting a job that was very much not a part of campus,” she added. “When I clock out, I am done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Fire Department responded to a smoke complaint in Adams House’s Claverly Hall at 3:58 p.m. Tuesday, according to Acting Chief of Department Gerard E. Mahoney.
Mahoney said the source of the issue was smoke due to “a telephone charger cord that overheated.”
“An occupant of the building pulled a pull station activating the fire alarm system due to the odor of smoke,” he added.
Emily Shen ’20, who lives in Claverly, said she was unsure if the alarm was real when it first went off. “I wasn’t sure what to make of it because sometimes the alarm goes off even when nothing is wrong,” Shen said. “I was dumbfounded and pantsless and just sitting on my bed, but eventually I put on my pants and my coat and brought my backpack with me downstairs.”
The Fire Department cleared the scene at 4:16 p.m.

From his perch on a velvet couch beside the whiskey, the 20-year-old Lord Great Chamberlain watches the whole debate unfold.
The Whips sit in a broad circle, Right Honorable Chairman Robert Milton Hope III ’19 at its head. By decree, three books lie on a table to his right: “The King James Bible,” “The Conservative Mind,” and “The Political Writings of John Adams.” Behind his left shoulder stands the American flag.
Directly across the circle sits the Right Honorable Secretary; next to the door is the Sergeant at Arms. When a speaker, pacing in the center, says something the society likes, the members lean forward to pound their legs and their seats’ wooden arms. When a buzzword offends, it is met with hisses.
They call themselves the John Adams Society, “Harvard’s Premiere Debate Organization for Political and Moral Philosophy.” The society meets in the Adams House Junior Common Room up to nine times per semester to debate topics ranging from “Resolved, That a Novel’s Lessons Are Not Its Author’s” to “Resolved, that Conservatives and Libertarians Should Unite In Friendship”.
Their “Guide to Procedure” is 23 pages long, with four of those pages dedicated entirely to the process of delivering toasts. Petitioners must be addressed as “Gentleman” or “Lady,” and, at every debate, the Lord Great Chamberlain is required to, “with alacrity,” announce the “Drink of the Night.”
According to the John Adams Society’s website, the group’s mission is to “aspire to pursue the Truth together as a community of friends.” Members of the group say it provides a space for conservative-leaning students to debate and discuss topics they might not otherwise raise on an overwhelming liberal campus: According to The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2017, 68 percent of respondents identified as liberal, while only ten percent identified themselves as conservative.
At a time when some are questioning Harvard’s—and higher education’s—commitment to free speech, the small conservative student group seeks to challenge what they see as the campus liberal orthodoxy. Even if it means meeting in secret.
While ambitious juniors dress up to pump the hands of their future bosses at Goldman Sachs and newly punched sophomores schmooze the final club members who will determine their social fate, a select group of freshmen don black tie attire for another purpose: they hope to comp or “petition” the John Adams Society.
The society’s “Information for Petitioners,” inscribed on its website in Latin, asks these petitioners to show “a temperament of Socratic curiosity,” “a strong sense of personal integrity” and an ability to engage with “extreme” perspectives without using “the easy rhetorical calumnies” which it suggests are common in mainstream political discourse.
Despite its gestures to antiquity, the John Adams Society began just three years ago in 2014. Cassandra Kane ’21, who attended a meeting at the beginning of the semester before ultimately deciding not to join, said the group’s preoccupation with the past was off-putting.
“It was just this wild, weird culture of pretending as though it were three centuries ago, kind of like a big blast to the past,” Kane said.
Though the Society’s information for petitioners is quick to note that “There is no political litmus test for membership in the Society,” members say the John Adams Society offers a political safe space of sorts for conservatives.
The Yale Conservative Party’s website claims credit for co-founding the John Adams Society and calls the society its “sister organization at Harvard College.” Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, a government professor and outspoken conservative who has attended some of the group’s events, said conservatives at Harvard often lack a forum for vigorous debate.

“As a conservative here, you’re embattled, and just to be together and to talk with people who take what you say seriously instead of merely politely, and find somebody who shares your views, that’s a real pleasure,” Mansfield said.
Kevin R. English ’20, who started a leftist political group on campus last year, thinks “it would be ideal” if more groups on campus could connect people across the political spectrum instead of pulling people deeper into their political niches. Right now, he’s “not sure that anything like that really exists.”
But Thomas P. Moriarty ’19, John Adams’ Right Honorable Vice Chairman, agreed with Mansfield about the value of a conservative group.
“I don’t think there’s anybody who could live in a conservative bubble at Harvard, so for a lot of conservatives, I think it’s very important to have a place to go and develop their views,” he said.
Beyond its political bent, the group also allows its members to engage with new ideas and debates.
“The people in it are the most intellectual and well-read people I know, and I learn something every time I go to a debate,” Portia C. Berry-Kilby ’20, Right Honorable Chief Whip, said.
The John Adams Society summarizes its ideological commitment as a dedication to “exploring the Western intellectual tradition.” On a campus that increasingly values multicuralism and non-Western thinkers, the explicit celebration of a tradition many criticize as narrow-minded is unusual.
Members of the society wrote in an emailed statement that the group’s focus on Western ideas reflects the belief that the Western tradition “has helped shape our college, our country, and our culture,” though they do not believe it superior to other cultural traditions.
And even as the John Adams Society seeks to engage students in open intellectual debates, Moriarty acknowledged that the group’s members are mostly white men.
“I’m not sure why that is, it might be due to the fact that conservatives in the U.S. tend to skew white. I have to say it’s not ideal that that’s the case, or at least I personally believe that conservatism’s more of a universal thing, it’s for everybody, and I think in general that’s how people feel,” he said.
To begin each debate, Hope enters the room. Every member stands until he bangs his gavel and declares, “I do hereby call this debate caucus of the John Adams Society into order.”
This is the beginning of an elaborate evening of procedures, delineated in the group’s official guide. Besides outlining customs for toasts and Drinks of the Night, the Guide to Procedure also mentions traditions like “dueling” and the singing of “The Purplish Cup Song.”
Although this can be confusing to outsiders, Moriarty said that there is a well-founded reason for the Society’s emphasis on complex procedure: the rigid implementation of rules prevents debates from spiraling into unproductive “shouting matches.”
“Often when people are arguing with each other, if you don’t have order, it can degenerate into a shouting match,” Moriarty said. “And we’ve never had a shouting match at the John Adams Society, because I think the rules go further than simply having decorum. I think the fact that they go further means that nobody’s going to touch the decorum of it.”
As far as what exactly the group argues about, John Adams Society debates cover a variety of topics, exploring how conservative thinking applies to some of society’s most pressing issues. Kane said she remembers sitting in on a debate about “whether War is necessary for man” when she considered joining the group.
In addition to expounding politically conservative ideals, the John Adams Society also puts another ideology at the center of their organization: Christianity.
When toasting, members of the Society can celebrate “God, the United States of America, Harvard College, or the John Adams Society.” And at the end of every meeting, the group sings the phrase “Veritas pro Christo et Ecclesia,” which means “Truth for Christ and Church,” in one of their official songs.
At the close of debate, when the chalice has been passed around and members have sung the Star-Spangled Banner, the students gather together, arms around each other, to sing the society’s song: “Rule, John Adams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has seen a 20 percent increase in sexual harassment complaints filed with its Office of Dispute Resolution in the wake of the scandal implicating Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein, according to University Title IX administrators.
A wave of allegations of sexual harassment in recent weeks has brought down a slew of powerful men, prompting a reckoning in newsrooms, boardrooms, movie studios, and the halls of Congress about workplace behavior. Women across the country have launched a social media movement encouraging those who have experienced sexual harassment to share their stories publicly with the hashtag #metoo.
Administrators say the cultural moment is making a mark at Harvard. University Title IX Officer Nicole Merhill and Office of Dispute Resolution Director Bill D. McCants said they have seen an influx in reports of sexual harassment, both via formal complaints and informal disclosures called “notice incidents,” as individuals continue to come forward with their personal experiences with sexual misconduct.
“Speaking for the Title IX Office, we have certainly seen an uptick in the number of notice incidents, both at the local level for our Title IX coordinators, and notice incidents directly to the University Title IX Office,” Merhill said.
McCants said that he believes the increase is tied to the nationwide conversation.
“ODR has seen, compared to this point last year, a 20 percent increase in complaints if you compare the two periods side-by-side. And we have reason to believe that it is in part because of the #metoo movement based on statements people make—it’s very much on people’s minds,” he said.
In a letter to Harvard affiliates sharing an annual report by ODR and the Title IX Office on sexual assault prevention and response, University President Drew G. Faust condemned sexual harassment and referenced the fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
“The powerful forces of presumption and hierarchy shape our lives and our communities in profound ways,” she wrote. “Over the past few months, this reality has been underscored by revelation after revelation of sexual misconduct by individuals across the country, and we have witnessed an unprecedented movement on social media and elsewhere to share experiences, seek support, and pursue justice.”
The report notes a general increase in sexual harassment notices and complaints in recent years. Formal complaints to ODR rose 65 percent from the 2015-2016 academic year to the 2016-2017 academic year, and informal disclosures to Title IX coordinators at the College rose 14 percent in that period.
“Increases in disclosures and complaints are indications that members of our community are seeking the assistance they need,” Faust wrote in her email. “If recent events in the wider world have taught us anything, it is that marginalization and silence perpetuate the status quo.”
Harvard has redoubled its efforts to address sexual assault since a 2015 climate survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate women had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact” during their time at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of formal complaints of sexual harassment Harvard affiliates filed with the University increased by 65 percent during the 2016-2017 academic year, according to an annual report on sexual harassment prevention and response released Tuesday.
According to the Office of Dispute Resolution and Title IX Office report, 43 individuals across the University filed formal complaints of sexual or gender-based harassment during 2016-2017, an increase from 26 the year before. Around 250 individuals made informal disclosures of such harassment to the Title IX office last year.
“Increases in disclosures and complaints are indications that members of our community are seeking the assistance they need. If recent events in the wider world have taught us anything, it is that marginalization and silence perpetuate the status quo,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday about the report.
The report is the University’s second on sexual assault prevention and response and the first under a new administrative structure. Harvard’s Title IX administration split into two offices in April in order to separate administrators who provide training and resources from those who investigate incidents of sexual assault.
Now, Nicole Merhill leads the former group at the helm of the Title IX Office while William D. McCants directs investigations through the Office of Dispute Resolution. Previously overseen by the same administrator, the two offices do not now share information about cases unless an individual decides to file a formal complaint about sexual harassment with ODR, Merhill said.
“By separating the two offices, we can confidently reiterate to our community members that affording each individual agency over the path they wish to take when accessing resources is truly central to the functioning of the Title IX Office,” Merhill wrote in the report.
With this separation—and increased communication to Harvard affiliates about the resources in each office—has come an increase in disclosures to the 55 Title IX coordinators across Harvard’s schools and the number of formal complaints filed with ODR. According to the report, 138 individuals at the College informally disclosed incidents of sexual or gender-based harassment to Title IX coordinators last year, up from 121 the year before. Across the University’s graduate and professional schools, 128 individuals at graduate and professional schools disclosed incidents.
Merhill said these numbers are likely the result of heightened awareness of University resources and a culture that encourages reporting sexual harassment, rather than an increase in the incidence of sexual harassment.
“Some of it is increased trainings—whether it is online or in person—some of it is increased awareness of the overall issue in society,” she said. “I think it’s awareness of the resources available, as opposed to an increase in harassment in our community.”
After students and a University-wide Title IX oversight committee called for the offices to publicly disclose more information about sexual harassment complaints and investigations, McCants said the report included more detail about the specific kinds of allegations, outcomes, and profiles of those filing formal complaints.
A majority of complainants over the past three years were students, according to the report. Students also made up the majority of respondents in 2014-2015 and 2016-2017, with staff comprising the highest percentage in 2015-2016.
In almost all cases, the complainants had previously interacted with the alleged perpetrator in either a work context, friendship, or romantic relationship. Allegations included “sexual assault with penetration,” “sexual and gender-based harassment: verbal, written, graphic,” and “quid pro quo harassment.”
Of the 44 complaints that entered the full investigation stage from 2014 to 2017, University investigators found policy violations in 43 percent of cases, according to the report. The length of time investigations take decreased from 4.4 months in 2015-2016 to 3.8 months last year—a reduction McCants attributed in part to ODR branching off from the Title IX Office and hiring another fellow.
The split has also enabled ODR to investigate violations of University policy beyond sexual assault or gender-based discrimination, McCants said—including instances of other types of violence and discrimination in access to Harvard facilities. With the consent of administrators at the appropriate schools, ODR investigated five such cases during the 2016-2017 academic year.
Since the restructuring, the Title IX Office to expand its educational offerings, Merhill wrote in the report. Office representatives and Title IX coordinators across Harvard’s schools held over 200 in-person trainings during the 2016-2017 year.
The report also highlights new online training modules at several schools, and increased participation rates across the University. Participation in employee online training increased 74 percent from the previous year, and the report notes a 67 percent increase in student online training from 2016-2017 to the start of this academic year.
The report comes amid ambiguity over the future of Title IX enforcement at the federal level. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos removed Obama-era guidance on Title IX, a move that some fear could allow institutions to relax their sexual harassment policies. In her letter prefacing the report, Merhill reaffirmed Harvard’s commitment to maintaining its current policy and procedures.
“It is imperative that as University Title IX Officer I reiterate not only the University’s commitment to working together to proactively address concerns of sexual and gender-based discrimination, but also my unwavering commitment to ensuring that Harvard University continues to serve as a leader in community outreach, education, and prevention efforts,” Merhill wrote in the report.
The efforts follow a set of recommendations a University-wide task force on sexual assault released in March 2016, and a 2015 sexual assault climate survey in which 31 percent of senior undergraduate women respondents said they had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 13, 2017 at 9:25 p.m.
Cambridge will allocate $867,000 towards seven voter-proposed projects, including initiatives to provide hygiene kits for the homeless, plant 100 trees in Cambridge, and increase pedestrian safety in streets with flashing crosswalks.
According to Michelle Monsegur, a budget analyst for the city, 6,778 people voted for 20 proposed ideas on the Cambridge’s Participatory Budgeting Department's ballot, a 43 percent increase in participation from last year. Anyone age 12 or older—regardless of their immigration or citizenship status—may vote on the participatory budget, Monsegur added.
This year marks the fourth time the participatory budget has run in Cambridge.
A proposal looking to plant 100 trees in Cambridge garnered the most votes, and the City will allocate $141,000 to plant trees in crowded areas. Voters also approved initiatives looking to provide “resource kits” with socks, toiletries, and feminine hygiene products for Cambridge’s homeless population. The other initiatives include building flashing crosswalks to improve pedestrian safety, installing more water fountains in Cambridge public parks, buying new musical instruments for students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, building “moss walls” to combat air pollution in congested areas, and upgrading the Gately Youth Center.
Phoebe C. West ’17, a Cambridge native and an intern with Cambridge Participatory Budget since May, said that projects for trees have also been popular in previous years.
“People here really like trees,” West said.
West also said that one of the participatory budget’s largest goals is to get young people, especially 18-24 year olds, involved in the work of city government. Her outreach team included volunteer Will H. MacArthur ’20, and together, they tabled for the budget in several House dining halls. MacArthur, also a native Cantabrigian and a former candidate for the Cambridge School Committee, said when he was tabling at Harvard, many students were surprised that they were able to cast ballots for the participatory budget.
“A lot of Harvard students thought they couldn’t participate,” MacArthur said. “When really, all that we ask of them is to be at least a part-time resident of Cambridge, which all Harvard students are.”
Voting period for the participatory budget ran between December 2-8, which coincided with the College’s reading period. West said that this posed difficulties for her student outreach.
“Harvard has been a hard place to tap into because of reading week,” West said. “We sent out a lot of emails, and did what we could.”
Monsegur also emphasized the importance of increasing youth representation in local politics, especially through the participatory budget.
“We had a lot of sixth and seventh graders this year, as well as a bunch of people in high schools, because we were able to get them to vote in their homerooms,” Monsegur said. “From a young age, you know you have a voice in the city.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Two weeks ago, three members of the Sports Board arrived at an unlikely destination—Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, a marvel of modern architecture that has moving walkways, generous windows, soft carpets, plentiful Wifi, and very few people.
We were excited. Excited to cover the game between Harvard men’s basketball and No. 7 Kentucky. Excited to escape Boston weather. Excited to eat at Blue Door Smokehouse (4.8 stars on Google; “Flavorful and tender brisket,” the latest reviewer said) and visit Two Keys Tavern (3.1 stars; “I got mistaken for another blonde girl, and they made me leave for no reason,” the latest reviewer said).
Well, we have stories to tell.
Few would label Lexington the Kremlin on the Kentucky. Cambridge has coffee shops and banks. Lexington has college bars and fraternities. In this city of 300,000 people, brunch spots serve cheddar grits and sausage gravy. The Kentucky bookstore sells “game shorts,” which feel like cardboard but retail for more than an Ec10 textbook. At the same time, a pitcher of Bud Light costs less than a Felipe’s burrito.
We plotted an intensive schedule. Blue Door Smokehouse definitely deserved 4.8 stars, and Two Keys Tavern definitely deserved 3.1. We appreciated the business acumen of pizza joint Goodfellas, which operated at the actual back of the Tavern. Picture Pinocchio’s sitting next to the PSK. Or Market sitting next to the Owl.
Our lone mistake came in not visiting the nearby Kentucky Horse Park, which is sort of a living museum for old racehorses. Consider the attraction a halfway point between the Belmont Stakes and the glue factory. By the way, residents of the Bluegrass State love their thoroughbreds as much as Meg Leatherwood loves Clemson. As Toby Keith famously sings, “Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses.” In Lexington, that statement holds true, assuming that horses drink 40s of Miller Lite.
The highlight of our journey came at Tin Roof, a live music venue where everyone except us wore Christmas sweaters. Cade Palmer, although absent, would have enjoyed the environment. As for the three of us, we felt like we were back in Cambridge at a Ten Man party when the band queued up “Mr. Brightside.” Joy turned to despair when the lead singer pulled out his phone to check the lyrics. To say that were disappointed would be akin to calling Kanye West “a bit different.” Or calling the Cuban missile crisis “a minor misunderstanding.” Or saying that Andy “kind of looks like a stoner.”
Hours later, Wildcats coach John Calipari summarized our experience with perceptive words: “We broke off plays at the end, and guys just—‘Why did you do that?’ ‘I was thinking the tree, and the bike came out, and the car almost hit me.’ ‘What? Why did you do that?’"
(Note to everyone, especially our editors: This quote is really, truly accurate.)
Then came Saturday, when—right—we had a game to cover. Many expected Harvard to be roadkill, similar to what one can find at each mile marker along Interstate 75.
As jarring as that drive was, nothing could prepare us for the strangeness of Rupp Arena, the largest indoor arena in the United States. The stadium is at least five times larger than the full-size replica of Noah’s Ark that sits 50 miles down the highway. This roadside attraction, called “Ark Encounter,” was closed when we left on Sunday. What were the odds?
Rupp Arena, however, was far from shuttered. A stream of blue hats ran from downtown Lexington, past a fluorescent mural of Abraham Lincoln, around the Indian restaurant where Jefferson Davis used to live, and through the doors of the stadium. It felt like Times Square, except all the food cost under $10 and no one shouted obscenities at us.
By tipoff, Wildcats fans had nearly filled the 23,500-seat space. Sitting on the floor, looking up, we felt like awestruck gladiators about to meet their fate. Which is pretty much what Crimson players were. Few fans held out hope of a Harvard victory.
At the front of Rupp, posters had informed us that the event organizer had prohibited the carrying of firearms into the stadium. Harvard forward Seth Towns must not have seen the notice because the sophomore nailed targets all afternoon. Were Kentucky fans troubled? Not at all. Slick-haired Calipari patrolled the sidelines. And during timeout breaks, lest the stadium grow restless, cheerleaders would emerge and perform cult classics such as “pivot a 75-foot flag around the stadium” and “spell out the letters K-E-N-T-U-C-K-Y by hurling your body on the hard floor.” Apparently, it’s a great honor to do so at Rupp.
Harvard lost, sure. The 79-70 result was a moral victory for the Crimson, but moral victories in NCAA basketball mean as much as credit cards at Mike’s Pastry. The greater revelation took place off the court. That’s where Wildcats fans had a blast. They screamed about three-pointers, berated missed calls, and even started cheering when the fire alarm went off. Emotions swelled in our chest, even though we didn’t have a rooting interest.
Sports Chairs of yore have lamented the lack of sports fandom at Harvard. “No one watches games,” the argument goes. “Harvard students think the Ancient Eight is a collection of Pokemon. How can you build community out of this mess?”
True, Lavietes Pavilion is no Rupp Arena. And true, Crimson players don’t receive autograph requests on their way out of Annenberg. But after four years of sports writing, we can report that community does exist around Harvard Athletics. It exists in hidden pockets—but exists nonetheless.
You can see community in the way that teammates treat each other. College sports require months of work. Discipline hardens bonds. You don’t sweat alongside someone for four years without gaining some respect.
Community extends beyond single teams, however. All athletes use the same facilities. The Palmer-Dixon Center for strength and conditioning. The same sports medicine rooms for stretching and rehabilitation. The Weeks Footbridge for walks over the Charles River on cold mornings. Harvard fans may never turn out en masse for a non-conference basketball game, but Crimson players still feel a connection to their uniform. The “Harvard” in “Harvard Athletics” actually means something.
As editors for The Crimson, we’ve had a chance to experience such community firsthand. Granted, the Sports Board is not an actual team. We’ve played one official game (in pickup basketball) and suffered one official loss (in excruciating fashion). Please check out our online article—it’s one of the finest pieces of journalism produced by The Crimson ever.
Still, we can bond over the trials of different teams. We can emulate the principles of hard work and unity that drive the players that we cover. We can train, strategize, and perform. Besides, transcription is kind of a sport.
Lexington is a fun town. We leave with warm memories and no permanent tattoos. Yet we’re glad to be back in Cambridge. Sometimes you need to drink two fish bowls even though all your body needs is a glass of water. Sometimes you need to order a banana at Panera Bread because all you’ve eaten in the past day is Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Chik-fil-A. Sometimes you need to visit the largest indoor arena in the the United States and marvel at the size of the Kentucky flag.
And sometimes you need to come home.
