After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—In last night’s 63-62 loss to Princeton, one of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s greatest strengths this season proved to be one of its biggest problems.
The Crimson, which had entered the contest as the nation’s second-best free throw shooting team—connecting on 81.6 percent of its attempts—struggled from the charity stripe.
Harvard finished the contest 10-of-16 from the line for a mark of 62.5 percent—its lowest single-game percentage on the season.
While junior co-captain Oliver McNally finished a perfect 3-of-3 from the line, each of Harvard’s other five players who went to the stripe missed at least one attempt.
The Crimson also struggled getting to the line, attempting just six free throws in the first half. And when the team did get to the stripe, it failed to capitalize on its opportunities.
With Harvard leading by five, 25-20, with 4:48 to play, Harvard freshman Laurent Rivard was tripped up cutting to the basket, and Princeton’s Dan Mavraides was whistled for the foul. The play sent Rivard—who entered the contest shooting 90.7 percent from the stripe—to the line for his first attempt of the night.
But the rookie bricked the front end of the one-and-one. Princeton secured the rebound, pushed the ball up court, and the Tigers’ Brendan Connolly finished an and-one layup for a five-point swing.
Sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry also failed to convert on an important opportunity late in the contest.
With the score knotted at 57 with less than three minutes to play, Curry sliced into the lane and was fouled by Princeton’s Douglas Davis as he attempted a layup. Curry made just one of his two shots, and the Tigers regained the lead on the ensuing possession thanks to a pair of free throws from Davis, whose team finished 14-of-15 from the free throw line.
“It’s amazing; we’ve been one of the better foul shooting teams in the country all year, and that was an area that certainly didn’t help us this afternoon,“ Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
CLEANING THE GLASS
In addition to its shooting woes from the free throw line, the Crimson also struggled with another fundamental—rebounding.
The Tigers out-rebounded the Crimson on the night, 36-24, and managed to pull down 14 offensive rebounds.
“I thought we didn’t shoot foul shots very well, and then we didn’t block out very well,” Amaker said. “I thought those were two areas that really hurt us. Again you give [Princeton] the credit for its execution in those two areas.”
Tigers’ senior forward Kareem Maddox led the way on the glass for Princeton, grabbing a game-high 13 boards—nine of which came in the second half.
Tigers’ sophomore Ian Hummer had particular success on the offensive glass, pulling down four of his eight rebounds on the offensive end.
Perhaps the biggest rebound of the afternoon came late in the second half with the score tied at 51.
With 4:45 to play, Mavraides attempted a deep jumper. While his shot was off its mark, Hummer was there to pull down the board. Harvard sophomore Kyle Casey fouled Hummer going for the rebound, picking up his fourth personal foul, forcing him to the bench for the next two minutes. The foul also sent Hummer to the line, where the forward sank two attempts to put the Tigers ahead, 53-51.
BUBBLING
While the Crimson missed its opportunity to secure an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament, some Harvard fans are still clinging to a glimmer of hope that the Crimson will sneak its way into the field with an at-large bid.
Harvard will learn whether it receives an invitation to the Big Dance this afternoon when the field of 68 teams is announced on CBS at 6 p.m.
If the Crimson were to receive an at-large bid, it would mark the first time the Ivy League received two invitations.
But in all likelihood, the Harvard will have to settle for a bid to the National Invitational Tournament, a 32-team tournament that kicks off this Tuesday.
While the Crimson is not guaranteed a spot in the NIT field by virtue of its share of the Ivy League championship, Harvard is likely to receive an invitation given its 23 overall victories which include wins over NCAA-tournament hopefuls Boston College and Colorado.
“Like Coach said, we still have more left of this season,” McNally said.
The NIT field will be announced at 9 p.m. on ESPNU.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ECAC men’s hockey doesn’t get much better than this.
Because no remaining team could string together two consecutive victories in the best-of-three ECAC quarterfinals, today’s four games pose a very clear ultimatum: win or go home.
The action begins when Harvard faces off against No. 18 Dartmouth at 4 PM. So far, the series has been tightly contested. Harvard held on to win, 3-2, on Friday night, but Dartmouth evened the series with a 2-1 overtime victory yesterday.
The Crimson’s high level of play indicates a complete turnaround from earlier this season, when beating the Big Green seemed all but impossible. The Big Green clobbered the Crimson during the year, taking both regular-season matchups, 8-2 and 5-2.
The other three ECAC quarterfinals series—Colgate vs. No. 4 Union, St. Lawrence vs. No. 3 Yale, and Quinnipiac vs. Cornell—all face off at 7 P.M.
If the Crimson can pull off another upset tonight, a Colgate or St. Lawrence victory could make Harvard’s road to the ECAC finals a lot less bumpy. The toughest team Harvard could face would be Cornell, a squad the Crimson beat, 4-3, on Feb. 18.
But if Harvard, Union, and Yale all advance, the Crimson would face the Dutchmen in the semifinals next Friday. And a victory over the fourth-best team in the nation would be a bit harder to come by.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its home opener on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team fell just shy of doing something it had not done in over 10 years: defeat Penn.
The Crimson (1-2, 1-1 Ivy) was unable to hold off the Quakers’ second-half surge, as No. 4 Penn (4-0, 1-0) came back from a three-goal half-time deficit and scored in the last 17 seconds to secure a 9-8 victory at Soldiers Field.
“Penn is ranked number four in the country for a reason,” sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “They are a very smart team, handle the ball well, and picked up and capitalized on the small mistakes that we made.”
Harvard started off strong, preventing the Quakers from entering its territory and building up an early 3-0 lead, with two goals netted by sophomore Micaela Cyr and another by VanderMeulen.
After 10 minutes, Penn finally got on the board, putting away a free position shot. The Crimson’s VanderMeulen and sophomore Danielle Tetreault quickly responded, each adding another goal to put Harvard up, 5-1. With the squads going back in forth in the final 10 minutes of the period, the Crimson entered the half with a 6-3 lead.
“We’ve been focusing on not turning the ball over and being really patient,” said senior tri-captain defender Sam McMahon. “In the first half, we did that. We were really patient on the ball on offense and made the defense work to get the ball back.”
“I thought we did really well in the first half,” VanderMeulen added. “We had the ball the majority of the half. In the end, we started to make small mistakes, and that’s when Penn started to get its momentum.”
After trading goals in the first 10 minutes of the second half, the Crimson maintained its three-goal buffer along with its hope of pulling off an upset victory over the four-time Ivy League champions.
Yet Harvard’s advantage suddenly slipped away. In the next six minutes, the Quakers netted three straight goals. Suddenly, it was anybody’s game.
“Penn got on a run, and we all started to drop our heads on offense,” VanderMeulen said. “We started to panic and forced things, and it showed our immaturity a little bit.”
“During that time, we just couldn’t get the ball up the field, case in point,” McMahon said. “What it comes down to are those little mistakes, and we let them get back in.”
With 15 minutes to play and the scoreboard tied at 7-7, the pressure was on.
After eight turnovers, seven shots, and five saves between the two teams, Penn broke the draw with 2:57 left to play. Cyr fouled Quakers senior Giulia Giordano, who netted the free position shot to give Penn its fourth consecutive goal and first lead of the game.
Junior Jess Halpern kept the Crimson’s hope alive by answering a minute later with a free position goal—her second goal of the game—to tie the score.
With the game on the line and the clock winding down, the Quakers won a crucial draw control. Penn senior Bridget Waclawik placed the ball in the back of the cage with 17 seconds on the clock, dashing the Crimson’s hope for an upset and securing Penn’s 30th consecutive Ancient Eight victory.
“Penn adjusted their defense, and we didn’t,” McMahon said. “We need to work on adjusting on the fly, not being antsy, and as a collective group, getting the job done.”
“I think one thing we are really taking away from this game is that we need to be more comfortable with the lead,” VanderMeulen said. “We have no problem gaining a lead and making a stance against the other team. We need to possess the ball, show some maturity, and be confident with ourselves when we have that lead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not be as exciting as the final of a Grand Slam tournament, but the Harvard men’s tennis team still proved it can provide exciting action and keep its fans on the edge of their seats.
In an evening match on Friday, the Crimson faced off against Binghamton at the Murr Tennis Center in the squad’s first home match in two weeks. Harvard (7-6) was on the brink of defeat in many of its matches against Binghamton, but pulled itself from the brink of defeat each time to pull out a 5-2 victory over the Bearcats.
“I think the team did great because Binghamton is a hard team to beat,” junior Ali Felton said. “It was the end of a long week...we worked hard on conditioning, and [the win] was what we’ve been working hard for.”
Harvard started things off by winning the doubles point to take an early lead over Binghamton.
Junior Jon Pearlman and sophomore Josh Tchan began with a relatively comfortable win over their opponents in the first doubles match. From the get-go, the Crimson duo dominated its opponents, breaking the pair from Binghamton three times to race out to a 7-1 lead.
In the ninth game, Pearlman and Tchan had a match point, but a big serve from the Bearcats quickly erased the opportunity. The Binghamton duo made a bit of a resurgence by winning the next two games, but Pearlman and Tchan stopped any chance of a comeback in the 11th game, sealing the first victory for Crimson, 8-3.
“I think that we were really able to prepare playing against Louisville the weekend before,” Tchan said. “For Jon and I, we kind of figured out what works for us in terms of working together.”
Senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and freshman Casey MacMaster were not as fortunate, losing, 8-3, to Alexandre Haggai and Arnav Jain. The Harvard pair was broken early in the match and never recovered from the deficit. Down 7-4, MacMaster made a few great shots to bring the game back to deuce, but the Bearcats eventually sealed the win when the rookie shot sailed over the baseline.
With one win and one loss for Harvard, the doubles point came down to Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen’s match. Felton and Nguyen had a rough start to match, getting broken early and finding themselves down, 6-4. Their opponents had a point to go up, 7-4, but Nguyen pulled off a solid volley to erase the game point.
The Harvard duo continued from this momentum, evening the score at six games apiece. Both teams held serve for the next four games, sending the match into a tiebreak. In the breaker, Binghamton won the first point, but the Crimson swept the next seven points to wrap up a thrilling 9-8 victory.
“We just kept fighting,” Felton said. “We’ve been in that position before and by the end of the match, we were playing really well.”
The singles also did not fail to disappoint. Harvard won four out of its six matches on the way to the 5-2 victory over the Bearcats, two pushing Crimson players into the final set.
Nguyen found himself in another battle in his singles matchup against Haggai. Nguyen cruised through the first set, 6-2, but lost the second in a tiebreak. The two seemed evenly matched going into the third set, but Nguyen had a little more left in the tank to earn the victory, 6-3 in the third.
Tchan also pulled out a tight three-setter to earn another point for the Crimson. Similarly to Nguyen’s match, Tchan won the first set 6-3, but dropped the second, 7-5. Despite his opponent carrying the momentum from winning the previous set, Tchan prevailed 6-4 in the third.
“Going into third set, I just said to myself ‘I’m not playing that well, but maybe I can be more energetic than my opponent,” Tchan said. “It took me a while to come back, but eventually it came out in favor.”

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient  Eight (and other schools too).
Athletes at Stanford had access to a list of "easy" classes, according to California Watch. The list, which has existed since at least 2001, included courses such as "Beginning Improvising" and "Social Dances of North America III" and was distributed exclusively to Stanford athletes.
Officials at Stanford said that the list was meant to help athletes balance their demanding schedules and disputed that the list was comprised entirely of easy classes, but Stanford athletes reported that the classes on the list were generally less than difficult.
"It's definitely not going to be a hard class if it's coming off that list," Karissa K. Cook, a women's volleyball player at Stanford, told California Watch.
Fox News' Jesse B. Watters interviewed students from Columbia about the "so-called Muslim problem" during a Watters' World segment on Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor." During the segment, Watters asked students if there was "a Muslim problem in the world." Several students identified a "terrorist" problem, rather than a "Muslim" problem, which is perhaps what prompted Watters to call Columbia "a different type of school."
"I mean, these people were doing mental acrobats trying to delink Islam from terrorists," Watters said after the segment.
Students at Wesleyan released a video last Wednesday titled "I Have Sex" as part of a larger effort to dissuade lawmakers from cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. Su Park, one of the video's creators, said that the video is meant to show lawmakers that Americans do have sex. The video includes Wesleyan students holding up signs reading "I Have Sex" and asks viewers to "Save Planned Parenthood." The video has already been picked up by websites like Jezebel and Feministing and, Coffee Party USA reports, received 80,000 views within 24 hours of going live.
Emma Watson announced last Wednesday that she is taking time off from her studies at Brown to focus on her "professional and acting projects." Watson said that she needed to focus on the final Harry Potter movie, which is scheduled to premier this summer.
Approximately 100 Northwestern students watched as a woman was penetrated by a mechanized sex toy about three weeks ago as part of a popular human sexuality class offered by the university. Students said that they were warned repeatedly about the "explicit" nature of the demonstration, which "featured a naked non-student woman being repeatedly sexually stimulated to the point of orgasm by the sex toy, referred to as a 'fucksaw,'" the Daily Northwestern reported.
Students in the class said that they were not able to see much because the woman was towards the rear of the stage, but Nicholas Wilson, a student in the class, told WCVB Boston that some students tried to get a better view.
The class' teacher, psychology Professor John M. Baily, wrote in an e-mail to students that he allowed the demonstration to take place because he was unable "to come up with a legitimate reason why students should not be able to watch such a demonstration."
