After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTIAGO, Chile—On a cold Saturday afternoon I discovered Talento Chileno.
Entering mid-episode, I quickly realized we were in the first round—auditions. Senor Germán Perez looked a little anxious when he walked out on stage, but relaxed quickly after one of the judges gave him a kiss and a quick shoulder massage. A former performer on the Santiago bus circuit, he sang a medley of “Over the Rainbow” and songs in his native tongue, crooning all the while in a thick Chilean accent. The judges suggested he stick to Spanish lyrics, but the decision was a resounding, unanimous “sí.”
As I continued watching with my Chilean host family, I was relieved to discover that Chilean contestants were just as self-assured, and often fatally so, as their American counterparts. I learned, too, that Chileans were just as eager to celebrate a train wreck of an audition—that of the breakdancing mime, for instance—as they were to celebrate a glorious success. As the show came to a close, we agreed that our favorite act was a gawky yet dynamic teen, described by one judge as an “artista integral,” or a man of the arts, who performed a rendition of Bjork’s “It’s Oh So Quiet.”
Watching Talento Chileno is akin to shopping at Líder, the Chilean equivalent of Wal-Mart. It’s eerily similar to the American version—complete with a dizzying array of red, white and blue fluorescent lights surrounding the stage—and yet strikingly different. In Talento Chileno, for instance, family members are allowed to encourage their loved ones from the wings, singing and dancing along during the performance.
Since this is one of the most-watched television shows in Chile, and since the Chilean public votes for the winner, I tell myself that, by following the show, I am gaining a comprehensive picture of Chilean culture and values. More likely, I will never again get the chance to hear a judge, when evaluating a 33-year-old Italian music aficionado, quip, “The age of Christ—let’s hope you don’t end up crucified today.”

VINA DEL MAR, Chile—In a tired tourist city of dusty apartment buildings and shuttered discotheques, the turreted stone towers were striking. After an afternoon of beachside wandering, they were also alluring, and we decided to leave our sandy perch to hike up to the castle.
When we arrived we didn’t find the anticipated signs and ticket booth. In their place was a conspicuously open wrought iron gate. This must be the Chilean Tourist Bureau’s indication that the castle was ours to explore, we guessed gleefully. Shrugging off the eerie emptiness of the place, we filled the silence with snapping—first photos of ourselves on the steps leading up to the bay windows, then standing in front of the stone wall overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
As we were getting ready to leave—the spooky loneliness had begun to wig us out—a little girl appeared atop the largest tower. I suppose our Disney-enriched childhoods took over, because we immediately announced, giggling, that she must be a princess. She was, after all, wearing pink. Determined to say “hi,” and reassured of our original conviction that the castle was, after all, some well-known Viña del Mar tourist attraction, we pushed open the faded wooden door at the side entrance. Inside we found a room of unmade bunk beds and a bathroom. But before we could find the princess, they found us.
“Excuse me, what are you doing here?” Two policemen appeared. We stumbled, the Spanish words to explain our presence getting stuck between our teeth. “You are trespassing on the property of the armed forces,” one of them began.
“But, the door was open. We thought—”
“A very bad thing. This is the residence of Chilean military and police. No one else is permitted to enter.”
After some discussion they decided, quite generously, not to arrest us. But we were promptly escorted out, and as we walked down the street the three of us laughed nervously—startled but smug that we had trespassed onto federal property, however unwittingly.
Two weeks later I was driving along the coast in Viña, listening to dated American hits on the radio and talking to Eduardo, a Chilean friend who was showing me around for the weekend. He pointed out sights along the road—the high school on strike, the pub with a view of the ocean.
“And the castle, up there on the hill, that’s where the president stays when he visits Viña.”
I looked up. I did a double take. “It is?”
“Beautiful, right? The view of the ocean from up there must be amazing.”
“Yeah,” I said and smiled down into my lap. “Definitely.”

NORTH YORKSHIRE, England—Malham Cove is, for lack of a better description, a very big rock. A vertical slab of limestone rising almost 300 feet above the Yorkshire countryside, swept by rain and mist, it’s the sort of natural formation that provokes an involuntary gulp.
It’s also climbable. A series of steps are hacked into the stone on its western lip, where the grade is gentler. The view from the top is breathtaking, but the ascent’s much more earnestly so. By the time I reached the cliff above, I was panting profusely. The English octogenarians in tweed and flat caps passing me without a care, waving merrily, were having the same effect on my ego that the climb was having on my lungs.
Finally, feet planted firmly on top of the cove, I took in the miles of green countryside rolling away beneath me. Gorgeous as it was, the most striking perception atop Malham Cove is not visual but auditory. The wind isn’t quite a howl—it’s more of a mournful shriek, punctuated by eerie spells of silence and the bleating of lambs. It’s a scene straight out of Wuthering Heights, and by the time I started my descent, I believed that Emily Brontë must have been, by Yorkshire countryside standards, a cheerful sort of gal.
I was glad to reach the cozy village of Malham, in the valley below. Cold and wet as a hike in the Dales may be, the warmth of a pub is always near at hand, and a welcome warmth it is. Heartened by a pint of ale, I set off on the stroll back to my residence in Skipton, eight miles away.
My infantile anger towards the ageing locals did not last long. After a few hours of trudging through damp pastures, I had figured out that Yorkshire cows are nastily aggressive, but I still hadn’t figured out my map. I came to a road, waved a car down, and asked its elderly driver to give me a lift. She kindly complied.

The world's population will hit 7 billion this year, raising concerns about the economic and environmental consequences associated with continued growth, according to an article by a Harvard School of Public Health professor.
In a paper published in Friday's edition of the journal Science, David E. Bloom, the chair of the Department of Global Health and Population, explored the global implications of the human population surpassing 7 billion, a milestone the United Nations has projected will occur on Oct. 31.
The exploding population increase will take the greatest toll on developing regions of the world, Bloom said. By 2050, according to a U.N. estimate, worldwide population will rise to approximately 9.3 billion people. 97 percent of that increase will occur in less developed nations.
"The world’s demographic center of gravity will continue to shift from the more to the less developed countries and especially to the least developed countries, many of which will face unprecedented and daunting challenges related to the supply and distribution of food, water, housing, and energy," Bloom wrote in the article.
Over the next 40 years, the population increase in Africa alone will make up 49 percent of population growth worldwide.
In more developed countries, however, population growth will slow over the next half-century. As life expectancy increases, birth rates continue to drop, and as the population ages, the proportion of retired adults will increase relative to those of working age.
More developed nations will face their own host of demographic shift problems, including supporting this aging population whose reliance on social welfare programs may outstrip the ability of the workforce to finance these programs.
Adolescents and young adults, aged 15 to 24, currently outnumber those 60 and above by 54 percent, Bloom wrote. After 2025, however, the older population will overtake the younger, setting off a gigantic demographic shift. While those aged 60 and above make up 11 percent of the world’s population today, by 2050, they will comprise 22 percent.
“Although the issues immediately confronting developing countries are different from those facing the rich countries, in a globalized world demographic challenges anywhere are demographic challenges everywhere,” Bloom said in a press release.
Worldwide population reached 1 billion in 1800, 2 billion in 1927, and 3 billion in 1960. Since then, population has increased by 1 billion approximately every 13 years.
Depending on changes in birth rate, the population in 2100 could range from 6.2 to 15.8 billion people, according to U.N. estimates.
“We have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge-action gaps we see in the area of child survival, to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy,” Bloom said in the press release. “It’s just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a controversial article written by Subramanian Swamy, the group Foundation for Individual Rights in Education sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust on Wednesday urging her not to allow Harvard to take action against the Harvard Summer School instructor.
Swamy, a political leader in India who earned his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1965, penned an op-ed published July 16 in the Indian newspaper Daily News and Analysis that advocated for the removal of hundreds of mosques and the denial of voting rights to non-Hindus with the goal of stemming terrorist attacks in the country.
Following the publication of the article, several Harvard affiliates circulated a petition calling on the University to end its ties with Swamy, and in a statement, the dean of the Summer School said that the school “will give this matter our serious attention.”
But FIRE, a civil liberties group with a focus on academia, cautioned in its letter to Faust that the group is “concerned about the threat to freedom of expression” that may come about from that attention.
“The threat of a disciplinary investigation of Swamy stands in sharp and unflattering contrast to this admirable and appropriate understanding of the importance of freedom of expression in the academic community,” Adam H. Kissel '94, vice president of programs at FIRE, wrote in the letter.
Harvard has not explicitly said that it is investigating Swamy or that it has considered such an investigation. Messages to spokespeople for the University were not immediately returned.
Swamy teaches Economics S-110: “Quantitative Methods in Economics and Business” and Economics S-1316: “Economic Development in India and East Asia” at the Summer School.
In his letter, Kissel said that an investigation of Swamy’s article would go against Harvard’s commitment to free speech, as outlined in the “Free Speech Guidelines” adopted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1990.
“If members of the Harvard community are given to understand that Harvard might begin an investigation—with possible disciplinary consequences—of the views they express, they likely will self-censor,” he wrote. “This is precisely the result that a university dedicated to intellectual freedom must seek to avoid.”
“Harvard must honor its own promises,” he said in a phone interview. “Students have every right to protest for or against ideas in article, as does Harvard, but Harvard may not investigate or punish the expression.”
While in some instances a professor’s publicized opinions might warrant disciplinary action, in these “extreme cases,” the professor’s opinion would have to prevent him from successfully teaching the subject, he said.
“In this case, it’s an economics professor with political opinions, and his subject has nothing to do with politics,” he said. “The University cannot simply investigate someone for publishing an opinion piece.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most students, the summer after graduation provides the chance to relax and reflect, possibly celebrating the fact that the days of papers and problem sets are over.
But for Harvard football’s Brent Osborne and Collin Zych, the real work is only just beginning.
After both players went undrafted in April, the duo waited 87 long days for the chance to begin pursuing their football dreams, and with the lifting of the NFL lockout on Tuesday, both acted quickly in taking a giant step towards the next level.
On the first day NFL teams were allowed to sign undrafted free agents, the former Crimson stand-outs were snatched up quickly, with Osborne, an offensive lineman, signing with the Seattle Seahawks and Zych, a safety, catching on with his hometown Dallas Cowboys.
Osborne becomes the second Harvard o-lineman in the past two years to sign with an NFL team after going undrafted, following James Williams '10, who signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before last season. Williams was cut by the Bucs two months after signing and is currently on the Indianapolis Colts’ practice squad—displaying the difficulty of making it as an undrafted rookie.
And Osborne’s journey the pros may be even more arduous than his former teammate’s. Williams, a three-time All-American selection and three-time all-Ivy standout, was considered a better prospect coming out of college than Osborne, a second-team All-Ivy performer in 2011 who started 19 of 20 games the last two seasons for the Crimson.
That’s not to say making it as a UDFA not been done before; defensive lineman Desmond Bryant '09 remains on the Oakland Raiders roster after signing with the squad out of Harvard two years ago and making the team in camp. Osborne’s chances of achieving that type of success might be helped by the fact that of the 20 undrafted free agents signed by the Seahawks, only one, UConn’s Zach Hurd, was an offensive lineman.
After completing one of the most decorated careers by a defensive back in Harvard history, Zych has an uphill battle to the NFL as well. During his senior season, the three-time All-Ivy honoree tied for the Crimson lead with 79 tackles and paced the squad in passes defended (12) and interceptions (three) while serving as captain.
The Plano, Texas native will now get a shot at the next level with his hometown Cowboys, whose head coach, Jason Garrett, played football at Princeton. Zych had visited with Dallas in April, and with a myriad of young, unproven safeties on the Cowboys roster, Zych could have a chance to make the team with an impressive training camp performance.
Both Osborne and Zych are considered too small for their positions to play at the next level by many scouts. But if either can make it, they would join a respectable group of Crimson alumni on NFL rosters, including Williams, Bryant, Buffalo Bills starting QB Ryan Fitzpatrick '05 and Baltimore Ravens six-time Pro Bowl center Matt Birk '98.
If neither can catch on in the NFL, there could be other options for the pair; their former teammate, WR Marco Ianuzzi ’11, was the sixth overall choice in this year’s CFL Draft and currently plays for the BC Lions.
Other former Ivy Leaguers to sign UDFA contracts this week were Princeton tight end Harry Flaherty '11 (New York Giants) and Yale long snapper Tom McCarthy '11 (Atlanta Falcons). The Bulldogs also had the only Ancient Eight player to be drafted in 2011 when fullback Shane Bannon '11 went to the Kansas City Chiefs in the seventh round.
