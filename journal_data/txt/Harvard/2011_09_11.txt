After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As attendees bowed their heads in a moment of silence at a prayer vigil Sunday night, a plane roared by overhead. The sound of jet engines provided a haunting reminder of the terrorist attacks that a crowd of several hundred people had gathered to commemorate in Tercentenary Theater.
With the columns of Memorial Church illuminated in blue lighting, students gathered before its steps holding lit candles and listening to the testimonies and reflections of Harvard students and faculty members. The University Choir sang several hymns, and the Kuumba Singers opened the program.
“This event allowed us to realize that our borders are just dotted lines,” Professor of Comparative Religion Diana L. Eck said. “There is no strength in bricks and stone, but only strength in the relationships that we build.”
During a series of events Sunday, the University commemorated the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, mirroring similar events around the country as it remembered a day that has become a defining moment of the past decade.
In a sermon at Memorial Church that began the day’s events, Harvard Kennedy School Professor David R. Gergen encouraged a renewed sense of compassion in America in spite of a decade characterized by wars, economic shock, and “political lunacy.”
“We have entered a dark wood, as Dante would call it, and we are yet to see the light,” he said.
ith standing room only, the service drew a crowd of both regular churchgoers and other members of the Harvard community.
After September 11, 2001, Americans sought to embrace their own families—but Gergen argued that in the future Americans should demonstrate their compassion by seeking to embrace a broader community. Social challenges such as rampant unemployment and economic inequality often escape the discussion at religious centers, Gergen added.
“These are challenges we talk about in classrooms around Harvard,” he said. “But do we talk about them enough at Memorial Church?”
Considering how America should move forward in the next decade, Gergen said that compassion for one another will be essential.
“The larger threat comes from what we are allowing to happen to each other,” he said.
At the Harvard Interfaith Collaborative and Harvard Chaplains’ “Conversations on the 10th Anniversary of 9/11” event later in the day, students and religious officials agreed that Americans still have a long way to go in aftermath of 9/11.
“We are still talking in terms of a very polarized world—and of ‘us’ and ‘them,’” said Samir Selmanovic, the founder of the inter-religious community “Faith House Manhattan” and the event’s keynote speaker.
In the “post-post 9/11” world, Selmanovic said that Americans need to change the nature of current discourse about the attacks.
“A lot of interfaith discussion has been about the past instead of looking to the future and actually providing some kind of prototype or some ideas or new experiences—a new history that we can refer to,” Selmanovic said. “We want forward-looking people to have new stories.”
Attendees had the opportunity to share their stories with one another during breakout sessions at the end of the event.
“It was really nice to hear people’s individual 9/11 stories,” said Yacine Fares ’15. “It touched on a lot of questions that I’ve had for a while and gave some answers.”
During a panel featuring student Reshma A. Lutfeali ’13, Harvard Zoroastrian Chaplain Daryush Mehta, and Eck, the audience also heard the stories of three different individuals affected by 9/11.
“Being a Muslim in America did not mean the same thing,” said Lutfeali, a Shi’a Muslim, referring to discrimination faced by members of her religion in the attacks’ aftermath. “Muslims were not considered people.”
Like earlier speakers during the day, Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha instructed audience members at “The Art of Survival: A Tenth Anniversary Observance of 9/11 in Words, Music, and Dance” in Sanders Theatre to continue to consider the societal implications of the terrorist attacks.
“This is an opportunity not only to remember, but also to reflect upon the state of the world and the meaning of survival and solidarity for us today,” he said.
Bhabha’s remarks preceded a series of readings and performances portraying individuals’ varied experiences in the wake of the “day that began like any other and ended like no other in recent history.” Speakers interpreted the testimonies of the first emergency response workers to arrive at the scene of the terrorist attacks, in addition to reading the letters of deceased American soldiers written to their families while serving overseas. These interpretations were punctuated by musical selections.
Bhabha also called attention to the way that the attacks damaged everyday life by introducing violence into previously peaceful public spaces.
“The wanton and willful violence turned the public spaces of civic life into a theater of war,” he said. “The everyday is eclipsed and estranged by a sense of disorientation and exposure from which there is no place to hide.”
As a testimony to the sense of chaos experienced as a result of the attacks, Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12-’13 described the confusion that she felt in witnessing the violent reprisals that occurred in the days that followed 9/11.
“I cannot find a productive reason to support the pernicious, contagious bargaining tool that not only breeds terror but also incites the terrible bigoted responses to it,” said Moroney, whose father died in the attacks, during remarks at the prayer vigil.
A short hymn from the University Choir signaled the vigil’s end. As the singers slowly exited, few people moved, lingering for several minutes as the candles were put out one by one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents campus dining hall workers, reached a tentative contract agreement Thursday.
The five year contract stipulates an annual wage increase for workers and provides for a committee to consider further workplace improvements.
The agreement came in the wake of an extension last week, after the Local 26 and the University were unable to come to an agreement by Sept. 7, the expiration date of the current contract. Before the new contract becomes official, Local 26 will hold a secret ballot among its full membership on Sept. 19.
Local 26 President Brian Lang said he was very pleased with the new contract, adding that it was passed unanimously by the bargaining committee between the University and the union.
“We’re very happy with the agreement,” Lang said. “It addresses all of the issues we have been raising in our sustainable jobs and sustainable foods campaign.” That campaign called for, among other things, more hours and job security for dining hall workers and for an increase in the amount of fresh, local, and organic foods prepared in the dining halls.
The University was also satisfied with the tentative decision.
“The agreement is the result of an extensive and constructive negotiation process between the parties and reflects many significant improvements to the previous contract,” said Bill Murphy, Harvard Director of Labor and Employee Relations, in a statement.
On the union’s foremost issue of higher incomes for dining hall workers, a statement issued by the University said that the contract provides a mutually beneficial course of action.
The contract provides for an average annual wage increase of 2.73 percent, which the University called “both fair and operationally sustainable.”
The new contract also stipulates the formation of a “Joint Best Practices Committee”, which will be responsible for exploring and recommending “best practices in the workplace, including those that promote: healthy, sustainable and environmentally responsible food services; full year employment for members; and professional development,” according to the statement.
Lang said that the formation of the committee will play a critical role in the success of the new contract for both sides.
“What we were intent on doing in this contract was establishing a truly collaborative process with the University with real decision makers from the University,” Lang said. “We’ve come to an agreement on a process—it’s a beginning, but it’s a beginning where we’re sitting down as equals to come up with solutions to the issues.”
Lang applauded the University’s openness in taking the “bold step” of creating such a committee.
He added that he was “confident” that the contract would be “enthusiastically” received.
“We think it’s going to yield positive results for our members and also for the University,” he said.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
Police arrested a Dartmouth College graduate student for allegedly running a methamphetamine lab in his off-campus apartment, The Dartmouth reports. After searching the apartment of graduate student Randy Lambreghts, 28, on suspicion of "possible chemicals," the police seized several items from his apartment for further analysis. Lambreghts was held on a $20,000 bail and the investigation into his drug dealings is ongoing.On the opposite coast, 43-year-old California State San Bernardino professor Stephen Kinzey is wanted by authorities for allegedly running a methamphetamine ring and leading a chapter of a motorcycle gang.
 
The names and Social Security numbers of 43,000 Yale University affiliates were publicly available for months via Google Search, The Yale Daily News reports. Though the information remained online for about 10 months, Yale’s information technology services director said that no evidence suggested that it had been "exploited" during that time.
 
The family of murdered Yale University graduate student Annie Le is suing the school for what Le's relatives perceive as a longtime failure in protecting women at the university from sexual violence. Le's body, which showed evidence of sexual assault, was found stuffed into the wall of a Yale lab in 2009. Raymond Clark III, an animal technician who worked in Le's building, was later convicted and sentenced to 44 years in prison for Le’s murder. Yale officials said in a statement, "Yale had no information indicating that Raymond Clark was capable of committing this terrible crime, and no reasonable security measures could have prevented his unforeseeable act."
