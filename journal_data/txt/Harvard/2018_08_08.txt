After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SAN SIMEON, CALIF. — On a rocky, meandering stretch of California coast, exactly halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, lies the region of San Simeon. If you’ve heard of the place, it’s probably because of the Hearst Castle, for the lavish and elaborate estate built by newspaper magnate (and expelled Harvard student) William Randolph Hearst sits atop a hill overlooking the coast. But while the castle is incredibly beautiful (if excessive), it pales in comparison to the beauty of the rugged cliffs, rocky beaches, and winding paths along the Pacific.
Five years ago, I discovered paradise here. The California central coast, from Ventura to Monterey, has always captivated me since I first saw its incredible wild beauty. I am not a nature lover at all — I’ve always been a city boy at heart — but something about the beaches and fields and roads here has held my attention, recurring in my thoughts again and again.
What I loved about San Simeon then and now was its simplicity — it’s not built up or heavily crowded with tourists at all. The vistas are unspoiled, wild, and natural, and the only way to get there is the wonderful two-lane Pacific Coast Highway. There are no luxury hotels looming over the ocean, but rather small, modest guest cottages within the tiny towns along the strand. Yes, many of the beaches are rocky and inaccessible, and it may seem too isolated, but nothing else quite captures my imagination so fully.
It could have been yesterday when I first walked the trails of Moonstone Beach as a 15 year-old, but I had changed so much. Instead of this trip being a high schooler’s adventure, this was a welcome detour in a summer consumed by an internship since coming back home from college. Part of me wanted this trip never to end, though I knew I’d be back home within 36 hours. I wanted to savor each second.
With each step I took, memories crashed down on me like wild ocean waves. I felt so much older and worldly wiser. I had new hopes, fears, desires, and dreams, and began thinking about who I might be five years from now. What job would I have? What career would I build? Would I live in L.A. or Boston? Who would I become? My thoughts overwhelmed me. I wasn’t a teenager anymore — those years now seemed as far away as the horizon.
I spent the entire next morning walking along beaches, piers, and rocky bluffs, always trying to capture the Pacific with my sunglasses. And as I fruitlessly tried to skip rocks across the waves, I realized my worries were pointless. What were my fears next to the vastness of the ocean? Why couldn’t I be content to just stare at the awesome power of the sea and its beautiful violence? What was stopping me from simply enjoying the view without fearing the time I had left here? There was no point in trying to answer questions I couldn’t have the answers to. The beach and the castle on the hill and the waves would always be here, always moving, always changing, but always constant.
What I loved about San Simeon then and now was its simplicity. I needed to embrace it fully and become less preoccupied, more content to live in the moment. And I flung another pebble in the ocean, smiling, not caring where it went.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve had the distinct honor of attending a party in Pforzheimer House’s belltower suite, you’ve probably wished the Harvard party scene was a bit different. There’s usually too many people, too little alcohol, and far too many concerningly drunk freshmen. The floors are sticky, sweat covers the arch of your forehead, and the friend you came with is making out with some boy he just met.
Dorm room parties, likely the social event the average Harvard undergrad will frequent the most during their four years, follow the aforementioned formula. Understandably, many people want more from their social lives. Harvard is lackluster and the parties aren’t as fun as the ones at the state schools their friends attend.
But behind these complaints, there has to be another source of disappointment: College parties are not as wild or exciting as popular media has deceived us into believing they should be. Yet, at a place of prestige and wealth like Harvard, people have invested innumerable resources into holding onto that idealized dream. They’ve hurt campus life in the process.
There are a number of real obstacles to creating the most vibrant social scene possible at Harvard. There are no large, off-campus bars or similar spaces catered to college students’ nights out. Many dorm renovations have taken away common rooms and other private social spaces. Formal processes in the Houses for hosting parties are tedious and excessive.
But beyond these limitations, our discontent with Harvard parties is a matter of failed expectations. We’ve grown up on movies that stage the wildest, humanistics, and extravagant parties imaginable. A large part of the movie “Superbad” is about the protagonist’s attempt to get to his crush’s party, during which they crash another rowdy party brimming with alcohol and cocaine. “Project X” is an entire movie about an attempt to become more popular through an insane party. Listicles give you options galore for determining the most iconic college party  — “Animal House,” “PCU,” “How High.”
These scenes, whether we’re actively aware of it or not, influence our desires. Movies socialize us, shape our behaviors, and imbed us with ideologies. There’s a certain fetizishization of what our party culture should look like, and it clouds what we seek out of our social lives. We want parties that allow us to lose control, obliterate inhibitions, and embrace excess until we’re sprawled out on a couch somewhere. We’re searching, inevitably, for one of the opening scenes in “The Social Network.”
The movie, which tracks Mark Zuckerberg’s journey from Harvard to Silicon Valley royalty, starts with a final club party. A bus full of attractive women is led to the front door of a final club by a bouncer dressed in black-tie.
“Everybody! ... You’re at one of the most exclusive clubs, not just at Harvard, but in the world,” a member of the Phoenix Club tells the crowd. Soon, women are undressing on top of tables in slow motion for the group of men watching them. Two women are kissing for an audience, and a game of strip poker ensues. The party is all about sex, alcohol, and even more sex.
The scene is a glamorization of the actual multimillion-dollar mansions that line Mount Auburn St., and the lines of young women who line up in the freezing cold for the chance to attend a party there.  When other areas of Harvard social life don’t allow for that ideal, people turn to final clubs. (Anyone who says they’re in a club for the networks or the community is telling you half-truths at best.) The appeal of a final club is intrinsically tied to the party culture we’ve been primed for: scantily-clad, drug-filled debauchery away from the eyes of authority.
When people say they wish that Harvard parties were better, I hear them asking for more parties like those they imagine happening at final clubs and in Hollywood films. But, as others have written before, final clubs are inherently exclusionary bastions of privilege. Because we’re at Harvard, where there are more students who come from families in the top 1 percent than the bottom 20 percent, entry into these organizations is tied to class. To roll in the final club scene, you have to have the money for Ubers, dues, and the other costs associated with that brand of nightlife. Harvard students are able to grasp for what they believe a really exciting, legendary college party to be. The key are the final clubs, but, if you’re not rich, the locks are tight and spare keys a rarity.
Many with complaints are seeking a shift towards a social life with the kinds of excesses, often financial, only possible at a place like Harvard. Bringing the final club scene to the masses, or opening up the door just a tiny bit wider, won’t cure our dissatisfaction with our social scene.
Social spaces based on your gender or class background should not be the gold standard for those seeking a thrilling night out. Instead, we have to reimagine what our ideal party scene strives for. Inclusivity, safety, comfort, accessibility, and community should be higher on our list of priorities.
The architects of this new party scene, who seemingly care more about togetherness than excessive and exclusivity, are already working. Cultural groups throw great parties, with reggaeton blasting and drinks flowing. Queer-affirming parties pop off. The shift in Harvard social life is on its way. But we have to accelerate it by asking ourselves the difficult questions: What are we looking for when we get dressed up to go out on a Friday night? Are we trying to have a good time? Or are we really knocking at the doors of multimillion-dollar mansions to feel as if we belong — a feeling only possible by the exclusion of others?
Harvard parties aren’t that bad. You just have to make sure you’re going to the right ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Colombian President Juan M. Santos will join the Kennedy School as its fourth Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow in the fall, according to a press release Tuesday.
On the last day of Santos’s eight-year-long presidency, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf named Santos an Angelopoulos Fellow — a title previously held by several world leaders, including the former Mexican President Felipe Calderón and former Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon.
The Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders program was conceived in 2011 to allow for outgoing and transitioning leaders to spend time in residence at HKS teaching, learning, and conducting their own research.
“President Santos is an accomplished public servant who has made a positive difference in the lives of millions of Colombians through his relentless pursuit of peace and security in his country,” Elmendorf said in a press release.
A journalist and an economist, Santo received the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating a peace treaty between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest rebel group better known as the FARC.
Before being elected president of Colombia in 2010, Santos also served as the country’s Minister of National Defense, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, and its first Minister of Foreign Trade.
A 1981 alum of the Kennedy School, Santos also served as a Nieman Fellow for his time as a journalist and newspaper editor in Colombia.
Elmendorf said in a press release he was “honored” to welcome the Colombian president back to HKS, and praised Santos’ “impressive leadership” in negotiating Colombia’s peace with the FARC.
Santos will “meet with students and collaborate with scholars and researchers” during the two semester long fellowship, according to the press release. He will also lecture and participate in public discussions and forums.
Santos said in a press release that he was looking forward to returning to the Kennedy School, a “place that profoundly shaped [his] understanding of public service.”
“This fellowship is a wonderful opportunity to share what I have learned during my time in office with the next generation of public leaders, and to continue my work on important public policy issues that I remain very passionate about, such as human rights, peace and reconciliation, poverty, and the environment,” Santos added.
Santos will begin his fellowship in the upcoming fall term and will reside through the spring term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a 2017-2018 season which saw the Harvard men’s basketball program raise its sixth Ancient Eight banner under Coach Tommy Amaker, the Crimson will set its ambitions towards making the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.
Having fallen just short of a March Madness berth in the final of the Ivy League Tournament last season, Harvard will again encounter a road-heavy non-conference slate before earning a chance at avenging the previous season’s NCAA Tournament throneholder, Penn, in February.
The pre-Ivy slate on paper is headlined by the Jan. 2 contest against the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, in a rematch of the 2015 NCAA Second Round meeting between the Crimson and the longtime nemesis of Amaker’s alma mater, Duke. Nevertheless, the odyssey to Chapel Hill is far from the sole spotlight in its non-conference schedule.
In a nod to the eight Golden State natives and two Peach State residents on the roster, Harvard will fly out of New England in late November and December for a California and Georgia trip, respectively. The November West Coast jaunt will feature a visit to the University of San Francisco on Nov. 21 and a rematch three days later against last year’s Wooden Classic opponent, St. Mary’s.
Following the Christmas holiday, junior classmates Chris Lewis and Robert Baker will not need to travel too far away from home as the Mercer Bears will host the Crimson in Philips Arena, the home of the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks on Dec. 29 or 30. The Georgia trip will conclude in North Carolina before two more non-Ivy contests against McGill and Howard, the latter of which will bring Amaker back to his hometown roots in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.
Of Harvard’s 13 non-conference matchups, eight will be away from Lavietes Pavilion. This marks a slight uptick in home contests compared to last season, when the Crimson hosted just four of its 15 non-Ivy contests. Supporters this season may also reap the benefits of away games in close proximity to Cambridge, including a Nov. 13 Mass Pike trip to Amherst against UMass coupled with a Nov. 16 excursion down I-95 to face the URI Rams. For more ambitious aficionados, a three-plus hour drive north to the University of Vermont will also be in store on Dec. 8.
The aforementioned rencounter with the Catamounts is one of seven opponents (including the MIT exhibition) which Harvard battled against last season. In the tail end of a slew of home-and-home agreements, the Crimson will seek to avoid a bi-season sweep against the Northeastern Huskies on Nov. 9 and the Holy Cross Crusaders on Nov. 29, in addition to its to Vermont, St. Mary’s, and George Washington defeats last season.
Transitioning towards 2019, the Crimson will spend early February in Cambridge for its Yale-Brown and Columbia-Cornell doubleheader weekends, before spending the following two weekends on the road. The Ancient Eight season will conclude at Lavietes Pavilion on Mar. 8 and Mar. 9 against Cornell and Columbia, where Harvard will be fighting over a berth in the Ivy League Tournament for the third straight season. This season, the Ancient Eight will converge in New Haven, Conn., instead of the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pa., for the concluding tournament on Mar. 16 and 17.
