Editors' Note: The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is closed due to COVID-19 for the foreseeable future. This article was written before the closure.
Museumgoers were buzzing with excitement on Mar. 8 for the International Women’s Day celebration at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A variety of activities and spotlight talks were set up throughout the museum’s extensive collection, highlighting their “Women Take the Floor” exhibition as a tribute to influential women in contemporary art. The exhibition features female artists in the Americas at different levels of recognition and fame, with artwork spanning a variety of media, including paint, textiles, and photography. On this day devoted to celebrating women, patrons wandered pensively through the seven thematic galleries, connecting with many of the pieces focused on female empowerment.
“International Women's Day to me is a critical moment for us to, as a community, reflect in the broadest sense on the power of women as makers, as thinkers, as debaters, as disruptors, as community shapers, and I think it's important for us to understand the efficacy of art to do that,” said Dalia H. Linssen, Head of Academic Engagement at the MFA.
Sentiments like Linssen’s were widely shared among the event’s viewers, who reflected on women in the art world. The museum label at the entrance of “Women Take the Floor” explained the necessity for appreciating female artists, prompting viewers to “name five women artists.” This deceptively simple question led many to recognize the underrepresentation of women in the industry and praise the exhibition’s inclusion of lesser-known artists.
“I honestly struggled and then picked the usuals,” museum patron Ward J. Capec said. “I think it’s good that they’re showing artists I don’t know... We all know ‘the biggies.’ If that was what was here, then it would be kind of a kick in the face to the underrepresented women.”
The MFA also stationed graduate students at specific pieces in the “Women Take the Floor” exhibition and other galleries for spotlight talks throughout the day. These students provided valuable historical context about womanhood during each piece’s time period.
“Women have had a very vibrant and active young life in the arts forever. We just haven’t been written about,” said Lydia D. Harrington, a Ph.D. candidate in the History of Art and Architecture Department at Boston University. “I think it’s really important to show that women have always been making art, especially now to counteract that really popular narrative, as well as showing that there are women in the Middle East who are successful artists, not just in the US.”
Harrington presented Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian’s “Pentagon” in the Arts of Islamic Cultures Gallery. The talk offered insight into the Iranian artist’s inspiration for the geometric, reflective piece, and emphasized Farmanfarmaian’s significance within the abstract art movement.
Phillippa E. L. Pitts, a Horowitz Foundation Fellow for American Art at Boston University, delivered another spotlight talk. Pitts spoke about Maria Montoya Martinez’s “Jar” in the “Women Take the Floor” exhibition, remarking on the Native American potter’s lasting impact.
“When we don’t look at the contributions of women, and we don’t think about methodologies to look at women’s work, we’re actually creating a fundamental flaw in our scholarship altogether,” Pitts said.
The MFA also featured artist Carolyn Muskat’s walkthrough of the “Women Take the Floor” exhibition, a performance by Boston poet laureate Porsha Olayiwola, an interactive artwork titled “Now, Speak!” by Amalia Pica, and a special viewing of original works on paper by women. In addition to these art-focused events, the museum included opportunities for patrons to interact with community organizations. Big Sister Boston had a table in the MFA’s Shapiro Family Courtyard, raising awareness for their organization dedicated to supporting young women.
“We’re all about igniting girls’ passion and empowering them to succeed through mentoring relationships and supporting girls’ healthy development,” said Nicole M. Canning, Manager of Volunteer Engagement. Canning was joined by Kelsey A. Karkos, a Big Sister herself for three years.
The Shapiro Family Courtyard also offered a collage card-making station, where guests of all ages could take a moment to design a card for an important woman in their lives. Parents and children sat around the bounty of craft materials, inspired by the mothers and children that exist in paintings such as Alice Neel’s “Lina Nochlin and Daisy.” Many mother-daughter pairs roamed the exhibition in admiration of such powerful pieces, spreading valuable lessons about female empowerment across generations.
“I’m proud to see these kinds of works represented, but kind of dismayed that they took so long to have something like this,” said Brenda C. McGurk, a patron who came to enjoy the International Women’s Day celebration with her mother. “It's great to have a day, but it needs to expand beyond the day.”

Editors' Note: The Kingston Gallery is open by appointment only due to COVID-19.
In mathematics, a “half-space” is defined as “either of the two parts into which a plane divides the three-dimensional Euclidean space.” Artist Erica Licea-Kane eloquently re-words the concept as “a mathematical term for checkerboarding,” which serves as the basis for her exhibit “Half Spaces” that was — prior to the pandemic — scheduled to show from Mar. 6 to Mar. 29 at the Kingston Gallery in the SoWa district of Boston.
Featuring five pieces and one diptych, the body of work resembles a collection of aerial urban views: while they look flat from afar, a closer look reveals their elaborate physical and visual texture. Licea-Kane’s artistic process starts with hardboards, or wood canvases, to which she affixes squares of balsa wood emblazoned with designs. The balsa serves as the understructure of the work, upon which she adds surfaces, realized by squeezing acrylic pigment out of a pastry bag.
The most basic unit of the pigment surfaces is the globule, and what makes “Half Spaces” so textured are the varied ways in which each globule interacts with those surrounding it. Some gather into a whole aggregate of globules, while others line up into groups of five to six to make small segments; some form into longer lines that span a whole work, and some into bounded boxes and polygons. Each of these collectives has its own set of interactions resulting in more sets of collectives. In this way, Licea-Kane plays with the relationship between individual unit and collective, where the former is one, but the latter is many. It urges viewers to think about this relationship more tenuously, where ideas of individuality and the threshold of collectivity are fluid. The works investigate the point at which the unit loses its individuality and becomes defined by something larger than itself, the point at which one system of collectives becomes more salient than another, as well as the point at which a collective form sheds the characteristics of the parts that make it up. Through the use of the pastry-bag-pigment technique as an operation, the works start with a definable unit that then grows to entertain an infinite number of forms and possibilities.
We can see the pieces as deconstructing the micro-macro dichotomy. There are not just two distinct scales of viewership, but rather a hundred different ways that can be seen at a hundred different distances from it. At the smallest level is the globule. At the largest is the whole piece. Just under that may be the grid system, evident in “Every Other,” or a singular element that traverses the whole work, like the orange line in “Up Over and Around.” Even as there may be controversy around which elements of a piece take on each distinct level along the microscopic to macroscopic spectrum, the works succeed in epitomizing the spectrum itself.
This lens of a macro-micro spectrum can guide analysis of the work, particularly for the concept of boundary. At the macro-level, the balsa squares are not positioned onto the hardwood canvas to create a neat four-sided rectangle, but are instead uneven and jut out from the canvas. Looking deeper, while some works take on a more orderly logic through rectilinear boundaries of color or pattern, others take on a levity through more irregular and curved sections like in “Just Under the Surface.” Approaching the micro-level, the concept of boundary is explored in the formation of lines, where the thickness, overlap or lack thereof, and gathering of lines onto each other relay different levels of rigor to the borders, as well as through the formation of color, where colors blend, accumulate, neutralize, or clash.
Licea-Kane plays with the concept of surface in a similar way. There are so many different layerings of pigment — and so many different pigment-pigment interactions in each layer — that the different surfaces of the work are difficult to cleanly separate. Still, there are surfaces that take a place closer to the foreground and those that are closer to the background, and in this way, the viewer obtains a sense of depth. For example, in “Squares in Fern,” there is a system of bounded boxes, each of which comprises an opening that one can peer into and see a multitude of deeper and deeper linear networks. The works play with hiding and revealing this depth, doing the former through excessive layering and parallel linework, and the latter through openings, which are sometimes broad rectilinear forms like in “Up Over and Around,” or open-top mounds like in “Checkerboard.”
Besides looking like top-down maps, “Half Spaces” also resembles textiles in many ways. The lines and edges of the pieces approximate weaving, the rectilinear sectioning parallels the inherent grids in fabrics, and we see similar practices of layering, visual and color transparencies, and a competition for attention. In fact, Licea-Kane spent her undergraduate and graduate years studying fine art textile. Through “Half Spaces,” she departs from textiles but draws heavily from them as she uses a different medium to bring new insight to the shared concepts. Through her works that are at once bounded and disordered, Licea-Kane simultaneously brings parts forward and pushes them away. She holds central the ambiguity of the individual, collective, boundaries, and surfaces — the ambiguity of space.

When her lead single “Don’t Start Now” came out last October, British singer Dua Lipa gave fans an exciting taste of what was to come on her sophomore album, “Future Nostalgia.” Now, a week ahead of schedule, the full product has finally arrived. The result is an unapologetic curation of funky, slinky, retro-inspired tracks, influenced by dance hits of the ’80s and early ’90s. With past hits “IDGAF” and “New Rules” under her belt, Lipa proved her talent for penning, as her one-time collaborator Mark Ronson put it, “sad bangers.” But “Future Nostalgia” proves that she can do much more, giving full display to Lipa’s wide musical range and killer songwriting instincts.

Title track “Future Nostalgia” sets the mood with heavy synths, electric sparks, and robotic beeps. Her lyrics read like a thesis for the rest of the album. They speak both to the empowerment of women and a desire to reinvent familiar tunes into a new sound altogether: “You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game / Like modern architecture, John Lautner coming your way,” Lipa sings. While the reference to a modernist American architect feels just a bit too highbrow for a club hit, the song’s disco-infused production speaks for itself.

The Glitzy, stylish breakup anthem “Don’t Start Now” quickly solidified itself as a pop staple last year, but many other songs from the album, particularly “Levitating” and “Break My Heart,” are sure to make their way to the top of the charts as well. Though each of the album’s tracks has a distinct sound, the songs are tied together by themes of growing love and female desire.

“Levitating” is full of electric ’90s house beats that build up gradually over the course of the song through layered synths. They form the perfect backdrop to Lipa’s rich, full-bodied voice. Her imaginative lyrics reach far beyond the confines of Earth, envisioning courtship in space: “If you wanna run away with me I know a galaxy / And I can take you for a ride.” The combination of effervescent beat and futurist imagery makes this song more emblematic of Lipa’s project than any other.

“Break My Heart” feels a little less Chaka Khan and a little more Madonna in her later years. The song is anchored by syncopated beats and strategic pauses that buoy the danceable rhythm. Its lyrics are catchy, fun, and lighthearted, with just the slightest hint of a potential danger. In the chorus she asks: “Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?” It’s a clever reminder that you can’t have love without heartbreak, giving the song just the right amount of self-aware edge.
Also noteworthy is the electric-pop track “Hallucinate,” which takes a page out of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” by anchoring the song to a compressed pulse. Lipa’s track is streamlined and yearning, eventually breaking out of its minimalism into an intensely pounding, climactic melody that just might earn her a seat up there with Summer.

“Love Again” cleverly samples 1997 hit song “Your Woman” — which itself borrows the original trumpet tune from “My Woman” by Lew Stone and the Monseigneur Band — while also bringing back the use of strings and adding a bit of guitar. It’s a swingy, instrumental affair that doesn’t dull in spite of its repetitiveness. The same can be said of the uber-sexy track “Pretty Please,” which plays with a slower tempo and staccato beats through a myriad of cowbells and synths.

Slightly less exciting are “Good in Bed,” an unabashed celebration of a relationship that balances atrocious communication with a great sex life, and the feminist track “Boys Will Be Boys.” Though both songs are worth listening to, they don’t have the same sleekness as the rest of the album. This is due less to each song’s individual production, and more to lyrics steeped in cliché. The chorus of “Good in Bed” tragically rhymes “bad,” “sad,” and “mad” as if this were a kindergarten lesson in learning how to read. And in “Boys Will Be Boys,” Lipa is a little too on the nose when she claims to sing the line “I know that there will be a man around to save the day” with “sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained.” These lyrics are too obvious to land right, especially given that they follow powerful opening lines that describe women’s need to be vigilant while walking home alone. With these earlier lines, Lipa gives voice to a universal, identifiable feeling — which more successfully captures elements of the experience of being a woman than lyrics dropping terms like “mansplained” ever could.

It feels silly not to address the elephant in the room: Dua Lipa is releasing this album in a world put on lockdown. Rumors identify potential leaks as the reason behind the move to release sooner. Whether this is true or not, we should be thankful. In a time of worldwide panic, certain economic collapse, and fear, “Future Nostalgia” isn’t just a distraction, but a genuine joy.

Much like “Despacito,” “13 Reasons Why,” and (for about two and a half minutes) “La La Land,” 2017 was a big year for “Little Fires Everywhere” — the book, that is. The novel, by author Celeste Ng, was named a best book of the year by Esquire, NPR, Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and Entertainment Weekly, won the Goodreads Readers’ Choice Award, and spent 48 weeks on the New York Times best seller list. It was only a matter of time before a network picked it up for a screen adaptation. That network was Hulu, who — following a multi-outlet bidding war — adapted the novel into an eight-episode miniseries.
With a novel like Ng’s — a 352-page spiderweb of intertwined plotlines that connects race, gender, motherhood, and class privilege in a beautiful bundle of tender, delectable prose — almost any screen adaptation is doomed to fall short. The show, to its credit, tries its best, remaining faithful to Ng’s plot and laying the groundwork for many of the same themes. It does so, however, without the nuance and care so integral to Ng’s success. Hulu’s adaptation reduces “Little Fires Everywhere” to the genre that we — in our original review of the book — commended Ng for avoiding: a “cheesy drama.”
“Shaker was built on the underlying philosophy by the founders that everything can and should be planned to avoid uncertainty and disaster,” reads the Shaker Heights welcome packet, and the queen of this idyllic suburbia is Elena Richardson (Reese Witherspoon). The Richardson family — Elena’s husband Bill (Joshua Jackson) and their four kids, Trip (Jordan Elsass), Lexie (Jade Pettyjohn), Moody (Gavin Lewis), and the unwaveringly rebellious Izzy (Megan Stott) — is enjoying a textbook suburban summer (i.e. trips to the pool, orchestra camp, etc.) when the Warren family arrives. Mia (Kerry Washington) and her daughter, Pearl are everything that the Richardsons aren’t. They shop at Goodwill. They eat leftover Chinese takeout. They’re Black (or, “African-American,” as Elena insists on saying because “Jesse Jackson says African-American, and he’s on television”). When Elena agrees to rent the Richardsons’ second property to the Warrens, the two families begin to collide, and the little fires everywhere begin to smolder.
It takes about six minutes for the viewer to realize the point that the show is making about race: Elena, and the white, suburban, upper-middle class demographic she represents, is oblivious to it. She calls the police on Mia for sleeping in her car; she chimes in, unprompted, that the high school was “one of the first schools integrated in the city”; Lexie (the mini-Elena) remarks about Pearl’s college prospects, “with all this affirmative action stuff, you’ll be a shoo-in anyways” — all before the second commercial break. This is, indeed, an important social commentary. “Well-intentioned white ladies” need to be challenged. The show, however, treats the issue with the subtlety of a large sledgehammer.
It seems like every five minutes, Elena says something utterly expected. “There are rules, and they exist for a reason. If you follow the rules, you’ll succeed,” she says while lecturing Izzy. “I’m just trying to raise nice children who do good in the world,” over coffee with her high school bestie, Linda. “It’s so much more fun when we plan it,” to her husband, who dares to suggest they have sex outside of the Wednesday/Saturday schedule. The writers, it seems, are afraid the viewers might forget Elena’s incorrigible suburban white-ness.
And elsewhere in Shaker, the tropes abound. Trip, the jock, has a different Jen on his arm in every scene. Lexie, the overachiever, declares, “I’m going to Yale,” before even applying. And, pigeonholed into these tropes, the acting suffers — characters deliver lines with a tone indistinguishable from scene to scene. Mia, it seems, has the same pained, awkward grimace on her face about 50 percent of the time.
Where the show slows down, where it delves into the uncertain — that’s where it shines: a particularly tender, wine-fueled heart-to-heart between Elena and Mia, a heated exchange on motherhood at a book club meeting. It is in these moments that the screenwriters reclaim the form and cadence of the book.
Much like the town it depicts, the show itself is carefully planned. Unobtrusive background elements develop into integral plot points. Major scenes draw strategically upon conversation snippets from throughout the episode. New characters seem only to trickle in, and plotlines unravel slowly and deliberately. Bebe Chow (Huang Lu), for example, appears in episode two as Mia’s coworker at the Lucky Palace; by the end of the three-episode premiere, she’s at the center of a heart-wrenching display of maternal anguish — layering an exploration of Asian identity on top of the story.
These thematic elements, however, are probably better credited to the source material. The show, again, stumbles in its portrayal: Bebe is depicted as a crying, emotional wreck, helpless and one-dimensional. An interesting question, then, emerges. Is this just a fundamental limitation of a medium? Is it inevitable that a TV adaptation will be less nuanced, less well-executed than its literary counterpart?
Though it has five episodes to go, “Little Fires Everywhere” seems to confirm this theory, and — unless it begins to deviate from its all-too-clear thesis — it will continue to do so.

It takes time to adjust to a new city. Every trip outside of the house is an adventure — street signs are unfamiliar, but also my saving grace. Neighbors are nameless, and I am too.
But when you move 12 times before you turn 18, adjusting to a new city becomes an expected challenge. If anything, I welcomed these unknowns and developed the ability to uproot easily before resettling someplace new.
I know how to pack all of my things into flimsy, cardboard boxes. I say “goodbye” to good friends more commonly than I’d like to admit. I introduce myself with a smile as a stranger often.
I’d like to think that I know how to start over by now. But I don’t always know the answer to a simple question, one that has followed me for years — where’s home?
***
The first year of college was described to me as the quintessential opportunity to start over.
Instead, college presented itself to me as a chance at stability. I’d had many opportunities in the past to define myself to my peers however I liked, but now with four years ahead of me, the possibilities in permanence seemed endless.
It was the first night of Opening Days, a time when all first-year students move in and adjust to campus life. In the whirlwind of hours before, I had set up my room, met my four roommates, negotiated how we were going to divide our overcrowded space, and said goodbye to my parents. Now, a group of nearly 40 first-year students sat in a circle and expected to introduce themselves.
Similar to most ice-breaker games, we had to find a connection to those around us. We needed to find someone else in the group hailing from a place near our hometown and later introduce one another to the larger group. This was supposed to be the easiest ice-breaker possible, but my mind still raced.
Growing up as a military kid, I lived in three countries and attended three high schools. But now that the circle had gotten up and begun to move, I needed to consider which card I was going to play. People were shouting out the names of cities, states, and countries. As people approached me, I sorted through a list of places in my mind: Vicenza, Heidelberg, Tacoma, Burke, Columbus, Fayetteville, and Tampa to name a few.
After being asked by another student in my dorm if I was from Europe, I told her I was born in Italy. I recognized that I wasn’t an international student, but I was her best option, and we decided to be partners.
I hadn’t created a hard and fast rule to answer the looming question. Is home where I was born? Or is it where I had lived the longest? Did I have a favorite?
I didn’t know how to answer the ice-breaker, but I could still begin to form life-long friendships — my blockmates were all in that game. Having lived across the United States, as well as overseas, I was able to connect with peers from Washington state to Washington, D.C., playing the game in my unique way.
***
I was running along the Charles when I first wrote the essay you are reading in my head.
At first, I thought I’d touch on how having grown up as a military child influences the way I perceive the world. I imagined sharing anecdotes of driving away from a city I loved and watching it disappear in the rearview mirror, or how I learned to use the cardboard boxes as sleds in a neighborhood-wide game.
My original piece ends with me looking out over the Boston skyline from my dorm room. I declare that I have found my home at Harvard. In the piece, I write about dancing to “Come on Eileen” in the middle of the night with the group of people who always bring a smile to my face, and the moment I met my blockmates for the first time. I talk about spontaneous adventures throughout Cambridge with a friend, and the productive (or not so productive) nights in Lamont Cafe that last until the early morning.
But that piece was written before COVID-19 began to wreak havoc across the globe. It was the piece I had in mind before we were notified of the University’s decision to send us home, for our safety and the safety of others.
***
Cardboard boxes filled the entirety of my dorm room. I didn’t hate the boxes, but they did remind me of the fact that I was leaving campus in a little over 12 hours.
Standing so my body faced the window of my room, I folded packing tape over the corner of the last flimsy, cardboard box. I’d already said “goodbye” to both of my suitemates. Anything normally associated with a living space in our suite — books, belongings, and even memories — was disguised by the boxes and packing tape.
The night prior, I helped one of my suitemates move her belongings from her room to her car. Before she left, I made sure my other suitemate was organized too. But now, with both of them gone, the room was eerily quiet.
The red light radiating from the alarm clock on my bedside table indicated that it was well past four a.m. I needed to be awake in a few hours, but instead I looked out the window at the Boston skyline. Packing that night (morning) was familiar, but nonetheless painful. I had always imagined what I could do with uninterrupted time — begin to forge lifelong friendships, find trusted mentors, memorize all the street names surrounding my place of residence, finally feel “in the know” — and college was supposed to provide those four years. The boxes, as they often did while I was growing up, meant the end had come too early.
The last few days at Harvard were long, filled with errands around campus, frantic emails, goodbyes, and lots of elbow bumping.
They were also reminders of how people come together when faced with uncertainty and fear.
Tutors and faculty deans swarmed the entrance to my house, surrounded with dollies and other moving supplies. Each time I walked past, they greeted me and other students with the simple but reassuring question, “How can I help?” Group chats and email chains exploded with offers of physical assistance, summer storage, and immediate emotional support. Faculty members offered to store students’ belongings in their offices. Alumni opened their checkbooks to donate to students.
Standing outside of the house gates, I watched as students shoved textbooks, large pieces of framed and unframed artwork, and other reminiscences of college into the backseats of overstuffed cars. For a few, only U-Hauls would suffice. In witnessing our collective attempt to hold onto as many aspects of college as possible, I considered how, in a few short days, a large portion of the student body would attempt to transform childhood bedrooms into adequate study spaces.
What does it mean to drop everything in a new-found home, and return to a familiar — yet distanced — house? For those staying with friends during this turbulent time, how can you sort through glimpses of someone’s past?
In going home, I left the potential stability of four uninterrupted years behind me. I was thankful for the chance to spend the next few months with family — especially my younger sister before she graduates high school. But I wasn’t returning home to my childhood bedroom, nor my birthplace.
***
In an effort to retain a sense of normalcy with family, I spread out my notebooks, papers, and pens across my desk in my own cluttered organization. But this set-up has a striking addition that catches my eye whenever I look up: my Italian birth announcement.
Translated to English, it reads, “May the City of Vicenza always pride itself on having been your Birthplace; may its illustrious name be always vivid in your memory and, as you grow in age and wisdom, may it call you back to admire the magnificence of its Art, the beauty of its countryside, and the hospitable heart of its people.”
My life started nearly 20 years ago in the northeastern city of Vicenza, Italy.
When my family visited the country for the first time since we had left, my parents made an effort to show me some of the city’s most important sights. We toured Teatro Olimpico and walked past Villa La Rotonda. My dad and I ran to Monte Berico. We drank cappuccinos and embraced the warm, social atmosphere around us in the city’s square, Piazza dei Signori. Vicenza certainly was a beautiful city, and I admired its art, the beauty of its countryside, and the heart of its people.
My parents also pointed out the hospital where I was born.
When I look up from my work, I read the annoucement’s words first in my broken Italian, then in English. Reading those words today, my heart goes out to the hospital and healthcare providers working around the clock as they try to save their people and their city from an illness with a mortality rate over ten percent. I remember a people known for their allegria (cheerfulness) in the face of a grim virus leaving destruction in its wake. I think of Vicenza, and I wish I could do more to help.
For many, birthplace and home are synonyms. I find it ironic how they line up next to each other in a thesaurus — for me, those two words pose a paradox begging to be solved.
If home is at Harvard, it has been upended — almost nobody is there, and those who remain are isolated on an emptied-out campus. And if home is supposed to be where I was born and raised, I’m not there, either.
***
Growing up, my home was never a house. Rather than defining it in a set place, I have learned to search for it in the people and experiences around me.
I formed it in the rush of heading somewhere else and meeting new people. I saw it at the dinner table with my family. I experienced it in the conversations with professors and teaching fellows who made me feel that I belonged at Harvard. I felt it in the friendships I hope last beyond our graduation. I found it in the places where I feel most loved.
Where’s home? For now, it’s right here.

“I remember the first time I saw a cairn,” Favia C. Dubyk ’09 recalls. She remembers asking herself: “Why is there a stack of rocks out here in the woods?” Dubyk was in the backcountry, on her first hike with some friends she met at her climbing gym. One of her companions explained that what she was looking at was a cairn, which mark trails and keep hikers from getting lost. Today, Dubyk is another kind of guide to the wilderness, an advocate to make the outdoors more inclusive and accessible to all.
Dubyk wasn’t always interested in the outdoors. She was born in Durham, N.C., where she lived for seven years before moving to Nashville, Tenn. At the time, her mother was a graduate student at Vanderbilt University, and the two of them moved into on-campus family housing.
When her mother was unable to find a babysitter, she would take Dubyk with her to class and occasionally to her lab on the weekends. Growing up around the “brain neural labs of Vanderbilt,” Dubyk considered pursuing higher education to be “an assumed thing.”
In a high school science fair project, Dubyk found that the arsenic levels in her town’s drinking water exceeded EPA guidelines. This, combined with her childhood experiences in her mom’s lab, encouraged Dubyk to pursue a concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy at Harvard.
Dubyk kept busy while at Harvard, a member of both the Black Students Association and Unite for Sight, an organization which helped conduct eye tests and distribute glasses to communities with barriers to accessing eyecare. But Harvard’s Track and Field team was her most significant extracurricular commitment.
Despite studying ESPP and setting a school record for the 100 meter sprint, Dubyk remembers that during college, she was far from a fan of the rugged outdoors. “You will not catch me outside. I like[d] being inside and air-conditioned,” she says. Her fondness for exploring the wilderness didn’t develop until graduate school, when she joined a climbing gym.
One day, another member of her gym approached her about joining an outdoor climbing trip. “What is this outside you speak of? But sure, take me there,” she recalls thinking.
Initially, she felt out of place climbing outdoors. Dubyk remembers receiving a lot of ridicule because “some people didn’t understand why I was afraid of the things I was afraid of. Because for them, these are just things that exist in nature. But for me, it was overwhelming.”
Dubyk vividly remembers the fears that dominated her first few climbing excursions: the spider that lurked in a climbing handhold, the pitch-black nights. She remembers that the first time she had to pee in the woods at night, “my friend had to hold my hand.”
While Dubyk soon found her footing in the backcountry, she faced another major obstacle: a diagnosis of advanced-stage lymphoma.
She had identified as an athlete for her whole life. “That was where I got most of my self-confidence from,” she explains. But illness and chemotherapy made her lose the strength she had so identified with.. Yet she was determined to come back from her illness stronger, both physically and mentally.
Now, she says, she’s not afraid of very many things: “I do not let fear dictate my life. I say yes.”
As a current pathology resident at the University of New Mexico, Dubyk explains that she has "so much life in my hands all day every day.” She appreciates climbing as an outlet separate from the intensity of her day job.
In some forms of climbing, climbers are supported by ropes and other climbers. But in bouldering — the variation of climbing Dubyk prefers — a climber does not have any support from ropes or harnesses. While bouldering, Dubyk isn’t responsible for the life of another climber at the other end of a rope. She can relax and focus on just reaching the top.
Dubyk is a firm believer in the importance of community and mentorship when introducing people to the outdoors.
“It is crucial, and it’s dangerous out there!” she explains. Community can serve as a “guide,” she says, city rules “don't quite apply in the woods.” Rock climbing specifically is “inherently dangerous if you don’t have some mentor to show you exactly what to do,” she says.
Having a mentor can remove some barriers to outdoor sports participation, even those outside the realm of safety, like cost. The first time Dubyk went climbing, she ended up spending thousands of dollars on equipment. A mentor, she explains, could loan a new climber gear and prevent them from having to spend what is essentially an entry fee.
For people of color, cost is not the only barrier to the outdoors, Dubyk says: There is a perception that it is only white people who participate in these sports. As part of her dissertation, Carolyn Finney, a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College, found that only 103 people out of 4,602 included in photos from Outside Magazine were African American.
As a black woman, Dubyk explains that she is sometimes assumed to be a novice climber, despite her clear experience. “Racism doesn’t stop in these sports,” she says.
Dubyk’s mission to get more people into the outdoors is intertwined with an effort to overcome these misperceptions about people of color and the outdoors. She is a featured athlete with Melanin Basecamp, an organization founded by Danielle Willams ’08, which seeks to “increase the visibility of adventure athletes of color.” Dubyk blogs about her experiences as a climber of color on Melanin Basecamp’s website, which, she explains, helps to foster inclusive spaces online for people of color in the outdoors community.
“If you’re new to a place and there with your male climbing partner,” she begins in a paragraph on her Melanin Basecamp profile, “people might only ask the man for beta but not the girl.” Beta is information on the routes one could take when scaling a face, whether it be outdoors on a real boulder or inside the gym.
Dubyk says she finds a particular comfort in sharing her stories online. Oftentimes, she doesn’t have to “explain why [an experience] I endured is racist; I just tell them the story and they’re supportive. I don’t have to defend myself.”
“When you see someone who kind of looks like you, you think, ‘Oh, I could do that, too,’” Dubyk says. Growing up, she idolized Dominique Dawes, an African American gymnast, and had aspirations to follow in her footsteps.
“If young girls and boys can have that type of role model in other sports, it can open a whole new world to them,” Dubyk explains.
Perhaps Dubyk will now be a visible role model for many young kids today; she was on back-to-back seasons of American Ninja Warrior in 2018 and 2019, has her own climbing blog, is an ambassador for the outdoors brand La Sportiva, and posts climbing content for her more than 8,000 Instagram followers.
And from her first trip into the backcountry, Dubyk knows just how important having a guide can be: “If someone doesn't explain to you what that stack of rocks means, you could get lost out there.”

In recent weeks, the Boston sun has often yet to rise when Doctor Ofer Levy arrives at the lab each morning at five or six a.m. But rarely does he enter an empty workplace — instead, he typically finds that the lab is already abuzz with scientists who have been there since three or four a.m.
Levy is no stranger to challenges. However, his lab now faces one of the most urgent and difficult challenges of his scientific career: finding a vaccine for coronavirus.
Levy grew up surrounded by science. “My grandfather used to take me hunting for fossils in southern Israel in the Negev Desert when I was a little boy,” he recalls. His uncle was a poet, artist, and hematologist. “[He] got me interested in blood coagulation research,” Levy explains.
Levy studied molecular biology as an undergraduate at Yale, then went to medical school at NYU. There, he investigated how the immune system changes with age — and also met his wife, who was studying pediatrics.
As he got to know her and her pediatrician friends, he grew impressed. “I was like, ‘These people are just great,’” Levy remembers. He decided to become a pediatrician, a shock to many of his peers who expected an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate like himself to follow the more traditional path of becoming an internist.
Levy is now the director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, which he describes as a “platform to enhance collaboration between academia, government, and industry to accelerate the development of next generation vaccines.” Precision medicine is a relatively new field which tailors treatments for the characteristics of specific patients. The Precision Vaccines Program tailors vaccines for children and the elderly, the two populations most susceptible to infectious diseases.
“Infections are most common and most severe at the extremes of life,” he says. Coronavirus is particularly lethal for the elderly, so Levy has shifted his attention from the youngest extreme to the oldest.
The Precision Vaccines Program has been working on a solution that could strengthen these groups’ immune response using something called adjuvants. Adjuvants are compounds added to a vaccine that are unrelated to the virus itself but help patients respond better to the vaccine. Adjuvants also broaden the immune response and lower the costs of vaccines, Levy explains.
The Adjuvant Discovery Program, a project in Levy’s lab led by Doctor David J. Dowling, has focused its efforts on finding an adjuvanted vaccine for coronavirus. “David and I have had a longstanding interest in identifying adjuvants and developing them to create adjuvanted vaccines to protect vulnerable populations like the very young, and now we’re focusing on the elderly for obvious reasons,” Levy says, referring to the higher mortality rate of COVID-19 among elderly populations.
Levy doesn’t say when a coronavirus vaccine will be produced, but he seems optimistic about the progress being made around the world. “It’s going to be a gradual process,” he says, “but it’s already begun.”
Still, the crisis makes him concerned about growing nationalist sentiments in an increasingly globalized world. “If there’s anything that COVID teaches us, [it’s] that viruses don't respect borders,” he says.
Levy predicts that there will be a spectrum of reactions to the pandemic once it is over, ranging from demands for stricter border controls to calls for increased global cooperation. He hopes that the public doesn’t forget the crisis, but instead strengthens its dedication to public health, research, and vaccine development to prepare for future pandemics. He warns, “The next one is just around the corner.”
Levy advises readers to listen to the public health guidelines, particularly in handwashing and social distancing.
“[People] should focus on what they are allowed to do, not on what they’re not allowed to do. Connect with their families,” Levy says. “Protect one another in the community by following the public health guidelines that are being issued.”
Coming in early each morning and seeing his co-workers’ sacrifices makes Levy hopeful. He smiles, saying, “People have really stepped up to work hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scores of entrepreneurs currently and formerly affiliated with the Harvard Innovation Labs have dived into projects combating the COVID-19 outbreak over the last few months.
Taking charge of the i-Lab just one day before Harvard announced it would send students home, newly-appointed executive director Matthew M. Segneri ’04 said the i-Lab was making arrangements to shift support for its ventures in the virtual sphere.
Segneri said i-Lab staff held “preparatory Zoom meetings” to start the transition early. Batten Hall, where the iLabs is located, closed on March 23. Only the biotech-focused Life Lab, operating on a “business-critical basis,” would keep its doors open, according to Segneri.
Despite what Segneri described as a transition that has “gone quite smoothly,” the ventures have seen mixed results, with success often pre-determined by the industries they serve.
La’Toya P. Jackson, founder of LaPrincess Entertainment and former Harvard MLA student, said in an interview that all the programming her company normally does has been shot. The company was set to premiere a ballet on April 10, but with all dance studios closed, Jackson said she currently cannot generate income.
Some ventures that already operate virtually have made a more seamless transition in recent weeks. June Motherhood, an online maternal care company that grew out of Harvard Business School, has expanded its group class offerings because of the pandemic. Its support classes — including a new option specifically tailored to COVID-19 — have been “more or less completely sold out,” according to co-founder Kristina Beilinson.
Michael Sheeley, co-founder of Nurse-1-1, a platform that lets nearly 1,000 nurses chat with concerned healthcare seekers, said his team has been working to maintain and expand the software’s reach.
“The [nurses'] ability to step up when a crisis like this happens is like none other,” Sheeley said.
While the coronavirus pandemic is stressing hospital resources and upending the economy, many ventures have rapidly — and unconventionally — adapted to fill gaps in the system.
Shuhan He, a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School, founded GetUsPPE, a national matching service for those looking to donate personal protective equipment and the hospitals that need it.
As cases of the novel coronavirus rise nationally, the shortage of equipment worsens. According to He, it takes 17 pieces of PPE on average to treat one COVID-19 patient. His goal is to “triage” the gear to the neediest or most appropriate hospitals in an expanding network.
Others have envisioned less transient initiatives capitalizing on the outbreak.
Buoy Health, a company founded by Andrew Q. Le ’10, acts as an “AI front door” to telemedicine, Le said, narrowing down symptoms to diagnoses and to healthcare providers.
“Healthcare is this very unique industry where the consumer — the patient — doesn’t really know what they should be buying,” Le said.
After a sleepless “11 day sprint” at the company, according to Le, the team baked the CDC’s coronavirus guidelines into the program to help advise those worried about symptoms on next steps.
Since then, Le said Buoy Health has gleaned insights into coronavirus’s spread from its roughly eight million users. By monitoring self-reported symptom data, the team could track the real-time spread of coronavirus before the cases were officially confirmed.
Harvard ventures have had to directly innovate in the hospital as well.
David M. Raiser said his team at Aldatu Biosciences has “never been busier,” spending the last few months developing a COVID-19 testing kit which has since been deployed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Another company, Kinnos, produces Highlight — a disinfectant additive that temporarily colorizes surfaces or PPE so users can visually confirm they have been sanitized — was first used in 2014, during the ebola outbreak in West Africa.
It’s been hard to keep up with demand, according to Tyan. As the outbreak exponentially grew in Wuhan, China, Kinnos started “receiving tons of orders from Chinese hospitals,” Kevin Tyan, one of the company’s co-founders, said.
Segneri said that just as it’s necessary for public officials and healthcare providers to step up to the plate, entrepreneurs and innovators need to not only think “through this crisis” but also “beyond, into what the other side looks like.”
“Expertise is essential in a time of crisis,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge announced Friday it would establish a temporary moratorium on eviction enforcement for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.
The order bans owners of residential and commercial properties from evicting residents and from entering their tenants’ homes for “non-essential purposes” in an attempt to mitigate spread of the disease.
“We need residents to stay home and prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in a joint statement released Friday. “In order to comply, residents must have a place to call home. Evicting residents and commercial tenants during this time would go against our public health priorities and our decency as a community during a public health crisis.”
The order does not bar property owners from filing eviction actions. Rather, it bans them from executing forcible evictions until the end of the public health crisis.
“I think that it was absolutely the right move,” Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said in an interview Friday. “This is obviously a very difficult time medically, but it’s an incredibly difficult time economically for people as well, and so this was the right thing to do.”
The announcement came after the City Council passed a measure earlier this week urging city landlords to halt evictions and freeze rent, but did not mandate that they do so. McGovern, who was the lead sponsor of the effort, said the Council did not have the authority to unilaterally mandate an evictions moratorium. He said state rules would require an emergency order from the Public Health Department and the city manager in order to enforce the policy.
Harvard — which owns 61 properties around Cambridge and Boston — had already halted eviction proceedings for its tenants.
The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution Monday that called on the state and federal government to enact eviction moratoriums on a broader scale. The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a measure earlier this week that, if enacted, would block most court-ordered evictions in the state.
McGovern, the former mayor of Cambridge, said he thinks the city has responded well, despite being in “unchartered waters.”
“I think it’s frustrating for everybody that we’re not quite as nimble or as flexible as we would like to be in a crisis like this,” he said. “But people are working incredibly hard to do everything that they can to move things along as quickly as we can.”

On March 10, Harvard College students woke to an email from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana informing them that they had five days to move off-campus due to concerns about COVID-19, the novel coronavirus sweeping across the globe. The same day, Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 declared a state of emergency. In under a week, thousands of students evacuated Cambridge. Beginning on March 17, restaurants could only be open for take-out and delivery and all gatherings of more than 25 people were banned. On March 23, a stay at home advisory urged residents to stay home unless performing essential activities. A day later, two weeks after announcing the closure of undergraduate dorms, University President Lawrence S. Bacow informed the community that he and his wife Adele F. Bacow had tested positive for COVID-19.
In just a few short weeks, Cambridge has transformed from a bustling city to a ghost-town in order to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The Crimson's photographers sought to capture that new reality.
On a warm spring day, Harvard Yard is usually filled with tour groups waiting for a turn to rub John Harvard’s foot and students anxiously racing to midterms.
The Yard is now empty, populated only by the occasional runner or dog walker practicing social distancing and wildlife.
The Science Center Plaza, usually swarming with students and food trucks, is similarly bare.
An announcement board typically covered with flyers advertising on-campus events stands barren in Tercentenary Theater.
Among the many buildings with closed notices taped to their doors is Lamont Library. The University announced all libraries would close in-print services on March 16.
Harvard Square is also nearly silent. The Smith Campus Center is closed.
Tasty Burger is one of the restaurants in the square that closed completely. A notice on the door informed customers that all Tasty Burger locations would close starting March 16. Next-door, El Jefe’s Taqueria remains open for take-out and delivery.
The paths along the Charles River remain popular with runners and bikers. Though people are urged to keep their distance from others, outdoor exercise is permitted under current guidelines.
Elsewhere in Cambridge, the streets are empty. Massachusetts Avenue is uncharacteristically quiet near Porter Square.
Dunkin Donuts in Porter Square is one of the restaurants that has remained open for pick-up. On the store window, a sign translated into seven languages urges people to wash their hands. The Porter Square Shopping Center is one of the busier places in Cambridge as people stock up on groceries at Star Market.
A shopper surveys Target’s grain options in Central Square. In Cambridge and beyond, increased demand for home essentials has stripped grocery store shelves faster than workers can restock. Stores around Harvard — including CVS, Target, and HMart — have imposed per-customer limits on some non-perishable food items and cleaning supplies.
Employees at Bertucci's in Kendall Square prepare meals for take-out and delivery. The restaurant has closed dine-in spaces in compliance with Massachusetts’s stay-at-home advisory.
Just a month ago, students roamed the campus, occupying their days with a variety of academics, extracurriculars, and social experiences. However, with the transition to remote learning and mass evacuation of campus, students are scattered across the world. As the coronavirus pandemic makes new headlines every day, Cambridge remains still, almost frozen in time.
