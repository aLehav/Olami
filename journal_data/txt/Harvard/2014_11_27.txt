After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you are one of the lucky ones, you have glimpsed a turkey walking around Harvard’s campus, totally out of place but strutting its stuff nonetheless. Turkeys have long graced the North American wilderness, but there’s a reason tourists and students routinely stop to photograph them: It’s rare to spot a wild turkey because the majority of turkeys are now raised in factory farms, without ever having seen the light of day. The Harvard turkey is, therefore, among the luckiest of its kinsmen.
Each year, a whopping 46 million turkeys are killed for Thanksgiving celebrations. Unlike wild turkeys that are free to roam, forage, and live their lives naturally, these turkeys have been through the worst types of cruelty imaginable.
Industrial animal farms—or factory farms—house as many as 10,000 birds in one building. Turkeys remain in these facilities for about 99 days (for hens) or 136 days (for toms), according to Farm Sanctuary. During this time, their lives are a living hell.
They are fed antibiotics and hormones that have led the weight of the average turkey to increase by 57% from 1965 to 2000. These growth patterns cause crippling leg deformities, hip joint lesions, and bone defects that prevent them from walking. Due to the crowded conditions, turkeys often have their beaks and toes removed at a young age so they don’t damage other turkeys’ flesh and reduce their marketability. This procedure involves use of a hot blade or shears to cut off part of the nerve-sensitive beak or toe, without using pain reliever or anesthetic, according to Farm Sanctuary.
The treatment these turkeys receive from workers only adds to their misery. Workers have been documented kicking and stomping turkeys, draging them by their wings and necks, and routinely subjecting them to other forms of cruelty. Butterball, the company that produces 30 percent of these 46 million turkeys, has been cited the past two years for egregious animal cruelty—but these fines they’ve paid are nominal and won’t prevent them from continuing to inflict the same type of treatment this year. In fact, there isn’t a federal law that regulates the treatment of turkeys during slaughter. Because the Humane Slaughter Act excludes both chickens and turkeys, which make up over 90 percent of the animals killed in the United States each year, producers are allowed to kill these birds in any way they choose. The typical process involves hanging them upside down by their legs, dunking them into electrified water, slitting their throats, and finally dunking them into scalding hot water to de-feather them, often before they are dead.
This year, I encourage you to fill your plate with all of the other delicious Thanksgiving options (mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, roasted brussel sprouts, candied yams, etc.) and leave turkey off. All of these delicious foods, any many more, can be eaten while knowing that no animal suffering contributed to your food coma!

I roll out of bed at 8:45 on game day (you know, The Game), ready to document the event for posterity. First stop: the pancake breakfast in Annenberg to meet up with my fellow game-day warriors. We then head to a sad pregame in a freshman dorm. The theme of the pregame is “Too Many Cooks.” Libations are poured to Smarf, the picaresque anti-hero of the 11 minute video. I’m offered some alcohol. I don’t take it for reasons of journalistic integrity, obviously.
After the group has consumed enough diluted cheap vodka, we venture out to join the river of people crossing the Charles towards the stadium. Humanity, it seems, imitates nature, which imitates water. Unfortunately, humans are a lot denser. We finally arrive at the tailgate at the tennis courts. This. Is. It. The final frontier of new journalism. Pay attention, Bezos.
We take a lap around the courts to drink in the atmosphere. Shockingly, that’s not the only form of drinking that’s going on. It becomes clear that we have stumbled into a den of sin. Disgusted by the debauchery of the tennis courts, we venture over to the club tailgates near the cars. We pass the porta-potties on the way, which only makes us feel a stronger degree of disgust.
Perhaps inspired by the innovative spirit and entrepreneurial drive of the i-Lab, just a stone’s throw from the stadium, a man explores new frontiers of urination by peeing in between two porta-potties as opposed to inside one. Top stuff.
The club and alumni tailgates are similarly debauched. With our puritan sensibilities offended and kick-off time fast approaching, we join the throng of people entering the stadium.
Maybe it was all the journalistic integrity from earlier, but as I walk into the stadium I realize that I could use a little nap, and maybe a trip to the porta-potties. It seems this thought has struck a lot of people by now.
One heroine decides she’s not waiting for Harvard to provide more nap spaces on campus. In a Herculean gesture of immense civil disobedience, she takes napping into her own hands for much of the 1st quarter. A nap-based protest of these proportions hasn’t been seen since “Nap Attack!” took Harvard by storm. I snap a picture for journalism. If you’re reading this President Faust, enough is enough. The students have spoken. In their sleep.
A football crowd is like a pointillist painting (in the world of journalism, we call what I just did a “simile”). When you look at it from far away, it seems coherent: tons of people cheering for a common cause. It’s only when you look at, or in this case, hear, the individual components of the crowd, that it becomes absurd as a whole. If you don’t believe me, take a look at some of the phrases yelled out by the intoxicated fans:
“And, I’m not a hussy by any means.”
– A woman in the row in front of us, describing a chance encounter with a gentleman the previous night.
“You’ll know Taylor Swift is done when when she releases an amazing Christmas album.”
-A burly man holding a “Rolling Rock,” grunting angrily.
“I wish I had gone to a football school.”
– A sad, sad man just before the kickoff. After saying this, he stared down into his PBR, finished it, and let out a tragic sigh.
Overwhelmed, I take a trip to the bathroom. The walls of the men’s room are lined with urinals. As I wait in line I notice four women partway up the line into the men’s room. After a while, one of them turns to a similarly female companion and asks, “Wait…Is this not the women’s bathroom?”
Unbeknownst to many of the drunken fans, a football game was happening at the same time as their brisk outdoor party. On an auditory backdrop of “Fuck Yale!” and “Yale sucks!” the Harvard team pulls off an incredibly close win.
Like our Snapchat filter, much of the day has faded away: the thousands of PBRs, the numbness in our toes, and Yale’s misinformed optimism. What remains is the feeling produced as the students storm the field, gingerly lowering themselves down the stadium walls and then dropping with the grace of a sack of flour: the once-a-year magic of the whole school being pulled together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fritzi Reuter ’14 has been named one of two winners of the 2015 Rhodes Scholarship for Germany, the Rhodes Foundation announced this week.
The former Lowell House resident will study at Oxford next fall and plans to pursue an M.Phil in economics.
She joins two current undergraduates, Ruth C. Fong ’15 and Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15, who are both American, in winning the prestigious award this year. Reuter, who found out that she was receiving the award last Friday, expressed gratitude to her professors, friends, and family in a phone interview on Tuesday.
“What I would like to emphasize most is just I’m incredibly grateful for my experience and education at Harvard, for all my supporters and mentors,” she said. “[It] wouldn’t have been possible without the support of many people.”
Reuter’s research adviser, Economics professor Claudia Goldin, said she was not surprised to hear that Reuter won the scholarship.
“[Reuter] is an extraordinary student, a personable individual, a quick learner, and a dedicated researcher,” she wrote in an email. “Superlatives are all I can use to describe her. She is brilliant, mature, intelligent, poised, articulate and wise beyond her years.”
According to her Rhodes biography, since graduating from Harvard, Reuter has worked on expert testimony in litigation at Cornerstone Research, an economic consulting firm. Under the guidance of Economics professor Lawrence F. Katz, she wrote her senior thesis on the long-term impact of graduating from high school in a poor labor market. Reuter also served as a Peer Advising Fellow and played golf for the varsity women’s team.
Several months after graduation, Reuter said still feels a strong connection to Lowell House.
“When I think of Harvard a lot of my memories are from my time at Lowell,” she said. “[When I found out that I won] I emailed [my blockmates] immediately, basically, writing, ‘I got the Rhodes,’ in the subject line. I got responses back, saying that that was a killer subject line.”
