After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sexual assault could happen at any university, to any student. The Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s latest production, “Oleanna,” which centers on a contentious dispute that spirals into accusations of sexual harassment between a student and her professor, has proven that this theatrical company does not shy away from controversial material. The play, a two-person performance written by David Mamet—who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984—David Mamet and directed by Rachel V. Byrd ’13, is an emotionally charged meditation on the value of higher education and the reversibility of power. While “Oleanna” gains a great deal of charisma from the performances of its two leads, Anna A. Hagen ’15, and Ronald N. Lacey, its weakness lies in a sense of stagnation as at times the production seems at times overly long and slow to develop.
Hagen’s character Carol comes to her professor’s office to protest a failing grade; she has read his book and done all that he asks, but in spite of this she is not able to succeed academically. What begins as a routine academic conversation descends into a testy confrontation about the merits of the higher education system and the pursuit of power.
Winthrop House Library—a stuffy yet dignified room lined with leather-bound books that conjure up a sense of “old Harvard”—is a fitting setting for a play that raises questions about privilege and elitism at college.
What begins as a purely academic conversation between John (Ronald N. Lacey) and his student Carol evolves over the course of the play into a vicious power-play between master and pupil. The identities and motivations of these two characters are revealed and made more complex as the conflict between them escalates to the shattering conclusion.  “Oleanna” dramatizes a conflict in which it is difficult to take sides; both characters act in questionable ways in what is revealed to be a raw struggle for control.
Hagen and Lacey shine in the roles of two opponents locked in a thick intellectual debate. Lacey effectively conveys the John’s lofty professorial attitude: the academic empathizes with his struggling student but is nevertheless consumed by more urgent personal and professional concerns. He struts back and forth in front of the audience, imbuing Mamet’s script with a perfectly dislikable superiority. Lacey delivers his lines in a sharp and condescending tone that emphasizes the power dynamics between the student and professor. For example, he belittles all of Carol’s diligent note-taking in his class as a way of questioning her academic chops. “Are you checking your notes?” Lacey scornfully asks, before telling her in a critical manner, “[that] which we wish to retain is retained oftentimes, I think, better with less expenditure of effort.”
Hagen’s performance reflects a high level of artistic maturity. She convincingly conveys her character’s transformation from cowering youth to self-assured and confident plaintiff through an imaginative use of her own physicality. For example, at the beginning she clutches the chair she is sitting on and leans away from Lacey. However, by the end of the play she is standing and confidently addressing, even condemning, her formerly dominant professor.
Shifts in power and authority that take place throughout the performance are subtly highlighted by Byrd’s directorial choices. She visually represents the character’s strengths and weaknesses through their physical position relative to each other, and this staging changes as the power dynamics in the play evolve. For example, at one point in the beginning Lacey towers over his student in a physical manifestation of his domineering attitude. There is even a moment where Lacey tries to forcibly make Hagen sit down. However as the show continues, Hagen stands and claims her own personal agency.
The HRDC’s production of Mamet’s script leaves considerable room for the audience to interpret every line of dialogue. With limited set changes, dramatic pauses between spoken parts, and an already dense and cerebral story-line, the show sometimes descends into frustrating stagnation. For example, there are several scenes where John’s lectures to Carol are followed by moments of silence, or where a similar idea is repeated in an repetitive manner by the cast. In spite of its somewhat slow pace, HRDC’s latest play is a thought-provoking criticism that provides a bitter exposé of the sexism and power dynamics present in some of our most lauded academic institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“White. A blank page or a canvas. The challenge: bring order to the whole.” As Georges Seurat (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) voices his thoughts in Stephen Sondheim’s 1984 musical “Sunday in the Park with George, the set itself comes to life as his work of art through the use of large panels that act as projector screens. Animations are projected onto these panels—which form the backdrop of the set—and show the development of Seurat’s masterpiece, “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jette” from a penciled sketch to the brilliantly colored final product. Directed by Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and running from March 30 to April 7 at the Loeb Mainstage, Stephen Sondheim’s charming musical dazzles with a stunning cast and sharp execution of the score. Though at times the visuals projected on the panels distracts from the acting, the musical still serves as a stunning combination of theatrical and visual art that serves as an invitation to examine the lives of the people in the painting more closely.
The play is based on Seurat’s most famous image of Parisians promenading in the Park. The painting’s significance lies in his daring break away from the more fluid stroke work of the Impressionists. He developed a novel technique known as Pointillism, in which the painting is made up of thousands of tiny painted dots. In “Sunday in the Park with George” Act I focused on Georges Seurat and the background behind the painting’s development, while Act II is set in the present day and follows George (also played by Mauriello), a descendent of Seurat’s, who is a young artist trying to reconnect with his own artwork and find new inspiration.
Mauriello is endearing as he skillfully portrays the intense obsession of an artist who is both immensely talented and socially isolated. With furrowed brows and his omnipresent sketchbook, George’s mad obsession with perfection is palpably felt in the musical number “The Day Off,” in which he voices his thoughts about painting a dog. He tries so hard to connect with his model that he rolls on the ground, yapping like a puppy. The orchestra provided fitting accompaniment to the action on stage. For example, it played crisp musical staccato beats in scenes of Seurat painting his dots, underscoring a tense desire for precision in his work.
Mauriello’s role as an isolated, obsessive artist is beautifully complemented by Dot (Kyla N. Haggerty ’13), his muse and long-time girlfriend. Haggerty lights up the stage as she melds frustration with tender admissions of love. For example, in the opening number, “Sunday in the Park with George”, she deconstructs the idyllic image of a Sunday in a Parisian park with a barely perceptible sense of grief. She complains about how “a trickle of sweat” or a wet petticoat would make a promenade very uncomfortable. Her frustrations about spending her Sundays in the park with her boyfriend serve as metaphors for her frustrations about her love for George and his inattentiveness. She sustains her strong performance as the elderly Marie—Suerat’s illegitimate daughter—in Act II. Even when putting on a scratchy and raspy voice, she sings with a delicate vulnerability that allows her acting and singing skills to carry through.
One of the show’s most intriguing aspects is the set design. Relying heavily on technology, the show skillfully treats the backdrop as Georges’ canvas, and the changes of color and composition accentuate his thought process. However, the experimental visual elements are hit-and-miss. In Act II, the use of animation projected on the panels adds an ingenious life-like quality as the figures communicated with each other on the canvas. Visual effects also lend Act II more weight as it enhances George’s own artistic endeavors. At times, however, this  reliance on animation becomes excessive and distracts from the quality of the acting. For example, when Mauriello and Haggerty beautifully sing a duet, “We Do Not Belong Together,” after their breakup, animations of their sketched figures dancing in the background serves more to distract than to complement their delicate, heart-wrenching performances.
Despite the occasional misuse of the projectors, “Sunday in the Park with George” still impresses with its strong execution and  set design. It is a musical that underscores the use of art as a metaphor for life, and the pursuit of a sense of balance in life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our nation is experiencing something that is devastatingly common, and yet, still peculiar: the use of a black man’s racial identity to justify his murder. In light of the killing of Trayvon Martin at the end of February, the strength and variety of cries for justice have stirred our hearts and widened our eyes to the battery and bruising of our pervasive, racist American narrative. From the evidence that has been given to the public, it seems that this young man was pursued by George Zimmerman, his killer, for nothing more than the color of his skin and the clothing that draped his 17 year-old body. Since the evening of February 26th, when evening Sanford police sent narcotics officers to the site of the homicide, fictitious racial assumptions have run rampant on and off the air. As the media began to defame Trayvon’s name, perpetuating and encouraging racist thought, so began the character assassination of our just America.
Despite sentiments circulating on the internet, it is not good journalism to report on contestable aspects of Martin’s perceived character. To the contrary, this type of writing and “reporting” is more in keeping with the tradition of cheap sensationalism that has become such a prominent part of American culture. After a comparatively light response to Martin’s death, portions of the right wing began to weigh in on his character. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin and her team posted a photograph on her website that allegedly portrayed young Trayvon Martin. In the image, a shirtless young African American boy with his shorts sagging below his waist casts his middle fingers to the camera.
It goes without saying that this image is troubling in more ways than one. To begin with, it has been confirmed that the photograph is indeed not of Trayvon Martin. It seems that Malkin either could not differentiate between two black faces or intentionally decided to project a false representation of the slain teenager. Unfortunately, Malkin’s contribution to the greater smear campaign only reveals the surface of racist thought in America. Perhaps, what is more heinous is the notion that the coloring of Martin as a budding gangster could justify his murder or mitigate the devastating weight of racial profiling in this case.
As an African American, or rather as an American citizen, I am forced to ask a horrifying question. What are the intentions of these besmirchers? How can the presentation of such attacks on Martin’s character at all contribute to exercise of justice? And furthermore, what does entertaining such narrow-minded conceptions of racial identity really say about the progressive nature of what some are quick to call “post-racial” America? Now, as his compromising tweets and actual photographs are presented as evidence for his less than innocent life, the persistent focus on determining his moral character through such a superficial presentation of his identity shows the standards by which the public is expected to determine Martin’s worth.
In the past week alone, I have been bombarded with upsetting reports presenting proponents of Trayvon Martin’s African American identity as explanations for Zimmerman’s confusion, when in reality, the implications of his “blackness” should play no determining factor in assessing the mitigating circumstances. Zimmerman had no way of seeing these images and tweets prior to his actions. Instead, it is likely he judged Martin based on his prejudiced conceptions, making much of this evidence presented in the right wing media moot.
What’s more, comments on Martin’s choice of clothing greatly diminish the agency of Zimmerman in the altercation. It is not as if Martin wore his sweatshirt to make a statement on that rainy night. The hooded sweatshirt is most certainly not the exclusive, choice clothing of hooligans and criminals. It may even be safe to say that every undergraduate student on the Harvard campus owns a hooded sweatshirt.
Trayvon Martin’s death sheds light on a much larger picture of the American consciousness. In the state of Florida, the same state allowing Zimmerman’s right to “stand his ground” and thus evade trial, African Americans under the age of 18 have been charged with non-homicides and received life sentences without parole where their white counterparts have enjoyed more forgiving judgments. Apparently, it takes large-scale federal intervention to maintain a semblance of justice for black citizens, as the Supreme Court deemed these punishments cruel and unusual in 2010. Fast forward two years and Trayvon, unarmed, carrying nothing but skittles and iced tea, is hunted like an animal and killed. The demonized image of the black man in the greater American narrative, on television, and engrained in our psyches thus continues to influence the lack of egalitarianism in our culture. Trayvon Martin’s death is a reminder of existing racial prejudices. It seems that the color of your skin, whether you are a perpetrator or a victim, will determine the force and variation of justice you will receive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the small additions to the Harvard University Health plan this year covers staff and students’ gender-realignment surgery. (In previous years, “top” surgery was covered, this year “bottom” surgery will also be covered.) This is excellent news. Such surgery is very expensive (thus requiring insurance), and it has an overwhelming rate of post-operation satisfaction. In other words, it works: It improves the lives of those who very firmly believe that they are not the gender their body once expressed. For a population with a 41 percent suicide rate, this is incredibly important.
The remarkable success of such surgery is a medical and humanist victory. But interestingly, it presents, at least at the surface, a challenge to some models of traditional feminism. This stems from the contradiction between the idea that people are innately a certain gender and the traditional feminist view that gender is—at least in large part—socially created and imposed. The most famous intellectual proponent of this idea is Judith Butler, who writes in her work “Undoing Gender” that gender is simply “doing, incessantly performed.” In other words, it is not one’s genitalia that make one a particular gender, but rather one’s behavior, constructed through some combination of unconscious absorption of societal standards, embodied performance, and conscious personal choice. Butler’s theory is liberating in many ways. It discards the notion that seemingly effeminate men or masculine women are unnatural or wrong; it opens all avenues of gender-related self-expression to all people. But the existence of transgender people, and the success rate of realignment surgery, does not square with the idea that gender is simply a social and personal construction. If so, why would some people in the same society not be constructed into conformity with their physical form like the rest? Why would they choose to construct themselves as something so agonizingly deviant that it would make them suicidal? Why would surgery almost never cause regret if gender can be constructed and thus re-constructed?
In this sense, the existence of transgender people and the claim of transgender individuals that their gender is something innate could be seen as a threat to feminism. It has, in fact, been taken as such: another famous feminist, Germaine Greer, repeatedly argued in her book “The Whole Woman” that “[a]s sufferers from gender role distress themselves, women must sympathize with transsexuals but a feminist must argue that the treatment for gender role distress is not mutilation of the sufferer but radical change of gender roles.” Transgender people, she argues, must be mentally ill (perhaps as a result of being unable to cope with the confines of traditional gender roles) rather than actually of a different gender.
This approach is destructive because it effectively attacks transgender people and their right to self-definition and in doing so undermines feminism itself. Such an attack is hypocritical for feminists, who argue that women should have the right to define for themselves what it means to be a woman rather than being constrained to patriarchal values. Greer and feminists like her thus claim the right to define their own gender and then immediately deny this right to others. This is the replication or iteration of the same kind of oppression as patriarchy. Greer argues that transsexual people are reverting to restrictive ideas about gender because she sees this idea of gender as innate and potentially oppressive in the same way patriarchal ideas are—but the crucial difference is that transsexuals seek only to define themselves, not to define all women or men in a certain way on the basis of their gender.
How, then, might a feminist reconcile the needs and rights of transsexual people with the concerns of feminism? One option is the approach Judith Butler herself takes. She suggests that “more important than any presupposition about the plasticity of identity or indeed its retrograde status is queer theory’s claim to be opposed to the unwanted legislation of identity.” Most of all, in order to treat others well, we need to allow them to define themselves. The goal of this self-definition is simple: as Butler puts it, everyone ought to be able to “to breathe, to desire, to love and to live.”
If one cannot imagine how gender could be innate, still one has the responsibility to let those who believe theirs is live their lives accordingly and only protest those who prevent one from living one’s own gender in the same autonomous fashion. In doing so, feminists support the freedom to self-define what one’s gender means and align themselves with the underlying and most important principle of both feminist and transsexual thought.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps returned to Harvard's campus—over the protestations of transgender rights activists, who noted that the continued exclusion of trans people from the military blatantly violates Harvard's anti-discrimination policy. Amidst all the fanfare, everyone seems to have forgotten why ROTC was initially downgraded to an extracurricular in 1971. President Faust seems to believe that it was because of the Army's Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy, but the Crimson adds the draft and compulsory ROTC enrollment to the list of perpetrators, and The New York Times takes a huge swing in the dark and throws out “The Vietnam War” as the culprit. While all these factors may have helped bolster anti-military sentiment at Harvard, one might argue that the real causes of ROTC’s removal were the fact that Harvard could not exercise control over ROTC, and that it is fundamentally a pre-professional program—both issues which even ROTC's defenders acknowledged were “inordinate favors” to the military. Neither of these issues has been granted even lip service in the public debate over the military’s return, and they must be acknowledged and resolved before ROTC is allowed to remain on Harvard's campus.
The report of the faculty policy committee responsible for removing ROTC indicates that the true reasons for ROTC's removal did not have anything to do with the military's policies as a whole, but rather with the structure of ROTC itself. ROTC is unlike any current Harvard organization in that ROTC units are actually academic departments within universities that are under the control of the United States military. The military gets to decide the content of classes, the credit given out, the students allowed to enroll, and, to a large extent, the instructors who teach its classes, while the university has to support the department and give it Harvard’s imprimatur. This inconsistency almost inevitably results in disparate academic standards, amounts of credit given, and quality of teaching staff within the university. In fact, when Harvard had a military science department many students explicitly took advantage of ROTC’s easier grading to make up classes they had failed. Problems such as this have already cropped up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where some classes give credit but others do not. Such classes can only be harmful to Harvard as a whole and unfair to many students and faculty.
Harvard should not give its blessing to a department which it does not have oversight over, and should not forfeit control over its classes and the lives of its students to any outside organization, including the military. The university does not even allow clubs to be beholden to outside organizations, so it certainly should not allow academic departments, far more critical to the school, to be run by them.
Beyond the structural issues with ROTC, there are serious issues with the classes' content. ROTC classes are inherently practical in nature. While some of these classes may be abstract, most are not, focusing on giving students, as the Army's website puts it, “basic military skills" like navigating the Army's chain of command. These classes are akin to those which would be taught in any other trade school—they teach you how to succeed within your profession, and little else.
While trade schools fulfill an important purpose, explicitly training students for professions is counter to Harvard’s mission. Harvard does not have a journalism, accounting, pre-medicine, or pre-law department. Instead, students interested in those careers have to form extracurricular clubs in order to pursue their interests. Simply put, a department such as ROTC whose purpose is to train students for a career is anathema to the idea of Harvard as a liberal arts college and does a disservice to Harvard students. Students are here for intellectual pursuits, not the pursuit of a job, and neither the military nor anyone else should be allowed to compromise this fact.
As ROTC grows, it is likely that a department will come to Harvard. Currently, the size and shape of that department will ultimately determined by the military, not by Harvard, and the extent to which it grows is the extent to which Harvard veers away from its liberal arts mission. If, after negotiation, the military granted Harvard academic control over the ROTC departments, allowing it to ensure that classes offered within the department were truly intellectual and in line with Harvard's general academic standards, not pre-professional, these worries could be assuaged—such solutions were even suggested at the time of ROTC's removal.
However, for that to happen public discussion over these issues needs to occur, which it has not, in large part due to Harvard's administration. By framing the debate over ROTC as only an issue of gay rights, the administration has misrepresented the causes of ROTC's removal, and in doing so willfully distorted the debate surrounding its return. Reversing a decision Harvard faculty made without explaining why those faculty made that decision in the first place is not transparent, and gives no opportunity to address the fundamental problems that led to ROTC being removed in the first place. These issues must be addressed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, fewer than 1300 students received admission to Harvard College. Tens of thousands more did not. With near universal declines in admission rates, students are receiving more rejection letters than at any point in history. Concurrently, societal trends have raised the perceived stakes of every college decision, particularly at “elite” institutions, perpetuating the notion that an application decision amounts to a defining moment in one’s life. It does not.
We congratulate the recently accepted applicants, and hope for their continued success at whichever institution they choose to matriculate. Nonetheless, the continuing trend of obsessing over specific schools is a worrying one that propagates false realities about higher education. While it may seem cliché, the old adage is inexorably true—it is not where you go, but what you do, that matters. College rankings, many based on little more than name recognition, cannot predict the personal fulfillment gained from attending a specific school.
The primary reason for lower acceptance rates is beyond anyone’s control. Rising application numbers, and correspondingly lower acceptance rates, are primarily the result of a level of accessibility in the college application process never seen before. With the advent of the Common Application, increased digitization of document submission, and the general streamlining of applications, it is cheaper and simpler to apply to a large number of schools. These are undoubtedly positive changes, and an unintended but not unforeseeable consequence is that students are now applying to more universities to increase their number of available choices. Overall, these developments are a net gain, one that helps level the socioeconomic playing field in an America at times defined by wide socio-economic divisions.
However, the astronomical hype associated with attending certain schools that turns the college application process into an existential struggle is exclusively our own doing. Websites like College Confidential reveal the manufactured hysteria over being accepted to particular schools, with students showcasing mental breakdowns over insignificant life developments. Little illustrates this phenomenon more brazenly than the success of Amy Chua’s bestseller “The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.” The memoir, as well as the public spectacle that surrounded it prior to publication, showcase the abnormal obsession many American parents display with getting their children into specific schools. The idea that adolescence is little more than an audition for college is an inherently problematic philosophy. Parents do their children a disservice by placing this emphasis on college admission; these notions about the significance of specific admissions only exacerbate the emotionally exhausting nature of the college application process.
Much of this hype is particularly pronounced in the Ivy League. There undoubtedly exists a mystique surrounding Harvard and several of its peer institutions. Cultural perceptions about the privilege afforded to students exaggerate the benefits of a Harvard education—it is not a golden ticket. Ultimately, admission to Harvard is no more a guarantee of success in life than a rejection is condemnation to failure. A degree from an “elite” institution will not mitigate laziness or lack of initiative when searching for a job just as a degree from a lesser-known school will not obscure a standout performance or positive character traits.
None of this is to say that students should forego the college application process, or eschew the value of an education. Every student should pursue, whether at Harvard or any of the thousands of other institutions in the United States, a college education or vocational training.
There is little doubt that the vast majority of students here at Harvard are thankful for and humbled by the combination of talent and luck that gained them admission. In the end, however, their future is determined, like everyone else’s, by the decisions they make, and not by the institution that seals their diplomas. Perhaps a more salient lesson than any learned in the lecture hall is the understanding that Harvard does not define one’s identity, but only enables its discovery.

My little sister, Jackie, has always been the cooler one in the family. Our parents know it, we know it, and our mutual friends are well aware. It’s tough to pinpoint when this discrepancy in our social-cultural-intellectual-literary-musical-artistic capital emerged, but its existence is not questioned.
Where to start—she’s currently sporting edgy red highlights in her black hair while I try to grow out the bad haircut that I gave myself over winter break. Her music library consists of Ra Ra Riot, Sufjan Stevens, Sigur Rós. And those are the ones I recognize. I am content with being force-fed Top 40 hits from the likes of Selena Gomez and, dare I say it, Taylor Swift. Occasionally, I will indulge in tween pop sensations Big Time Rush or once-tween-“Degrassi”-sensation Drake né Aubrey Graham. But that’s only when I’m feeling adventurous.
On top of all that, she’s an artiste—both a musician (a clarinet player, admittedly not the coolest of instruments) and a filmmaker who became a local YouTube celebrity in our town at age 15—Quentin Tarantino, Yo-Yo Ma, and a hint of Ke$ha rolled into one. I, on the other hand, extend my creative wingspan by doodling and trolling nail art on Pinterest.
They say that siblings exhibit stereotypical attributes determined by birth order. The older one likes to be in control, craves approval, and is a perfectionist to a fault. The younger is more of a free spirit, creative, and always looking to have a good time.
As such, my bullying tactics were comprised of brute force and name-calling. Her response was to lock me out of my room and force me to trade prized Pokemon cards in order to regain entrance. Since we were young, playing hardball has been her means of survival. But, as we grew up, I became straight-edged and she became the troublemaker. I liked to be in charge and she was much more easygoing.
From these instances, it could be observed that we play right into the stereotypes, our respective traits tempered and molded by each other’s behavior. In a sense, a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Since then, she’s participated in (and won) rap battles, sewn her own Peter Pan collared tank tops, and won three superlatives in her senior year of high school: “Most likely to be famous,” “Most likely to change the world,” and “Friendliest.” Although we attended different schools—and, granted, mine limited everyone to only one senior superlative—I was awarded the infinitely more square, “Next Einstein.”
I remember the first day I came to Harvard, for move-in, my whole family attended one of those panels focusing on “How to help your son/daughter transition from home to school.” Towards the end, I think it was Dean Dingman who read a letter a younger brother had written to his older sister about how he noticed their father and aunt weren’t that close, and how maybe it started when she went off to college and they no longer spent as much time together. His last line to his sister was, “Is this the beginning? Or the beginning of the end?” I still remember that, up until that point, I had been nervous, excited, eager—embodying all of the expected emotions of an incoming freshman. But I hadn’t yet been sad about the departure from home and family. Upon hearing this speech, a tear rolled down my cheek as I thought about, in addition to what I was gaining from this experience—dorms, roommates, the much-anticipated freedom—what I could be losing.
And while those words expressed an unspoken fear that had been already planted in my mind, I am happy to say that the threat they encapsulated has yet to be realized. Although I’m not as connected to her life as I once was, the distance has only allowed us to find our own worlds that we can share with each other, although they now intersect in surprisingly new ways.
I always find it interesting to hear stories from friends about their relationships with their siblings. Many have become even closer because of the separation that college creates, maybe because it is a time for many to establish unique selves, completely apart from family, so that they rediscover who they are standing alone. And, in doing so, some might find a new perspective on a relationship that serves not only as a tie to loved ones and an embodiment of past experiences, but a discovery of someone completely new in a sister or brother that they’ve known all their lives. When I went off to college, into this new community that I had found, Jackie and I were no longer seen in the context of one another.
We’ve become more alike, although my coolness will never catch up at this point. Ironically, even as we burrow more into our individual interests and personalities, it is in college that I can pinpoint the impact we’ve had on each other. This semester, I’m taking my first ever VES class on film studies, fashion, and architecture, while Jackie has set her sights on leading underground film festivals. I’d like to think I have imparted some of my less abrasive control freak tendencies to contribute to this trajectory, but that might just be wishful thinking.
Either way, as both of us dive into different parts of our lives—she at school in Southern California, reveling in Disneyland trips and ultimate frisbee, and I here in New England, basking in preppiness and erstwhile rays of Cambridge sun—it’s become even more clear that we are who we are because of each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a nearly 50 percent reduction in federal funding, several of Harvard’s regional centers have been forced to rely on alternative sources of funding—including individual endowments and support from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—to maintain the quality of the academic and extracurricular opportunities offered to students.
“We’re giving less support to students, and to some extent making it up from other sources,” said Professor Andrew D. Gordon, director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute for Japanese Studies. “But some people are not getting the funds they need.”
Four of Harvard’s centers for regional studies—the Committee on African Studies, the Asia Center, the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies—are recipients of Title VI grants from the Department of Education.
But Title VI grants were cut by 46% for the current academic year after Congressional debates last year. They will remain at that level for the upcoming fiscal year as well, according to Alexandra M. Vacroux, executive director of the Davis Center.  Vacroux said the Title VI grant represented approximately 17 to 18 percent of the Davis Center’s budget—an amount that has since decreased to less than ten percent.
Similarly, the Reischauer Institute, which was receiving about $500,000 dollars of federal grant money a year in the form of Fulbright-Hayes grants and Foreign Language and Areas Studies fellowship programs, saw that funding slashed in half, according to institute director Andrew Gordon.
The cuts in funding have affected language training programs, course offerings, and scholarships, said Professor Ali Asani, member of the Standing Committee on Middle Eastern Studies.
Meanwhile, some institutes like the Reischauer Institute have also reduced the number of postdoctoral fellowships and invited fewer guest speakers in order to cope with lower budgets, added Gordon.
“It’s a big issue for international centers across the country,” said William C. Kirby, director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. “The federal government since the 1950s has funded graduate fellowships to train the next generation of professors in international studies.”
Title VI grants, which date back to the Cold War period, are awarded to undergraduate and graduate programs in foreign language or area studies through an application process that takes place every four years.
But Kirby said he thinks the federal cuts have been misguided.
“On the one hand these are long—standing grants—it’s understandable if they were to be changed into some new or different approaches,” he said. “But sadly it just seems that they’ve been slashed to be slashed.”
Regional centers experienced cuts in federal funding even before Title VI grants were reduced.
For example, the Social Science Research Council funded grants for the Ukrainian Research Institute until five years ago, when their funding from the Department of Education was cut, according to  Executive Director Tymish J. Holowinsky.
“We have maintained the program as best we could,” he said.
The Ukrainian Research Institute, like most of the regional centers on campus, has relied increasingly on its own endowment. Endowments were first established by individual patrons or private foundations upon the founding of most centers, and include monies brought in by private donors from around the world as well as foreign governments.
The Fairbank Center has even raised its own funds to support titled professorships, “in order to ensure that there would be a permanent cadre of professors in what we believe to be critical areas,” said Kirby.
The reduced financial support from the federal government has meant that centers have had to dip into their own endowments more than usual. In some cases, the FAS has served as a source of aid, funding tutorials and language courses that would otherwise be cut, Vacroux and Asani both said.
Because centers did not find out about Title VI cuts until early in the summer of 2011—after they had already finalized budgets for the upcoming year—the FAS went “outside of the normal budget process” to provide support, Vacroux added.
Overall, however, funding from the FAS for regional centers has fallen since the economic crisis in 2008, when regional centers were asked to redirect part of their own endowments to FAS to help close the deficit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Department of Agriculture has recently cited Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center for non-compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, following the death of a cotton-top tamarin monkey in February.
The new report documents the findings of a March 7 USDA investigation into the monkey death; this latest citation is the seventh against the NEPRC since June 2010. Harvard self-reported the incident to the USDA at the time of the death, prompting the inspection.
On February 26, a cotton-top tamarin monkey died due to dehydration—the fifth primate to die in the past 19 months at the NEPRC.
Paula S. Gladue, a veterinary medical officer inspector, cited the center for failing to provide the monkey with a water bottle in its cage. The report states that on the day of the animal’s death, facility personnel noted “unusual behavior” and contacted a clinical veterinarian to examine the monkey, who diagnosed the animal with dehydration. The monkey was then euthanized.
The death led Jeffrey S. Flier, dean of the Medical School, to halt indefinitely new experiments at the center. At the time, Flier said in a statement that the animal deaths were “absolutely unacceptable, deeply regrettable, and personally disturbing to me.” Flier also said he plans to implement a three-step plan to correct the failing protocol.
USDA spokesperson David Sacks wrote in an email to The Crimson that the USDA is conducting an investigation to determine actions that will be taken against the Medical School. A USDA citation can result in a warning letter to the offending institution or a fine of up to $10,000.
This citation comes at a time when the NEPRC—which has been at the forefront of biomedical primate research since its founding in 1962—is under fire from animal rights groups due to primate deaths.
“We believe that the USDA has been going soft on Harvard in particular,” Michael A. Budkie wrote in an email. Budkie—executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, an organization that focuses on preventing abuse of laboratory animals—helped organize a protest against the Medical School’s use of animals in January of this year.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter to the National Institute of Health demanding that the government agency cease funding research at the NEPRC following the February death and the death of a squirrel monkey in December.
The NEPRC received five citations from the USDA in July 2011, including one for the overdose of a primate with anesthetics. The animal, experiencing kidney failure, could not be saved and was euthanized.
In October of last year, the NEPRC was cited by the USDA for multiple failures to comply with the Animal Welfare Act—namely the Oct. 2011 death of a primate that died soon after escaping from its cage. The primate was then captured with a net by NEPRC staff, and died after undergoing an imaging procedure.
And in June 2010, a primate was found dead in a cage after it went through a mechanical washer. NEPRC and USDA investigators say it died before the washing.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 4
The April 4 article “USDA: Harvard Violated Law” said that Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center violated the Animal Welfare Act. While the NEPRC was cited by the United States Department of Agriculture for failure to comply with the Animal Welfare Act, the USDA did not determine the non-compliance to be a violation. The USDA only terms non-compliances “violations” after further investigation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Babies are able to differentiate minute sound distinctions that would otherwise be lost to adults, University of Washington professor of speech and hearing sciences Patricia K. Kuhl said on Tuesday.
In the first talk of a two-part lecture series organized by the Human, Mind, Brain and Behavior Interfaculty Initiative, Kuhl discussed babies’ ability to learn vowel patterns quickly.
“Seven-year-old children are geniuses at learning languages, but with every two- or three-year advancement in age, their ability to learn languages declines dramatically,” Kuhl said. “After puberty, it becomes increasingly more difficult to learn languages at such a fast rate.”
Kuhl explained that developmental disabilities take hold early.
“The hope is that if you have a biomarker for any of these disabilities, you could go in and do something about atypical learning patterns and change the trajectory of a child’s life,” she said.
Kuhl also discussed an experiment that proved the importance social context plays in early child language acquisition.
The experiment placed a group of ten-month-old babies in a series of sessions lasting thirty-five minutes that introduced the infants to foreign language instruction in a face-to-face, private lesson setting. A second group of infants was shown a television screening of the same lessons.
The first group, which received personal instruction from a real human, recognized the vowel patterns of foreign languages at a much higher rater than the group of babies who viewed the televised lessons, implying the importance of social interaction for early language acquisition, she said.
“The more social behavior that took place during the sessions, the better learning the babies had on the phonetic level,” Kuhl said.
Kuhl further explained that babies commit the architecture of native language sound properties to propel rapidly to perceptions of foreign language sound properties to propel rapidly to perceptions of foreign languages.
“If babies are good at non-native languages in their first months, they will have more difficulty learning non-native languages later on because they will not have established the initial native language techniques to comprehend the patterns of foreign languages,” she said.
She said that the phonetic discriminations of a seven-month-year-old child predicted the reading skills of that child at age five.
“What children are doing early in locking onto sounds of language is a profound measurement of future learning,” Kuhl said.

Six teams of Harvard students based out of the I-Lab presented their business ideas—including proposals to revolutionize battery technology and to re-define teacher education—to members of the Harvard Board of Overseers on Sunday.
The presentations were meant to showcase the creative thinking sponsored by the I-Lab, which currently offers space and resources to 55 teams. The teams, composed of students from across the University, are the first to maintain residency in the I-Lab, which opened last year.
University President Drew G. Faust, who is also an overseer, said the event demonstrated how the I-Lab fosters the innovative thinking that is crucial to the University’s mission.
“The I-Lab student presentations at the overseers meeting illustrated Harvard’s tradition of using knowledge to invent the future,” Faust wrote in an email. “We saw, firsthand, how this new collaborative space inspires innovation, curiosity, and engagement.”
Megan R. Marcus, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said she was “honored” to have the opportunity to address the members of the Board of Overseers.
“It’s just wonderful to have a platform to talk about a large idea in front of a group made up of such prominent and important leaders in such a wide range of fields,” said Marcus, who said that she hopes to revolutionize teacher’s education through her business, FuelEd.
Louis B. Beryl presented his business idea “Solid Energy”—a new, more efficient and cost-effective battery. Beryl’s group has already been in talks with a number of high profile corporations, including Toyota, he said.
“It was very validating to have such a prestigious group respond positively to our idea,” Beryl said.
I-Lab director Gordon S. Jones said that Sunday’s presentations was a sampling of the type of “progressive, inventive, and cutting-edge” projects the teams at the I-Lab are pursuing.
He added that the event marked an important benchmark for the new lab, displaying the extant potential for student creativity.
“What makes the innovation lab distinctive is that it’s this chance for students from around the University to be able to meet each other and put these ideas they have into practice,” Jones said. “It’s important that they have a space like the I-Lab, where we facilitate, support, and resource those ideas.”
In addition to space, the I-Lab provides its teams access to experienced mentors and legal advisors. These resources, have been essential for students like Katharine R. Wolf, who is studying at Harvard Kennedy School. Wolf is the  president and CEO of the new company OrganJet—an organization which aims to help patients awaiting organ transplants obtain organs more quickly while reducing the health-care costs associated with such a transplant.
She said the I-Lab has been crucial in developing her idea, which she said she hopes will affect everyone, “rich or poor, white or black.”
“The I-Lab space is really critical for us, because it allows us to interact with other ideas that help us think through what we really want to do as well as giving us access to venture capitalists, lawyers, and medias,” said Wolf, who also said she wants to base her growing company out of the I-Lab. “This is the chance of a lifetime. We’re trying to save lives out of this space.”

The Student Labor Action Movement held a celebration Tuesday afternoon in response to Harvard’s recent decision not to reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts, a hotel chain that has come under fire for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations.
Approximately 25 people, including SLAM members, union organizers, and workers marched from the Science Center to Memorial Hall to hand out fliers, proceeding through the Yard and gathering in front of Massachusetts Hall.
SLAM member Iman E. James ’12 said that Tuesday’s event had originally been planned as a protest of Harvard’s investment in HEI, before the University disclosed the news of its decision not to reinvest in HEI.
“I see it as a celebration,” James said. “It’s a great thing.”
James added that she hoped Harvard’s decision would urge HEI to change their labor practices.
Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a former SLAM member who attended the event, said that she participated in the 2008 protest, when Harvard students first began campaigning for the University to reconsider its investment in HEI.
“It’s been a pretty up-and-down campaign,” Narefsky said. “It has really taken continual pressure on the University. I was really happy to hear about it.”
In an email to University President Drew G. Faust, Jane Mendillo, CEO and president of the Harvard Management Company, said HMC had decided not to reinvest in HEI. According to the email, the decision not to reinvest resulted from “factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs,” rather than HEI’s labor practices.
The University declined to comment further on the decision.
James said that the congregation on Tuesday was “also in solidarity with the workers at the Le Meridien,” referring to the HEI-owned Cambridge hotel on Sidney Street, near the MIT campus. According to speakers at the SLAM event, a delegation of around 30 workers and 10 students approached the general manager of the hotel asking for a “fair process” for the workers to determine whether they want a union.
Karen Burkart, an organizer for the union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers, said that the petition for a “fair process” meant only that the workers were asking not to be intimidated by the management.
Burkart said that although she was pleased about Harvard’s decision not to reinvest in HEI, the University still has a stake in its practices, because “Harvard has already given them a lot of money.”
David Vermillion, a public relations professional who works with HEI, wrote in an email statement that  the type of process proposed by the petition “strips our employees of their democratic rights, which we cannot support.”
Vermillion said that Le Meridien respects employees’ rights to a process that allows for free choice and protects workers from intimidation from outside parties, including unions.
“HEI enjoys a strong, positive relationship with out employees at the Le Meridien and we respect their right to elect union representation through a secret ballot election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board.”

The teaching profession in the United States needs a makeover, the president of America’s largest labor union—the National Education Association—said at the Graduate School of Education on Tuesday.
Dennis Van Roekel, who heads the union, said Tuesday that the current level of educator recruitment is insufficient to meet the demand for the 1.6 million new teachers the U.S. Department of Education says the country will need over the next decade. His union, the NEA, represents 3.2 million public school employees.
“We’ve got to find a way to find people who ought to be in teaching, who want to be in teaching, and they choose that as their profession and they stay there, or we’ll never succeed in meeting students’ needs,” Van Roekel said.
Van Roekel praised the recruiting done by Teach for America, but said that the two-year stints that teachers hired by the nonprofit work in schools are too short to have a long-lasting effect on the profession.
In his experience, he said, lacking a sense of achievement often leads new teachers to leave the classroom.
“We need to find a way to offer those different challenges young people are looking for without leaving education,” Van Roekel said. He suggested that frustrated teachers could take on other roles within the school, such as writing curricula.
He also pointed to lack of diversity as a problem plaguing the teaching profession. “We have got to change the face of the teaching force,” he said. “It’s got to reflect the way our students look.”
Responding to criticism that teachers’ unions like his allow ineffective teachers to keep their jobs, Van Roekel instead blamed the training that bad teachers received.
“We have to be far more aggressive in defining what it takes to be a good teacher and to ensure that no one gets in the field without knowing that,” Van Roekel said.
Van Roekel also criticized the use of students’ standardized test results as a means of evaluating teachers, as the No Child Left Behind policy prescribes.
“The high-stakes testing one day of the year—and taking that as a snapshot to evaluate students, schools, teachers, everything—is just wrong,” he said. Van Roekel suggested evaluations by fellow educators and by students as alternate options for reviewing teachers’ performance.
Maren E. Oberman, a student at the Ed School, said she enjoyed hearing Van Roekel’s take on the NEA’s values and goals. However, she expressed skepticism that his ideals can practically be put into place.
“I wanted to hear about how his vision has any chance of being implemented on the ground,” Oberman said.

The Cambridge Police Department made 17 arrests for drug-related conduct in Central Square during “Operation Booting Heroin.” Ten of the arrests took place last Thursday and Friday.
The Special Investigation Unit “Operation Booting Heroin” began last summer and has been at work throughout Cambridge to wipe out heroin trafficking in Central Square.
CPD launched the operation in response to a growing threat of the use and distribution of drugs in Central Square. On Tuesday, the CPD announced the success of the program, according to a press release.
There had also been instances of “citizen complaints,” according to the release. In an email, CPD spokesperson Dan M. Riviello described the complaints as calls from residents reporting a perceived increase in drug use, dealing, and “experiences with individuals in public/business restrooms suspected of drug use,” among other things.
Operation Booting Heroin involved three distinct phases, beginning with the surveillance from August through November of 2011 during which time “some arrests [were] made for activity that was witnessed by detectives,” Riviello wrote.
The second phase consisted of gathering further information and “undercover buys”; the final stage of the operation used the gathered evidence to execute arrests, although Riviello also wrote that several outstanding warrants exist for individuals wanted on similar charges.
Deputy Superintendent Paul Ames called “Operation Booting Heroin” a “great success” in the CPD press release.
Ames also said that the CPD hopes that the arrests will improve the quality of life for all people who spend time in Central Square and that it will send the message that “drug use and distribution will not be tolerated, not only in Central Square, but throughout Cambridge.”

Bringing contemporary artists into a traditional museum setting can make the art relevant to otherwise alienated audiences, specifically racial minorities, art curator and professor Ethan W. Lasser said at the Harvard Faculty Club on Tuesday.
Lasser, who teaches art history at the University of Wisconsin and works for the Chipstone Foundation, a research institution that produces art exhibits, described three of his past exhibitions which sought to “further historical knowledge but also equip visitors with interpretive tools to use both inside and outside the museum context.”
Lasser said that one of his projects, which focused on a ceramic pot made by a South Carolina slave in 1838, addressed concerns far beyond 19th century earthenware. In the face of considerable racial segregation in Milwaukee, Lasser said that by adding contemporary performance to his show, he created an exhibit that “brought the voice of the outside inside—and sparked a city-wide conversation about the function of the museum and what divisions it sustains, perhaps unknowingly.”
The creator of the pot in question was known as Dave the Potter. Despite a ban on slave literacy, Dave inscribed his pots with verses such as “When you fill this jar with Pork or Beer, Scot will be there to get a peace [sic].” To highlight these distinctive verses, Lasser invited Theaster Gates Jr., a recent Loeb Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, to bring a contemporary element to the exhibit.
Gates staged a performance corresponding with the museum exhibit in which Milwaukee gospel choirs sang Dave’s verses.
Speaking about Gates, Lasser said, “He gave me insight into the production of the object [and] found contemporary significance [in the pot] that I couldn’t have found on my own.”
Lasser added, “It’s become kind of fashionable for gallery curators to invite contemporary artists to engage in commentary with the work [on display].” He described his other exhibits showcasing the work of artists ranging from colonial America to the present.
In one show, Lasser displayed colonial objects including a wooden armchair from Puritan New England, which was carved in a style reminiscent of a gravestone, and an imposing merchant’s desk from Philadelphia, which, according to Lasser, underlined its owner’s wealth and power.
For Lasser, these historical objects “focus on the agency of things [and] how they reinforce moral codes, support a certain identity, and regulate the body.” For example, he said that the iconography on the chair served as a reminder of death’s imminence, an important aspect of religion in New England at the time.
Likewise, Lasser called the desk “performative object.” He explained, “In the process of opening its doors, the merchant could add to the symbolic language of the object and show off his genteel grace and ability to organize.”
He also curated a show featuring the work of 16 artists who each made their piece using only one tool. Lasser said he aimed to question “what constitutes a tool” and “the centuries-old idea that the mental and the manual should be separate.”
Despite their differences, Lasser said “all three [of these exhibitions] are underpinned by the same idea of investigating the manifold possibilities of the museum.”

Students expressed concern over the presence of machismo in Hispanic communities, in a panel discussion on Tuesday.
Co-sponsored by Fuerza Latina, Latinas Unidas, and Latino Men’s Collective, the event is one of many events hosted this week by Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA’s “Semana Chicana” in honor of the organization’s 40th anniversary. Other events include film screenings, open mic nights, and voter registration drives.
“[Machismo] is a problem. It’s very prevalent in the Latino community,” Nelida Garcia ’14 said. “Whenever I go back home, there’s always a grim reminder of that reality. Events like this are great because they remind us of what we’re trying to fight.”
Adrian Aldaba ’12 said that machismo is “best described with the three F’s: ‘feo,’ ‘fuerte,’ and ‘formal.’” He said that these adjectives, which mean ‘ugly,’ ‘strong,’ and ‘proper,’ respectively, in Spanish, form the masculine ideal associated with the Latino culture.
“There’s a sense of hypermasculinity to make up for the oppression and marginalization faced by Latinos on a daily basis,” he said.
Jesse G. Sanchez ’13 acknowledged that this masculine ideal influenced his family life.
“Growing up, I had this view of machismo as something that was not good,” he said. “It brought a lot of pain to my family. I used to think, ‘What constitutes a man?’ I’ve been trying to redefine what it means to be a man.”
The panelists’ examination of machismo was not limited to practices associated exclusively with Latino men and acknowledged that the pervasion of traditional masculine ideals also affect women.
“Redefining what it means to be strong, to be a leader—a lot of that came from my mom,” Sanchez said. “To see her determination as anything but female, I think is very unjust.”
At one point during the discussion, Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña, the panel’s moderator, changed the trajectory of the conversation and asked the panelists to consider what extent machismo is a post-colonial construct.
“The whole notion of the macho is born out of combating the oppressor. You have to be more macho than the españoles,” Aldaba said in response to her question. “That being said, are we still being colonized?”
The panel culiminated with final remarks about what strategies could be most effective in combating machismo. Several participants said that the creation of more equitable gender norms relies on personal initiative.
“It is up to you to bring it to your community,” Sanchez said.

Regardless of team allegiance, all sports fans seem to agree on two things. One: We love lists and rankings (for proof, look no further than ESPN’s unnecessarily dramatic ranking of the top 500 players in baseball). And two: We love trivia.
We’re no exception here at The Back Page. And while we’ve made our fair share of rankings, we’ve skimped on the trivia—until now. Below, we’ve compiled a Harvard athletics trivia challenge with 10 questions, ranging from, to put it in golf lingo, tap-ins to 50-foot double breakers.
Check back tomorrow for the answers.
1. Which offensive tackle who played in the famous 1968 Harvard-Yale game roomed with Al Gore '69 freshman year?
2. Name the two teams that the Harvard men’s basketball team played in its 1946 and 2012 NCAA tournament appearances.
3. The 1998 Harvard women’s basketball team defeated which No. 1 seeded opponent in the first round of the NCAA tournament?
4. What is the first and the longest-running American intercollegiate sports event?
5. This season, both junior Colton Chapple and senior Collier Winters tied a single-game Harvard record by throwing how many touchdowns?
6. Harvard Stadium is one of four athletic venues in the country that is also a National Historic Landmark. What are the other three?
7. Which golfing legend is a Harvard grad?
8. Tennis star James Blake lived in which Harvard house?
9. Which spouse of a current Harvard coach has won an Olympic gold medal as a competitor?
10. Which current NHL player was part of the first trio of brothers to play for the Harvard hockey team at the same time?

The Kentucky Wildcats (38-2) ascended to the throne of college basketball Monday night, but in Cambridge, Mass., a different sort of king was being crowned. With Kentucky's victory over the Kansas Jayhawks (32-7), junior Coulter King secured first place in the first annual Harvard Bracketology contest.
King correctly picked three out of the four Final Four teams (Kentucky, Ohio State, and Kansas), the two championship game participants, and the national champion Wildcats.
“Early on in the process, I knew I had something of a chance, but I didn’t think I would win,” King said. "Then, when I got into the top 20, I started to see how viable my bracket really was.”
He also chose pragmatism over sentimentality in predicting an early exit for Harvard.
“It was tempting to go with Harvard, but I felt confident enough in the bracket,” King said. “Vandy had so much momentum. They won the SEC [tournament], they were shooting well from three, so I felt like it was best to pick strategically. It would have been great if they had messed up my bracket.”
The tournament, organized by the Harvard College Sports Analysis Collective, attracted 405 unique brackets from a diverse selection of the Harvard community, including students from all grades and even two entries from Statistics 104 professor Michael Parzen.
Constructed by junior Andrew Cohen, the tournament’s website (harvardbracketology.com) featured an exponential scoring system—one point for correctly-picked second-round games and 32 points for the championship game—that included adding a team’s seed number to each correct selection as a bonus for picking upsets; for instance, 12 extra points for 12-seed VCU’s victory over Wichita State. King credited the scoring system for his choice to pick 10-seed Xavier in the Sweet 16.
And he needed every one of those bonus points. With 314 points, King defeated the runner-up, freshman Alana Ganz, by just two points.
For his victory, King will receive a $100 Amazon gift card, while Ganz earned $25 in Amazon credit for her second-place finish. As of yet, King has no specific plans for how to spend his windfall.
King said that he follows college basketball pretty closely, but his secret weapon for filling out his bracket was consulting with his brother, a high school junior who, according to King, follows the sport “really intensely.”
“I ran the entire bracket past him, and he made a couple of changes,” King said. “I definitely wouldn’t have done as well without his feedback.”
The advice certainly paid off. Though it may not have been the gutsiest pick, King’s bet on the Wildcats to win the title ultimately earned him bragging rights over some 400 of his peers.
“It’s pretty tough not to choose a team that’s going to have five or six [NBA] draft picks,” King said. “They were the bigger, stronger team, and they had a lot of momentum, so it was kind of silly to choose anyone else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An inning after tying the game with a solo home run, sophomore Kasey Lange stepped back up to the plate with the Harvard softball team trailing by one once again and now down to its final out. With a runner on second, Lange had a chance to give the Crimson its first lead of the day over Providence, but that opportunity was summarily taken away. The Friars elected to intentionally walk Lange to bring up co-captain Whitney Shaw. The plan paid off as Shaw popped out to give Providence (13-18, 4-1) a 3-2, home victory Tuesday.
“Kasey had hit a home run earlier, so I wasn’t surprised by [the intentional walk],” coach Jenny Allard said. “I would have made the same situation. Whitney needs to know that those situations are going to happen. She just got jammed and popped it up.”
The Friars took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning when junior Jesse Bryant went deep on co-captain Rachel Brown, who was pitching in her fifth game in five days. In the top of the inning, sophomore Shelbi Olson got to third on a single, a wild pitch, and a ground ball out, but Shaw was unable to bring her home as she popped out.
Providence added to its lead in the third when senior Michelle Huber scored after an error by senior shortstop Jane Alexander kept the inning alive.
Through three innings, Harvard (15-9, 3-1) had stranded all three baserunners that had reached first safely.
“We had gotten once through the lineup, and we only had two hits,” Allard said. “We did not have a lot of quality at-bats. We were swinging at bad pitches.”
That changed in the fourth.
Shaw walked to start the inning, and freshman Andrea Del Conte came in to pinch run. Del Conte stole second before watching two batters pop out. With two outs, senior Marika Zumbro knocked Del Conte in with her first of two hits on the day, narrowing the deficit to 2-1 and earning her first RBI of the season.
Lange eliminated the gap altogether with a solo home run to lead off the sixth inning.
“We have a lot of players in the lineup who are go-to players, and Kasey is a go-to player for us,” Allard said. “When she got the home run, she swung at the good pitch. Before, she was swinging at bad pitches.”
The Crimson offense continued to be a threat, generating back-to-back singles after a pair of groundouts, but the attack eventually stalled.
The game did not stay tied for long as the Friars came right back in the bottom of the sixth and did more damage, this time off sophomore Laura Ricciardone, who had entered the game for Brown after the senior pitched a scoreless fourth inning. In four innings, Brown had fanned seven.
“Both Rachel and Laura needed to throw in the game today,” Allard said. “That was the plan. I thought they were attacking their hitters well. They both looked sharper than they did last weekend.”
Ricciardone got the first batter out in the sixth but then surrendered a walk and a single. The next batter, junior Stephanie Kiesel, made Ricciardone pay with a double that scored one and left runners at second and third. The Friars then attempted a double steal that failed, leaving Kiesel at third as the only baserunner. Ricciardone ended the inning with a strikeout, but only after the home team had gained a 3-2 advantage.
Going for a complete game, junior Corinne Clauss began the seventh inning by getting junior Ashley Heritage to ground out. Senior Jane Alexander then put pressure on Providence with a base hit to left field, her second single of the game. Alexander then advanced to second on a groundout by Olson that brought Lange to the plate.
Besides homering an inning earlier, Lange had been on a tear, batting .384 over the previous four games while driving in six runs over that stretch. The Friars opted not to test Lange again, putting her on the empty first base with four straight balls.
The intentional walk brought up Shaw, who had previously gone 0-2 in the game after going 0-3 her last time out.
“It’s happened before,” said Shaw of coming to the plate after watching Lange be intentionally walked. “If anything, it fires you up more, because they are saying she is more intimidating than I am. That’s a motivating factor.”
Despite the extra motivation, Shaw’s struggles continued in the at-bat as she popped out to end the game.
“Obviously I’m disappointed in the at-bat,” Shaw said. “Of course I wanted better from myself. Now, I really have to learn from it. It’s not about if you fail, it’s about how you fail and how you respond to it. That’s the nature of playing softball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite already playing 22 games in its 2012 campaign, the Harvard baseball team still has yet to suit up for a contest at O’Donnell Field. But at long last, the Crimson returns to familiar territory Wednesday afternoon, opening its home season against crosstown competitor Boston College.
“We have our work cut out for us,” said freshman Zach Boden, who is currently tied for first on the team with a .333 batting average. “[BC] is a very good team…but we also know what we’re doing. It should be a pretty good game.”
And there’s more than just the typical Boston-area rivalry riding on the contest. The last time these two teams met, the Eagles (12-16, 4-8 ACC) stunned Harvard, 8-0, at Fenway Park in the finals of the 2011 Beanpot after the Crimson (3-19, 1-3 Ivy) edged UMass in the first round, 1-0.
“Even though we lost…the whole experience of playing at Fenway is something we’ll remember for rest of lives,” sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan said. “[But] to get to that championship game last year and lose 8-0 definitely crushed us. We want to bounce back from that.”
Last year’s struggling Harvard team entered its contest against the Eagles on the tail of a four-game split with Ivy foe Yale and went on to drop its final four games of the season, all against Dartmouth, to close out a 9-36 overall record for the year.
The Crimson—which began Ivy play this past weekend—experienced mixed results in its first four league contests of 2012, splitting games with Cornell before dropping two to Princeton despite amassing at least a one-run lead in three of the four games. But the Harvard team remains positive as it looks to snap its three-game losing streak on Wednesday.
“We haven’t gotten the results we wanted so far, but a lot of that has to do with playing a bunch of really good teams,” Boden said. “Going home and starting our Ivy schedule, we should definitely see better results. Most teams play way better at home, and we’re hoping to turn our schedule around.”
BC has also had its share of mishaps this year, losing 11 straight games in the month of March. The team currently sits fifth in the Atlantic division of conference competition, but the Eagles are an impressive 6-3 in their nine most recent contests.
“[BC] is in the ACC, which a lot of people say is a better baseball conference than the Ivy League,” McGuiggan said. “Even if they’re not at the top of their league, they’re still a very good team, [and] we’re looking forward to playing them.”
After the first weekend of Ivy play, Harvard sits tied with Dartmouth for second place in the Rolfe division, with every Ancient Eight team notching at least one loss in the opening weekend of league competition. The Crimson will take on Columbia and Penn at home a few days after Wednesday’s game.
“I think the way we play against BC, especially if we do well, can really get the ball rolling,” Boden said. “We hope it will give us momentum for our Ivy games this weekend.”
Against the Tigers and the Big Red last week, three Harvard players—sophomore outfielder Jack Colton, classmate Steven Dill, and senior designated hitter Marcus Way—each contributed at least five hits for a combined five RBIs. And according to McGuiggan, consistency on offense and defense will likely play a big role on Wednesday.
“We want to get out to an early lead [against BC] and have consistent pitching,” McGuiggan said. “Our offense has a lot of work to do as well…. We want to play a complete game: pitching, hitting, and on defense.”
The contest against the Eagles marks one of Harvard’s final opportunities to test itself against a non-conference opponent, as the Crimson heads into the heart of Ancient Eight play in the coming weeks. Harvard has just three more non-Ivy games on the schedule after it takes on the Eagles.
“Our 20 Ivy games are crucial, because they’re the only games that determine whether or not we get into the NCAA tournament,” McGuiggan said. “Ivy games are our focus, but whenever we play a midweek game we’re definitely looking to pick up a win, at least in part to prove to other teams that we’re a good team.”
Perhaps fittingly, Wednesday’s game will also serve as a preview for the first round of this year’s Beanpot, in which BC and Harvard are pitted against each other once again on April 10.
“We play [BC] twice in one week,” McGuiggan said. “[On Wednesday], we’ll see what they have and see how everything goes. That should give us an advantage going into the Beanpot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If rowing on the Charles River in 20-degree weather on the morning of The Game is not difficult enough, add in a shifting race course and a near-crash at the Eliot turn, and you will have just experienced Andrew Hamm’s first race as a novice.
Though Hamm, now a senior on Harvard heavyweight crew, is long past his days as a freshman walk-on, he points to this particular race as important in solidifying the relationship between himself and all of the other freshman novices.
“The quality of rowing was pretty bad,” Hamm joked. “I would not want a video of that rowing, but it was still really cool finishing that first race and feeling connected with the other guys who walked on.”
Just like Hamm did back in 2008, Harvard students continue to sign up by the dozens in order to take their own shots at the University’s oldest sport. The number of freshmen that attend the initial information sessions held for men’s and women’s crew as walk-ons can reach anywhere from 40 to 100 prospective rowers.
In her search for rowers, men’s lightweight assistant coach Linda Muri is known to patrol the lunch line in Annenberg and fill the calendar of Opening Days with novice crew meetings in order to generate interest in the program. Unlike most sports at Harvard, crew allows for walk-on rowers to be integrated into a Division I program, even if they have never touched an oar.
“[There] is the appeal of being able to work hard and see results from your effort,” Muri said. “In a good way, Harvard students are results oriented, and if you continue to work hard [at crew], you will continue to see results.”
Muri uses Michelle Guerette ’02 as an example of just how far the sport of rowing can take a walk-on. Guerette, a walk-on to the Radcliffe heavyweight team, competed in the 2004 Olympics in Athens and then proceeded to win the silver medal in the Single Sculls Final in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Radcliffe heavyweight crew coach Liz O’Leary was also an Olympian, exemplifying the high level of experience that can be found on the crew coaching staff. She was a member of the 1976 and 1980 US Olympic teams and even went on to coach the Olympic team in 1988.
“To get everyone rowing the same way in a month just speaks to how patient [the coaches] are,” said sophomore heavyweight walk-on Maura Church. “Every time you’re out in the water, you realize that there is a former Olympian coaching [you].”
For committed novices, the appeal to join crew reaches past the mysticism that surrounds the Weld and Newell boathouses. Most freshman walk-ons spend their high school careers as multi-sport athletes, and once they reach college, begin looking for some new way to satisfy their competitive edge. Both freshman lightweight rower Robert Hawthorne and sophomore heavyweight rower Sidney Hilker found themselves facing this challenge. Hilker was a gymnast for 15 years, while Hawthorne had been wrestling since he was six years old.
“When I decided that I didn’t want to wrestle in college at all, I knew that I wanted to do something,” Hawthorne reflected. “Athletics have always been a huge part of my life, and I couldn’t imagine just going to school and having that disappear.”
Some novices do not even wait until school starts to track down the crew coaches. Hawthorne was in contact with the Crimson coaches about joining the team before even stepping foot on campus, while Church emailed the heavyweight coaches to ask for a preseason training workout.
For the walk-ons, the first two weeks of training, known as ‘trial week’, are full of running, sprinting up the stairs of Harvard Stadium, and spending large amounts of time on the ergometer. Skill work for novices is focused on learning the technique of the rowing stroke.
“When you’re learning the rowing motion, it’s not an instinctive motion,” explained Radcliffe assistant heavyweight coach Cory Bosworth. “You’re rowing backwards.”
The technical side of rowing was the area where sophomore lightweight Joey Wall noticed he needed to put in the most work. Being a distance runner in high school allowed Wall to reach the fitness level of the recruited rowers with little difficulty, but learning technique added a whole other aspect to training.
“You constantly feel like you’re holding everybody back, so you really try to get better on the technical side,” Wall said. “It’s [there] that you really have to make strides every day.”
The merging of recruits and walk-ons happens in late fall for both the men’s teams and the women’s heavyweight team, establishing a new dynamic in the walk-on experience. Freshman lightweight Henry Klingenstein described how the almost vertical learning curve of crew keeps the novices believing that they can eventually catch up to the level of the recruits. Klingenstein credits the recruits for being helpful and accepting throughout the whole process of learning the rowing skill set.
But on the heavyweight women’s team, both Church and freshman walk-on Theresa Gebert found there to be a prevalent theme of having to “prove yourself” in the first few months of each of their novice seasons. Church, who is now on varsity herself, recalled seeing the varsity team in the boathouse and being fairly intimidated. She pointed out that this intimidation factor begins to lower significantly when the women’s heavyweight team takes part in a team-wide triathlon, consisting of a 7500-meter row on the ergometer, a four-and-a-half mile run, and a full-stadium run. This huge athletic undertaking plays a part in who gets an invitation to the winter training camp in Florida.
Gebert used this challenge as her springboard. She would run a stadium every Wednesday morning, keeping a log of her times. Finding herself at the bottom of the novice roster, Gebert trained with the goal of making it to Florida. Her hard work and qualifying time was soon rewarded with an invitation to winter training.
“I think it is true that when you are walking onto a team having no experience, you have to become a little obsessed with it,” Gebert said.
Winter training in Florida mixes together all four heavyweight, lightweight, men’s, and women’s teams, leaving less of a social distinction between walk-ons and recruits. Besides the team bonding that occurs, Bosworth also noted the importance of winter training in significantly boosting novices’ level of experience.
“In one week of double-days, we can get in almost a month’s worth of strokes,” Bosworth said. “We see big periods of growth during this period of time.”
Radcliffe lightweight coach Michiel Bartman finds the period right after winter training to be the point where a walk-on should make his or her decision as to whether or not he or she will stay on for the racing season.
“I rely a lot on walk-ons to fill the spots in the team because I unfortunately don’t have a big number to recruit,” Bartman said. “Luckily, we get a lot of new people, and my job is to keep them around.”
It is a novice’s decision whether or not he or she wants to stay on the team. For all teams, the number of freshman walk-ons drops into the single digits after the fall. Betsy Storm ’14 walked onto the women’s freshman heavyweight team in the fall of her freshman year, looking to take part in one of Harvard’s greatest traditions. Storm noted how rewarding the sport was but decided after the fall season not to pursue it further.
“I didn’t come to college to be a full time collegiate athlete,” Storm recalled. “I don’t think that I really understood that crew could potentially become a full-time NCAA sport.”
Those few walk-ons who do continue into their varsity years of crew make up a select group of athletes, but the distinction of being a walk-on soon fades out.
“You can really rise through the ranks,” Wall stated. “It’s how strong you row and how hard you pull, and it ultimately doesn’t come down to who’s a walk on and who isn’t.”
Walking on to crew offers a person the rare chance to be considered on the same level as a Division I varsity athlete during their time at Harvard. The task of taking on something that is completely new and challenging seems to be what drives a lot of these novices.
“After all, It’s fun being the dark horse,” Gebert added with a laugh.

Harvard, as an institution and as a symbol, has been a regular topic of discussion—or object of derision—in the 2012 presidential contest. Flyby brings you some of the most notable mentions of fair Harvard on the campaign trail.
It is unsurprising that so many candidates have mentioned Harvard, given that both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are Harvard alums. Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, and Romney earned a joint degree from HLS and Harvard Business School in 1975.
Critics of both Obama and Romney have lambasted the two for their perceived elitism, pointing to their Harvard connection as an emblem of privilege.
Before dropping out of the presidential race, Rick Perry wrote in his book "Fed Up" that today's Democrats are "more interested in government and the opinions of Harvard, Washington, and Upper West Side Manhattan than the beliefs of those people in flyover country between the coast." For all of Perry's derision of Harvard, he later hosted a fundraiser at the Harvard Club of New York, leading to mockery from blogs like Politicker.
Rick Santorum, too, has referred to Obama’s supposed elitism. He has called colleges "indoctrination mills" and commented, "President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob."
Mitt Romney's repeated jabs at the "faculty lounge" have raised eyebrows, given his Harvard pedigree. Most recently, on March 18, Romney criticized Obama, saying, "I didn’t learn about the economy just reading about it or hearing about it at the faculty lounge at Harvard or debating it in Congress."

In colorful yet tasteful burger suits, the Burger Brigade redefines fast food. Tomorrow, from 4 to 6 p.m., the group will be serving free b. good shakes and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in front of b. good on Dunster Street.
The brigade is sponsored by b. good, and has a simple concept: "a bunch of Harvard students dress up as burgers while running the Boston Marathon to raise money for charity," said team member Amy Guan '12.
The team hopes to raise funds and awareness for Back on My Feet, a charity that works with the homeless to promote independence and self-sufficiency. Last year's Burger Brigade raised $17,000 for the charity, and this year's team hopes to top that sum by $2,000.
Need a greater incentive to stop by the event? A couple of runners will also be present in full burger costumes. While they are inspired by taste, running 26.2 miles in a burger outfit might be tricky.
"They say they're aerodynamic, but it is essentially a tire with cloth around it," Guan said with trepidation.
The event's Facebook page can be found here.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 6
An earlier version of this post referred to Burger Brigade runner Amy Guan as a member of the Class of 2011. In fact, Guan is a member of the Class of 2012.
