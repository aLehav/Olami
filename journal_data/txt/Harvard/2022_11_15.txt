After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although he’s only been professionally making music since 2020, rapper Invada has already become a key piece in one of the most exciting hip-hop acts to come out of Massachusetts in decades. He is the newest member of Van Buren Records, a rap collective from Brockton that is making industry buzz with its independent label structure and high energy posse-style bangers. Van Buren is a collective of 13 members — including rappers, producers, and designers alike — which has amassed a significant regional listenership that is quickly expanding. The crew played Boston Calling in May, has opened for the likes of Griselda and Pusha T, and sold so many tickets for their Boston album release party in September that they needed to book a bigger venue.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Invada said that he is still processing the love that Van Buren is receiving both locally and beyond. “It still hasn't registered for real,” the rapper said. “Every time I’m on stage it’s like: ‘Damn, all y'all came out to see us?’ You really could have been anywhere in the world and you chose to be here with us? That's fire. It really makes me appreciate having fans.”
Founded in 2014, Van Buren Records gets its name from Season Eight episode 14 of Seinfeld, a show that had a big impact on original Van Buren members like SAINT LYOR, according to Invada. In the episode, Kramer and George have beef with a street gang called “The Van Buren Boys.” It was through his longtime friendship with SAINT LYOR that Invada was introduced to VB, which led to him becoming  an official member.
“I've known LYOR since kindergarten actually, but we didn't start getting really close until right around the time that he joined VB,” Invada said. “We were basically inseparable regardless, so he started just bringing me around and then everybody in the group started taking a liking to me. This was before I was even thinking about music, mind you, and then one day it just happened.”
Invada stepped into the booth with VB for the first time while at Audiomack Studios in New York in Dec. 2020. The crew instantly took a liking to his style and raps, but the rapper shared that he was still on the fence about seriously pursuing music. “I guess part of it comes from the fact that I wasn't used to seeing rappers from where I was from,” he said. “If I was from a place with a bigger scene like Atlanta, or New York or something like that, maybe I would have seen it differently.”
“Coming from a small city with no music scene prior to what we were doing, respectfully,” he added. “I just didn't see it.”
Thanks to Van Buren Records, who have earned over 1.7 million Spotify streams on “Cult” and recently wrapped another multi-city tour this month, Brockton — population 105,000 —  is beginning to get cultural recognition outside of New England. After the 2019 census, Brockton became officially designated as the only majority Black town in New England, although Invada said that the demographics of the city have not changed much since he was a kid.
“It's been majority Black the whole time I've been there,” the rapper said. “But it's probably just even more so now. It’s interesting to see what’s happening in the city because it’s still being gentrified, but demographics haven’t changed so much.”
“There’s going to be a lot more money coming into Brockton and a lot more development,” he added. “I just hope that the way the city looks doesn’t change too much. I hope that people remain solid because there's a lot of investment that our community has made into this community.”
After his session at Audiomack, Invada committed himself to daily freestyling sessions, which helped him find his voice as a rapper. He made his Van Buren Records debut with the release of “Black Wall Street” in Aug. 2021, contributing verses on three tracks. The project’s opener “Jump Street” is the first professionally-recorded song by Invada to be released officially. The video for “Cult,” which dropped alongside the project, sees the rapper fit in seamlessly and confidently with his seasoned VB peers SAINT LYOR, FELIX!, and Luke Bar$. Invada’s gravel-voiced flow on the track sets the stage for a guest verse from trending Toronto rapper Jazz Cartier. Throughout the process of his first official VB release, Invada said that he felt at home.
“Since I had already been around, it felt mad natural,” the rapper said. “I was already hanging with everyone, going to the events, cracking jokes, already in the group chats. So it was just like: ‘Now I rap too.’”
In the year since “Black Wall Street,” Invada has developed an effortless, nearly mumble-like flow that draws on his influences from both the braggadocio of drill legend Chief Keef and the trademark nervous vocals of the late Drakeo the Ruler. On VB’s latest offering “DSM,” which dropped in September, Invada showcases his cold, menacing delivery over head-banging production on songs like “NOBODY SAFE,” which features an opening verse from Luke Bar$. While working on “Black Wall Street” and “DSM,” Invada learned that he raps best when his verse is placed towards the end of songs.
“I have the last verse on almost every song I'm on because I like to let everybody get their part off,” the rapper said. “It helps me focus. Once I get into that mode, it’s quiet.”
According to Invada, Van Buren is first and foremost a record label. Like Griselda, the Wu-Tang Clan, Odd Future, A$AP Mob, Bruiser Brigade or any other analogous hip-hop collective format, the members of Van Buren are part of the group, but also exist as independent solo artists. Invada said that he will always represent VB and plans to expand his solo career in new directions.
“I'm just working right now,” the rapper said. “I've found a pocket with a few local producers who are really working on something crazy. It sounds very different from what you've heard from me, but trust me, it's fire.”

Bazzi’s career has come a long way since his musical beginnings on the social media platform Vine in 2015, and his Halloweekend performance at House of Blues Boston felt like a celebration of this journey.
Although Bazzi’s Oct. 30 performance was a part of his “The Infinite Dream Tour” in support of his most recent album, the crowd was equally or even more excited to hear him perform the songs that gave him his start. Bazzi obliged.
Shortly after performing his 2018 hit song “Why?” which the young Boston crowd absorbed with cinema-like animation, Bazzi sang an improvised but confident solo to a years-old song that a fan cordially requested a performance of with a neon-pink sign. Although the lesser-known single was difficult for the mostly unknowing audience to participate in, many reacted with high-toned cheers and wide smiles to the Michigan-born singer’s confidence.
“Who the fuck dressed up tonight?” he said to the crowd, which celebrated the holiday dressed as a variety of fictional characters with varying levels of commitment. Bazzi, himself, was dressed to look like the legendary Elvis Presley in his 1957 film “Jailhouse Rock,” which he pulled off seamlessly, sporting the singer's iconic look: black denim pants and jacket over a black and white striped shirt. He always thought he looked like Elvis, he recalled. This Halloween costume made him realize he was probably mistaken.
Even before Bazzi took the stage, his opener, alternative pop-rock singer Seb Torgus began the Halloween festivities by performing his single “Dance with the Dead.” Although his music was largely unknown to the eager crowd, Torgus went about introducing the titles of his songs and hook lyrics before most performances in an attempt to involve the crowd. As a measure of his success, a fan threw him a Hawaiian lei, which he seamlessly integrated into his minimalist outfit.
Still, as he sported a zebra-print robe and leather jeans, Torgus casually walked up and down the stage with the nonchalance of a veteran performer.
As Bazzi took over, however, a large gray tarp fell to reveal the night’s subtle but natural floral theme.
“How cool is it that we are all here to enjoy music together and have fun,” Bazzi said after a few songs as he inaugurated the positive, light tone that he would maintain throughout the evening.
So light, in fact, was the atmosphere that roughly midway through his performance, Bazzi felt compelled to lie down on stage, close his eyes, and pretend to nap for a dozen seconds while the crowd cheered for him to return to his performance. Amidst the rapidly changing colored lights, which persisted throughout the concert and served to radiate energy and excitement through the three-story venue, it was impressive that Bazzi was able to maintain his stunt for so long.
Of all of his performances throughout the night, however, Bazzi’s most important was a recollection of a special moment that he had in Boston, which he shared with the crowd. The last time he was in Boston, he remembered, he walked down a road littered with statues of famous military personnel, but one statue, that of a sailor, resonated with him so deeply that it brought him to tears, he recalled. Beneath it was a quote that Bazzi delivered on stage.
“Dream dreams… then write them, but first live them,” he said.
His reason for bringing up the quote was its parallel in the modern, highly digitized world. He explained that although it can be initially rewarding to share our lives on the internet, we must live them first in the absence of social incentives, presently and in the moment, to lead happy lives.
On a night when Bazzi celebrated the release of his newest album with a fully packed crowd, the fantasy of many aspiring artists who were likely in the crowd, his message about enjoying the journey and all of life’s small moments was ultimately what humanized him most. Thus, by the end of the night, his show felt less like a one-man performance and more like a communal celebration of music, love, and life’s subtle joys.

On Saturday, Oct. 29, enthusiastic bibliophiles gathered at the Boston Book Festival for the 15th annual presentation of The Shirley Jackson Awards. Aptly held in the waning days of this spooky season, the awards recognize outstanding achievement in horror, the dark fantastic, and psychological suspense in six literary categories.
Co-hosted by horror authors Paul G. Tremblay and Elizabeth Hand, the ceremony included a hybrid of live and virtual reflections on trailblazing author Shirley Jackson’s work and its continued relevance to both authors and readers today. To Tremblay, Jackson’s appeal and resonance can be explained quite simply.
“I feel like we’ve never met a writer who didn’t say, ‘Oh, Shirley Jackson, yeah, she’s meant a lot to me.’ It’s very clear to me that she’s a foundational author of the 20th century, and one whose stories I think still very much speak to our experiences now,” he said.
“She is a writer’s writer,” said F. Brett Cox, President of the Awards’ Board of Directors. “She is a great role model for us all in writing what you want to write, writing what you believe in, writing what you know to be true. Looking at what’s underneath the surface in seemingly normal circumstances… Nobody does that better than she did.”
Tremblay, who serves as a member of the Board of Advisors, delivered the opening address and examined some of Jackson’s best known works such as novels “The Haunting of Hill House” and “We Have Always Lived in the Castle,” and her best known short story, “The Lottery.”
“I’ve been a fan of Shirley Jackson since I’ve been a reader,” he said. “When we started this award, we knew people loved Shirley Jackson, but I had no idea how pervasive her influence was.”
A literary powerhouse veiled beneath the façade of an American housewife, Jackson seems to parallel the sentiments of her character Merricat in “We Have Always Lived in the Castle.” “I can’t help it when people are frightened,” said Merricat. “I always want to frighten them more.”
For horror devotees, Shirley Jackson is synonymous with visceral, spellbinding prose and characters that haunt readers long after digesting the final page. It is no surprise that when her name is attached to a new work through a nomination, the literary community takes note.
“It’s been really overwhelming the reception the awards have gotten and how moved people are when they wind up being a finalist or winning an award named for Shirley Jackson,” said F. Brett Cox.
Like Jackson’s seminal body of work, the award crosses stylistic and geographical boundaries, nominating diverse authors from across the world. Awards Administrator JoAnn F. Cox described the importance of selecting works reminiscent of Jackson’s masterful storytelling, irrespective of genre.
“Sometimes the nominees are not even categorized, you wouldn’t know how to categorize them. But you read them, and think, ‘Oh yeah, it’s kind of strange, it’s kind of like a Shirley Jackson story,’” she said.
Before presenting the awards, Tremblay also enticed fans by confirming several exciting announcements, including the adaptation of his 2018 novel “The Cabin at the End of the World” into the newest M. Night Shyamalan film “Knock at the Cabin,” featuring actors Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, and Rupert Grint. Additionally, set to release in 2023, Elizabeth Hand has been authorized by the Shirley Jackson Estate to publish a novel directly based on “The Haunting of Hill House.”
“What I personally love about Shirley Jackson is that she helps bring forward the uncanny, and the unsettling, and the strange” said JoAnn F. Cox.
After all, “we are all trapped within our own haunted lives,” Tremblay said.
The same can be said for the newest winners of the Shirley Jackson Awards, works that transfix readers while exposing what haunts each and every one of us.
The 2021 Winners of the Shirley Jackson Awards are:

On Friday, Oct. 29, Boston Book Festival’s Secrets and Revelations Panel pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of a horror novel. From challenges of writing in multiple perspectives to the importance of extremely detailed outlining, Kayla Cottingham, Kendall A. Kulper ’08, and Sara Farizan took the stage at Boston Public Library’s Teen Central to discuss all the inner workings of how their novels came to be.
With all three of their books being firmly rooted in their setting, the novelists first discussed how they went about developing this aspect of their books. When Cottingham, the author of “My Dearest Darkest,” began developing the setting of her novel, she pulled lots of inspiration from both Wellesley and Emerson College. She specifically included tunnels into her fictional college due to her knowledge of there being secret tunnels at Wellesley College. She wasn’t the only one who included aspects of her real life into her novel, however: Farizan, the author of “Dead Flip,” took inspiration from her own life in the suburbs of Massachusetts, mentioning her choice to include Papa Gino’s, a Massachusetts-based pizza chain, in her novel.
Dealing with the structure of having multiple character perspectives was also discussed by the participants of this panel. Kulper, the author of “Murder for the Modern Girl,” revealed that she found it fun to write in a dual perspective as it allowed her to bounce between two character voices. With one of her characters being more peppy and the other dreary, she enjoyed describing certain scenes from different personalities. Similarly, Farizan had three different narrators when writing “Dead Flip,” and had to make sure they all sounded distinct, so when they were all conversing back and forth they felt like three separate people and were easily identifiable by the reader.
The novelists also talked about the journey from their first drafts to the final copies of their works. Farizan, for example, discussed how she took out multiple characters from her earlier drafts when she realized that her secondary characters were overshadowing her protagonists. Somewhat differently, Kulper, who felt like she wasn’t naturally funny, had to learn how to balance hopelessness with humor. Despite their differences, all three novelists emphasized the importance of having a detailed outline, as it serves as the roadmap for one’s story.
Katherine Nazzaro, moderator of the discussion and bookstore manager of Porter Square Books, visibly enjoyed speaking with the panelists as their books pertain to her interests. “I have a very eclectic reading type, but I am interested in YA and especially interested in horror which their books veer into a little bit,” she said when asked what her favorite genre of novels was.
Nazzaro wasn’t the only one who expressed interest in the horror genre, however, as Kulper herself stated that she would like to veer more in this direction with her future works. “I love reading it [horror] and I love watching it. My next book is going to be a bit more horror proper, as this one was more me exploring the genre.”
Kulper’s ability to delve into multiple genres seemed to entice audience members. “I am very interested in reading Murder for the Modern Girl,” said Maame Forroson ’25. “From the synopsis it seems to merge romance and magic with horror which I really enjoy.”
The panel finished with a conversation on how to incorporate fantastic elements into the real-world setting of the authors’ novels. Cottingam shared how she explored this through her LGBT character Finch, connecting the queer experience with the fantastic by showing that both are feared for their novelty. “I wanted to sort of combine the horror with queerness in a sense, as there is a sort of societal expectation when you come out that you’re going to fulfill some stereotype or lose apart of your identity.”
Overall the Secrets and Revelations Panel was a very engaging and insightful experience that gave a behind the scenes look into how horror novels are created and the personal influences that shine through an author’s work.

If you are looking for a Netflix drama to fill up your heart with love and then completely shatter it, watch “From Scratch” immediately.
This limited series based on Tembi Locke’s memoir of the same name, follows Amy (Zoe Saldaña), an American going to study art in Italy while on a gap year from Georgetown Law. Her life quickly gets flipped upside down as she not only falls in love but also discovers her true passion along the way.
Admittedly, Amy’s background could have been explored in more detail: The events that led to her leaving law school are not addressed very clearly, and viewers are not truly ever shown why she is so passionate about art either. However, these unanswered questions about Amy’s past do not take away from Saldaña's portrayal of Amy's ambition and grace.
Upon her arrival to Italy, Amy quickly becomes torn over two different lovers, but eventually chooses to be with an Italian cook named Lino. Although the development of their relationship moves at a very fast pace, it is impossible not to love their love. The series has an emotional plot that, combined with the actors’ amazing performance and chemistry, makes it insanely captivating for any viewer. Lino and Amy’s life together is painted as the perfect love story. But as quickly as their love for each other grows, their new life falls into shambles as Lino’s health begins to decline.
Despite the beauty of Amy and Lino's romance, the rapid pace of the series ultimately detracts from its story and character development. The show zooms through Amy and Lino’s life together, thus losing the minor details that make the story feel more personal and emotional to viewers. The lack of depth just causes viewers to feel more disconnected from Amy and Lino, and less invested in the plot, despite the show’s emotional subject matter.
Originally, Lino’s parents do not approve of his decision to be with Amy or to move to the United States with her. In conjunction with Amy’s parents constantly questioning Lino’s ability to provide for Amy, Lino definitely has to make larger sacrifices to make their relationship work. However, Lino’s sorrow seems to become the center of the series, as his health decays right after his family situation is resolved. It would have been beneficial to let his character thrive after this hardship, rather than piling more difficulties onto him.
The series gets quite predictable due to the endless negativity surrounding Lino, and at some point the viewers just want things to work out for him. It is unclear whether the purpose of this plot was more than to tug at the audience’s heartstrings. In combination with the pacing of the plot, it is strenuous to find the larger meaning within Amy and Lino’s story together.
But when their life was good, it was beautiful. They become part of each other's families, and although they come from two extremely different locations in the world, they complement each other perfectly. It should not be discounted how loveable the characters are in this drama: Viewers should root for all of them every moment throughout their eight-episode journey. It is impossible not to want a happy ending for this series due to the amount of trauma the families experience. This show will definitely leave you wanting more, and hopefully there is more to come.
Until then, for any viewer looking for a show to build their hopes up then destroy them in the best way possible, “From Scratch” is the perfect choice.

“Normal is a type of madness, isn’t it? I think it’s just that the only madness society allows is called normal,” writes Sayaka Murata in her short story collection “Life Ceremony.” With childlike naiveté and disorientingly flat prose that never passes judgment, Murata takes taboos to extremes to expose the ultimately arbitrary nature of societal norms. Without ever reaching a conclusive answer, she asks if and how those who see through society’s “temporary mirage of little lies” can retain their humanity and sense of self.
Sayaka Murata is a Japanese writer best known for her novel “Convenience Store Woman,” which deals with the pressure society puts on women regarding reproductive burdens and marriage. “Life Ceremony” is her first collection of short stories to be translated into English and extends this notion of societal pressure towards a general examination of norms.
In the titular story, grotesque “life ceremonies” are held as funerals at which the guests eat the deceased and participate in “inseminations” to create new life. Cannibalism, the reader learns, was taboo in the story’s society 30 years ago but is now widely accepted during life ceremonies, leading the protagonist to think, “Instinct doesn’t exist. Morals don’t exist. They were just fake sensibilities that came from a world that was constantly transforming.” In her view, norms are relative, a result of morally arbitrary factors like the time and place of a society.
Murata’s greatest strengths are her unapologetic, childlike questioning and wild imagination. She is not afraid of shocking the reader with topics like cannibalism but rather builds plausible societies around them that confuse the reader’s moral standpoints. Murata’s strange ideas are also what makes “Life Ceremony” an entertaining page-turner, and her paratactic, deadpan prose turns even the most disturbing horror stories into comedy.
The flat prose also conceals her judgment: Although her characters argue and discuss the question of norms, Murata’s voice never takes sides. She wants to create ambiguity and sensibility, not certainty. In contrast to the protagonist, another character in the story “Life Ceremony” calls the world a “brilliant mirage, a temporary illusion” that is simultaneously real: “All our little lies are gathered together and become a reality that you can see only now.” Although absolute norms may not exist, collective belief renders them tangible. Murata’s word choices — “mirage,” “illusion,” “lies” — asks the reader to challenge their notion of “reality.”
In “Life Ceremony,” the mirage falls apart when one sees through it. Murata is interested in what happens to those who do, those who refuse to conform. Some of her characters stay true to their beliefs and face ridicule and ostracization, some slowly conform or at least lose their grasp on right or wrong: “I just don’t know what to think anymore” and “maybe everyone’s right,” one thinks — thoughts the reader may also have throughout the collection.
Individuality and the need for belonging are constantly at odds in these stories. In “Eating the City,” a young woman named Rina lives in Tokyo while longing for her rural childhood surroundings which gave her access to fresh food. She starts foraging in Tokyo’s parks and eventually only eats food she has gathered in the city. Rina then slowly starts to manipulate her work colleague Yuki, persuading her to join her “alternative society” of foraging for wild food. Her psychoanalytic considerations are at once disturbing and insightful: “I had to avoid prematurely shocking her, paying deliberate respect to her perception based on her current understanding of common sense.” The concept of “common sense” — just like morals, values, and norms — here takes on Murata’s flavor of arbitrariness and relativity, posing the question: How many people have to believe in something to render it “common sense”?
In a masterful twist, Murata lets Rina subvert not only Yuki but also the reader. As Rina explains how she plans to convert Yuki, it slowly dawns on the careful reader that these tactics have been woven into Murata’s narrative from the beginning: Mentioning Rina’s homesickness as “the sort of comment anyone could empathize with” and later blending in her “feral sensations” to “slowly change that person.” In a direct quote, Rina tells Yuki her life story in exactly the same way as she introduced herself and her worldview to the reader at the beginning of the story.
Murata’s breaking of the fourth wall is almost a kind gesture, a disclosure of her own literary tactics that reveals how easy it is to manipulate others into accepting ideologies. Many of the stories in “Life Ceremony” are set in societies with norms that the reader may find repulsive and bizarre, yet the characters’ innocent belief in them subversively allays the reader’s alertness.
Rina’s behavior is also a characterization of humanity as social beings. We cannot be human without other humans, and it is “rational and convenient to blend into and be liked by a community,” as another character states elsewhere. Even a nonconformist like Rina longs for others to accept and join her alternate society. Rather than portraying this as a solution to the central dilemma of this collection, Rina’s cold and calculating manipulation adds another problematic dimension, a circular and ironic anti-solution.
“Life Ceremony” is a weirdly entertaining blend of horror, comedy, and dystopian fiction as well as social criticism bordering on philosophical inquiry. Murata understands that questions are more important — and more feasible — than answers. Her taste for tongue-in-cheek ambiguity and contradiction and her refusal of make-believe solutions are precisely why she can speak to the complexities of human existence, particularly those of our time.

Art museums are some of the world’s most important cultural institutions, and Harvard’s own museums are no exception. However, the objects of great museums can have ugly, bloody colonial pasts that they sweep under the rug.
An entire 47 works of the so-called “Benin Bronzes” at Harvard are part of this legacy. There are currently two bronzes in the Harvard Art Museum and 45 in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. The bronzes are beautiful and historically important metal sculpted busts, ivory statues, and coral beads. The history of the works, however, is marred by the atrocities and cultural robbery that tarnish the value of holding these works in museums like Harvard’s.
The Kingdom of Benin was a state in modern-day Nigeria that was the main player in trade with Europe on the Nigerian coast for centuries. The state was ruled by an Oba, or king, who was considered divine and was given ornate art that held extreme cultural significance.
In 1897, a group of British soldiers invaded Benin, massacring people who held swords and muskets with machine guns and artillery. They captured the Oba, pillaged all of the artwork from the palaces in the name of preservation, and burned the royal compound to the ground. Art from this horrific expedition was then shipped all over the world, ending up in museums all over the Western world, including Harvard.
Harvard acknowledges this atrocious history. The Harvard Art Museums’ website reads, “we acknowledge the violence and trauma of that expedition and understand how the presence of this cultural material in western museums is experienced as continued injustice by descendant communities.”
Despite their acknowledgment of harm, Harvard has not taken further steps to repatriate the stolen art that it now controls. The Benin Bronzes, even with their legacy of colonial violence and theft, remain in the University’s museums.
There is a precedent for repatriation of colonially pillaged art. The German Foundation of Prussian Cultural Heritage signed over ownership of 512 items to Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments this year, which constitutes the largest transfer of museum artifacts derived from colonialism to date. The Smithsonian, as well, has transferred 29 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria’s National Commission. But Harvard has remained relatively silent.
Some, like The Atlantic’s David Frum, have asked whether repatriation actually makes any difference. He argues that it was a victory for activists to even get African art the respect to be displayed in European museums as real art. It is also argued that the art is currently seen and appreciated by more people than it would be if it was not condensed in institutions like Harvard’s museums. And he is correct in saying that, no, transferring art cannot erase the atrocities of the past.
Still, the claim that Western museums care for the bronzes better than Nigeria could is inherently colonially minded. The art is a part of Nigerian history, and who has more of a right to easy access to it than the Nigerian public? Yes, institutions like the Louvre, or the British Museums, or even the Harvard museums allow a wide public to enjoy masterpieces of human achievement, but it is a skewed, Eurocentric view of the world that claims that Western audiences and tourists deserve access to this art more than the country the cultural artifacts were stolen from.
There is also controversy within Nigeria over what will happen with the returned art. Various stakeholders want vastly different things, with many pushing for a museum specifically dedicated to the legacy of Benin City, and the current Oba claiming personal ownership. This raises questions within Western establishments about who will actually get the returned art, whether it will be properly protected, and whether it will be displayed openly. But this is analogous to a thief forcing the group they stole from to prove they will take care of their own rightful property before returning the stolen goods.
Despite the nebulous nature of the proposed transfers, and the potential positive impacts of Western museum stewardship, art stolen by colonial powers should be returned, especially in this example which is the result of an abject atrocity. Harvard holds the responsibility to work actively towards the repatriation of these cultural marvels, especially since there is a clear precedent for this action.

For many years, the Asian American Dance Troupe (AADT) has presented Horizon as its fall semester cultural dance show, uniting students from the Boston Area to celebrate Asian heritage and identity. On Nov. 12, AADT sold out three consecutive shows housed in Lowell Lecture Hall with 15 dances each. In this series of photos, The Crimson relives the rhythms and action of the AADT Horizon.
Horizon began with “Flagship.” Choreographed by Cordelia Yu ’24 and Jeanna Shaw ’24, it was AADT’s traditional ethnic performance. This year’s “Flagship” dance alluded to traditional Chinese dance with fans, flutes, and traditional instruments.
“ON AIR” was a fast-paced hip hop dance that ignited the mood in Lowell Lecture Hall.
Guest performances also included “EXP” from the Harvard Expressions Dance Company (EDC).
“Bad Decisions Getting the Best of Me” was a jazz and ballet-inspired dance that culminated in a burst of energy at the end of the piece as dancers high-kicked in unison.
Hannah Liu ’23 lead the rest of AADT as they reinvisioned life in 1930s Shanghai in “Dawn,” painting a scene of elegance and poise.
“Kids Led Astray” featured the newest k-pop group on campus, and dancers explored the feuds and friendships of being young.
Morgan Lee ’25 and Sho Sho Leigha Ho ’24 choreographed “Revive,” a playful twist on the story of Ophelia and Hamlet.
“We’re Not Stoppin’” had the audience grooving with the music, as dancers on stage showed off their dance moves in fashionable outfits.
AADT Horizons closed with “BEYOND,” a stunning dance that incorporated elements of drama to explore the story and concept of “home.”

The Liberty Hotel embraced the holiday season in the latest Fashionably Late Thursdays fashion show with effortlessly glamorous styles from Bobbles and Lace. The show, in the Liberty’s richly decorated lobby, was a celebration of the vibrant elegance of Boston’s fashion scene, featuring shimmering and sleek holiday looks from Bobble and Lace’s new holiday collection. With the distinctly luxurious feel of the designs and venue, the night’s focus on accessible luxury was a refreshingly unexpected approach to fashion.
The Liberty’s Late Thursday shows stand apart from other fashion endeavors, as they used an interactive format to bring fashion eye-to-eye with the guests. This innovative take on the fashion show focuses on exploring everyday paths anew. Redefining ordinary spaces as potential runways, the show saw models ascending escalators, strutting through the crowd, and posing atop concierge desks to the live music of DJ Frank White. The models initially caught the audience’s attention as they posed around the hotel’s impressive circular balconies before appearing in the audience’s space on the lower level for an up close and personal look. Audience members crossed paths with models, laughing or blushing in surprise as they caught the spotlight. The unconventional catwalk format facilitated a direct conversation between fashion and guest: Attendees were often unknowingly welcomed into the show itself, the high pressure of high fashion dissipated for a more engaging and friendly atmosphere. Guests were invited to envision themselves in the models’ place, perhaps tracing their paths as the most exquisitely dressed at a holiday party.
Even the venue itself was anything but conventional. Originally the Charles Street Jail, the layered balcony space under a reclaimed lofty rotunda begs for a second look. Upon closer inspection, one could see features like original cell bars still intact and displayed around the hotel. The former prison space has been coaxed into the perfect sleek venue for a late night fashion show, old cells and guard watch stations mingling with vibrant lights and brilliantly illuminated hanging trees. Such rediscovery of the building’s potential served as an apt backdrop to the night’s theme of rediscovering the meaning of high fashion.
It was only fitting that the show removed the barriers between spectators and fashions, as this goal is shared by Bobbles and Lace owner Lindsay Rando. Rando insisted that fashion need not be taken so seriously or offered at serious prices. “It’s about fun fashion, affordably,” Rando said. “It’s there to make you feel good.” Indeed, the festive air of the night lent credit to her claim.
Having been at the center of the spotlight at four fashion shows at the Liberty Hotel now, Bobbles and Lace is now turning to unveil their holiday collection at nine locations from Portland, Maine to Westport, Connecticut. Three rounds of four looks from the new collection were selected for the show, displaying a practical versatility of occasion and style. Looks ranged from understated silky cocktail dresses to sparkly skirt and pants sets sure to set the wearer apart this holiday season. Take the classic festive style of the Gift Wrap Dress or the eye-catching fun of the Fair Feather Friend Top, for example. Sleek satins and rich faux feathers boasted by the designs strike a satisfying balance of unique and trendy. Quality materials supplement Bobbles and Lace’s innovative variations on the season’s hottest trends, noted by the audience’s rapt attention and the occasional delighted gasp at each of the twelve looks showcased.
Thursday’s show also featured the final “Get the Look” beauty bar of the Late Thursdays line-up. The makeup pop-up was hosted by Flyte 7.0, a company reinventing age-positive luxury makeup looks for the modern woman. As founders Carolyn Barber and Elena Frankel explained, the inspiration behind the makeup was simply growing older. No longer finding makeup products catered to their age, they created Flyte 7.0 as an accessible and practical line for everyday people — a message of attainability which was echoed throughout the night.
Fashionably Late Thursdays are hosted every Thursday from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. through Dec. 15. Details and RSVP are available here.

The program reviewed in this piece was performed at Symphony Hall on Oct. 27, Oct. 28, Oct. 29, and Oct., 2022.
The legendary Mitsuko Uchida — a two-time Grammy Award winning pianist and co-director of the prestigious Marlboro Music Festival — stepped into the limelight at Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Oct. 29 performance of Beethoven and Shostakovich with hesitance. Although met with rapturous cheers, her countenance betrayed just the faintest hint of discomfort, almost as if something bothersome was lurking beneath the torrent of applause.
Written more than 120 years apart, Beethoven’s Fifth Piano Concerto and Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony represent two stylistic extremes. Beethoven’s work — replete with compositional idiosyncrasies — dazzled audiences with its novelty while Shostakovich’s piece, subtitled “A Soviet Artist’s Response to Just Criticism,” represented a cautious step towards conforming to the Soviet regime’s musical conventions. Beethoven’s work gushes with almost superhuman vitality while Shostakovich’s work wavers between emotional extremes.
Yet, there are some similarities between the two landmark works. Beethoven began drafting his Fifth Piano Concerto while Vienna was under siege. Routine bombardments deeply affected the German-born composer. He wrote, “What a disturbing, wild life around me; nothing but drums, cannons, men, misery of all sorts." Shostakovich suffered from similar angst. Following the party’s condemnation of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, the Soviet composer — certain of his imminent arrest — began sleeping in the stairwell outside of his apartment. Both works are thus musical expressions born out of the very crucible of emotional turmoil.
The challenge in performing these two pieces thus lies in the balance between conveying the compositions’ intended effect and capturing each piece’s musical details. Saturday’s performance was a valiant effort, but not without a few stumbles. Uchida’s performance of Beethoven’s Fifth Piano Concerto “Emperor” with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) did not match the work’s liveliness and sparkle. Despite this, Uchida’s characteristic interpretive sensitivity exposed a dynamic range of colors and textures. Her command of the instrument thus revealed the work’s stylistic breadth with artistry. Nelsons’s conducting of the program’s second piece, Shostakovich’s famed Fifth Symphony, suffered from the opposite setback. In conveying the symphonic work’s emotional turmoil, the ensemble glossed over compositional details.
Under Uchida’s hands, the first movement of Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto — a flamboyant Allegro — was notably lacking in exuberance. Moreover, in more than one passage, technical imperfections interrupted the musical fiber, disrupting phrases otherwise shaped with finesse. Yet, Uchida’s execution of the sforzandos, fortissimos, and pianissimos peppered throughout the movement was spine-chilling.
Uchida’s performance of the concerto’s second movement (“Adagio un poco mosso”) was nothing short of masterful. Each note rang with expressive intent before effortlessly melting into the next. From these heavenly threads, Uchida stitched together passages of breathtaking nuance, clarity, and lyricism. Phrases, delineated by natural lines that pulsated with the texture of the music, floated comfortably at the threshold between overstatement and imprecision.
The concerto’s last movement — a rambunctious Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo — however, suffered from the same ills as the first movement. The movement’s bounding main theme, evocative of a German folk dance, felt strained and labored. Weighty chords detracted from Uchida’s otherwise tasteful interpretation.
Nelsons and the BSO then approached Shostakovich’s somber Fifth Symphony. The orchestra’s performance of the opening movement — a haunting Moderato — was expressive yet underdeveloped. In the ghostly introductory theme, the string section was incohesive. Throughout the movement, dynamics suffered from a lack of clarity. Softer passages felt barely demarcated, almost as if the orchestra was already rushing to more robust dynamics. Yet, moments of musical inspiration abounded. A buoyant percussion section propelled the soaring trumpet and trombone chorale to stunning heights. The movement’s ending — tense, quiet, and subtly phrased — was gripping, almost phantasmagoric.
The second movement — a playful, almost sarcastic, Allegretto — lacked the composer’s trademark musical liveliness and suffered from interpretive ambiguity. The woodwinds failed to render the almost sardonic quality of the movement’s principle theme. Although Alexander Velinzon’s performance of the movement’s violin solo was richly textured and exquisitely shaped, the oboe, horn, and flute’s responses could have done more to match the concertmaster’s dynamic phrasing.
The orchestra’s rendition of the solemn Largo, the symphony’s third movement, was spellbinding. The strings conveyed the composition’s heavenly introduction with unreal precision and artful expressivity. Piano passages were rendered with an almost undetectable softness that rang with ghost-like clarity throughout the hall. Each note reverberated with musical impulse, conveying a religiosity, reservedness, and natural lyricism fitting for such a requiem-esque arrangement.
The fourth movement — a racy Allegro non troppo — was not nearly as convincing. The movement’s introduction, marked by a dramatic accelerando, was distastefully rendered. Nelsons urged the orchestra to an extreme tempo at the expense of orchestral unity and any semblance of cohesive phrasing. The final brass chorale, though voluminous and bolstered by a vigorous string section, ultimately lacked sustained phrasing and musical direction. It seemed as if style finally triumphed over substance in the last moments of the program — a fitting conclusion for a sincere but labored performance.

A poem’s meaning is most often constructed from its words, but there is just as much, if not more, hidden within its silences and blank spaces. Local poets Allison Adair and Sandra Lim explored this theme of engaging silence in poetry at the Boston Book Festival on Oct. 29. In the workshop “The Silence After a Bell: Crafting Poems Beyond Language” hosted at the Goethe-Institut, Adair and Lim shared readings from their own collections, as well as from other poets, and invited workshop participants to consider the role and sound of silence in the auditory medium of spoken verse.
Adair and Lim began with a bell, which by virtue of its hollowness produces sound — it also fills the silence after its ringing with a lingering impression of its presence. They referenced an interview conducted with Li-Young Lee by Marie Jordan in “Breaking the Alabaster Jar,” in which Lee states that “language [is used] to inflect silence so we can hear it better… After church bells ring everything seems more quiet.” Lee describes his hope that “after a line or stanza[,] there’s a silence imparted to the reader.”
Considering silence in poetry is difficult because writers often think of writing as “putting words on the page,” said Adair. Writing is not seen as akin to “Michelangelo carving away stone to reveal something,” she noted. Yet “silence is an expressive gesture,” said Lim. Silence creates a delicate balance of expectation and surprise in a poem, dependent upon a trust built between the writer and reader. Lim encouraged writers to consider “where in the poem you should make a hollow so that the words can reverberate.”
Adair read a poem about, among other things, haggis; Lim a poem about Jean Rhys. They also read “Traveling through the Dark” by William Stafford and “Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods” by Tishani Doshi, along with other poems that grapple with imbued silence in different ways.
Workshop attendee Kurt F. Klopmeier came to the workshop with the goal of learning how these poets think about their own writing. He works as an academic and career advisor at UMass Boston, has a master’s degree in poetry, and writes himself.
“I think poetry innately uses silence in ways that prose might not; think jazz to classical music,” said Klopmeier. “Poetry uses silence both on the page, like the empty space [the panelists] were talking about, and in the mind, like images that don’t necessarily close off with a period.”
Katherine M. LaFond was also interested in creating a poem to play with sound. She is currently working on a poem about clocks.
“I thought it'd be interesting to hear about how silence can be engineered to say what I would want to say with sounds and words,” LaFond said. “I am dyslexic, and I have a really hard time writing long pieces of work. Organizing a story is hard for me. But poetry is like a snapshot; you can say a lot of deep things with only a couple words. It's much easier for me, having language based learning disabilities, to use poetry to write and express myself because of this condensed format.”
Attendee Susan Roberts, a professor at Boston College, especially appreciated how the workshop brought writers together.
“I've been in writing and thinking about language and words for a long, long time. Coming to [the Boston Book Festival] was just a nice shot in the arm because we do everything in isolation,” said Roberts. “Unless we get together once a week and share our work, the generation of it, the editing, the revision, all of that is happening privately. To be in a community of writers is a gift.”

This review contains spoilers for Season One of ‘Vampire Academy.’
After a season full of twists, betrayals, and deaths, the season finale of “Vampire Academy,” which premiered on Oct. 27, still had multiple cards up its sleeve. Titled “Ascension,” the episode stays true to its name, as it tries to one up itself with several plot twists that never have time to fully strike their chords.
The episode hits the ground running as the guardians struggle to deal with an unexpected strigoi attack on the Dominion. Graphic scenes of strigoi murdering and hungrily feasting on the citizens of the Dominion succeed in emphasizing the terror of the predicament. With the guardians being both unprepared and outgunned, Dimitri (Kieron Moore) is let out of prison and Mason (Andrew Liner) and Rose (Sisi Stringer) return from their desertion to help. Unfortunately, this choice lessens the impact of the previous episode as it doesn’t let the audience sit with the characters’ absence, especially after framing it as a pivotal moment.
The strigoi’s entrance into the Dominion is due to Tatiana (Anita-Joy Uwajeh), who is revealed as the season's main villain. Not only did she steal the stake that kept the wards up, but she’d also kidnapped Andre (Jason Diaz) and had been holding him hostage the entire season. The plot twist, definitely meant to be a “WTF” moment, instead elicits more confusion from its viewers. That Andre could be kidnapped without Lissa noticing, even though she was mere feet away, is quite unbelievable. Even stranger, Tatiana’s motive is never revealed: All viewers learn is that she only wants to be queen for the title and doesn’t actually want to rule. Though her true motives may have been intentionally left out for further exploration in a potential season two, Tatiana ultimately comes across as a basic villain without any nuance.
The biggest plot twist of the season finale is without a doubt the return of Andre Dragomir, who had been kidnapped by Tatiana and forced to give advice on how to ascend the throne. This reveal feels empty from the start: From the moment Andre comes back on screen, it is very obvious his resurgence is temporary. This is proved true as shortly after escaping Tatiana’s capture he is turned strigoi, moments after reconnecting with Lissa (Daniela Nieves). Even still, this moment had little emotional impact. The common trope of loved ones coming back to life and then dying in the arms of the main character is too overused to strike a chord with audiences. Ultimately, Andre’s reemergence feels unnecessary, as it doesn’t add anything to the story or cause any added character development for Lissa.
The episode ends with Tatiana’s official ascention to the throne after the murder of the Queen (Pik Sen Lim). With fingers being pointed at Lissa, she and Rose leave the Dominion as they go on the run. This turn of events is perplexing, as the season ends where Richelle Mead’s “Vampire Academy” novels begin. Straying from the source material is a bold choice that throws into question where the story will go from here.
Overall, the season finale of “Vampire Academy” falls short as it leaves the audience feeling empty-handed. The many plot twists don’t stick as the lack of explanation for them causes confusion. The series’ open ending presents an opportunity to start over in a potential second season — but with no clear path in the show’s overall arc, the fall could be disastrous.

The pursuit of a good life does not just mean maximizing happiness — it also means listening deeply to loss and pain, which is inextricably linked to joy. In the panel “How to Live: Purpose, Joy and a Dash of Philosophy,” hosted by the Boston Book Festival on Oct. 29, authors Kieran Setiya, Ellen Warner, and Ross Gay shared attentive approaches to living well. As sunlight gleamed through stained glass windows into the sanctuary of Old South Church, each author presented a summary of their book and answered questions facilitated by Harvard psychiatry professor Robert Waldinger.
“Breaking news: Life is hard,” began Kieran Setiya, author of “Life is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way.” Setiya joked that while Instagram influencers often spread the message that people should “live their best life,” we can trace this frame of mind back to ancient Greek philosophers who imagined utopias. In reality, life is full of difficulties; through his own experience with chronic pelvic pain, Setiya set out to explore philosophy that acknowledges adversity rather than fixating on (often unrealistic) positivity.
Pain disrupts one’s ability to engage with others, but sharing invisible hardships can bring people closer together. Setiya introduced a thought experiment: If humans were plugged into a simulation that allowed them to fully experience a life free from pain and worry, they would not find that life meaningful. Thus, we should forget about the ideal or perfect life, and instead focus on “making the best of a bad lot,” Setiya concluded. He offered his book as a deeper philosophical exploration of maladies that people face in life and potential remedies.
The next author on the panel, photojournalist Ellen Warner, spent over 15 years working on “The Second Half: Forty Women Reveal Life After Fifty.” Her book combines photo portraits with advice from women around the world who are older than 50. Warner shared a slideshow of photo portraits along with a rapid-fire distillation of her subjects’ advice.
People should widen their horizons and continue trying new things as they get older, and “cultivate an interior space” where they can retreat when life is difficult, Warner said. People need discipline: both in approaching diet and exercise, but also in pursuing new interests. “Love is not a given, you have to work on it,” she said. As people become older, there is more paring away of the extraneous, which she compared to making a “simpler meal with better ingredients.” Friendship and generosity become more and more important. “Forget all that self-interest. People need to be nurtured,” she said. What “you thought was important becomes less important”; there is “less doing, and more being,” she said. The bottom line, Warner concluded, is that the second half of life is better than the first, because now one knows how to deal with any obstacle.
Lastly, poet Ross Gay shared his essay collection “Inciting Joy.” He read directly from the book’s introduction, which challenges the common notion that joy is free of pain and sorrow — a notion which also implies that joy is a consumer state that one can purchase. Instead, he believes that everyone needs to widen their definition of joy: Joy emerges from how people care for each other through “the bleak stuff,” he said. Sorrow is a neighbor that people should invite in and seek to understand, including both personal sorrows and the sorrows of friends and strangers. Several essays in the book detail Gay’s practices that have structures of care embedded within them, ranging from gardening to pickup basketball. Gay concluded that joy is what humans use to help each other survive.
The crowd of nearly one hundred was animated, often breaking into laughter or murmurs of assent. “I've always wanted to come to the Boston Book Festival, but this is the first time I've ever made it,” said Marah Gubar, a professor of children’s literature at MIT. She said that October is especially busy, but she’s “glad she could come to the festival” and was excited to meet some of her favorite authors.
“I loved the common thread of human connection,” said Karin Dolce, a returning Boston Book Festival attendee who considers herself a new Bostonian. “Coming off the last two years of Covid, many of us have been reflecting on that common theme, whether we had significant human connection during the past two years, or whether that was something that was missing or looking very different in our lives.”
Another attendee, Lydia Mullan, felt hopeful after attending the panel. “Being sad is really easy right now. People have been really isolated and lonely, and there has been a lot of tragedy and atrocities in the world in the past couple of years,” she said. But Mullan stated that she wants to “invest in happiness and joy.” She believes that the panel reinforced that “we all have a choice to frame our lives in ways that can bring us more joy.”

The Western hemisphere is familiar with musical giants like Beethoven and Mozart and the beautiful compositions they left behind on the five-lined staves in treble and bass clef. Yet long before this form of musical notation began in the West, there was a composer in the horn of Africa who had created his own notational system and had established a tradition of musical pedagogy that would continue to this very day. His name was Yared.
Yared lived in the sixth century during the height of the Aksumite Empire, what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea. Like many early composers, Yared was a religious leader and a scholar of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He is most known for devising an eight-note (and later ten-note) notation system of music, which could form three different melodic categories. With the involvement of Ethiopian instruments such as the cistrum, (known in the ancient Ethiopic language of Ge’ez as ጸናጽል, the staff (መቋምያ), and the drum (ከበሮ), he spent the majority of his life composing thousands of hymns and teaching his students his notational system. This eventually led to a complex system of oral tradition and musical pedagogy known as “abinet” or “fatherhood,” which has lasted for 1500 years and is still present today.
Before going into detail about the music of Yared, or about the ancient traditions of his music, it is important to first grasp the most foundational aspect of “Yaredian” music: its worldview. Yared is considered not only an important figure in Ethiopian history, but a legendary figure with a miraculous story. This is indicative of the hagiographical approach Ethiopia takes to her heroes.
The story of Yared starts with the tale of his life as a young student. We are told that as a young man, Yared traveled to Aksum to learn religious studies from his uncle. After failing to keep up in his studies for six consecutive years, Yared retreated to a nearby forest. Yared, in his desperation, found the endurance to continue by looking at a caterpillar. It was in the seventh year that the legend states that Yared’s mind was opened and he was able to grasp what was taught and become a learned scholar. This leads us to the legend of how Yared discovered his musical inspiration:
This story takes us to the center of the Yaredian and one might say Ethiopian philosophy of music. It tells us that music does not come from within us, but reveals itself through us after descending from on high. It is the three birds, each representing a musical mode, that give Yared his musical inspiration. This is the essence of the legend of Yared. The name Yared itself means descension, a reference to how the music of heaven descended down to the realm of humanity. Yared becomes a prototype of the musician who must elevate to the higher realm to gain inspiration, and must make himself submissive to the inspiration. While Yared is considered a real person, the hagiographical approach to his life makes his story an allegory of a deeper message.
In Ethiopia, the melodies of Yared are not just considered beautiful but literally heavenly. This understanding serves as a fundamental tenet to the religious pedagogy of Yaredian music. The scholars who teach Yaredian melodies are careful to make sure that every note is sung correctly, without distortion, out of respect for where it came from. In the Ethiopic language of Ge'ez, the verb ቃነየ meaning “to present music,” and the verb ተቀነየ meaning “to submit” both sound and look virtually the same, an intentional similarity. Music is at its core an act of submission to inspiration. We let the art guide us, instead of us guiding the art.
Yaredic music is said to create a form of contemplative ecstasy, in which the music they are singing gives them a kind of out-of-body experience to the point that they have no awareness of their surroundings. This is based on another legend of Yared, which recounts how when Yared was presenting his melodies to the Emperor of the Aksumite Empire, the two of them both experienced a trance-like state. During this, the Emperor unknowingly impaled Yared’s foot with his staff, a fact which they only realized after Yared had finished singing.
The transcendent approach to music in the Yaredian worldview suggests that music is eternal. The legend of Yared doesn’t end with his death, but concludes that he was hidden away and is still alive. This is a common way to end a legend in Ethiopian culture as it makes the figure’s contribution immortal. Just as Yared’s music lives on, he does too — in the legend, and in his music, which is still of paramount importance today.
While Yared’s music has lived on in the local regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea, it has not gained the acknowledgement it deserves by the rest of the world. Though there are a minority of academic scholars who have analyzed his work, the attention given to him does not compete with his Western counterparts. It’s time for admirers of the arts to give Yared his due. We may not have traveled to heaven and back, but we can step into a different world and culture through the melodies of Yared.
—Mihret Melaku’s Column, ‘Three Little Birds: Yared’s Inspiration From Above’ is about the Ethiopian composer Yared and his musical notational system.

Capturing a slice of Bostonian life in only one hundred words is a difficult task, but “Boston in 100 Words” contestants boldly embrace the challenge. On Saturday, Oct. 29, past winners of the contest, current judges, and the contest’s lead organizer Jane De León Griffin joined local Boston residents at the Boston Book Festival to present a panel discussing topics ranging from the creative process of tackling 100 word-vignettes to building community through storytelling. Winners of the contest will have their stories transformed into illustrations by local artists that will be displayed on digital screens throughout downtown Boston and on over a thousand posters throughout the MBTA system.
Among the panelists was Louis Frank, an ESL and music teacher as well as the first place winning author in 2020. With his 100 words, titled “Freedom Trail,” Frank tells the story of a friend visiting Boston who thought she had walked the Freedom Trail, but in reality defined her own path, passing stores with Spanish names, camped cop cars, and Fenway Park.
“As a teacher, I had taken students on field trips to the official Freedom Trail,” said Frank. “I thought the irony of [my friend] Julie mistaking the Freedom Trail for the actual path [that she took] to be really sweet.”
“The reason I was so happy to see [this] story win first place in our first ever contest was because we're hoping that these stories are, in a way, like an inside joke that only people who know the city really well would understand,” said De León Griffin. “If you don't know that Julie didn't really walk the Freedom Trail, then Louis's story doesn't have the same impact. But for those of us that hear all those places, we know that that's not the real trail. That's what makes the story beautiful; the Freedom Trail doesn't have to just be that red brick line that all the tourists follow, it can be whatever you make it.”
Past successful stories also took on more retrospective tones. Tristen Grannum, the 2021 honorable mention winning author, wrote a story inspired by his childhood experience. His 100 words capture how a game of cricket in Franklin Park reminds him of his parents’ upbringing.
“My parents immigrated to the United States in the 1970s, and they basically built a life in Boston,” said Grannum. “One of the things that helped connect them to home was cricket; my father played cricket and a lot of people that we got to know in the Boston community played. It was that and [reggae played on the radio] that really kept them grounded in the culture and identity of the Caribbean.”
Later, Shirley Jones Luke, an English teacher at Boston Public Schools and one of this year’s judges, shared what she tells her students when teaching storytelling: Everything is worth writing about, and no story is too insignificant.
“How your family navigated Covid, how the pandemic affected you, your schooling, and how we're trying to recover: Those are stories in the now that you can write about that are fresh,” said Jones Luke. “You want to capture those memories.”
She also discussed how this advice relates to how she will go about judging this year’s submissions: “You'd be surprised at, when you put something in the world, who it might connect with, who might resonate with your work. As a judge for ‘Boston in 100 Words,’ I'm looking for that connection from the person who, in their 100 words or less, makes an immediate impact.”
Theresa Okokon, another judge for this year’s contest, shared similar sentiments on the nature of what constitutes a story. As someone who teaches nonfiction, essay, and op-ed writing, she finds herself constantly telling her students that “what is happening to you matters and is interesting.”
In reference to the details included in past winners’ stories, from street names to radio stations, Okokon said, “those tiny little mentions are so small, but so sticky and important; you can create a whole 100 word world around this little thing that sticks with you.”
Although the panel only featured winners of the general category (i.e. contestants over the age of 17), “Boston in 100 Words” accepts stories from writers of all ages. In fact, the contest seeks to amplify the voices of people who might not consider themselves artistically or authorially-inclined. Afterall, as Okokon said, “storytelling is the art of performing about your own life.” Indeed, each contestant’s 100 words of Boston come uniquely from their own eyes and lived experiences.
This year will be the third annual contest. The deadline to submit to ‘Boston in 100 Word’s’ third annual contest is Dec. 17th. The submission page can be found here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kamila Shamsie, author of several successful novels and writer for the Guardian presents a story on friendship, politics, and the boundaries of loyalty in her newest book, “Best of Friends.” The novel can be split into two narratives, each separated by 30 years and thousands of miles.
The first portion of the book is set in Karachi, Pakistan in the late 1980s.The novel follows two best friends in their early teens, Maryam and Zahra, as dictatorship makes tensions rise in their community. Maryam lives a life of comfort, privilege, and political influence, while Zahra is the daughter of a schoolteacher and a journalist who hosts a popular national cricket television program.
Shamsie does a nice job illustrating the way class can insert itself into even the closest of friendships — often in unsaid, almost indistinguishable ways, and sometimes in conversation-stopping, silencing ways. The cracks and canyons caused by class in close relationships are not lost on Shamsie, and this gives her characters an authenticity that is more than welcome.
After several chapters of introduction and buildup, the book takes off when Zahra convinces Maryam to ride home from a party with Jimmy and Hammad, two older boys. The men taunt and intimidate the girls, the threat of physical and sexual violence running just below the surface of their voices. While they could technically only be legally charged with reckless driving, the impact is crystal clear: This was an instance of gendered, and inherently sexual, violence and trauma.
The evening spurs a series of events that ends with Maryam sent to boarding school in England and Zahra left to finish secondary school without her. But more importantly, this event and the men that facilitated it are the axis, really, that the rest of the book revolves around.
Now, this could have been an effective tool, and it frequently is; the trauma bond is no new phenomenon to the contemporary reader. The problem here, though, is that the trauma and the way it bonds Zahra and Maryam gets muddled — dare I say, faded — over the course of the novel, which would have been fine if Shamsie hadn’t kept insisting on the reassertion of its importance. The two women that lead this novel are strong, complex personalities; they are assertive, successful, and not always totally agreeable, but — more often than not — fundamentally likable. Shamsie gives both of her characters the space and time to be full, multifaceted people.
So, while acknowledging this car ride from their teens as traumatic does the important work of identifying gender violence as something that can be nuanced (and never requiring physical harm to be legitimate), as the characters age, their relationship aging is more interesting than dredging up this scary memory. If Shamsie wanted to make this night the focal point of the novel, she either needed to make the personal/emotional impact of the event stronger or make the event itself more dynamic.
The second part of the book jumps ahead to 2019 in London and begins with a Guardian profile of Zahra and a Yahoo! Finance article on Maryam. The faux journalism is an awkward way to inform the reader of where the women’s adult lives have taken them, but they are not necessarily unpleasant. What is unpleasant, however, about the second portion of this novel is the startling lack of detail in some places and the excess attention given to others.
The entire novel struggles with visual details — very few scenes are described, few people are given physical characteristics, and movement between people, scenes, and places is not written in a way that permits the reader any rights to visualization. While the first part of the novel focuses on class in Karachi, once Zahra and Maryam move to London, this tension dissipates almost entirely, and the adjustment of moving from Pakistan to the United Kingdom goes totally unaddressed. Meanwhile, the reader spends a tedious amount of time considering the intricacies of Zahra’s human rights advocacy and the way that bristles against Maryam’s profit-over-all perspective.
Although reading about these parts of the characters’ lives can be interesting, the decision to include them feels awkward — not bad, just not what the reader was expecting (or wanting, for that matter). The prose works well, and everything that Shamsie addresses is important — but that’s part of the problem. In choosing to incorporate content and characters that all demand large amounts of attention, some don’t get what they deserve and others are overdone. And, all the while, the reader is not granted access to the images needed to process all these narrative pieces in a cohesive way. That’s not to say that every book owes its reader a rich, visual world, but this contemporary novel does and doesn’t step up to the challenge — or even acknowledge the challenge at all.
All in all, this book is not Shamsie’s best work, but it’s more than worth reading. The characters are dynamic and well-developed, and the plot is anything but boring. The friendship of Zahra and Maryam is a pleasure to witness, and Shamsie’s argument on the nature of violence towards women is astute and important. Unfortunately, the novel’s ultimate shortcoming is simply that some aspects are half-baked and underwhelming.

On Oct. 26, following a successful run in New York, the Emerson Paramount Center welcomed the Tony-Award winning actor, clown, and comedian Bill Irwin and his show “On Beckett.” The expectations for the show, which was originally developed at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, were high: Its New York run had been met with raving reviews and celebrated as “captivating…radiant, living theater” by the New York Times. But Bill Irwin did not disappoint, delivering a refreshing and deeply personal reflection on Samuel Beckett’s life and work with just the right amount of comic relief.
“On Beckett,” an original play, entirely written and performed by Bill Irwin, explored Irwin’s own relationship with Samuel Beckett's work as a performer. The show offered a fresh perspective on the Irish dramatist’s plays, by exploring the beauty and the challenges of Beckett’s writing — famous for its thought-provoking and at times frustrating nature — and invites the audience to do the same.
“On Beckett” is not your typical one-man show, but rather a somewhat chaotic collage of Beckett’s work, alternating passages from some of the writer’s most famous works — including “Watt,” “Waiting For Godot,” and “Texts For Nothing” — with commentary based on his personal thoughts, questions, and revelations. The mix proves surprisingly successful.
In “On Beckett” Bill Irwin reminds audiences what great theater acting should look like. Irwin is the kind of actor who has total control over his own voice and body. He approaches each scene with profound emotional realness, embodying various characters and roles authentically through precise vocal work and bodily agility. With breathtaking speed, Irwin jumps between his two different roles: Actor and commentator. Throughout the show, he elegantly put each scene into context by offering extensive background information on Samuel Beckett and his work. It didn’t matter if one was an avid Beckett fan or someone entirely new to the writer’s plays: Irwin extended a powerful invitation to engage with Beckett’s work to each and everyone, successfully taking his audience on an exhilarating intellectual journey.
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what “On Beckett” is — it is not a play, it is not standup, and it is not improvisation. Perhaps the most apt description would be it is the best theater lecture to date.
But make no mistake. Bill Irwin is no lecturer; He is an entertainer. “On Beckett,” is one of the few shows that flourished in its staging as a one-man show precisely because of Irwin’s natural talent as a performer. His nuanced performance was perfectly complemented by a limited set and minimalistic lighting design, letting him fill every inch of the stage with his imagination.
Irwin carefully draws the audience into a lively and vivid discussion. He connected the 20th century plays with some of today’s most important social challenges, yet never failed to leave room for disagreement, and criticism. Bill Irwin beautifully acknowledged that even the greatest actors sometimes cannot make sense of great writing. There was something highly resonant, relatable, and refreshing in Irwin’s humility and willingness to openly explore his own uncertainties on stage.
“On Beckett” never ceased to be refreshing despite — or perhaps because of — the unexpected lack of a traditional intermission. “Samuel Beckett’s writing is natural clown territory,” Irwin said. He clearly took advantage of this, creating his own intermissions that skillfully contrasted serious theater and profound commentary with light-hearted play.
The idea that Ireland’s most famous playwright might pair well with red clown noses might sound strange, but it worked, serving not only as comic relief but also giving the audience a new avenue to explore Beckett’s writing. Granted, at times it was puzzling to see Irwin change into his clown gear, and as he launched into vaudeville show numbers, the audience admittedly found itself torn between two different worlds. But it was precisely this dichotomy that kept the audience engaged throughout the show.
After 90 minutes, the lights on stage started to dim. Bill Irwin looked at the audience one last time before saying his final line: “This is all I have to say tonight, “ skillfully leaving the audience wanting more — more “On Beckett” and more Bill Irwin.

It was a party they would never forget. When a bunch of overworked, rich teenagers decide to blow off some steam and party in a house under construction, they leave it in ruins and their lives are changed forever. Causing around 100 thousand dollars in damage, the teenagers are all in deep water, putting their bright futures in serious jeopardy. Entering a conversation about wealth and white privilege, “The House Party,” investigates the issues that plague seemingly perfect suburban towns. Rita Cameron hits the nail on the head with her take on how the justice system treats those with privilege versus those without, but she unfortunately fails to treat the serious topic of sexual assault with the sensitivity that it deserves.
Though the story follows the teenagers who attended the house party, their parents end up taking the spotlight. The wealthy parents of New Falls all succumb to toxic ideals as they refuse to hold their children accountable. “Kids will be kids,” becomes their common catch phrase in defense of their children's actions as they cut deals with law enforcement to get them off the hook. This characterization is nicely juxtaposed by some of the working-class parents, such as Linda O’Conner, who disagrees with shielding the kids from the consequences of their actions: “We can’t protect our kids from the real world, and we shouldn’t try.” Cameron’s characterization of the divide between the upper and middle classes sheds light on how money can affect people’s carelessness and repentance, to wondrous effects. As the juxtaposition creates a bittersweet humor, highlighting how ridiculous the upper-class families are in an unfortunately realistic way.
The foundation of the novel is its social commentary on wealth, which stands strong. Cameron enters the conversation by focusing on how the enforcement treats the kids with lots of money, versus the kids without it. Chief of Police Whitman Quarry attempts to pin the entire party on the “local yokels,” otherwise named as the working class, and let the other kids off with a warning. “I know a few of these names. They’re good kids, but they made a mistake. Let’s not rock the boat,” he says. The tendency for law enforcement to go easier on people with lots of influence and power is problematic, as they focus more on protecting their personal relationships and less on getting justice for victims. This is exactly the point Cameron makes, as Whitman is eventually called out in an article for his problematic behavior. Cameron makes poignant commentary on our current law enforcement through sad but realistic dialogue, as it shows how little law enforcement cares about injustice when its perpetrators come from wealthy and white backgrounds.
The novel falters heavily, however, regarding its sexual assault storyline, as it takes a back seat to the rest of the story and makes it feel like a cheap plot device. The storyline starts in the beginning of the novel when Maddie, one of the middle-class protagonists, is assaulted by an unknown man, causing Will to break a glass window to save her. The scene moves in quick succession, as Cameron captures the trauma of it all without using too many vivid descriptions. With the party turning to chaos immediately after this scene, it’s clear that Maddie’s sexual assault is what catapults the main plot into place. But throughout the rest of the book, Maddie gets little to no focus in the story, with most of what happens to her being relayed through other characters' perspectives and not her own. Not giving Maddie’s experience and recovery decent page time leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the readers, as the treatment of such a serious storyline leaves much to be desired.
Overall, Cameron succeeds in her powerful commentary on privilege and power, as she speaks to the problems that many of those with privilege love to ignore. But with so much focus on the social commentary, the sexual assault storyline gets painfully ignored to the point of negligence. It’s clear there were many things Cameron wanted to say and point out in “The House Party,” but by juggling too many arguments, the novel fails to dig deep into all its serious topics, leading it to feel more superficial than it should.

I was 15 when I first visited my homeland for the first time. My mother’s stories and media like “Coco” had familiarized me with aspects of my Mexican culture, but this didn’t compare to seeing it in person. One of the things that stood out to me the most from my two-month excursion was the Hacienda-style homes in Guanajuato. The neon and pastel tones were beautiful expressions of individuality, life, and joy. Now my mother’s insistence on hand painting our living room in the bright pastel blue shades and the light-colored yellow tones of my childhood bedroom (however tacky they might have seemed at the time) made sense.
Because of the complex variations in color, lighting, and texture in landscapes like Veracruz and Guanjuato (note the deep purple stones of the bridge versus the bright bushy tops of the trees), I often use underpaintings to guide my work. Underpaintings are monochromatic compositional base layers that help match color values, create tonal foundations, and add warmth and unity to a piece.
In this underpainting, I used diluted Winsor and Newton Burnt Umber (oil paint mixed with Linseed oil, a fast drying paint medium) to map out the various shades prior to beginning the painting. I added more linseed oil to areas with more light (like the rightmost edge of the dome) and added more paint to deepen dark shades (like the edge of the mountain tops and the shadows looming over the water below the bridge). Although I never did get around to finishing this painting, this and the watercolor piece (both of which currently hang in my mother’s room) serve as a reminder of my family’s cultural ties and the complex beauty of Mexican architecture.

If the horror genre is all about exploiting viewers’ fears of death and violence, it stands to reason that horror filmmakers need to find more sensational ways to do so. Bloody violence or gore is a physical manifestation of this fear that serves an important role in some horror movies as long as it has direction, but when gore lacks direction, its inclusion can make a movie feel lazy and reliant on shock factor. The sensationalization of death and gore in horror is disturbing not only because of any negative psychological effects on viewers but because of its over-saturation due to a lack of originality within the genre.
When opponents of gore discuss its presence in film, they tend to bring up the potential psychological harm it can have on audiences — but this reasoning is merely speculative. One of the largest critics of gore in horror is Gianluca Di Muzio, who argued in his 2006 paper in the “International Journal of Applied Philosophy,” “The Immorality of Horror Films,” that it is unethical to engage with “slasher” and “gorefest” movies either as an artist or consumer. His argument focuses on the effects gore has on our ability to “react compassionately to the sight of human victimization.” While Di Muzio’s argument is compelling and similar thought processes have played into mainstream pro-censorship arguments, there is limited evidence that engaging with gore has negative long term effects on our ability to react with “compassion.”
Although the psychological effect argument against gore may be weaker, excessive gore can still hinder a movie by reducing it to a dimensionless and unoriginal gorefest. Instead of reinvigorating the horror genre with new ideas, innovative design (not more CGI), or new perspectives — especially during a time where remakes of classic movies are very popular — creators have opted for shock value, anticipating a squeamishly profitable audience. “Tusk” (2014) epitomizes this tactic, in a disturbing story following podcaster Wallace Bryton as he is tortured and mutilated by a man hoping to turn him into a walrus. The film lacks meaning and attempts (and fails) to make up for it with gory scenes.
It is important to note that gore is not necessary to make a compelling and horrifying story. There are several examples of great horror movies with little to no gore. From classics like “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968) to more recent films such as “Midsommar” (2019) these films are able to evoke fear by manipulating our deepest fears through carefully curated innuendo and imagery designed to horrify without the overt gratuitous gore. Sympathetic and relatable characters are also essential vehicles for this genre to be effective. One of the most disturbing parts of “Midsommar” is Dani’s humanity, which makes her empathetic to the audience. Once this connection is established, suspense is created not by giving everything to the audience, but by meticulously withholding key information and revealing it, if at all, precisely at the right moment for maximum impact.
The score, too, must be a living breathing part of the film that is synchronized with the plot. In “Rosemary’s Baby”, the unsettling soundtrack sets the tone for the movie. The variations in music playing during the serene versus more hectic moments are subtle but powerful. The cinematography must capture the chilling essence of the story with each frame. The cinematography in “Midsommar” served to effectively subvert the fear-of-the-dark trope with brightly colored aesthetics and visuals that make the viewer feel like they have nowhere to hide.
Too much gore can detract from either the scariness or the watchability of a movie. The “Final Destination“ franchise, for example, includes five movies that consist of people dying violent deaths in dramatic fashion. The level of violence becomes comical because it is so over-the-top. Characters' deaths range from dying in a tanning bed to being impaled by a ladder. The concept of the movie is enough to frighten any viewer, but the manner, number, and graphic nature of the deaths give the movie a more humorous tone, which is great if you’re watching “Scary Movie,” but can hurt the film if you’re looking to be scared. On the other end of the spectrum, movies like “The Human Centipede“ series can feature too much graphic footage for even the biggest gore enthusiast. The characters endure such disgusting torture sequences that it is hard not to feel like a sadistic voyeur.
Horror movies are often predicated on the idea of otherness and demonizing people based on their perceived differences, and because of its symbolic usage, gore can feel particularly pointed against certain groups. It is hard not to draw a parallel between viewers’ desensitization to the harming of marginalized people in film and in real life.
In “The Hills Have Eyes,” for example, the “monsters” in the movie are all physically impaired due to nuclear testing. Their physical differences are played up for horror, and they engage in grotesque acts to disturb viewers. This type of “gore” is ableist, as it relies on viewers being made uncomfortable by the appearance of the villains — before they even commit any acts of violence.
In addition to ableism in horror, extreme acts of violence against people of color where their race is mentioned can alienate viewers of color. In “The Human Centipede (First Sequence),” the only Japanese character is not only tortured by the antagonist, he is also called racist names, and, being the front of the centipede, forced to eat dog food. The unnecessary racism adds nothing to the movie, while making the gore feel more like a hate crime, resulting in an incredibly uncomfortable watch.
When gore is done well, though, it can really elevate the movie. In “Get Out,” Jordan Peele is selective with his goriness and he does not rely on gore to instill fear in viewers. He does so through impeccable storytelling, a chilling atmosphere, and unsettling characters. The goriest scene of the movie is brief, but it happens at one of the most revelatory points in the film and serves to underscore the horror the audience only assumed was transpiring but finally witnessed on screen.
As horror continues to progress as a genre with more stories from creators with diverse perspectives, hopefully gore will be incorporated into films in a more tasteful way. The genre certainly doesn’t need gore, but when done with care, the genre can greatly benefit from it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all the talk of grade inflation ravaging the Ivy League, some Cantabridgians still struggle with obtaining their target GPAs — so much so that some chose less ethical paths to the much-desired As. That trend has only worsened over the past couple of years: According to a recently released University report, a record 27 undergraduate students were forced to withdraw from the College due to academic dishonesty during the 2020-2021 school year.
As a Board, we strongly and unequivocally oppose academic dishonesty, a practice likely to hurt the perpetrator (through artificially inflated results that discourage skill development) and their curve-graded peers and academic culture at Harvard writ large.
Without condoning or excusing their actions, we must, however, strive to understand what drives them: Why does the cheater cheat?
We would like to believe that most of our peers would never cheat just for the fun of it, but only as a desperate last resort. From that lens, Harvard’s culture of high academic pressure might be as large a factor as any individual predisposition towards hiding a cheat sheet inside their sleeve.
To be clear, we don’t believe academic dishonesty is entirely cultural. Students found to have been academically dishonest are ultimately responsible for their own actions: For every student that resorted to academic dishonesty under pressure, there are swaths who dealt with the very same pressure but either stomached lower grades or made sure to prepare more thoroughly.
Still, combatting academic dishonesty will likely require acknowledging the cultural backdrop that we regard as nudging students toward grade maximization even at the cost of violating the honor code. Our fast-paced, perfectionist culture can and should change, but it is up to us to take the initiative. That starts with better understanding the specific factors likely to increase dishonesty rates, and creating policies designed to disincentive said behavior.
The records set during the 2020-2021 academic year included a large number of first-years: Students who, without much guidance from upperclassmen or time to acclimate to Harvard, are still fundamentally shaped by their (over-achieving, Harvard-worthy) high school experiences and driven by the compulsive need to be the top of their class. Once big fish in a small pond, newly surrounded by a class defined by excellency, first-years are vulnerable to unease about their skills, imposter syndrome, and a crushing desire to prove that they do, in fact, have what it takes to thrive at a place like Harvard. Faced with such pressures, some — like the overrepresentative share of first-years investigated for academic dishonesty — may resort to unethical means to prove their worth.
Here, the ideal policy prescription can be found just outside the confines of our university:  MIT’s mandatory first-semester pass-fail grading system, which forces students to progressively adapt to college standards before transitioning to standard grading their sophomore year, might reduce stress for first-year students, minimizing the risk of cheating. If Harvard is genuinely concerned about high school valedictorians feeling pushed towards academic dishonesty within months of enrolling, replicating the MIT model could offer a better path forward.
The tendency toward academic perfectionism, however, needs to be addressed even when the harm isn’t as severe as academic dishonesty. A competitive culture will naturally amplify preexisting inequalities in past educational experiences: FGLI students, for example, are likely to comparatively struggle more in courses that require substantial high school knowledge — primarily courses in STEM subjects with problem sets and exams to test learning.
While it is necessary to measure growth and learning in courses, evaluative tools with rigid grading schemes may, if overused, put undue pressure on students. This could explain the overrepresentation of the sciences in cases of academic dishonesty: STEM courses accounted for slightly more than 85 percent of all cases of academic dishonesty in the 2020-2021 academic year, a vast overrepresentation in comparison to the Humanities and Social Sciences.
To address that dynamic, STEM courses may require a top-down rethink altogether: When the pressure to perform well on exams and problem sets overrides any meaningful incentive to learn, students’ passions and love of learning for learning’s sake inevitably suffer. The College and individual faculty should consider relying more on alternative evaluative measures that emphasize growth and synthesis of knowledge, or encouraging other policies, such as problem set drops, that might reroute students’ drive towards perfectionism.
Generally speaking, our campus’ hyper-perfectionist culture points to an intense fear of failure that dissuades us from taking risks — a disservice that closes our doors to academic explorations. Even past our first year, we all remain uneasy fish in newly enlarged pond. “Gem-mining,” where students purposefully seek ought easy-A courses, leads to unchallenging (and hence unsatisfying) academic careers for the sake of protecting career prospects from what would be perfectly standard grades at any other college (grades, we must add, that grade-inflation renders below-average).
These intertwined cultural phenomena (at-all-costs perfectionism, grade-inflation, fear of failure) cannot be immediately reversed by University policies. Administrative action should, nonetheless, start now rather than later. Striking a balance between personal and administrative accountability is crucial: Professors should not have to restructure courses with preventing academic dishonesty as a priority, but they should prioritize student well-being and meaningful learning — goals that are poorly served by stringent problem set policies. Pre-class check-ins, assignments that encourage deep reflection rather than summarization of readings, and engaged scholarship courses that prioritize deep learning, on the other hand, are all worthy avenues to explore.
In the short run, students can only attempt to collectively resist our cut-throat cultural impulses. Confront failure in your own life; a failure to do so will make the eventual, inescapable reckoning with your imperfections (we all have them!) much more bitter. We must give ourselves grace, but in turn, allow ourselves to take risks — just not when it comes to academic honesty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1630, John Winthrop voiced his dreams to the settlers of New England, exclaiming that their new Massachusetts Bay Colony “shall be as a city upon a hill” that “the eyes of all people are upon.” In the nearly 400 years since then, these sentiments, written upon the walls of Winthrop House, seem to remain a powerful part of how the administration understands this University — the verbalization of an idealistic perception of Harvard’s place in the world. This invocation is not without merit, encouraging faculty and students to hold themselves to a higher standard and to lead with purpose. But there’s a flip side: it renders Harvard’s administration fundamentally concerned with its own public perception, sometimes to a greater extent than — and to the detriment of — its student body.
From mental health resources to Covid restrictions, Harvard has historically publicized aggressive policies that represent bold change while quietly maintaining the status quo. It’s almost as if the University is saying, “Look, world, all of our students can test as often as they’d like (though we won't enforce the testing cadence). Look, world, we have created such abundant mental health resources (though CAMHS wait times remain over a month-long).” On the outside, we are a city upon a hill, but upon walking through our gates, one realizes that we are much like any other city.
The latest example of the University’s preference for appearance over substance comes with its social plan for this year’s iteration of the Harvard-Yale football game. On November 9, Interim Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 emailed all undergraduate students about the upcoming festivities, writing that the University would be holding an official tailgate featuring “classic American barbecue fare,” “plenty of water stations,” and three drink tickets for students 21 years old or older. This is, of course, a welcome set of resources that contribute to a safer experience for all in attendance, and I am thankful that I go to a university that is willing to contribute to important social experiences like this.
Then I read a bit closer. Further down, the email mentioned that “outside food or drink [would] not be permitted within the tailgate” and that the affair would be “open to current Harvard and Yale undergraduate students only.” Many in attendance will undoubtedly use alcohol or marijuana, but the thousands of students who are under 21, as well as many students from surrounding schools, will have no safe place to do so. Instead, those students will almost certainly engage in rowdy pre-game activity in dorms, yards, or parks far afield of Harvard’s football stadium.
This presents a decidedly intolerable risk to students and the community alike.
For one, the alternative locations will offer none of the health and safety resources that the official tailgate does. At informal pre-game gatherings, there will likely be zero medical personnel, no guarantee of food or water, and varying accessibility to law enforcement. Additionally, without authorities present, these private parties may very well see physical assault, sexual assault, narcotic use (both voluntary and, worse, involuntary), theft, vandalism, and more.
And what happens when The Game is about to start? Thousands of inebriated college students will descend upon the stadium from afar, dodging highways, buses, cars, bikes, and rival fans along the way. Drunk pedestrians are already proportionally more likely to die in traffic accidents than even drunk drivers. And the risk of disaster will be even greater with many of the visitors walking through unfamiliar areas. In this respect, Harvard’s policy presents an unacceptably large risk to the lives of students.
The 2022-2023 College Handbook states that “in cases of drug or alcohol intoxication, health and safety are the College’s primary concerns,” and that their policies are “intended to encourage students to seek help.” In her recent email, Interim Dean Brandt echoed this sentiment, writing that “there is simply nothing more important than ensuring the safety and well-being of our entire Harvard community and our guests.” While the College’s outward message is consistent, its actual policies fail to consider the safety of the countless students who will inevitably choose to participate in underage drinking and drug use at The Game, clearly appearing to place the health and well-being of students second to the image Harvard works so hard to craft.
The University needs to take off its rose-colored glasses and see its students for who they are: stressed young adults who may unintentionally hurt themselves and others in the pursuit of fun. The College must offer practical options for socializing, placing the full force of the richest university in the world behind protecting and nourishing the well-being of its students rather than its image. In truth, Harvard may be a city upon a hill, but to be a worthy model, it must ensure that its example goes beyond appearances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Small Claims Advisory Service — a legal aid program run by undergraduate volunteers — is expanding nationwide, with new branches founded at Columbia University and the Claremont Colleges this semester.
Student volunteers in the program, which sits within the Phillips Brooks House Association, provide information to those whose legal cases are too small for pro bono lawyers.
Per SCAS’s website, the program’s mission is to “empower socioeconomically disadvantaged people in order for them to seek legal redress effectively through the small claims system.”
Though SCAS began at Harvard, this semester the group has expanded to universities nationwide.
Henry F. Austin ’23, an outreach director for the group, said he hopes SCAS can continue to expand because of the positive impact it has had on many Massachusetts residents.
“One thing for me in being a part of SCAS and volunteering is being able to see the tangible impact that this kind of information can make on people’s lives,” Austin said.
Rasleen K. Krupp ’23, a co-executive director of SCAS, said that resources for small claims lawsuits often are not offered by professional lawyers and instead fall on the shoulders of volunteers.
“We’re the only organization of college students helping with small claims issues of our type, and it’s an overlooked court system because it’s not worth it for a lot of lawyers — it seems like a waste of your time because you’re not going to profit much off of it,” Krupp said.
Kayla Solomon, a senior at Scripps College and co-founder of its pre-law society, worked with Harvard’s SCAS to create a branch for the five Claremont Colleges: Pomona College, Claremont Graduate University, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College.
The group successfully trained more than 35 volunteers in its first semester to help with local small claims law, according to Solomon.
Rachel N. Ramenda, a Columbia senior who started a SCAS branch, said Columbia’s group wrote a series of “Wikipedia-like articles" providing accessible legal information to the New York area.
“[The articles] served a dual purpose of, one, educating the members of the New York SCAS at Columbia on these different areas of law, but also creating a database that will allow our clients to have information as well,” Ramenda said.
Sabrina P. Goldfischer ’23, a legal research director for Harvard’s SCAS, lauded the efforts of the students working at Columbia and Scripps to get their groups off the ground despite working in uncharted territory.
“The reason why we have been able to be successful in being able to help start these programs in these states is just a testament to how hard the directors at these schools have been working,” Goldfischer said. “They’ve been starting from scratch really to get people involved and get people excited about the mission.”
Like volunteers at Harvard’s SCAS, Solomon said she is optimistic about the prospect of creating a web of support for small claims cases across the country.
“I am so excited to start making a difference when it comes to opening up opportunities for people who may not have understood the small claims court system or had access to the information they need to have an effective case and the ability to effectively seek legal remedy,” she said.

Darwin’s Ltd., a famous Cambridge coffee chain, announced the closure of all four of its locations on Wednesday, only two weeks after disclosing plans to close its original shop in Harvard Square.
Owners Steven and Isabel Darwin announced in an Instagram post that they will retire and close the chain’s Cambridge St., Massachusetts Ave., and Putnam Ave. locations. The Darwins have owned and operated the coffee chain, which grew in popularity for its sandwiches, since 1993.
“We thank the thousands of employees, customers, and the City of Cambridge for allowing and supporting the 30-year experience & success of our family-owned business,” the Darwin wrote in the Instagram post.
The announcement came less than a month after the Darwins announced the closure of the chain’s original location on Mt. Auburn St., citing workload and personal health concerns. While the lease extends until Dec. 1, the owners said on Wednesday that they reached an agreement with Darwin’s United — the employee union — to close the location on Nov. 22.
The Darwins added that closure dates for the other three locations are still undetermined, pending a response from Darwin’s United.
In response to the initial closure, members of Darwin’s United organized a rally at Cambridge City Hall on Oct. 29, calling on the owners to guarantee employment to the workers at the Mt. Auburn location, raise wages to $24 per hour, provide three weeks of paid time off, and offer zero-deductible healthcare.
The decision to shut down the chain follows a long-fought effort by Darwin’s employees to unionize and secure a new contract with addiional guarantees. Tensions between the union and ownership came to a head last month when members of the union protested outside the Darwins’ Cambridge home.
Rebecca Patterson, a frequent customer, said she was disappointed to lose a longtime local business.
“I wish that the negotiations with the union could have gone better because I think there could have been a way forward,” Patterson said.
Alexandra C. Stanton, a member of Harvard’s graduate student union, previously called the closure of the Mt. Auburn location a tactic to “potentially demoralize the workers and frighten them.”
Prior to the Darwins’ announcement last Wednesday, the couple said they planned to work in good faith with the union to retain as many staff members as possible.
The Mt. Auburn location is set to be replaced by a bakery, according to Cambridge Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oscar L. Berry ’23-’24 first met Arda Cataltepe ’23 while playing competitive tennis in the New England Circuit at around ten years old.
Berry recalls that Cataltepe was always the “most compassionate, nice kind of person.”
When the two were just around 14 years old, Cataltepe finished a match just before Berry headed off to the tennis court. Instead of leaving, Cataltepe stayed to cheer on his friend during a match that lasted more than two hours.
“I look back on it, and I think it’s really touching as an individual experience — and also really indicative about how he saw his own life and his own interactions with others, how dedicated he was to trying to be there for other people,” Berry said.
Cataltepe died on Nov. 4 of a prolonged illness. A senior in Kirkland House, Cataltepe was a concentrator in Applied Math and Economics, having graduated in 2019 from Weston High School in Weston, Mass. In spring 2022, Cataltepe served as president of Harvard Consulting on Business and the Environment, a campus strategy consulting club.
“He would take almost every opportunity that he could to just have those kinds of small meaningful interactions with people before practices, after practices, carpooling to tournaments,” Berry said. “Whenever I had the privilege to be hanging out with him in any situation, it always felt like I was the only thing that mattered to him in that moment.”
“I think a lot of people felt that way,” he added.
Max Bobby ’22, Cataltepe’s close friend, recalled the sense of humor Cataltepe brought to late-night study sessions for a computer science class the two took together.
“Even when the timeline was running tight and things were pretty tense — you’d have to get something in by the next day — he had a really dry sense of humor, but it always cracked me up and released some of that tension,” Bobby said.
Bobby said Cataltepe was “one of the nicest, most caring people” he encountered at Harvard.
“Arda was almost a constant in all of our lives at the time,” Bobby said. “And he was certainly a constant presence in my life.”
Cataltepe loved the Boston Celtics and enjoyed bantering with his friends about the team, Bobby recalled.
“The first time I met him, he was wearing a Celtics jersey,” James Chen ’23-’24 said.
Chen said Cataltepe was someone who was “very generous with his time and his energy.”
“He’s worked with me a lot on projects that really had no benefit to him,” Chen said. “He had no real responsibility or even duty to help out with it, he would just help out.”
Julia Kendall ’23, who grew up in the same town as Cataltepe and has known him since kindergarten, described him as “inquisitive” and “always very curious.”
Cataltepe had a variety of academic interests throughout his life, including history, applied mathematics, economics, and science. In high school, he won the National History Day competition in Massachusetts, Kendall recalled, for an American history project on the Compromise of 1790.
“He definitely had a great interest in history,” Berry said. “I remember we used to have these conversations about ancient Roman and Greek history.”
In an announcement about Cataltepe’s death to the Harvard student body, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana highlighted Cataltepe’s passion for academics.
“His family told me that he was emailing his teachers even hours before his passing,” he wrote.
In September, Cataltepe began a research internship at the Boston Children’s Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program in the lab of Harvard Medical School assistant professor Maimuna S. Majumder.
“He first got in touch with me in 2020 when he applied to intern with my lab,” Majumder wrote in an email. “We didn’t have a position that was quite right for him at the time, but he made such an impression on me that I kept my eye out for an opportunity that would be mutually synergistic.”
Majumder reached out to Cataltepe earlier this year with a suggestion for his senior thesis topic and ultimately served as his thesis advisor.
Cataltepe joined the lab this fall to work on the EAGER project, which aims to use machine learning techniques to identify state-sponsored disinformation on social media.
“As a junior researcher, Arda was passionate about taking his skills from applied math to solve problems at the societal scale—especially those with geopolitical consequences,” Majumder wrote.
Marie-Laure Charpignon, a member of Majumder's lab, wrote in an emailed statement that she was “impressed by [Cataltepe’s] intellectual curiosity and maturity” from the first time she met him.
“What came across the conversations me and other teammates had with Arda is that he is a mission-driven person,” Charpignon wrote. “Arda once shared with me his thoughts about the purpose of applied mathematics: beyond our academic engagement, he said that we should seek to serve social good, even early in our careers.”
Cataltepe was a leader on the EAGER project due to the connection between its research and his senior thesis, according to Majumder.
“I noticed that he led with kindness, every single day,” Majumder wrote. “His devotion to his thesis and to the EAGER team was evident until his very last breath, and we will all miss him terribly.”
Cataltepe was deeply involved in CBE, serving as its president this past spring. His friends in the club described him as a compassionate and dedicated leader who devoted much of his time to the organization.
For Diana Zhu ’23, Cataltepe was a person to “look up to and learn from.”
“I knew he was sick, but we never really knew the extent of it, just because he was so fully dedicated to the club and just making sure things were running as normal,” Zhu said. “He truly just wanted to contribute to the organization and not make it about him.”
Current CBE president Alexander H. Dang ’24 said Cataltepe was “amazing at everything he did” and yet remained “so humble.”
“He was always just there for you, even when there was nothing for him to get out of it — that’s just how much he cared about everything,” Dang said. “He really poured his heart and soul into this organization.”
Michelle Lu ’24, who was previously a managing director at CBE, said Cataltepe was her mentor and acted as a voice of “steadiness and calmness” for the organization.
“His impact is felt not only in terms of how he changed the organization or what things he did as a president, but also the very tangible effect he had on the people that he worked with,” Lu said.
Kendall described Cataltepe as “supportive and thoughtful” throughout their time together at CBE.
“His last semester, he was battling his illness but also serving as president and handling an intense course load, and he just did that with no complaints,” Kendall said.
“He was just a really extraordinary person,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Office of BGLTQ+ Life celebrated the start of Transgender Awareness Week with a Shorenstein Center panel on media representation on Monday.
The event, titled “LGBTQIA+ Representation in the Media,” included a discussion of transphobia and its effects.
The panel featured Schuyler M. Bailar ’19, the first transgender athlete to play on an NCAA Division I men’s athletics team; Chastity Bowick, executive director of the Massachusetts Transgender Emergency Fund, a nonprofit supporting low-income and unhoused trans people; and Amir Ashour, a Harvard Law School student who founded IraQueer, a queer rights advocacy group in Iraq.
Moderator Ian Daniel, an Emmy-nominated journalist and filmmaker who is also a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, discussed the importance of transgender visibility in his opening remarks.
“More than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been proposed in 2022,” he said.
Bowick and Bailar said they are disappointed with transgender representation in the media, which they say accentuates stereotypes.
“People take what they see on TV, whether it’s a movie or a show, and they assume that’s exactly how we live,” Bowick said. “It does a disservice to our community members — we need more advocates to be on TV to be speaking on day-to-day issues.”
Bailar said harmful stereotypes often counteract the progress offered by greater representation. He said he avoids television shows that feature transgender characters because they often misrepresent the lived experience of trans people.
“It’s not done well, and it’s so uncomfortable for me to watch that I don’t even want to interface with it,” he said.
Bowick discussed the importance of universal rights for transgender people.
“We shouldn’t be ‘lucky’ to have equal rights,” Bowick said, referring to socially progressive laws in Massachusetts. “I don’t feel like our political system is doing our LGBTQ communities any type of justice.”
Bailar said transgender inclusivity in athletics favors feminist initiatives, rejecting arguments that laws allowing transgender women in sports disadvantage cis women.
“When you exclude trans women, you happen to define womanhood to reduce women to their reproductive capacity, which is pretty much the opposite of feminism,” he said. “All of this is punishing trans people because of cis men, which is the most opposite of feminism possible.”
Ashour explained why he centers universal human rights in his activism.
“Once we are at a point where people are not afraid for their lives when they speak up against certain violations, then we can have a real debate where queer people from all the groups can join the table and speak up,” he said.
All panelists suggested ways to best support transgender individuals.
“Allyship takes all hands, not just the massive things,” Bailar said in an interview after the event.
“​​Either you advocate for human rights, or you’re not advocating,” Ashour added. “Not only because they’re intersectional, but because they’re actually identical.”
The event was cut short by a building evacuation at the Kennedy School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Monday meeting of the Cambridge City Council, some residents praised the recent transformation of a section of Garden Street into a one-way road while others voiced frustrations with the change.
The segment of Garden Street between Huron Avenue and Concord Avenue has been one-way heading east since bike lane construction began on Oct. 28. In public comments and written communications to the Council, many residents said that heavy traffic is now redirected to side streets in the area, such as Walker Street, leading to safety concerns.
The city is constructing bike lanes to fulfill the goals of the amended Cycling Safety Ordinance, a 2020 policy passed by the Council requiring the construction of more than 25 miles of separated bike lanes in the coming years. The city has also begun constructing bike lanes on Brattle Street and will soon start installing lanes on Hampshire Street.
During the meeting, the Council unanimously voted for a policy order asking the Department of Public Works and the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department to meet with residents in the affected area and “discuss strategies to mitigate and reduce overflow and cut through traffic,” including whether it would be feasible to revert back to two-way traffic.
The order asks city staff to produce an initial report in December.
Councilor Paul F. Toner, who co-sponsored the policy order, said it does not call for going back to two-way traffic but rather gives “cover” to city staff to consider it as a “potential option.”
Toner also emphasized that “in no shape, way, or form” does the order call for the removal of the separated bike lanes from Garden Street.
The order “simply asks for us to get a report on the feasibility of any mitigation changes, including the potential of reverting to two-way if that’s the best solution,” Toner said.
Several councilors said the decision to make a portion of Garden Street one-way followed resident feedback that adding bike lanes on a two-way street would remove too many parking spaces.
Some residents who commented during the meeting spoke in favor of the bike lanes.
Clyve Lawrence ’25 said during public comment that the construction of bike lanes ends the city’s “continued failures to put safety first, to put people first.”
“Providing separation between people in cars and people on bikes decreases the chance that a momentary distraction leads to a deadly crash,” said Lawrence, who writes a Crimson Editorial column on transportation in the Boston area.
But others said the changes to Garden Street pose safety concerns of their own. Jay H. Wickersham, a former lecturer at the Graduate School of Design who lives on Walker Street, said the “well-intended” changes have nonetheless “created a series of poorly designed and dangerous intersections” in the area.
“Community members have documented daily safety risks and potential or actual collisions that could result in injury or even death,” Wickersham said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Immigration Initiative at Harvard discussed the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in a hybrid event at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Monday.
During the event, “DACA Moving Forward: What Can We Expect?” roughly 50 Harvard affiliates gathered to hear four panelists discuss the history and policies of DACA, as well as future pathways for the policy given an ever-changing political landscape in Washington.
DACA — a 2012 executive order by the Obama administration protecting undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children from deportation — is now pending another review by a federal district court following proposed changes to the program by the Biden administration.
The Trump administration aimed to halt the program in 2017, but the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of DACA in 2020, blocking the administration’s efforts. An October ruling by a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, necessitated further review of the act by a lower court.
Andrew Seele, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said that despite single-party control in Washington for two years, Congress has not made any long-term changes to the provisions of the act, leaving its future up in the air.
“There was a strong feeling a few weeks ago before the appeals court ruled and sent this [review] back to a judge that there might be movement in Congress,” he said. “Unfortunately, that's been taken off the table.”
Panelist Jason Corral, a staff attorney for the Harvard Representation Initiative, said that while some states may call to end DACA, they continue to benefit economically from the program.
“They're trying to make the case that immigrants are a drain on society,” Corral said. “At the same time, the courts are allowing them to say that without actually taking [DACA] away.”
Director of Federal Advocacy at United We Dream Juliana Macedo do Nascimento said she believes the future of the act is still uncertain despite Democrats’ retaining control of the Senate and urged immediate action. Nascimento added that DACA may yet again end up in the Supreme Court.
“Whether it ends by June next year or in 2024, DACA will die under a Biden administration — a Democratic president — and [this Congress] cannot allow that to happen,” Nascimento said.
Nascimento also argued that DACA recipients create major benefits for the United States, citing billions of dollars in contributions to the economy and participation as frontline workers during the pandemic.
‘The idea that DACA could end, and over two years everybody would lose their work permit — it would not only devastate personal lives like mine, but really the economy of the country and the lives of our communities,” she said.
Panel moderator Carola Suarez-Orozco, who directs the Harvard Immigration Initiative, said in an interview after the event that the panel reflected the “continued complexity” of DACA.
“Whilst some [panelists] took a very narrow view of what we can expect moving forward, others gave us a sense that we should be hopeful in working on the ground to keep making change,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-eight Harvard College seniors on Monday learned they were tapped for induction into Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious academic honor society. They join 25 of their classmates who were inducted in the spring.
The inductees span all 12 of Harvard’s undergraduate houses and 27 different academic concentrations. Kirkland House boasted seven “Senior 48” inductees — the most of any house — followed by Eliot and Pforzheimer with six each.
Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Social Studies, and Economics each had four inductees, more than any other concentration.
Jaxson T. Hill ’23, a Leverett House resident studying Mechanical Engineering, said he was doing homework when he learned the news.
“I was a bit surprised to see an email that said PBK in the top of the subject line,” he said. “I opened it up and was surprised, very pleased. Took a minute to celebrate, go eat, and then back to work — a little uneventful.”
Cabot House resident Lena Lofgren ’23, a joint concentrator in Government and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said she first thought she had been rejected when she got that email.
“I was at lunch with a friend and the notification of the email just popped up on my phone. And initially, I thought it was a rejection, but then I read it more closely,” she said. “Then I called my mom, she was really excited — she’s a college professor, so I think that this meant a lot to her, especially because both my parents are immigrants.”
Inductees said they appreciated the ability they had at Harvard to explore many academic disciplines.
Sílvia Casacuberta Puig ’22-’23, a Dunster House resident studying Math and CS who is originally from Spain, said she came to the U.S. to explore subjects beyond her concentrations.
“I think it’s sometimes hard to convince people back home and other places that there’s a lot of value to this liberal arts education,” said Casacuberta Puig, a Crimson Multimedia editor. “I’m happy that the U.S. has prizes or other ways in which they value this diversity of academic topics, because it makes it feel that I feel supported in my decision to study different things.”
Jessica Liu ’23, an Applied Math concentrator in Eliot House, said she was “shocked” when she opened the announcement email in class.
“The capstone of my Harvard path is just exploring multiple things, and that’s also what I think PBK really captures, is that exploration,” she said. “Not just exploring miles deep, but also miles wide.”
Aaryan G. Morrison ’22-’23, a Social Studies concentrator in Kirkland House, said the award validated her academic interests, which she said haven’t always been in the academic mainstream.
“Social Studies in particular hasn’t had a lot of Black or African thinkers on our syllabi over the years,” she said.
“I think it’s hard for me to think about this award in ‘me’ and really singular terms — I have to think about all of the people that have supported me and my time here at Harvard from before I got here,” she added, thanking her parents who are from South Africa and her mentors and professors at the College.
Two of Monday’s inductees — Lauren Kim ’23 and Isaac A. Robinson ’22-’23 — also received U.S. Rhodes Scholarships over the weekend.
The 73 inductees for the Class of 2023 will be joined by approximately 96 more seniors later this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men's water polo team finished off their regular season last weekend with a three game stint. It was only fitting to do it at the place the team has favored most: home, sweet home, at Blodgett Pool in Cambridge.
The Crimson (19-8, 8-2 Northeast Water Polo Conference) won two of its three games last weekend, bringing its regular season record at Blodgett to 10-3. The wins came against conference rivals St. Francis Brooklyn (19-9, 6-4 NWPC) and Iona (10-17, 4-8 NWPC), the former of which had cut Harvard's postseason short last year with a 11-10 upset in the conference semifinals.
Last Saturday, in a decisive 15-10 victory, Harvard did not let the Terriers secure a repeat.
Junior attacker Owen Hale and center Kaleb Archer both scored hat-tricks against St. Francis. First-year utility James Rozolis-Hill continued to raise Harvard water polo’s single season goal record, tallying another four goals onto the board, while senior goaltender Noah Hodge recorded ten more saves, adding to his tally as the program’s all-time saves leader.
Harvard would continue their winning streak at Iona with a powerful 15-9 victory before losing their last game to conference rival Princeton 10-7.
“It would have been nice to get a win against Princeton,” said head coach Ted Minnis of the game. “They’re a very talented team, they’re very well-coached. It's always fun to play against them and they’ve pushed us over the years to be the best that we can be and hopefully we’ve done that for them too.”
The Crimson played against Princeton earlier this season in October, ending in a tight 6-9 loss to the Tigers, with both matches featuring an uncharacteristically low goal count for Harvard. As of now, Princeton currently holds an undefeated regular season record in the Northeast Water Polo Conference, their first undefeated season since their 2015 sweep in the now defunct Southern Division Conference.
Yet, despite the unsatisfactory outcome, some prettier stats also made a favorable appearance for the Crimson. Senior goaltender Noah Hodge made a season-high of 15 saves, and Rozolis-Hill was as present as ever, tallying a casual hat-trick against the Tigers to do his part in keeping Harvard in the game.
The loss leaves the fruitful regular season to an unfortunate ending note, but the team remains optimistic.
“We played a pretty tough schedule, and to come out 19-8––I’m pretty proud of that,” Minnis reflected. “I talked about at the beginning of the season ‘we’re at the bottom of the staircase,’ and we’ve done a good job of climbing that staircase and getting to the top, and giving ourselves a chance to compete here in a week for hopefully winning a championship or at least competing for a championship.”
The tough schedule was reiterated by captain Noah Hodge, though this tough lineup was not necessarily reflected in the team’s statistics. For those doing the math, a 10-3 home record gives the Crimson a 6-2 away record, and a 3-3 neutral record––quite a feat considering the journey and teams faced.
“I think that definitely played to our benefit, especially towards the end of the season,” said Hodge, referring to the difficult schedule. “Playing a lot of top ten teams in the country really prepares us well for conference play … I think we got a lot of really good experience under our belt throughout our regular season.”
Many of these top ten teams have been courtesy of Harvard’s California trips, as the team spent weekends against water polo powerhouses such as Stanford (20-4), UCLA (21-2), Long Beach State (19-8), and Pomona-Pitzer (16-14). These trips have been big, not just on a player level, but also a personal one.
“California trips are always really special for us, especially as water polo is such a California-dominated sport,” Hodge explained. “Almost all of the team comes from California, and so whenever we’re able to head out there it’s always like a giant family reunion – all our families come up regardless of what part of California they’re from.”
Of all the players listed on the current 2022 roster, only four players are not from California. It makes for, as Hodge describes, some extremely exciting get-togethers for all involved, and a fantastic motivator out of the pool to boot.
“Being 3000 miles away from home isn’t the easiest, and being able to go out there, play outdoors, get a little tan, enjoy the sunshine and having our families there at the games is always a huge highlight for everyone,” Hodge laughed. “I’d definitely highlight that one as one of the best parts of the season so far.”
Of course, all of the experience doesn’t hurt the performance in the pool either. Coach Minnis commented on the improvement of the defensive play from Harvard, while cultivating a more thoughtful offense on the other side of the pool.
“Defense is what wins championships. You have to be able to get stops,” Minnis explained. “I thought we’ve done a better job of being more patient in our attacks and not forcing things, and really taking the best opportunities that we can get.”
Neither of these directions would be made possible without the work of their goaltenders. The current tandem is comprised of freshman Tanner Furtak, and senior Noah Hodge. Though Hodge holds the starting role, Furtak is working to make a name for himself – his start with Iona on Saturday extends his winning streak, as Furtak remains undefeated as a collegiate goaltender.
“[Furtak] came in at the right time, with me being almost done,” Hodge grinned. “I think [Furtak] is a fantastic goalie … he’s such an avid learner and he always asks questions – asking me, asking our coaches questions about how to improve. And he’s coming in and basically inheriting the goalie spot, which is such a huge part of our team, and our defense relies so heavily on it. I’m super excited to see him take over the reins and lead this team. He’s also just like one of the funniest guys on the team, he’s such a goofball and just brings such a good energy to every practice, every time that we hang out as a team. Super proud of him, and super excited to see how he continues to flourish.”
“[Furtak] has improved so much as the year’s gone on,” Minnis agreed. “He’s been awesome, but he’s got that opportunity to work and study under such a great goalie as [Hodge]. Next year is gonna be his opportunity to try to continue the great goalie play we’ve had here over the last seven or eight years.”
Captain and now senior, Hodge has been with the program since 2018, and has collected his fair share of accolades, including All-American honors and his bid as the current program all-time saves leader.
“[Hodge] – he’s, in my opinion, one of the top goalies in the country,” Minnis said. “He does a very good job – he allows us to do a lot of things defensively because of him in the goal.”
Though Hodge was not as interested in focusing the attention on himself, the team was plenty ready to honor him. Saturday’s matches doubled as a senior day, aiming to honor the collegiate careers of the five current seniors (three of which are super seniors) on the roster, which of course, included Hodge himself.
“I always love senior day, and it’s weird being on the other side of it and being the one being honored now,” Hodge admitted. “It feels a little surreal, and maybe a little bit premature, because we have so much of the [post-season] left. I speak for the rest of the super senior class, but we came back because we knew that we had the chance to do something special, and now it’s time for us to put it into motion and make it happen.”
“The class is gonna always be special to me as they leave the program. They’ve brought so much in and out of the pool to our program, and they’re gonna be missed,” Minnis said. “I don’t want to think too much about it, because it’s gonna be sad that they’re gone. I kinda wanna enjoy this last week and a half with them, and hopefully a little longer.”
Hodge and the rest of the senior class were also present during Harvard water polo’s miraculous, undefeated 2019 regular season run, which culminated in a NWPC Championship. They’re among the few to have had the chance to experience the playoff finals, a valuable asset to the team both last season during the group’s transition back from Covid-19 growing pains, and this current year as the Crimson begins to make its own run for playoff victory.
As for this coming postseason, there’s a lot to look forward to – from a potential second chance against St. Francis in the semifinals to a possible matchup against Princeton in the finals, if one dares to look so far ahead. The Tigers are the No. 1 seed and current favorites to repeat as NWPC Champions – and, historically, the last year that Princeton went undefeated in conference play, it led to a decisive championship victory as well.
Harvard will be looking to face a formidable opponent in the potential finals, one whom the team had failed to best in the 2022 regular season. Yet, as anyone who’s been in the postseason before knows, nothing is guaranteed.
“My freshman year heading into playoffs, we were going in as the No. 1 seed, we beat Princeton twice already during the regular season, and we went in and lost to Princeton in the finals pretty handily,” Hodge recounted. “It’s a tough spot to be in, and I would argue that Princeton is kind of in the same boat as we were that freshman year. They handled everyone during the regular season, but none of that matters when it comes to postseason.”
As for Coach Minnis, there is one obstacle that must be dismantled before Princeton first – the semifinals against St. Francis. As the team that had cut short Harvard’s own postseason last year during a nail-biting upset, the Crimson is looking for vengeance. Above all, this is an opportunity to right some of last season’s wrongs. These factors together make the semifinals, as Minnis puts it, “the hardest game to win.”
“If you don’t win it, you don’t get to play for a championship,” Minnis explained. “Things happen in the championship game, but you gotta get to that game.”
Interestingly enough, the team seems less worried about the closest playoff matchup they have – a match against Connecticut College occurring next week, and their stepping stone to a potential semifinals match.
“[Connecticut] College came into our conference last year - they’re still a new program, they’re young, they’re upcoming, which is great because they're growing the sport,” Hodge said. “Personally, I don’t think we’re too worried about that matchup, I think it’s a great opportunity both for them and for some of our younger guys and guys who don’t get to see as much playing time to get in and really get that experience under their belt. It’ll be a great start, but really our sights are set on our semifinals first.”
Of course, that isn’t to say that Connecticut will be a pushover, and especially not in their coaching - their head coach is, in fact, a great friend of Coach Minnis himself. However, the team, and their captain, is ready for the challenge.
“We’re ready to go out with a bang, y’know?” Hodge grinned. “We didn’t take a semester off to come back and lose twice in a row, and we’re all really fired up.”
Harvard will play Connecticut College next Friday at 3:00pm at Brown University. The next time Crimson steps into game-day, it will be treading playoff waters.

At the end of spring semester last year, I had used none of my BoardPlus — mainly because I had no idea what BoardPlus was and where I could spend it. And so, this semester, I decided to use my BoardPlus more consistently, as a way to treat myself during the semester. Because of this mission and my newfound love and discovery of the infinite dining/snack/beverage options at the Harvard Law School, my BoardPlus this semester is no more. So to all of you who are lucky enough to have some BoardPlus leftover: Go. To. The. Law. School. From sushi to blueberry scones, here is a quick run-down of the law school’s endless Board Plus options. Go forth and spruce up your otherwise HUDS-y week!
The cafe
As soon as you step into the main HLS building, take a right down the steps and enter the Hogwarts-esque cafe. Behold, a Peets coffee shop complete with seasonal drinks (especially convenient for all the Quadlings who would otherwise have to trek all the way to LISE for a pick-me-up latte) and baked goods that look like they could have been sold at Tatte. But the best part of this space is its ambiance. The erudite, old-fashioned vibe of this cafe is mainly a result of the fireplace (yes, there’s a REAL fireplace) that blazes throughout the day. I enjoyed a cappuccino by the fire here, watching the rain fall and feeling like I was in the Gryffindor Common Room — true main character moment.
The first-floor cafeteria
Sushi. I repeat. Sushi!!! Despite being cheap compared to other sushi options in Cambridge, the sushi in the HLS Cafeteria really hurt my BoardPlus stash. The ground-floor cafeteria is full of even more baked goods (not the mini-danishes in the dhall during breakfast but nice pastries), pizza, a wild range of refrigerated drinks, mac and cheese (with toppings!), and freshly prepared sandwiches. And, in case I didn’t make this clear enough, sushi!!
The second-floor cafeteria
Admittedly, I ran out of BoardPlus before I could make it here for a meal. But, this cafe is a huge space with a crazy number of stations. HUDS on sTeRoiDs of all kinds. I don’t know why HLS needs one cafe directly above another, but grab lunch here and tell me everything I missed out on.
Maybe the delights of the Law School have always been common knowledge, and simply unfamiliar to me. In any case, this guide is for anyone who, like me, has been oblivious to the ultimate BoardPlus spending spot. Am I upset that I ran out of Board Plus? Yes. Do I regret any of my Law school food purchases? No. Will I still go to the Law school instead of HUDS? Most likely.

Dear Homesick Students…
Whether you’re from Australia, Argentina, Afghanistan, or Alaska (just me?), we love you! You’ve got this. And even if you don’t live halfway across the globe, it’s okay to miss home — I’m (slightly enviously) talking to you, Bostonians. With the holidays around the corner, it’s that time of the year when we start to crave the comfort of home and non-Harvard life just a tad more than usual. But don’t give up now! We’re in this together, and the finish line is in sight. And if you’re close enough to be going home for Thanksgiving, you lucky, lucky, ducky.
But if you can’t go home for the holidays, try to bring some home to campus (cheesy, I know). But for real, I have a picture hanging on my wall of some mountains from home, and whenever I see it, there’s a 50 percent chance it will brighten my mood. Even simpler for all of you who like blank walls — call/FaceTime your friends and fam from home for a little chat. Hopefully, their words can be of even more comfort than mine :)
And if you’re feeling retro, write a letter to someone you miss. If you send mail, you’re more likely to receive mail, and who doesn’t love getting mail?! PSA: Trader Joe’s has fun cards for $1 or you could even get crafty and DIY orrrr just tear out a piece of paper from your pset notebook and throw it in an envelope. Did you know you can send outgoing mail from the first-year mail center? (But make sure you buy a stamp, or that letter’s going nowhere!)
And can we just commiserate for a sec about food homesickness? I’ve heard that food is one of the main reasons people start to feel homesick, and boy, do I concur. Whether it’s something your family makes or a familiar restaurant back home, it can be tricky to replicate what you’re missing with what we’re working with in the dhall. Name a better excuse to grab a couple of friends and go into Boston to treat yourself to something that will fill your belly and heart. Or if you’re feeling really ambitious, channel your inner Gordon Ramsey and reserve one of the kitchens in your dorm/house (or make friends with someone who lives in Dewolfe).
Hopefully, you can find solace in the fact that going home is going to be 10000x more rewarding after being in the trenches for a semester. Whenever I go home, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have such a sick home (pun intended). And let’s face it, when you go home, you’re probably just going to start missing school anyways. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, even for Tasty Basty. Though Taylor Swift might think differently, we promise — you’re not on your own, kid. Hang in there!
With a gentle kiss on the forehead,
Flyby <3
