After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Camp at the Grocery Store,” a short story written by Claire J. Orrange ’23, has been selected for inclusion in the anthology “Queer Life, Queer Love,” which looks at and celebrates the work of new and emerging BGLTQ+ writers from around the world. Orrange wrote the story during the beginning of the pandemic as part of Harvard English professor Neel Mukherjee’s creative writing workshop.
“I was home in Buffalo, having just been evicted from school, and I honestly didn’t really know what to write about,” Orrange said. “They say to write what you know, so I ended up writing a story about a trans woman who smokes weed and then goes to the grocery store.”
Orrange was first introduced to creative writing through Harvard’s workshops. Although she had previously done analytical writing and journaling, she had never tried fiction writing before.
“I thought [the creative writing workshop] would be a good creative outlet that I could use to process emotions, or to just have a more unique class that wasn’t just problem sets or essays,” Orrange said.
She was also introduced to “Queer Life, Queer Love” through the workshop when Mukherjee emailed her about a worldwide queer writing competition based in the UK in November 2020. The competition, run by indie publisher Muswell Press, was looking for writing that “explores characters and experiences beyond mainstream society.”
Orrange submitted two pieces that she had written in Mukherjee’s workshop, not expecting any response. But in April 2021, she was notified that “Camp at the Grocery Store” had been selected for publication in the anthology.
“Queer Life, Queer Love” was released in the UK in November 2021. Although Orrange originally didn’t anticipate being able to attend the anthology’s launch party, which was in the UK, it ended up being on Nov. 25 — the same day as Thanksgiving. While other Harvard students spent their fall break at home, Orrange flew overseas. She had an amazing time meeting the anthology’s editors and publishers, talking with other contributing writers, and signing copies of her work.
“It was a lot of fun. It was at this queer bar. Everyone was drinking. I think I was probably the youngest person in the room, but I felt right at home,” Orrange said.
“Queer Life, Queer Love” was dedicated to the memory of Lucy-Jack Reynolds, Muswell Press publisher Sarah Beal’s trans daughter, who passed away at the age of 20. Orrange said that it was a special experience to be able to be a part of such a personally impactful project.
“The publishers made this very touching toast for their daughter, and we were drinking cocktails that they named after her,” Orrange said. “It felt nice to be able to participate in something like that.”
Orrange said that one of her goals while writing “Camp at the Grocery Store,” as well as everything she has written, was to create a piece of work that centered the experience of trans women, citing the lack of representation of the trans community in literature.
“It’s really lonely. It’s not something I would wish upon anyone,” Orrange said. “So when I wrote ‘Camp at the Grocery Store,’ I wanted to make sure that I was paying it forward to trans girls in the future who might read it.”
When asked about any advice she would give to aspiring writers, Orrange encouraged anyone interested in fiction writing to take creative writing workshops. She also said that just writing pieces and creating work is more important.
“Ultimately, the most important thing to do when you want to make it as a writer is to write. I have to remind myself that all the time,” Orrange said.
“Queer Life, Queer Love” was released in paperback on Jan. 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kim M. Janey, who served as acting mayor of Boston for eight months last year before losing a bid for a full term, will headline the Harvard Institute of Politics’ class of Spring 2022 resident fellows.
Janey’s selection, announced by the IOP Wednesday morning, comes four months after she lost in the preliminary election of last fall’s Boston mayoral race. Her stint at Harvard this spring will be her first endeavor since leaving City Hall.
The five other fellows joining Janey are Brendan Buck, former counselor to Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan; Christine Chen, executive director of Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote; Josephine “Jody” Olsen, former Peace Corps director; Maya Rupert, former campaign manager for Julián Castro’s presidential run and New York City mayoral candidate Maya D. Wiley; and Gerald F. Seib, executive Washington editor at the Wall Street Journal.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said he was pleased to be welcoming fellows from different parts of the political world at “a critical time for our country and our democracy.”
“Their expertise in local and federal policymaking, campaigns, civic engagement, global affairs and journalism will help our students imagine their pathways forward and inspire them to lead lives of consequence,” Gearan said.
Study groups with the resident fellows are set to begin the week of Feb. 14.
Janey ascended to become acting mayor of Boston in March after Martin J. Walsh resigned to serve as U.S. Labor secretary, making her the city’s first woman and first Black person to hold the office.
Janey failed to advance past the preliminary round of last fall’s Boston mayoral election, finishing in fourth place behind the eventual winner, Michelle Wu ’07, along with Boston City Councilors Annissa Essaibi George and Andrea J. Campbell. Janey endorsed Wu in the general election.
Janey faced a slew of controversies during her short stint as mayor. In addition to steering the city through Covid-19, she fired the city’s police commissioner in June and faced criticism in October for ordering the removal of homeless encampments near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard.
“I had the honor of leading my city during a time of unprecedented challenges,” she said in a statement. “I am excited to join the Harvard community in discussions on how we move US cities forward as we tackle the twin pandemic of COVID and systemic racism.”
Alexa C. Jordan ’22 and Jessica A. Alexander ’24, co-chairs of the fellows and study groups program at the IOP, highlighted the variety of political views represented in the fellows.
“This semester, we are pleased to welcome a Fellows cohort of diverse ideology and experience to engage with students in discussions about the ever-changing meanings of politics, public service, activism, and advocacy today,” they wrote.
Students have criticized the IOP in the past for providing insufficient conversative programming. It formed a Conservative Coalition in March 2021 in response to the concerns.
Buck, a longtime Republican political operative, served as a close aide to former Speakers of the House John Boehner and Paul Ryan.
Chen, executive director of the nonpartisan APIAVote, said she hopes to continue her work to increase civic participation of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.
“As the AAPI population in the US continues to grow, get elected and appointed to more leadership roles to govern our country, it is critical that we are included and represented in influential forums such as this,” Chen wrote in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Men’s Ice Hockey players, junior forward Nick Abruzzese and sophomore forward Sean Farrell, have been selected to represent Team USA at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China.
“This is something that doesn’t come around a whole lot. It’s hard to pass up on that opportunity,” said Abruzzese, who was named team captain in August 2021. “Above all else, being able to represent my country is probably the biggest honor of my life.”
Farrell shared similar sentiments. “It's a no-brainer to decide to go to the Olympics,” he said. “It's such a once in a lifetime opportunity and something that not a lot of athletes get to experience.”
Players from the National Hockey League (NHL) were originally expected to comprise the vast majority of Olympians for the 2022 tournament. However, after Covid-19 outbreaks among NHL teams caused the postponement of dozens of games, the league prohibited players from participating, leaving NCAA players and players competing in overseas leagues to take their place.
Due to the suddenness of the NHL’s decision, being selected for Team USA was not on Abruzzese’s radar until a few weeks ago.
“I spoke to our coach a couple of weeks ago and he said that they were looking at a majority of players that were college guys and he said that I was on the list for that,” Abruzzese said. “A couple days later, I found out from Team USA that I made the team. So it was a pretty quick transition from not really having any idea or having this on my radar at all to making the team.”
Abruzzese hails from Slate Hill, NY, where he attended Minisink Valley High School before playing two seasons for the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League (USHL), the top US junior hockey league. In the 2018-2019 USHL season, Abruzzese scored 80 points (29 goals, 51 assists) while serving as one of the Steel’s alternate captains. In June 2019, he was drafted in the fourth round of the NHL Entry Draft, 124th overall, by the Toronto Maple Leafs, but he opted to join the Crimson in the fall of 2019.
Farrell comes from Hopkinton, MA and the St. Mark’s School in Southborough, MA. After two years of playing for USA Hockey’s US National Team Development Program, Farrell joined the Steel for the 2019-2020 season, scoring 56 points (15 goals, 41 assists) in his debut season. In June 2020, he was drafted in the fourth round of the NHL Entry Draft, 124th overall, by the Montreal Canadiens, and he piled up 101 points (29 goals, 72 assists) in the 2020-2021 season for the Steel before joining Harvard for the 2021-2022 season.
Both players have plenty of support from their professional squads. Abruzzese has even spoken to experienced Olympians within Toronto’s organization about what to expect.
“I’ve spoken to Hayley Wickenheiser. She was a legend for the women’s team up in Canada…Just trying to get a feel of what it's like. I was trying to pick her brain a little bit to get some advice from her,” he said. Wickenheiser, who represented Canada in six Olympic Games, is now a player development executive for the Maple Leafs.
Abruzzese and Farrell will join the majority of Team USA in Los Angeles a few days before they depart for China on Feb. 3, just before the opening ceremonies on Feb. 4. The team is composed of 13 other NCAA players, as well as eight that play professionally in Europe and two from the American Hockey League (AHL). Team USA will be coached by David Quinn, the former head coach of the NHL’s New York Rangers.
“I grew up a Rangers fan so I’ve followed him pretty closely when he was coaching the team over the past number of years,” said Abruzzese on playing for Quinn. “I’m going to be a sponge and try to absorb as much information from him as I can.”
Farrell is similarly excited to play for Quinn, who was the head coach at Boston University prior to being hired by the Rangers.
“I actually know him a little bit from when he was at [Boston University]. I talked to him probably a day after we made the team, and it was great to hear from him,” Farrell explained. “I’m really excited to get the chance to play for him. He’s got so much experience from coaching and has been a great coach in college and the NHL as well.”
Despite their absence during the approaching home stretch of Harvard’s season, neither player is concerned about the Crimson.
“I think they’ll be fine. We’ve had a pretty good year up to this point and I think we’re starting to make some strides,” Abruzzese said.“They’ll continue to build on what we’ve started to build so far.”
“I think we have so many good players on our team that the next guys will be ready to step into bigger roles,” Farrell added. “I think that with Covid, we’ve kind of been dealing with that already, guys being in and out of the lineup, so I think that guys will just continue to have bigger opportunities and step up in such an important part of the season too.”
Abruzzese and Farrell will rejoin the Crimson for the end of the season and a potential playoff run after the Olympic closing ceremonies on Feb. 25.
