After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This shit sound like what being rich feel like,” Drake mumbles at the start of “My Side,” one of the added tracks on this week’s physical release of his record-smashing mixtape “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.” “This shit,” an ambling and abstract beat from Boi-1da and Syke Sense, isn’t a huge departure from other brooding tracks on the tape. The simplicity of the track, however, lends it a meditative tone that isn’t as present on the mixtape’s stylistically similar “Madonna” and “Company.” While “My Side” is less kinetic than its counterparts, then,  it is also more affecting. The track necessarily softens the bravado of Drake’s recent sound and offers a potential glimpse of a pared-down approach for the rapper’s upcoming album, “Views From the 6.”
“My Side” reflects a morose, high-society Drake more than the drunken, stripper-obsessed Drake. The MC croons about his lover’s “New York condo” and how he’s “too busy for a wedding or a kid.” In the least focused moment of the otherwise succinct hook, Drake discusses the semantics of “wasting our relationship on a relationship,” which possibly refers to the exhaustion of exclusivity. As usual, it’s hard to say. As his career has progressed, Drake has relied more on impressionist snapshots of his flings rather than plot-based narratives. The result of this lyrical simplification can lead to eye-rolling redundancies—the number of disparate, often contradictory issues that Drake has with women on “If You’re Reading This Its Too Late” make it difficult to imagine what wouldn’t get him down.
Despite moments on “My Side” where Drake’s vagueness begets this self-indulgence, the sparseness of the single verse and dissonant backing make it feel more authentic and unified than much of the fun but scattered fare on the digital mixtape. The beats aren’t going to be the deciding critical factor on Drake’s next album, however—the production on “My Side” is exceptional in its lack of explicit structure, but not dramatically different from the ambient OVO “sound” that Drake’s producers have perfected. Instead, it is Drake’s presentation of self and romance that needs to evolve. “My Side,” with its taut images and consistent focus on the issues in the relationship, is an encouraging step forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The year is 3015. It has been one thousand years since the release of ‘Foil Deer’ by Speedy Ortiz,” begins the Michael DeForge-penned comic that accompanied the announcement of the second album by the Allston (formerly Northampton) punk rockers. It continues: “Now ‘Foil Deer’ by Speedy Ortiz is everywhere—in our nasal implants, in our tap water, in the disembodied voices of our dead relatives, in our pets.” Why does DeForge suggest the album will gain such significance? “It represents a crucial key to our ancient past—when mankind was loving, cruel, exuberant…covered in skin and easily hurt.” High praise certainly, but not undeservedly so. Speedy Ortiz’s latest is a stunning, vitalizing release—a powerful album about wounding and being wounded, healing, and surviving.
Speedy Ortiz started in 2011 as the solo project of Sadie Dupuis, the band’s current lead singer and lyricist. Dupuis, who is a tremendous lyricist and vocalist, imbues her group’s songs have thorny and complicated lyrics that pair compellingly with their dense, blistering sound.  Dupuis’s project quickly grew into a group and that released its debut album, “Major Arcana,” in 2013. Since their incredible debut, they have replaced their guitarist—Devin McKnight is a compelling addition—and released an EP. Their latest album, “Foil Deer,” is an exciting intensification, amplification, and expansion of their previous sound.
“Foil Deer” opens with a minute of a heavy guitar riff laid over squalls, squeals, and general clatter. Dupuis’s voice emerges in the last 30 seconds of the track (“Good Neck”), singing sweetly if threateningly: “Watch your back / because baby’s so good with a blade.” It is a harrowing beginning to a searing album. Part of what makes the album so hair-raising is Dupuis’s fascination with the darker elements. Speedy Ortiz’s songs often have macabre lyrics and a wonderfully churning, snarling sound to match. On “Dot X,” Dupuis sings over an abrasive guitar line: “Don’t ever touch my blade you fool / you’ll be cursed for a lifetime.” Elsewhere, she approaches the subject with more humor. On “My Dead Girl,” a stunning track, she describes herself as having a “brain like a sphinx / But got nails like a prom queen.” This is familiar territory for the band—on “Plough,” from “Major Arcana,” Dupuis sang of a former lover, “You picked a virgin over me,” with a hellish, curse-like intensity.
Dupuis seems interested more generally in those at the borders and boundaries of society. In “The Graduates,” she sings fondly of high-school slackers: “We were the French club dropouts / But we never got excused from class.” The song is about the painful entrance into adulthood of these disaffected and alienated youth—the “French club dropouts” become “law school rejects.” With an aching intensity, Dupuis sings, “I was the best at being second place / But now I'm just the runner-up / At being the second one you think of every day / Before you go back to one.” It is an evocative and deeply affecting listen.
It is in these margins that Dupuis finds a central energy and power. We live in a dark world—or “Dvrk Wvrld,” as the last track is titled—she seems to be acknowledging, a place that can be cruel, wounding, and demeaning both personally and systematically. On this album in particular she explores societal inequalities. It is through engagement with the margins, with boundaries, with liminal, murkier energies that the album  gains power. Sometimes her lyrics come off as merely lumpish jingles of empowerment—on “Raising the Skate” she sings “I’m not bossy, I’m the boss”—but with her punkish verve and her earthy grit, she manages to make them seem vital and necessary nonetheless. More frequently, the lyrics themselves are genius—on “Mister Difficult” she sings, “Boys be sensitive and girls be, be aggressive,” and it is a stunning, essential rallying cry. While Speedy Ortiz’s music won’t likely stay relevant for an entire millenium, the group has created the sort of powerful and transformative music that should be welcome in nasal implants and tap water.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
British pop artist Jessie J took the stage in pink hair and a Harvard T-shirt for the College’s annual Yardfest concert in Tercentenary Theater on Friday, although for some concertgoers, the student bands who opened the show were the highlight of the evening.
Jessie J paused after performing her hit single “Domino” to address the crowd on Friday.
“Congratulations to every single person out there for getting the dream, for going to Harvard,” she said. “I have so much respect for you and how hard you all work.”
The singer went on to perform her song “Nobody’s Perfect” and told students, “whatever you’re beating yourself up about, let it go.”
The 27-year-old pop artist topped charts in 2011 with “Price Tag,” and again last fall with her hit single “Bang Bang,” a collaboration with artists Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj. Jessie J closed out the concert with the two hits in an encore.
Despite some concerns about the density of the crowd—which was packed at the front, to some students’ discomfort—College Events Board co-chair Dakota Santana-Grace ’16 said he felt the concert drew “one of the best crowds in the history of Yardfest.”
“I think it was probably the most successful and energetic Yardfest I’ve seen,” Santana-Grace said.
Some concertgoers said their lack of familiarity with Jessie J’s work detracted from the event, citing last year’s headliner, R&B singer-songwriter Janelle Monáe, as a more popular artist.  “I think Janelle worked with the audience a little better. A lot of people aren’t as interested as they were last year,” said Yardfest attendee Mounir M. Jamal ’17, who said  he was unfamiliar with Jessie J’s music.
Still, while Kevin Hong ’15 said he was “excited more about last year’s artist,” he noted that “Jessie J has a couple hit singles, so I’m not complaining.”
For many attendees, the bands student bands that opened for Jessie J—the Intrinsics and Black Tie Affair, who were chosen to perform following a March competition—highlighted the outdoor concert.
“I’m more excited about the Intrinsics,” Hong said.
The Intrinsics, a soul band comprised of Harvard and Berklee College of Music students, debuted four original songs as a “trial run” during Yardfest.
Black Tie Affair, composed of five students, also performed some covers for the first time.
“The crowd was super into it; it felt good,” said Vibav H. Mouli ’16, who sings for the self-described “middle school rock” band. Mouli said that for the band, who have only been performing together for about four months, playing at Yardfest was “very new for us, and it was great.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also attended this year’s concert. “I think it’s a great way our community comes together,” said Khurana, who added that the opening bands were “amazing.”
“Harvard has a strong student band tradition,” Khurana said.

Congratulations on getting through another Yardfest! Whether you remember it or not, you and your friends “dirty danced into the moonlight” and were “shown how to graduate” by headliner Jessie J. While walking around Tercentary Theatre and trying to not get trampled in the crowds, Flyby overheard the most interesting things said.
"Who is Jessie J?" Those who did not read this post.
"I don't think Jessie J is wearing pants. Does she usually not wear pants?"Hey, it’s hot up there. No pants, no problem.
"Yeaaaah Jessie take it off!!!" When Jessie took off her Harvard t-shirt. Which she promptly replaced with a Yale t-shirt the next day. Red looks better on you, Jessie.
"We should crowd surf!!" Those who thought that, before Jessie J took the stage, it would be a good way to pass the time. Many people had to avoid the flailing arms and legs #thanks
"So we're like a state school now, right?" Everyone who thought that drinking and partying during the day made Harvard an honorary state school.
"I think I'm getting crushed right now"Everyone in the moshpit, especially those who couldn’t be seen by the taller people around them.
"Akefnclwpedfnfm"What one could hear Jessie J saying when she was talking.
“Oh no… my snap story…”Everyone looking at their Snapchat stories the morning after.
