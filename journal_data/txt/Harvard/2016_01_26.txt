To the editor:
The Crimson ran an editorial about Tsinghua University's "Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought" course on edX. This article asked edX to clarify its conflict of interest policy. EdX’s policy is simple and based on academic freedom. I am writing to express my personal belief about why this is important in the context of this specific course.
My undergraduate education began with a student-run school tour which mixed exaggerations with pure myth. From the school’s mythology, we developed a strong understanding of our school’s identity and culture. Later, in Medieval History, we were inundated with birth and death records (where a large fraction were Mary/no last name, making it impossible to correlate the two), and with documents containing incorrect and contradictory information. Perhaps at this point, the astute reader might understand the goal of this letter. 
Diverse opinions and incorrect information are
integral—not in opposition—to the learning process. Teaching is not the pouring of knowledge into the empty vessel of student brains, where if the wrong knowledge is poured in, the vessel is forever polluted. Rather, learning is a complex, experiential process with complex goals, including:
- Working with primary and secondary sources
- Managing contradicting and incorrect information
- Developing critical thinking skills
- Developing cross-cultural skills
- Understanding points of view contradicting our own
As a student, I immersed myself in Indian, Chinese, and Nigerian cultures, which gave precisely such opportunities. Those led to insights about global education which ultimately led to my role in creating the Open edX (then MITx) platform. We would like to provide similar opportunities to less privileged students. "Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought" is precisely such an opportunity—a course taken by every Chinese
undergraduate which gives a unique perspective on one of the most important
cultures in the world. That experience involves understanding (rather than agreeing with) the material in the course. I trust our students. People who choose to take edX courses are a driven, self-motivated, inquisitive bunch. In contrast to the authors of the staff editorial, I remain skeptical that many of our students will blindly accept everything in a course titled "Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought" from a Chinese government university and come out as Maoists.
I hope that we will see similar courses from other institutions outside of our own political and cultural spectrum. I am delighted to see growth of MOOCs from a range of cultures, from the Christian right on proprietary platforms such as Luxvera, to Islamic instutions on platforms such as zadi.net (enabled by Open edX). I am not threatened by their ideas. Rather, I am confident that such exchange will help us understand each other, making the world a better, more peaceful, and more thoughtful place.

Relax is a word that you don’t hear too often at Harvard. We are either working on this p-set or that essay. This practice or that project. This mixer or that interview. At this time of year, classes start piling on and extracurriculars ramp up; life feels like a semester long sprint to summer break.
The endless opportunities to explore and learn here are amazing, but it’s hard to juggle everything that Harvard has to offer. As busy as we all are, I believe it is essential to make time for ourselves to let loose or wind down.
Harvard students are perennially busy. And that’s a good thing. If we weren’t, we wouldn’t be taking advantage of the university we have been blessed with attending. But there needs to be a balance. A study conducted at Stanford shows that productivity declines sharply once someone works for more than 50 hours in a week. For this reason, we should strive to be busy with the things that we care about, are passionate about, or thoroughly enjoy. If there’s one thing that I have learned in the past year, it’s that our time here is limited and we should spend it on what we want. If there’s an ancient mythology class that sounds cool, go for it. If there’s a painting society, IM sport, or cultural club that looks fun, go for it. I understand that your schedule isn’t always up to you and not everything will be fun. That’s all the more reason to make sure at least some part of it is something to look forward to.
No matter how much is on your plate, you have to find time to let your brain recharge. Too many students just keep plugging on in an endless game, trying to catch up to their ever-expanding schedule. This doesn’t necessarily mean we need to change our schedules; often times, we are in these cycles  because we haven’t taken enough time to relax and recoup. We become tired and inefficient. Sleep deprivation is a big productivity killer, comparable, in some cases, to “legal drunkenness.”
How many times have you been half awake in class only to not absorb anything and spend twice as long learning the material on your own later? This only leads to more work piling on and less time to relax. Over and over again. Take that hour to go to the gym, walk along the river, or watch that episode of Thrones, and it’ll save you many hours later.
Mental health has become a really important cause for concern on college campuses and Harvard in particular. We need to do something about the stress that too many students feel on a daily basis. The culture of Harvard should be passionate and hardworking, not overcommitted and under-rested. While certainly a lot can be done on a campus wide scale, there is a lot we can do on a personal level to take ownership of our health and happiness. If we tackle a busy day knowing that we are doing what we love, it feels a lot less like work and a lot more like fun.
There is nothing wrong with an ambitious schedule. Harvard is a place where we should be encouraged to challenge ourselves and strive to reach our potential, and I would be lying if I said that I didn’t have a busy schedule myself. All I am saying is that we should use that drive and put it towards a schedule that is not only productive but also balanced. Success and happiness are not mutually exclusive. In between those p-sets and practices, we just have to make some time to relax.

I sat in the library thinking, “How will it all get done?” This is anxiety. Maybe you’ve experienced it. It starts low like the bubbles of boiling water at the bottom of a pot, burning slowly near the heart; bubble by bubble, it begins to rise. How are you? Bubble. So much work? Bubble. No sleep? Bubble. It’s studying, writing papers, getting great grades, participating in multiple extracurricular activities, making and being friends, preparing for a career or grad school or both, being a leader, growing up, being accepted, having convictions, yet still fitting in, and so on.
Surviving the anxiety requires morphing into a certain kind of addict—not the kind that uses drugs and alcohol to mask a deep emotional malfunction but rather, the Google calendar addict. I’m talking about the spreadsheet sidekick seekers. I’m talking about an addiction, not in dark corners, but one accepted in the broad daylight of our campus and sometimes even celebrated.
I’m talking about the balance addict. I’m talking about me.
This addiction is the need for everything in our lives to go smoothly and as planned, according to a certain color-coded scheme. Some call it the work-life balance. It’s the thought that everyone needs to have a little bit of this and a little bit of that and then it will all be perfect and there will be success and happiness with family, friends, money, and accolades. And all these things will hang beautifully in balance.
I don’t think the addiction is to plans or goal setting. Instead, we are addicted to the notion that everything will work out perfectly if it’s planned correctly. We want everything to fit, because we want to do everything. That is the addiction. I am not just a student or a musician or a girlfriend or a daughter or a sister or a writer or a Netflix devotee; I am all of these things, and I want to be all of these things.
When things start to clash, I instinctively search for ways to balance everything. I look for the articles that will tell me I need to eliminate things from my life. But I don’t know how helpful these bits of advice actually are. Sure, if I decided to just be a student or just a musician, maybe my life would be a more balanced. Maybe it would be easier to make everything go together seamlessly. But I have a feeling it would also be a whole lot less satisfying.
Moreover, getting rid of the things that make my life full doesn’t ensure an easier, smoother life. Because being human means there is a real chance of getting “quadded.” Or your brother calls because he’s in trouble and needs your help and three hours later you’re still on the phone and your problem set is incomplete. Or your flight is canceled because of a blizzard. Or you miss too many Crimson Editorial Board meetings, or you don’t practice your instrument for long enough. Or perhaps, you and your roommate waste thirty minutes in the empty reading room just laughing.
These mini-failures and time drainers can seem frustrating. They get in the way of the goals, the schedule. They place themselves naturally in the rhythm of our lives. They are the intervention to the balance addiction. And when they intervene, we feel the need to look at our calendar once more, because the bubbles are rising again and we are off balance.
I’ve heard many people say that the fullness and madness of Harvard life is what makes being here so great. This place is full of people who do amazing things, people who do everything. Maybe a new perspective within that madness is needed—one that fully acknowledges the push and pull of daily life and in so doing, is better able to see its beauty. It could help us focus less on to-do lists and more on being prepared and present people. It won’t get rid of the anxiety, but might enable us to be more at ease within the anxiety. Sometimes, no Google calendar can help. We must shift, adapt, and breathe in the tension, because that is the reality of life.
So when your brother calls and you talk to him for hours, you’ll know it was better than getting a head start on the problem set. When the shuttle runs late, you know there’s nothing you can do or improve with worry; you just do the next right thing. And when you sit in the library and think, “How will it all get done?” you know that somehow, some way it can get done.
The refrain of one of my favorite songs goes, “Tension is to be loved when it is like a passing note to a beautiful, beautiful chord.” I don’t want to seek the allusion of finding balance anymore: It can’t be found. It doesn’t work that way. But I do want to learn how to live well in the tension. Maybe somewhere in the bubbles, a truly beautiful harmony is waiting to emerge.

Paying Harvard’s tuition is no small feat. With a sticker price of $60,659, the annual cost of attending Harvard for undergraduates continues to rise by three to four percent every year.
One slate of candidates for the Harvard Board of Overseers purports to offer a solution. Led by conservative Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron K. Unz ’83, the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket is making the case that Harvard, with its $37.6 billion endowment, should make undergraduate tuition free. The underlying logic is that free tuition would attract a more socioeconomically and racially diverse student body. The slate is also critical of race-based affirmative action, which it claims is unfair, particularly towards Asians.
Despite its appealing name, on both tuition and affirmative action the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” slate is off the mark. We continue to believe that affirmative action is crucial to ensuring that Harvard remains a diverse, equitable, and transformational institution. Moreover, we do not endorse the idea of eradicating tuition at Harvard entirely. As we have previously opined on Senator Bernie Sanders’ proposal for free tuition at public colleges, such a plan is unreasonable. Put simply, free tuition would provide an unnecessary subsidy to students whose families who can afford to pay for college.
The slate’s proposal on tuition also faces a practical obstacle: Harvard’s endowment, as it is currently structured, would be incapable of making free tuition a reality. “There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard’s, can be accessed like bank accounts,” Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement on the slate’s ideas.  “In reality, Harvard’s flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it must be maintained in perpetuity and that it is largely restricted by the explicit wishes of those who contributed the endowed funds.”
In short, free tuition is neither a feasible nor an appropriately targeted approach to making Harvard more equitable. Other reforms, however, would help reduce cost barriers for deserving applicants. Despite Harvard’s generous financial aid program—the budget of which often increases faster than tuition—some costs still interfere with low-income students’ ability to take full advantage of their time in Cambridge. Expenses like textbooks, printing, and laundry can cause undue stress for many students. These issues are not new, but Harvard must renew its efforts to address them.
More broadly, an expansion of Harvard’s financial aid program has the potential to make college more affordable for students who struggle under the current system without needlessly subsidizing families that can afford the sticker price. While the realities of the endowment militate against quick action on this front, the ongoing capital campaign aims to raise $600 million dollars for financial aid, a sum that could expand the number of families for whom tuition is negligible.
Ultimately, the cost of college is hardly a trivial issue, and Harvard would do well to work towards slowing the growth of its tuition. But the free tuition proposal of “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” represents an impractical solution that ignores the reality of the endowment and the potential for growth in the financial program. Harvard should pursue better ideas as it seeks to make college more affordable.

UPDATED: January 26, 2016, at 1:25 p.m.
With a new slate of sophomore concentrators, the undergraduate degree in Theater, Dance, and Media will offer 12 courses this spring that span a spectrum of acting, dancing, and directing.
Courses include tutorials and more niche offerings, such as a movement lab, a scenography course, and a course on Argentine tango. Officially launched in October, the new concentration offered 13 courses in the fall semester. Five sophomores declared TDM as their concentration in November, following two juniors who had already declared earlier. According to English professor Martin Puchner, who chairs the TDM concentration committee and led the program’s development, TDM now has 13 concentrators.
The concentration strives to integrate both the academic and practical perspectives across the three disciplines that comprise the field of study, according to program affiliates.
Deborah D. Foster, the director of undergraduate studies for TDM, emphasized the applicability of the courses beyond the stage or screen.
“The instructors are working very hard to direct students to think with the practice they are using to investigate what theater, dance, and media forms actually produce in terms of knowledge, resources, and personal expression about what’s going on in the world,” she said.
TDM 120: “What’s So Funny? Introduction to Improvisational Comedy” was a popular course scheduled on Monday, with around 130 students auditioning for 14 spaces. Dramatic arts lecturer Remo F. Airaldi, the course’s instructor, stressed the usefulness of the skills learned through improvisation for success outside of the classroom.
“We are going to be studying comedy and collaboration,” Airadi said. “It’s deceptive because it’s not so much about comedy as it is collaboration, which can be applied to any field.”
Puchner echoed TDM’s common theme: the intersection of the different artistic disciplines in an attempt to understand their impact on society.
“We’ve said from the beginning that we present traditional theater and dance course,” Puchner said. “But we are really interested in is connecting these three. We don’t want them to be silos.”
Several concentrators said they already see the benefits of this integrated approach in the classes they have shopped this semester.
“It has something for those who are interesting in the academic side and the performative,” Eliza B. Mantz ’18 said of the required sophomore tutorial, taught by Puchner. “[It’s] combining seminar based discussions with performances, thinking not only about what it means but also why and how.”
Despite the curricular emphasis on combining both theoretical and practical perspectives to theater, dance, and media, some concentrators said there is still room to achieve a greater balance between the approaches.
“TDM listed courses are practiced based,” TDM concentrator Sam A. Hagen ’18 said. “I hope it will change. I hope there will be more theory-based.”
Foster admitted the concentration is in its beginning stages, and said administrators may continue to refine the class offerings to better reflect the concentration's goals.
“The more a student has the experience of being engaged in this complicated social, intellectual practice the better prepared they are for the world,” Foster said.

For most of the spring semester, students and faculty members heading to William James Hall—the 15-story home of the Psychology and Sociology departments and the Social Studies concentration—will face delays as they travel to higher floors.
One of three elevators in William James Hall has grounded to a halt, frustrating faculty and students alike. The elevator is not broken but is undergoing renovation as part of a larger upgrade process begun last July, according to building manager William J. Santoro.
Each elevator car takes 14 weeks to update. The project is running on schedule, and all three elevators should be operational again in May, Santoro wrote.
“It’s a big project,” Santoro wrote in an email. “We’re replacing everything—the cars, the control, hoistway, et cetera.”
According to Santoro, the elevators were due for an upgrade. One has already been upgraded, another has yet to be overhauled, and a third is currently under construction.
“[We’re only] doing one car at a time, so that we could keep two elevators running for the duration,” Santoro said.
Despite these precautions, students and faculty who frequent the building expressed frustration with both the renovation process and the general functionality—or lack thereof—of the elevators.
“I have been going to [William James Hall] at least two times a week for classes since freshman year, and I don’t recall a time when all three elevators were functioning,” said Psychology concentrator Iris Feng ’17. “I’m always late for my classes, past the seven minute mark, because there’s always a huge crowd waiting for one elevator to arrive.”
Feng added that she began to use the stairs this year. She called her decision a “faster” and “healthier” choice.
Associate professor of sociology Jocelyn Viterna said she considers the non-functioning elevator “an incentive to walk.” She said she would encourage anybody on the fifth floor or below to take the stairs.
“Those who are on the higher floors are the ones who need it,” Viterna said.
But sometimes the stairs are not the easiest, or quickest, option.
“I have a tutorial on the fifteenth floor, so taking the stairs...isn’t really feasible,” Psychology concentrator Isabel G. Alexander ’18 wrote in an email. “Funnily enough, I’m waiting for the elevator right now.”
Though Santoro predicts that the upgrade will be completed by May, some remain skeptical that all three elevators will ever work at the same time.
“The elevators are basically a running joke in William James,” Psychology concentrator Garrett R. Maron ’16 said. “Most people have developed a sense of humor about the delays. It’s just a fact of life for us.”

Back on campus after a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig said the campaign was a learning experience in the challenges affecting democracy in America.
In particular, Lessig said restrictive changes to the Democratic National Committee’s debate eligibility requirements excluded him from the stage, limiting the visibility of his electoral reform platform.
Lessig said he  is now looking for the Republican Party to continue his proposed reforms and sees businessman Donald J. Trump as the candidate with the best chance of enacting the campaign finance reforms he ran on, given his strident criticism of Super PACs, political organizations used to funnel tens of millions of dollars into political campaigns.
“I’ve long thought that we will only get reform if a Republican proposes it,” Lessig said.
The center of Lessig’s hope for the Republican Party is none other than Trump, a bombastic billionaire who Lessig said has created an environment where supporting Super PACs is “toxic.” On the issue, Lessig said Trump can “crush” rival Sen. Ted Cruz, who considers political donations free speech.
"As much as it’s impossibly difficult for me to imagine a Donald Trump presidency.... I do kind of think that the highest probability of fundamental reform is if Donald Trump is president,” he said.
Looking beyond national politics, Lessig said his return to the Law School “feels sane.” After his time spent traveling on the campaign trail, he is preparing to teach three classes this term.
Despite the full schedule, he said he will “do as much as he can” to stay involved in the upcoming election cycle but stopped short of endorsing a candidate.
Lessig has had an active and varied academic career prior to his campaign. He is an expert in Eastern European constitutionalism, a prominent voice in the fields of internet security and copyright law, and most recently, an outspoken critic of gerrymandering and the outsized role of money in politics.
He launched his latest project—a bid for the United States presidency—this September after raising $1 million from small donors. He ran an unconventional single-issue platform centering on a proposed legislation titled “The Citizen Equality Act of 2017,” a series of reforms to expand voting rights and limit the role of corporate political contributions. Lessig originally promised to resign after signing the legislation into law.
However, his bid stalled out after the initial round of donations, and he failed to register enough support in polls to qualify for Democratic debates. He officially ended his campaign on Nov. 2.
“To have the appetite to join the political fray as a citizen is laudable, whatever the result,” Harvard Law Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain said of his colleague’s run. “It's to Harvard's credit that he had the freedom to take the leave he needed to do it, and then return to his research and teaching.”
Reflecting on his campaign, Lessig said he regretted his promise to step down after completing his electoral reforms, calling the issue an “albatross” that distracted from the rest of his platform. Despite backtracking on that promise in October, his poll numbers remained low, hovering at or below one percent.
“It was a gamble, but I don’t think it was a mistake to make the gamble because we got damn close,” he said. “I certainly wish that I’d done it differently, but I don’t wish that I hadn’t tried.”
If the Democratic Party had not changed the criteria for its debates this year, Lessig said, he would have been able to present his platform to the nation.
“I think he knew this would be an upstream fight to say the least,” Zittrain said, “but his instinct that this is a ‘change’ year in politics, one where people are hungry for something other than business as usual, has proved true.”
While he said he views Trump as the candidate with the best chance of carrying out fundamental campaign finance reforms, the openly liberal Lessig said he was originally a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders before becoming concerned over the credibility of Sanders’ platform.
“You could love everything that Bernie is saying, but unless you change the political system and end this core corruption, nothing that he’s talking about is even credible,” Lessig said.
He said he will continue to weigh in on the election and fight for reforms while juggling a demanding teaching schedule this spring.
“I will do whatever I can, as much as I can,” Lessig said.

Undergraduates registering for the spring semester this past week were asked their religious identification and affiliation as part of an effort both to gauge the religious demographics at the College and connect students with appropriate Harvard chaplains.
Student names and contact information will be distributed to the various chaplaincies, who will then reach out directly to students with invitations for their respective religious or nonreligious communities, such as subscribing to email lists, according to Undergraduate Catholic chaplain Mark W. Murphy.
Results from the question will help improve the chaplains’ capabilities in providing advising, counseling, and support services to undergraduates, Murphy said.
Mennonite chaplain Alexander B. Hernandez-Siegel said the addition of the question is timely and appropriate, particularly in light of University President Drew G. Faust’s recent statements of the University’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. Hernandez-Siegel said he worked with Debra Dawson, staff assistant to the Board of Ministry and Harvard Chaplains, to guide the question through the approval process and coordinate with the Registrar.
Inquiring about students’ religious affiliations is not a new initiative, Hernandez-Siegel said. In the past, the Harvard Chaplains have conducted their own questionnaires at events like orientations and fairs, though the distribution of paper forms has proven inefficient in the recent decade.
“It was time to have more of a unified and more formal method of collecting this information,” Hernandez-Siegel said. “This is more streamlined, and it also shows more of a University commitment…to religious diversity at Harvard.”
Along with assisting the chaplains in their quest to improve student outreach, the registration question will ideally increase undergraduate awareness of the existence and availability of the chaplains, Murphy said.
Humanist chaplain Greg M. Epstein said the question also encourages students  to actively consider their views and beliefs when entering Harvard, regardless of their specific affiliation or degree of spirituality.
“All of the chaplains can really agree that it’s a good thing to think about where you fall, or where you would place yourself, on the spectrum of religious and nonreligious affiliation,” Epstein said. “It’s a process of self-reflection, really.”
Having a better sense of the religious demographic makeup of the undergraduate community benefits the Harvard Chaplains as well, Hernandez-Siegel said.
“I think the big picture will give us a stronger outlook in terms of support services we do like to provide, and how to design them based on the information that we have,” Hernandez-Siegel said. “This will give us a stronger foundation of knowing what we should be doing and where we should be heading.”
Epstein said the new registration question reflects an increased collaboration between the diverse range of beliefs in the Harvard chaplaincies, something that will ideally extend to the campus at large.
“No matter what you believe, it’s a good thing when communities of faith and conscience come together to understand one another better,” Epstein said. “I think that this change in registration will contribute to that kind of healthy environment on campus.”
While the overall idea of direct outreach to students was met with positive responses, some students suggested future that iterations of the questionnaire consider other factors, such as the distinction between heritage and belief in students’ religious identities.
“In the case of Judaism in particular, it might be beneficial going forward to just have an option for students to click to hear more about Jewish activities in general,” said Harvard Hillel president Edyt J. Dickstein ’17, who is an inactive Crimson editor. “Some people identify as Jewish culturally or want to hear more about the cultural aspect of it as opposed to one specific denomination or religious activity.”

After unanimously agreeing to change their collective titles last December, Harvard’s House masters have yet to agree on a replacement.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana issued a statement in December announcing that the leaders of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses had “unanimously” agreed to change their title to “suggest a new title that reflects the current realities of the role,” and would announce the replacement sometime early in 2016. Some students have criticized the title for a perceived association with slavery.
But, according to House masters in Winthrop, Mather, Eliot, and Adams, progress on a new title has been slow going.
Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., co-master of Winthrop House, said “no” when asked whether discussions on a new name had begun.
“We're going to discuss [the name change] when spring semester starts,” he wrote in an email last Thursday.
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed that no decision on a new name has been made yet.
“The House Masters have been in discussion and are considering several options for new titles. They have not yet shared their discussions with Dean Smith for his consideration,” she wrote in a separate follow up email, referring to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith.
That, however, has not stopped speculation on potential replacement titles.
Adams House co-master Sean Palfrey ’67 wrote in an email that some potential replacements were less preferable. For example, Palfrey wrote that he found the title “leader”—as Khurana has referred to House masters in recent emails—too boring a title, whereas some more ornate words like “magister” or “rector” are too old-fashioned or religious.
Discussion around House masters’ controversial titles began late last semester, during a tumultuous period of racial protests and activism on campuses nationwide. Within Harvard’s own gates, a group of Harvard Latino students issued a set of demands to University President Drew G. Faust, one of which requested changing the existing nomenclature.
House masters have been publicly supportive of the change.
Mather  House co-master Michael D. Rosengarten wrote in an email that “this change is a meaningful and important illustration of the sensitivity and the caring of those of us who are the heads of the Harvard Houses.”
Additionally, Khurana—a co-master of Cabot House himself—said he was “personally uncomfortable” with the term just one day before he sent out an email signed by all 24 of the College’s resident House masters announcing the title’s planned change.
The House leaders’ docket committee, “a senior College team member,” and the House masters themselves will decide the new title, Khurana wrote in his original email announcing the change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite some technical difficulties, students began their search for spring semester courses on Monday, sloshing through melting snow and swarming into packed classrooms for the first time in 2016.
The my.harvard course selection tool— launched last semester to create a centralized information system for students across Harvard— went offline for a time on Sunday while students attempted to plan their shopping week schedules. Jason Shaffner, managing director for student information systems, said that his office was investigating the “root cause” of the problem.
“We take these things very seriously,” Shaffner said, adding that the system was back up within two hours. “I’m very optimistic, and we’ll be watching.”
The course tool’s loss of functionality did not prevent students from heading off to their classes of choice, many of them, as usual,  filling the classrooms of Harvard’s most popular courses to capacity.
Philosophy 8: “Introduction to Modern Philosophy” attracted more than 100 students, according to Philosophy professor Alison J. Simmons, some of whom were her students from the “framework” course Humanities 10a: “A Humanities Colloquium: From Homer to Descartes.”
“It’s exciting,” Simmons said of the large turnout. “I was expecting maybe 70 or 80 [students] to show up and fewer to take it...The worry now is finding teaching fellows.”
Students who attended the lecture described an auditorium that was standing room only. Still, course administrators chose not to cap the size of the class, a move that some students said reflected the welcoming nature of the course.
“It’s not a lottery class. Even though it’s a large number [of students] she’s not keen on turning people away,” Anisa J. Kureishi ’19 said of Simmons. “That’s the kind of atmosphere she fosters.”
Other courses like Societies of the World 49: “The Worlds of Business in Modern China” offered a case study-based teaching method, rare in the College. The course was also packed full of students, several who initially could not get through the doorway.
“As soon as I walked into the class, the first thing I see is a line of people packed outside the door,” Michael K. Bervell ’19 said. “It was like a tidal wave of people trying to get in...It was an amazing experience just to be there.”
Unlike Philosophy 8, the Societies of the World course is capped at 60 students. William C. Kirby, a professor of Chinese history who teaches the course, described the advantages of the case method and attributed some of the course’s popularity to its unique approach.
“Since it’s in the case method, students have to do three things that Harvard College students don’t always do,” Kirby said. “First they actually have to come to class; second they have to do the reading since we’ll have an open discussion and people will be cold called; third, no laptops or electronics. It’s simply a different type of class that you don’t normally see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students struggled to return to Cambridge in time for the start of classes on Monday as flights across the country were canceled following a snowstorm that pummeled parts of the East Coast.
The winter storm, known popularly as Jonas, deposited record amounts of snow in some cities, leaving many roads impassable and dozens of flights canceled. Major travel hubs including New York City and Washington, D.C., were affected.
“I’m trying to fly out tonight; this is attempt number four,” Cassandra E. Lowell ’17, who lives in Maryland, said. “Since our street’s not ploughed, I might be out of luck.”
Lowell, who is traveling from hard-hit Frederick County, Md., said she was planning to use a sled to try to navigate her blocked neighborhood so she could make her flight on time.
“I can cut through my neighbors’ yards and attempt to wait at the bottom of their driveways for a car to come pick me up,” Lowell said.
Other students coming from the Washington, D.C., area and northern Virginia faced similar obstacles arriving back to the Yard, with chaotic travel conditions complicating a smooth start to the semester.
“I was supposed to fly out Friday night and that flight got canceled, I got a different flight for Sunday night and that was canceled, and then I had a Monday morning flight that was delayed until the afternoon,” said Brooke C. Dickens ’16. “Then they put my luggage on the wrong flight, and I had to wait an hour and a half until it got here.”
“It's been rough,” she added.
While some students said they were frustrated that they were not on campus to attend their first classes, most inconvenienced students said they did not foresee any major problems in their shopping week planning.
“I personally like the first day of class because it’s the easiest and the most fun,” Jessika S. Nebrat ’18 said, who was still in Harrisburg, Pa., as of Monday afternoon. “Luckily my class schedule is pretty set—there was only one class I was shopping—but I’m missing three that I’m going to take.”
For Albert B. Corvah ’18, the first day of classes is crucial for setting the tone of the semester.
“It’s definitely inconvenient to miss the first few lectures of the semester; there were also a couple advising meetings I had to go to,” said Corvah, who hopes to fly into Boston from Baltimore, Md. “It’s not that bad, but I would've liked to be there on the first day and get a good start to the semester.”
Despite the frustrations the storm caused, students managed to stay positive and to find constructive ways to spend their time.
“I watched all of Harry Potter, so that was fun,” Dickens, a senior, said. “It’s been a great start to the last semester of college.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A “bumper crop” of eight new professors has been a welcome addition to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, even as the new faculty members compounded pressures on the school’s already-limited office space.
In computer science, the area in which five of the eight new faculty teach, the hires add much-needed heft to a department that former interim SEAS dean and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said had been operating at “subcritical” size. With the new professors, the number of courses the Computer Science department offers has increased, and SEAS more broadly listed about a dozen new courses for the 2015-2016 academic year.
Madhu Sudan, a recent hire for Computer Science, reiterated the department’s pressing need for new faculty, saying that while Harvard has always recruited strong individual Computer Science professors, the department on the whole “has not been so strong.”
The new faculty, who matriculated last semester, were hired as part of an approximated $60 million donation from former Microsoft CEO Steve A. Ballmer ’77 intended to fund 12 professorships in computer science. A  record-breaking gift from John A. Paulson in the summer of 2015 means that the school has the financial capacity to continue hiring, a major priority in the school’s $450 million capital campaign. Physical limitations, however, persist.
Many SEAS departments are slated to move to a new Allston campus in 2020, but in the interim, long-standing space constraints make it feel “extremely cramped,” Lewis said. For Sudan, his new office in Maxwell-Dworkin is “wonderful,” but he “can see that we don’t have the room to stay this way.”
Paul Karoff, a spokesperson for SEAS, said a group of administrators dedicated to “space planning” is looking for new ways to ease constraints. The school has already relocated some administrative staff to satellite office space in Harvard Square and reclaimed the offices of faculty on extended leave.
Luckily, computer scientists—particularly those who specialize in theory—don’t require much space to work, unlike some of their counterparts who work out of laboratories. Indeed, a number of the recent hires focus on the theoretical side of computer science, for which Harvard’s department is already known. Both Sudan and Boaz Barak, another new computer science professor, conduct their research in more theoretical areas of computing.But at least one new professor, Scott Kuindersma, focuses on the application of computer science through his work on robotics.
While the addition of new faculty members adds space constraints an already cramped school, Lewis and Sudan said the new hires are well worth the additional pressures.
“We’re going to make it work,” said Lewis. “We’ll convert. We’ll double-bunk if we have to for the next four years. We’ll make it work because we’re not going to let that stop the hiring process.”
If SEAS can “make it work” logistically, Lewis said he believes that the concentrated growth in faculty could bolster Harvard’s engineering—and computer science in particular—to levels that rival some of its traditional competitors. The renewed focus on engineering, Lewis said, should have been a priority long ago.
“We should have gotten on the train when some of the other departments did decades ago,” said Lewis. “But, they have no growth capacity. They have to wait for people to retire now, and we actually have incremental appointments we can make which is a huge, huge, advantage for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The first time Harvard field hockey coach Tjerk van Herwaarden saw junior Marissa Balleza play, he was still an assistant coach at the University of Maryland and she was still just a freshman at Severna Park High School—a half hour away from College Park.
From the moment she took the field, however, Herwaarden knew that he was watching a big-time talent.
Three years later, Herwaarden’s and Balleza’s paths crossed again as he found himself putting together his first recruiting class as head coach at Harvard. Remembering Balleza from his days in Maryland, Heerwaarden decided that he had to try to have her join him in Cambridge.
After a long tug-of-war with Cornell for Balleza’s signature, Heerwaarden got his wish, and along with it, a front row seat to see how the high school freshman he had identified so many years earlier would pan out at the college level.
The verdict came just a few months into Balleza’s freshman year, in a mid-week matchup late in October against crosstown rivals Northeastern. Balleza had started all season, making solid contributions to the team as a rotation player. With 4 minutes left and the score still tied 0-0, however, overtime seemed inevitable, and certainly no one was counting on a freshman to break the deadlock.
“The game was going back and forth, back and forth,” Herwaarden said. “No one could get any real chances and players were becoming frustrated.”
But Balleza, in a sequence that would be repeated many more times in her college career, managed to conjure up a goal from practically nothing. With a low, hard shot from the left side of the shooting circle, she buried the decisive point of the match.
From moment Balleza spun away in celebration that day, Herwaarden knew he was no longer watching a star in the waiting. He was watching a star.
“What makes Marissa so special is  at she’s not the kind of player who scores the goals when the game’s already 4-0 or 6-0,” Herwaarden said. “She’s the kind of player who scores when you’re down, or when you’re tied, and no one else can seem to score.”
Balleza followed up her performance against the Huskies with three more goals in her last three games of the season and an assist of the game-winning goal in the Crimson’s overtime win over league foe Columbia in its final match.
GETTING A HEAD START
Players rarely develop into clutch performers by chance, and in Balleza’s case, there is a reason why no moment is ever too big for her.
From the moment she took up field hockey as a fourth grader, her time on the pitch has been filled with fierce competition from none other than her sister, Hannah, who is three years older. Off the pitch, the relationship has been anything but fierce, with Hannah providing the role of a loving mentor for Marissa.
“Hannah was the one who got me into field hockey, and once we both got started, we played with each other every day,” Marissa explained. “She’d get home from her high school practice and show me the new moves she had learned that day, and so every day, I was competing and learning with her.”
Practicing with someone three years older than her helped Marissa prepare well ahead of time for each stage of her career and gave her the confidence that she could compete with anyone. In no instance were these traits more evident than at the end of her freshman season of high school.
Marissa had played on her Severna Park’s JV team all year, but for the state playoffs, most of the JV team joined the Varsity team to provide depth and support. While the experience mainly involved observation from the bench for almost all of the young JV players, Marissa found herself taking the field in a critical semifinal match against her school’s bitter rival, South River.
“It was the end of my senior season, and I was super focused on the game, on ending my high school career on a good note,” Hannah said. “But all of a sudden, halfway through the game, I saw Marissa subbing in and I forgot all that because I realized it was the first time we’d ever played with each other in a real game. Then, she scored two goals to win us the game and send us to the finals, and I just lost it.”
The seniors all around her on the field naturally didn’t faze Marissa, because, after all, she trained with one every day at home.
TAKING HER GAME TO COLLEGE
In Marissa’s first season at Harvard, her sister’s guiding hand once again kept her on track as she had a tough start to her college career.
“I realized even before the season started that the college game was very different from anything I’d played before,” Balleza said. “In high school, you could just run and shoot, but in college, you couldn’t do that anymore. You needed to learn how to control your body, perfect your technique.”
The reminders that she needed to improve did not just come from within, however.
“Coach told me just a few weeks into preseason practice, ‘You’re lazy on defense,’” Balleza recalled. “That a was a big wake up call for me, and it was something that nobody wants to hear, but you kind of have to.”
With the support of her sister, then a senior at Cornell and captain of its field hockey team, Marissa once again made the adjustments needed to succeed.
“Playing with my sister and learning from her has helped me in ways that I’m not sure many other things could,” Balleza said. “She’s been such a big part of my life and helping me develop my skills and confidence.”
Even though Hannah now lives in Chicago, she still made it out to six of Marissa’s games in Cambridge this past season. The consistent support from her sister translated into consistent performance for Marissa on the field, as she netted 13 goals as a junior, good for the fourth-highest single-season scoring haul in Harvard history.
Combined with her 12 goals from freshman season and nine from sophomore year, Marissa now sits second on the Crimson all-time goal-scoring list with 34. Perhaps the more important number, however, is eight—the number of game-winning scores Marissa has, which ranks third-all time at Harvard.
As she heads into her senior season with a handful of school records in reach, Marissa can count on the fact that she’s not going to be chasing them alone. For the Ballezas, it has been a family affair all along.

Last week, we learned that asbestos has been found in the building material of Winthrop. This has created quite the uproar, because asbestos is a harmful material, with the potential to cause diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The administration has claimed that the current levels of asbestos in Winthrop do not pose health problems to students, but people are still, understandably, worried. Should we be worried about the asbestos problem, or is it not a big deal after all?
Flyby has done our research. According to the Senior Director of Facilities Operations, asbestos is most dangerous when it is friable. But what does that even mean? The term “friable” means that the asbestos is easily crumbled by hand, releasing fibers into the air. These fibers are what we should be worried about. The body can’t break them down once they are lodged in lung or body tissues, so they remain there and potentially cause disease—not a very pleasant thought.
The good news is that most building materials that contain asbestos won’t actually release asbestos fibers. The downside is that they will release fibers if they are disturbed or damaged in some way—if an asbestos ceiling tile is drilled or broken, for example. Fortunately, most of us students don’t do much drilling into our ceilings. So does that mean we’re safe?
Not exactly. Drilling is not the only way fibers can get released from asbestos materials. Even things like water damage, continual vibration, aging, and physical impact can break the materials down and make fiber release more likely. That’s slightly more worrying. Does water damage include spilling water (or other liquids) on the floors and walls? Does “continual vibration” entail the extracurricular activity your roommate and her boyfriend sometimes participate in? Should we be worried?
The answer is probably not. At the end of the day, the administration and building experts understand this situation a lot better than we at Flyby do, so we encourage Winthrop residents to trust that Harvard would not let its students live in a toxic environment. Asbestos is used in almost every public and commercial building constructed before the 1980s, and I think we can believe the administration when they say that the current levels of asbestos in Winthrop are not dangerous.
All the same, we are sympathetic to the students’ plight. It’s not fun knowing you’re exposed to just barely-acceptable levels of a carcinogenic toxin, and it sucks that you had to find out from a Crimson article rather than from the administration directly. Maybe this unfortunate incident will encourage the administration to be more transparent about things like this? We can only hope.
