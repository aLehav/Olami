Massachusetts State Police pulled an adult male from the Charles River early Tuesday morning. He was transported to Mount Auburn Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
Officials responded to a call Tuesday morning after a dog walker reported seeing an adult male jump from the Weeks footbridge, according to Jeremy Warnick, a Cambridge Police Department spokesperson.
About an hour and a half later, just past 8 a.m., a State Police team recovered the male from the river and transported him to Mt. Auburn Hospital, according to David A. Procopio, director of media communications for the Massachusetts State Police. The man, who is from Allston, was pronounced deceased at the hospital. State Police detectives are investigating the death, and have not yet released the name and age of the adult male.
The Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office is not currently considering the death suspicious, according to Elizabeth A. Vlock, a spokesperson for the office.
