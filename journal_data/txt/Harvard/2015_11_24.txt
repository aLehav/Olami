In its Nov. 11-15 production of Philip Glass’s “In the Penal Colony,” the Boston Lyric Opera performed a show as memorable and distinctively Kafkaesque as the short story on which it was based. Fully embracing Glass’s minimalism, stage director R.B. Schlather created spellbinding, extreme visuals and a sense of futuristic horror, aided by the haunting performances of the show’s two singing characters. Provocatively exploring issues of justice, torture, tradition, and authority in its 90 minutes, “In the Penal Colony” was modern opera at its finest: tense, daring, and darkly relevant.
In Glass’s opera, the Visitor (Neal Ferreira) is invited by the new commander of the titular European colony to attend the execution of a silent local known as the Man (Yury Yanowsky). The executioner, known as the Officer (David McFerrin), adores the “Apparatus” used in the colony’s executions. The horrifying device kills the prisoner by carving his charge into his flesh over the course of many hours, during which the prisoner supposedly experiences spiritual redemption. The Officer tells the Visitor that the new commander disapproves of the machine and everything it symbolizes: respect, tradition, and order. With an eerily familiar reactionary severity, he pleads with the Visitor to convince the commander of the merits of the Apparatus. But the Visitor, whom Ferreira gives a halting, frightened humanitarianism, is appalled by the Apparatus and demurs, saying he has no power and will not intervene. The Officer finds himself unable to live in a changing world and straps himself into the machine, but it malfunctions and kills him with “no sign of redemption.” Dark material, to be sure.
The BLO scarcely wasted a moment in heightening the horror. The actors took the stage to Glass’s bleak overture, one step per measure: first the Man, in some sort of tribal makeup; then the Officer, in a futuristic (and presumably very hot) orange rubber suit, with an astronaut-like helmet visor; then the Visitor, in an all-white costume, who began to sing, clutching the backdrop’s white walls. The actors were lit entirely from one side, creating shadows that extended completely across the extremely wide stage, which was unadorned save for a raised skeletal trapezoid that served as the Apparatus. The lights changed just a few times, always as harsh and simple as Glass’s signature ostinatos. The show’s staging flowed from the same distortion and detachment that underlie its plot for a powerful unity of purpose.
This unity extended to the acting and choreography. The Visitor moved with an affected twitch, at times looking as if yanked about the stage by a rope, mirroring his confusion and powerlessness. In this physicality, and in Ferreira’s Munchian horror, there may not have been much subtlety, but little was called for: “In the Penal Colony” painted in daring, strident strokes. In one striking moment, the Officer described the Apparatus’s process as the Visitor and the Condemned lay on either side of him, their tortured motions synchronized, underlining a recurring theme: that the Visitor, and the Western civilians he represents, ultimately have less in common with their own law enforcement and military than with the victims of the latter’s inhumanity.
The opera is scored for just two singers: a bass-baritone, the Officer, and a tenor, the Visitor. Both sang superbly, with no amplification (nor conventional melody) to guide them. McFerrin plunged into the depths of the bass clef with a forcefulness that matched his character’s matter-of-fact cruelty, and Ferreira’s climactic high notes were resplendent in anguish. Both singers, as well as the orchestra, conducted by Ryan Turner, performed with enough dynamism—and the play was so visually vivid—that the show sustained interest despite the repetitiveness of Glass’s instrumentation.
In the context of an overdue national conversation about our own criminal justice system, “In the Penal Colony” was not only artistically impressive but timely. When the Officer wistfully recalls his youth, during which the whole colony cheerfully gathered to watch the executions (children in front), or when the Visitor decides, as just one person unfamiliar with local customs, that he cannot publicly object to the Apparatus, “In the Penal Colony” made uncomfortably plain its parallels to the state-sponsored human rights abuses of our own world. The BLO’s production was the epitome of a brilliant vision masterfully executed. With a lens that powerful, it scorched what it studied.

A few weeks ago, Swiss artist Shahryar Nashat installed an exhibition on the first floor of the Carpenter Center and an “intervention” in Gallery 1510 of the Busch-Reisinger Museum. In the case of the latter, the intervening work changes the focus of the room from the ideal to the flawed—not because Nashat's work is lacking, but because many of his pieces thematically revolve around the weaknesses within the concept of perfection. That ideal is embodied by the beauty of Renée Sintenis’ statue “Daphne,” a pre-existing and perhaps antagonistic piece within Gallery 1510.
Although this intervention is fascinating on its own, it also calls attention to Nashat’s larger exhibit “Shahryar Nashat: Skins and Stand-ins” in the Carpenter Center. This exhibit largely focuses on prosthesis, making for a poignant reminder of the physical imperfection inherent in the human body and a powerful metaphor for people’s attempts to take care of themselves. The intervention’s title, “Private Practice,” not only alludes to the imperfection and inexact repetitions of the human body but also indirectly poses a question: How does this concept of imperfection apply to the practice of medicine?
In recent years, physicians have offered various perspectives on this question and explained its relevance to the field of medicine. In his 2003 book “Complications: A Surgeon’s Notes on an Imperfect Science,” surgeon Atul Gawande writes, “[Medicine] is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives on the line.” Unfortunately, however, medicine is often structured around an expectation of perfection. As physician Danielle Ofri explains in her TedMed 2014 talk, “The current culture of medicine today is zero tolerance of medical error.” However, more nuanced dedication to understanding and analyzing failures could likely help healthcare providers improve their treatment of patients in the future.
Recognizing the inevitability of imperfection might also be a more realistic approach. As Nashat’s exhibit reminds us, mistakes are unfortunately intrinsic to human endeavors; to use Ofri’s words, “Error is intrinsic to normal human functioning.” It is impossible to repeat human actions without any adjustment or unconscious variation, as Nashat illustrates in his video “Hustle in Hand.” In the video, characters engage in repetitive activities, such as exchanging dollar bills or eating pieces of chicken. Another object, the dodecahedron, similarly remains constant throughout the video. This object particularly epitomizes the perfection of static objects because it is a Platonic solid, a shape whose symmetry has preoccupied mathematicians for centuries. By juxtaposing such a shape with instances of human repetition, Nashat reminds us of the ways in which human actions in general fail to line up neatly according to expectation. Error in medical practice is only one manifestation of human fallibility.
Yet Nashat’s exhibition speaks to the importance of imperfections, which, particularly within medicine, are relevant for patients, family members, and friends, as well as health care practitioners. Ofri says, “The expectation—by doctors, by patients, by society at large—is perfection.” No single group is culpable for the perception that medicine is a perfect science, and many people are affected by the existence of medical error. Perhaps if patients and families more fully recognize how and why health care practitioners make mistakes, then they can become more active agents in preventing the consequences. We are all implicitly invested in the process of illuminating and analyzing medical errors.

The Boston Sculptors Gallery smells like horse. Using such pungent materials as earth, manure, and hay in her show “Postcards from the Field: Contemporary Pastoralism,” Nancy Winship Milliken transports visitors to a muddy New England pasture immediately upon their cracking open the gallery’s door. Hung as a multi-sensory installation that exposes visitors to the world of husbandry, Milliken’s sculptural work draws unexpected parallels between farming and visual artistry. “Postcards from the Field” demonstrates how artists can transform commercial galleries into environments in a manner that most museums rarely do.
“To the Barn and Back,” a 16 foot-wide matte print with a thick band of leaf-encrusted mud running through its center, looms over the gallery’s short staircase. To create the work, Milliken laid the canvas on the ground and, to simulate the rhythm of the farmer’s routine, repeatedly walked down its length on trips to an oxen barn, constructing with her boots a thick line of mud. Coming across as a clever riff on Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage’s 1953 “Automobile Tire Print” and seemingly rejecting that work’s mechanical gesture and removal of the self, “To the Barn and Back” turns the gallery wall into a site of agricultural tradition.
Hanging adjacently is “Field,” a 20-foot relief of hay-saturated netting. Looking like an unraveled hay bale, “Field” intimately buries viewers under a material that is often only glimpsed off the side of the road. Notably, the work’s dimensions vary each time it is installed, allowing the piece to remain just as alive and responsive as the organic material from which it is assembled. Milliken comments that because her materials are susceptible to changes in the weather and seasons, “time becomes an active element in the work,” which initiates the same continuous dialogue between man and nature that largely defines farming. Taken as a whole, “Postcards from the Field” can be seen as a sculptural deconstruction of landscape painting, engulfing viewers in the sights, textures, and smells of a pasture rather than simply presenting a window onto one.
A few buildings down from the Boston Sculptors Gallery, Galatea Fine Art is a commercial space currently showing “Justin Freed: The Waters of Life: A Refuge,” an exhibition that demonstrates the environmental installation gone wrong. Whereas the immersive atmosphere of “Postcards from the Field” is effortlessly composed by the material qualities of the works themselves, “The Waters of Life” is the artist’s heavy-handed attempt to force immersion upon viewers. The press statement claims that Freed’s “refuge is being curated to fulfill the human need to spend time in a place that is both aesthetically rewarding and emotionally satisfying.” However, the abundance of screensaver-esque digital framed photography and the kitschy “original soundscape” instead craft the ambiance of an electronics store showroom.
In addition to painting the walls deep blue and lowering shades over the windows, Freed attempts to submerge the gallery with video monitors showing rolling waves and marine ecosystems. The numerous media present in “The Waters of Life”—including four fingerprint-marked framed digital photographs of the ocean, two “physical constructions” (videos of waves projected onto shoddily erected panels of undulating wood boards), and audio tracks of bird sounds—serve to distract viewers rather than set them at ease. At times, the show can be superficially therapeutic, but it certainly does not deserve the status of refuge. This shortcoming, however, may not entirely be the fault of the artist, since Galatea Fine Art’s glass walls allow sunlight to flood in from the hallway, undercutting Freed’s attempt to darken the space.
At Kingston Gallery, “Jane Lincoln: All About Color” presents an entirely different approach to crafting an environmental presence. Hung in the intimate central space of the gallery, Lincoln’s 13 small sculptural paintings made of acrylic on paper and hardboard are optically exhilarating. Reminiscent of Gerhard Richter’s “Strips,” each piece is comprised of stacked, varyingly wide horizontal bands of intense hues. Unframed with harsh, hard edges, the geometric compositions are razor thin and held about three inches away from the wall by clear plastic pins, allowing them to hover in space. Lincoln painted the back of each piece in buzzing monochromes, which cast colored shadows on Kingston’s white walls. Standing in the small rectangular gallery, one feels swallowed up by these floating, shadow-casting colors. Though not immersive in the sense of recreating a particular environment, as “Postcards from the Field” is and “Waters of Life” attempts to be, “All About Color” is immersive as a visually stimulating sensorial experience.
Commercial galleries are especially suited to installing environmental exhibitions, as the works on display, often by a single artist, create a homogenous character that permeates the space—both literally and figuratively coloring the white cube. Because the 17 galleries on and around Thayer Street are geographically concentrated, one has the ability to continuously open doors into new artistic atmospheres, which is thrilling, even when an atmosphere is largely created by manure.

The Peruvian Incas are confused by the Spanish colonists’ obsession with gold and wonder if they eat gold to survive. The Spaniards laugh at this ridiculous thought. But yes, they jokingly concede, “We live on gold.” Through this misunderstanding, the Incas come to know the Spanish conquistadors as the eponymous gold eaters in Ronald Wright’s historical fiction novel, “The Gold Eaters.” Wright paints a vivid picture of Peru in the early 16th century as Spanish explorers and colonizers began to arrive, providing convincing perspectives from both the Spanish and the Incas’ side. Despite having an accomplished tone of historical realism, however, the novel is somewhat lacking in plot depth and character maturity.
Wright devotes a great portion of the novel to creating a colorful setting of Peru during the early 1500s, but he does so at the expense of his plot. The novel tells a somewhat cliche adventure and homecoming story through the eyes of Waman, a young provincial from the Incan empire who runs away from home shortly after coming of age. He is soon violently captured by Spaniards and is forced to become Francisco Pizarro’s interpreter. The novel mainly follows Waman’s journeys with the Spaniards, as they attempt to colonize the Incan Empire and search the land for gold. Waman is exposed to a new culture and language and must choose to defend his own while trying to find his way home. The story meanwhile follows Waman’s family and some of the other Spanish colonizers settling in the land. The plot is more or less straightforward and predictable. Its concept provides many opportunities for depth and surprise, but Wright’s adherence to historical fact seems to handicap his fictional license.
Many of the novel’s characters and events are based on real historical figures, which adds to the credibility of the setting. Francisco Pizarro, for example, is a major character, and Queen Isabel and King Charles of Spain make brief appearances. Wright has clearly done plenty of research on the Spanish colonization of Peru, as he provides detailed backstories for most of the historical characters. For example, he describes Francisco Pizarro’s impoverished childhood and how that leads to his merciless ambition. His knowledge on the subject matter is sound, and the setting and characters he creates are vivid and believable.
The book does succeed at highlighting the vastly different perspectives of the Incas, other Peruvians under the Incas, and the Spaniards. Each views the other as savage and strange. To citizens of the Inca empire, the Spaniards are pale as death. The Spanish view of these Inca citizens and their culture as uncivilized and barbaric is perhaps more familiar to the Western reader. When Waman begins learning Spanish, the colonizers ask him, “Como te llamas?” This only confuses him and makes him wonder, “Why was he speaking of llamas? They have none.” Perhaps the most telling moment of the difference in perspectives occurs when the Spaniards ask Waman what his land is called, and he tells them it is called Tawantinsuyu. They ask if it means something, and Waman can only say, “It means… the World, sir… You could say the Four Quarters or… the United Quarters of the World.” The Incas have no concept of the world beyond theirs. The cultural gap between the Incas and Spaniards adds humor to the story, but also allows a better understanding of each side’s motives and instills sympathy for both sides.
Although Wright has clearly mastered the historical background of his characters and setting, the novel is lacking in plot complexity and character development. Wright uses the present tense for nearly the entire novel; while when executed well the present tense can effectively engage and immerse a reader into a story, Wright’s prose sometimes begins to take on the quality of a middle school paper or a colloquial recount. The pacing of the plot is at times tediously slow, yet at other points it progresses at a disorienting speed. In the first chapter, for example, Waman’s cousin Tika gets into a wrestling fight with him, then kisses him and takes off her shift. Waman admires her breasts but is still set on leaving home, and then she resignedly helps him pack some food for his voyage, all over the course of one page. This scene is a pivotal event in the plot, but instead of elaborating on it Wright flies through it. Meanwhile, he devotes multiple pages to some details and dialogue that do not directly move the plot along but only supply cultural or historical information. Given that this is a novel, more emphasis on the plot and less on historical exposition would make for a more engaging story.
Unfortunately the characters are seldom very relatable, and as a result the reading experience feels very distant and unemotional. Tika, for example, is repeatedly mentioned in Waman’s thoughts and memories, but very little is actually revealed about her personality. Despite the fact that Waman sees her as one of his main motivations to return home, she remains very one-dimensional. Pizarro is more developed as a character, but whether he should be sympathized with or seen as despicable is not considered in a way that invokes a deeper layer of meaning. While sometimes a lack of obvious protagonists and antagonists can make a novel thought-provoking, it makes “Gold Eaters” difficult to fully engage with.
Wright’s novel is a well-researched historical work and is certainly an entertaining read. He provides a rich and vivid setting and paints a convincing scene of early 16th century Peru. There is little else to take away from the novel, however, than a history lesson. The story is not particularly intriguing or suspenseful, and it does not raise any questions still relevant today.

Justin Bieber’s latest album reveals a mature artist who has impressively achieved simultaneous rebirth and continued success. Since Bieber dropped “What Do You Mean” in August, topping charts almost immediately, Beliebers have been waiting with bated breath for the full album. On “Purpose,” the singer appears to be experiencing his own Blue Period of sorts. The 21-year-old sounds uninspired and anguished. But these tortured feelings that seem to leave him broken also serve to produce a more substantive artistic venture.
Like any album released from a megastar (and really, is anyone more mega than Bieber?), the work could not be dropped without fanfare. The album’s religious cover art, which features a shirtless Bieber sporting a cross tattoo and folding his hands in prayer, created controversy across the globe. While the Canadian singer has never been shy about professing the role of Christianity in his life, the religious overtones may seem ironic coming from the singer right now in light of certain recent law-breaking behaviors. His bad boy image of late had been so crystallized, complete with tattoos, earrings, and Draco Malfoy-bleached hair, that Bieber seemed to be dangerously nearing that unrecoverable, Lindsay Lohan-trajectory. But with his latest endeavor, he and his myriad producers pulled off creating a coherent and renewed vision of Bieber’s persona.
To approach “Purpose,” listeners must let go of any nostalgia for the high-pitched refrains of “One Less Lonely Girl.” Even Bieber’s more recent tracks, like “Confident,” sound like bubblegum beats compared to this new, definitively post-adolescent album. “Purpose” infuses more R&B flavor into the star’s tracks. Even the sound of his voice, with convincing consistency, is noticeably altered. In tracks like “What Do You Mean” and “Purpose,” Bieber murmurs, as if he’s barely exerting his vocal cords to emanate noise. Listeners get little of the “Baby”-esque pitch fluctuations. Instead, his voice rolls out in fluid, husky strains.
Featuring collaborations from Skrillex, Diplo, and Halsey, “Purpose” is laced with lots of electronic beats. However, The synthetic sounds don’t detract from Bieber’s textured crooning. Tracks like “What Do You Mean,” “Sorry,” and “Company” give listener pulsing, danceable backings. Alternately, “Love Yourself,” co-written with Ed Sheeran, is a melodic treat—the song’s clean vocals, sharp beats, and beautiful trumpet interlude produce a piece that sounds like nothing else in Bieber’s oeuvre.
Bieber keeps his lyrics pretty simple, but his succinctness serves to add to the tunes’ catchiness, probably best exemplified by the namesake chorus of “What Do You Mean?” Thematically, “Purpose” is fairly focused. In classic Bieber style, much of the album deals with heartache. “Sorry,” the second single released from the album, is fairly emblematic of the album’s apologetic overtones. Copious rumors have naturally circulated that this plotline is suggestive of his failed relationship with Selena Gomez. But Bieber seems somewhat ambivalent about his apologies. In the song “Pressure,” he sounds completely supplicant: “Talking to my conscience I made a few mistakes / I did it to myself I'm the only one to blame.” But in “Sorry,” he adds a caveat: “I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to / But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two.”
Though Bieber’s emotions vary by track, he consistently addresses some sort of relational issue. Sometimes he abandons the remorseful sentiments altogether and sounds downright bitter. In “What Do You Mean?” he is especially outspoken about his frustrations: “You’re overprotective when I’m leaving / Trying to compromise but I can’t win / You want to make a point, but you keep preaching.” In “Love Yourself,” Bieber echoes these accusatory tones: “Cause if you like the way you look that much / Baby you should go and love yourself.”
The success of “Purpose” is undeniable. According to Nielsen data released Monday, the album opened at No. 1 on Billboard charts and has sold more copies than any album so far this year. If Bieber is using the the tracks on “Purpose” to test new waters, he’s clearly found sounds with staying power. He seems to be creating a new genre with the album. The marriage of R&B, pop, and EDM beats successfully leads listeners into untried territory—sometimes bordering on rhythms ranging from Latin to grime. The album certainly wasn’t pulled together sloppily. Bieber worked with blockbuster producer Rick Rubin in addition to a number of collaborations with both established artists, like Big Sean, and lesser known names, like Poo Bear.
“Purpose” works because of Bieber’s amorphous emotions, but it soars most when he’s confident and embracing the swagger that has given him his staying power. He encapsulates his efforts best in “Life is Worth Living”: “From what the world may see / They try to crucify me / I ain’t perfect, won’t deny / My reputation’s on the line / So I’m working on a better me.” The diverse and seductive musical complexity of “Purpose” has emphatically proven Bieber’s mature sounds.

Frankie Cosmos’s latest release, a trim seven-and-a-half-minute EP entitled “Fit Me In,” offers a vision of what her music might sound like were she to refashion her guitar-driven indie jangle into slightly skewed synth pop. Greta Kline, under the stage name Frankie Cosmos, is known for her deceptively simple indie pop, witty and incisive lyrics, and incredibly prolific output—her Bandcamp is home to some 50 releases. Like a number of other young singer-songwriters, Kline has benefited from her ability to easily self-release her music and has, for the past several years, been meticulously honing her craft, producing ever more perfect and intricate songs. Her debut studio album, “Zentropy,” released last year on Double Double Whammy, was an absolute breakthrough success. A follow-up will be released next year on Bayonet. “Fit Me In,” sandwiched between these two larger, more straightforward releases, is something else entirely—billed as an experimental one-off, it offers an intriguing alternative vision of what Frankie Cosmos music could sound like. The EP demonstrates that, if anything, Kline isn’t content to rest on her indie pop laurels but is still striving for more varied modes of expression.
“Fit Me In,” which Kline created with frequent collaborator Aaron Maine of the indie rock-moving-towards-electronica band Porches, draws both from indie pop proper (think the D.I.Y. twee punk of early K releases) and from “indie” pop (think contemporary groups like Lower Dens, Purity Ring, and many others of the so-called “metropopolis”). While Kline pulls elements from both of these genres, her music is resolutely, distinctly her own—sweet, sad, slow, spare, and a little strange.
The EP opens with a reworked version of “Korean Food,” a track Kline first released on her 2013 demo “Daddy Cool.” “Korean Food”—initially a droney two-chorder that had an eerie sound—has here been pepped up with slightly more tuneful synths and even a drum machine beat. Like “Sand,” the last track on the EP, “Korean Food” is a beautifully, if briefly, sketched picture of a relationship. In an interview with the Hartford Courant, Kline described the EP as being inspired in part by The Magnetic Field’s three-volume indie-pop classic “69 Love Songs.” Kline’s sonic landscape recalls Stephen Merrit’s idiosyncratic pop vision, and her lyrics, like his, evocatively capture love and intimacy in wonderfully and powerfully offbeat and unusual ways. For instance, in “Sand,” Kline paints a sweet and gently sensual image of physical intimacy in a relationship—by focusing on touch and texture. “I want to kiss your stupid thumb,” she begins, continuing with descriptions of hair and hand holding, and concluding: “touch all the books outside The Strand / the oldest pages soft like sand.” At a mere 49 seconds, it is a perfect pop jewel—tiny, radiant, and beautifully formed.
Kline is a terrific lyricist, and her graceful, witty, and insightful lines are one of the highlights of her music. Critics have often focused on the diaristic or confessional elements of her writing. While Kline certainly draws on her personal experience in writing her poetic lyrics, her works don’t evoke the great confessional singer-songwriters as they do the works of those in the New York School. Kline is a fan of Frank O’Hara—her stage name intentionally evokes his—and it shows. Like his best poems, her best songs have a personal, conversational, but elevated, quality—they are marked both by a loose, free-flowing of ideas and a sense of composed wit. She shares with him a certain wry and slightly ironic vision.
Her dry wit is best on display on the most original track on the EP—the stunning, bedroom pop par excellence “Young.” The track, a wry take on what it means to be young, let alone a visible millennial voice, features Kline’s deadpan delivery of slightly sardonic lyrics such as: “wrote some songs that I sung / and have you heard that I’m so young?” The accompanying instrumentation, which contains, among other sounds, lounge-y, slightly atonal synths, a lovely, beautiful chorus of angelic Frankies, a rich organ-y synth, and a sort of thump clap drum machine beat, is a delightfully Frankie-ish take on pop music. About midway through the two minute run, the track moves from something cynical to something a little more melancholic—Kline sings wistfully about the promised, if not quite experienced, fun of youth. As the song finishes, Kline stakes an existential claim for herself, amidst her malaise; “I just want to be alive that’s it,” she seemingly concludes. There are a few moments of pause, a sort of fake-out ending, and then Kline returns, singing the word “alive” twice, with a hauntingly beautiful intensity. It is a deeply moving ending to a masterful track.

Upon moving to Boston, Jay Calderin saw an opportunity to nurture the city’s unique but neglected fashion scene and founded Boston Fashion Week in 1995. As an author, designer, and professor, Calderin was invited to speak on 19th-century black fashion as part of the Cooper Gallery’s new exhibit, “Black Chronicles II,” which feature photographs of various subjects from artists to royalty. Prior to his Nov. 15 talk, Calderin spoke with the Crimson about his thoughts on the exhibit and his experiences as a leader in fashion.
The Harvard Crimson: What do you hope this exhibit will teach the public about fashion, status, and identity in 19th-century Great Britain?
Jay Calderin: One of the most obvious things that you get from the exhibit…is a little bit of surprise in terms of how African Americans are pictured. We’re so used to images that don’t show them dressed well or dressed theatrically. It’s always sort of a negative stereotypical imagery that we’ve seen for so long…. I was very excited by it because often our students, when we do fashion history, don’t see themselves if they happen to be of color. It goes for a lot of different backgrounds…because a lot of the history we study…is usually more elite and higher fashion. This exhibit really captures some incredible imagery that I think is very empowering.
THC: How do you think photographs from the 19th century are relevant to today’s audience?
JC: A lot of people don’t see the value in it right away, especially when you think about more pop culture things like fashion. But from studying history and fashion history, it’s so obvious that [fashion is] all very cyclical and tells these stories...that have been lost for so long. It’s just a way of showing a bigger picture…. History books are very specific to who wrote them and their perspectives. So this kind of starts to give you a broader picture of history and of how people express themselves through clothing.
THC: What do you think your students can take away from this exhibit or your talk that they can use when making their own fashion choices?
JC: I explain to my students [that] with regard to any culture, there’s a challenge to go a little deeper and think about how you interpret any period in fashion or any particular culture. It’s easy to stereotype and to get lazy about how we will put a person or a culture in a box and wrap it up and say that’s what that is. But I think an exhibit like this challenges you to think about things in a special way. The fashion itself [is] not that unusual for clothing of that period. It’s more about imagining who’s wearing the clothing of that period, whether it be a boxer or royalty.... It’s challenging you to see it in a different light because sometimes history can focus on a very narrow population. As fashion designers, [my students] need to be thinking about how they’re interpreting things and what kind of messages they’re promoting, and not even in terms of interesting clothing but how they present their work…the people represent[ing] their clothes on the runway and in editorials.
THC: Why do you think it’s important to highlight this particular aspect—the fashion—in all the photographs presented in the exhibit, not just for designers but for the general public?
JC: With fashion there’s almost an intimate connection because you can imagine yourself wearing something…. When I heard the story behind [the boxer], it was just so fascinating because he was a man of the world, and he travelled and he dressed well. You could see the pride in the way you want to represent yourself on film. I think it’s still true today…. We express ourselves in what we wear, and [fashion is] just another way into the exhibit and into the stories and history for the general public.
THC: You’ve been executive director of Boston Fashion Week for a few years now, and in 2012, you were appointed creative director of the first Chengdu Fashion Week in China. How do you think your experience directing Fashion Weeks in two very different cultures has changed the way you see fashion?

In her “Empty Chairs,” a stunning first collection of poetry published by Chinese poet and visual artist Liu Xia, her husband Liu Xiaobo, the human rights activist, political prisoner, writer, and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, finds his literary equal. Liu’s poems, published with the Chinese text side-by-side with the English translations by Ming Di and Jennifer Stern, are selected from a 30-year period of Liu Xia’s writing. During that time, Liu Xia saw her husband and her brother repeatedly arrested, jailed, and imprisoned, likely for politically-motivated reasons, and was herself placed under house arrest and constant surveillance. It is no wonder that Kafka is a recurring figure in her poetry. The intense, haunting, visually evocative poems in the collection are accompanied by some of Liu Xia’s visual art, photographs of dolls that seem similarly confined. “Empty Chairs,” as a vision of one woman’s experience of and resistance to nearly overwhelming political force, is an incredibly powerful text.
In reading the poems, one sees how images, ideas, and themes evolved in her work over time, a development which is most vividly visible in the contrast between the opening and closing poems of the collection, both of which explore birds as mysterious haunting images. The opener, “One Bird Then Another,” concerns a couple repeatedly visited by visions of a bird. At first, Liu Xia writes, the bird “brought us / warmth and laughter.” After it leaves, however, the thought of it only brings the couple sorrow and longing for its return. The bird seems to have magically left, just evading the couple. While they pine for it intensely, they become less able to express this desire—“We kept the windows / open, remembering: the bird. / But we didn’t talk / about it any more.” Finally, after an evening out, they return to their home to find the bird gone and something altered in their home. The door is ajar, with a strange light streaming out. The couple finds themselves transfixed, unable to do what they intended—and then the poem concludes: “The bird, again, the bird.” It is an evocative, ambivalent ending to an astonishing poem—a powerful vision of a young couple on the verge of sudden, transformative change.
This poem is intriguingly connected to the last poem in the collection, “How it Stands,” which again concerns unseen birds. “How it Stands” is written as a series of questions and answers. At first, it seems as if Liu Xia is merely being asked about a tree she has drawn—eventually, it becomes clear that she is really being asked about how she represents herself in art and, moreover, how she views her life. The questioner asks if Liu Xia has any company—she responds by referring to birds, which are supposedly in the image of the tree. When the questioner presses her on the birds not being visible, she allows that she does not know how to draw birds, without quite conceding that they aren’t there. When the questioner concludes by accusing her of being “an old, foolish tree,” she stoically responds, “I am.” That these two poems bookend the collection captures the emotional and artistic journey of the collection—from an unseen bird being a symbol and portent of change to a young woman to an unseen bird becoming a symbol of consolation and strength to an older woman in the face of interrogation—from a poem in which the central couple has incredible freedom of movement to a poem in which the central figure is coercively and aggressively questioned.
The rest of the poems in the collection trace Liu Xia’s changing emotional experience—in the face of intense political repression of her and her loved ones. Sometimes, she captures her experiences with grotesque, macabre images, such as in the poem “A Grapefruit” where she writes: “I’d rather be in pain / and die in pain peacefully / then watch my body rot / with maggots squirming inside.” Other times, she better captures her grief with lines that are all the more devastating for their understatedness and quiet sorrow, as in the poem “Snow,” dedicated to her brother: “and I dream of you all the time. / In my dream you quarrel with me— / it must be hard to be my brother.” The title piece of the collection weaves together the more macabre and quietly haunting elements of her work—in it, Liu Xia writes of presumably of her loved ones being imprisoned: “Empty empty empty / so many empty chairs / everywhere….they are frozen / by what’s breathing inside.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Below the minimalistic nameplate, a five-column layout of text is intermittently complemented by color photos. Bylines are printed in a different font from content, and articles are divided by thin dark lines. This is the front page of The Harvard Crimson with which current students are familiar—so much so that it is hard to imagine that the newspaper used to look otherwise. However, just a short 15 years ago, The Crimson looked drastically different, featuring black and white photos, longer stories on every page, and a marked absence of infoboxes and graphical features.
It is notable that The Crimson has changed so much during such a short portion of its 142-year history. Following the internet journalism revolution, The Crimson transitioned from a primarily physical publication into a multi-platform, digital-focused outlet spanning print, computers, and mobile devices.
1998 marked the birth of The Crimson’s website. Unsurprisingly, the design of the first version of the website looked both crude and lackluster by the standards of today’s aesthetics. The paper’s name—“thecrimson”—was displayed in lowercase Times New Roman font in the top left corner of the webpage, with a banner and a menu stretching right and down respectively, both in dark red. At any given time, there were typically on the front page fewer than seven entries, accompanied by two or three photos, some black and white—a layout that retained a lot of blank space within the browser page. In fact, a decent portion of the website was devoted to providing an alternative way to read the print newspaper online, exemplified by sections such as “In Today’s Paper” and “Daily Index”—the latter section directed readers to a comprehensive list of that day’s news articles, opinion pieces, and features. However, even in this early iteration, the website also included content tailored for the digital medium, with exclusive internet features such as “Breaking News” and “Web Specials.”
If the first online design of The Crimson could be considered crude by today’s standards, then the second version—launched in late 2001—could be called austere. In this iteration, news titles were still presented in Times New Roman font, but they were also marginalized to the default font size and the blue color used for hyperlinks. The website now more closely mimicked the stark layout of a traditional print newspaper with an extended length landing page that included many more stories—13 pieces were featured on the front page of the website on October 31, 2001. However, despite the increase in quantity of content on display, the decreased prominence of each piece potentially rendered the website as a whole less distinctive.
It was not until the redesign of late 2005 that the familiar aesthetic elements of today’s website began to appear. The most important drive behind this radical change was the increasingly dominant role of the internet in people’s daily lives—by this time, more than a seventh of the world’s population had gained access to the internet, up from just over 3 percent in 1998. Having a website became essential for any major news outlet, and there was as much, if not more, care put into creating an attractive and user-friendly design for the online version of The Crimson as for its print edition. By this time, the iconic elements of the current website—the banner featuring the newspaper name, the clear division of columns, and the crimson-colored news titles—were already present, albeit in a more primitive form. The website also looked much more similar to a modern news website than to an online version of a physical newspaper: The news entries were organized by topic rather than by their physical position in the paper, and there was almost no reference at all to the physical copy aside from a screenshot of that day’s front page. A 2009 touch-up further fine-tuned this design with the addition of sections featuring digital-only content from places like the new Flyby blog, as well as a “Most Read” section, which took advantage of the relatively new viewership and analytics features of websites.
With the advent of the mobile web several years later, different priorities emerged for digital redesign. According to E. Benjamin Samuels ’13, president of The Crimson in 2012, the paper conscientiously focused its 2013 redesign on capturing non-desktop users. “The last Crimson redesign of the website had been a couple of years old, and what it didn't necessarily allow for was a good experience on tablets or smartphones, so there was a redesign that was done in large part with that focus in mind,” Samuels says. “It was becoming an increasingly—and I'm sure it still is—large chunk of the online readership. We wanted to make sure we were catering toward that appropriately.”
Given that an increasing percentage of visits had started originating from mobile devices and tablets, The Crimson’s digital focus shifted to accommodate these changes in viewership habits. “There were a couple different reasons we changed the website. Some were from a business perspective...but one of the big things we wanted to do was make the website responsive,” says Robert S. Samuels ’14, president of The Crimson in 2013 and the younger brother of E. Benjamin Samuels. “Meaning that if you view it on your phone, if you view it on your tablet, if you view it on your computer, the website will change to be optimized to the device you're using.”
The most recent website redesign was initiated during the tenure of the elder Samuels in 2012 and ultimately completed in 2013. “We had a couple of people who worked on tech, a couple people who were involved in design, and a couple specifically in online design,” E. Benjamin Samuels says. “There was an iterative back and forth process, trying to understand what we thought worked and what we thought didn’t.” One of these ideas was to create a rectangular block element on the website that was divided into segments for both pictures and text. “Eventually we whittled down from some of the broader ideas to more specific ones—ideas that we thought worked for desktop, for tablet, for smartphone. And ultimately, a year or so afterward, that was where the templates got implemented,” he says. Templates, now a major component of The Crimson’s publication process, systematized the process in a novel way.
This change paved the way toward data-driven design, especially because stories in the “Most Read” section were already prominently featured on the homepage of the website. “I wanted to make sure that [the redesign] was also something that would allow us to create more value for the advertisers of The Crimson, something that would help promote the stories we were writing,” E. Benjamin Samuels says.
Accompanying this key change were some backstage technical updates regarding the speed at which web pages were loaded. "There were also other business reasons that were more technical or tactical—the way pages and articles loaded and things like that,” Bobby Samuels says. “It was pretty well received and generated a lot of excitement. It just looked a lot more visually appealing after the redesign.”
The most recent print redesign, implemented in the fall of 2014, came partly as a delayed response to the changes on the website. One critical development was the realization that the print newspaper would not and could not continue to contain all of the news that The Crimson ran. According to Samuel Y. Weinstock ’15, president of The Crimson at the time, the redesign aimed to be more prescriptive about the content that was published in print versus online. "The paper hadn't been redesigned for 10 years. It hadn't been redesigned since a time when we really didn't have a website with a strong presence. And it not only could use a more modern look, but it could use a leaner structure than it had previously, partly in recognition of the fact that the rest of our content was online,” Weinstock says.
Jake Freyer ’15, the daily design executive at the time, recalls a lengthy ongoing conversation over this matter. "Redesigning that paper had been something that had been an objective for a number of years,” he says. “The Design staff and a few successive generations of presidents and managing editors had decided they weren't crazy about the way it looked, and it seemed like most everybody had some little issue with it. So for at least three years before that, people had been trying to start [the conversation].”
Weinstock saw the print redesign as an editorial opportunity to focus the content of the print publication. "We wanted to start thinking about using the paper specifically to address our on-campus audience and what our on-campus audience would be most interested in, rather than just sort of a document that we would just throw all of our content into," he says. For instance, page two of the paper originally covered world news before being phased out. “That was something that sort of made sense in a time when people weren’t on the internet all the time, and people might actually pick up The Crimson in the morning and look on page two and see what had happened in the world the day before,” Weinstock says. “But obviously today no one is going to do that. No one picks up The Crimson to look for world news, because they’re on Twitter, on Facebook, they’re on the internet. And so what we did was we changed page two to the content that was specifically relevant to life on campus for that day, because the people picking up the paper were going to be people who were going to be living on campus that day. What are the events going on on campus? What’s being served in the dining hall?”
Even today, The Crimson’s Flyby Blog continues to provide daily updates on campus events and dining hall menus. It was important that The Crimson be a paper local to Harvard and local to Cambridge rather than a general newspaper. “The paper would be a tool specifically for someone picking it up in the morning rather than, again, this thing that we’d made as if anyone across the country might pick it up,” Weinstock adds.
However, many of the changes in the print redesign were focused not around the content of the paper, but rather around its physical design. “Many of the fundamental building blocks of the design were altered,” Freyer says. The paper had not undergone a print redesign since the switch to color in 2004, and its old-fashioned aesthetic was, to say the least, impractical. The lack of columns and inability to wrap text around images handicapped design; front pages in particular suffered. “The variation among different front page designs was minimal. We had fallen into a rut of just making the same design every day,” Freyer said.
The Crimson reached out to a local consultant named James M. de Vries, who is currently the creative director of the Harvard Business Review Group. “We got in touch with James, and he responded to the email within a few minutes, saying something to the effect of, ‘I’ve always thought The Crimson could use a shake-up,’” Freyer recalls. “What proceeded was about a seven-month process, including a summer vacation, where we did a lot of brainstorming. We did a lot of idea solicitation from different board members, different editors from every part of The Crimson to figure out what people liked and did not like and what they would like to see in a new design of the paper.” Throughout the lengthy process, editors at The Crimson, including Freyer and Weinstock, tapped into de Vries’s prior expertise in print publication design work in Australia. “They wanted to go through the exercise of doing the design themselves largely, with my advice and supervision,” de Vries says.
Fonts and typefaces were especially important to fix. “Everyone kind of had their own pet bugaboo,” Freyer says. “I really didn’t like ‘The Harvard Crimson’ font that appeared at the top of the paper. A number of people didn’t like our caption font. And the headline font was universally reviled, because it was really huge and wide, and no one could ever fit headlines onto the number of columns they wanted to.” Ultimately, the redesign settled on three “families” of fonts, and the new headline font ended up being more manageably sized. The nameplate at the top of the paper and the body text were assigned unique fonts, while the headline and captions were printed using different variations of the same font family.
“Within the newspaper, it’s always good to have a very strong, hard-working body typeface, which is the key reading typeface,” de Vries says. “And then you get a contrasting typeface, to be a sans serif typeface, for things like subheads and sidebars. You also want something that has a bit more of a personality for headlines.”
According to Freyer, this was not a decision that the design team reached easily. “We did a pretty extensive test of different options—the consultant provided a number of possibilities, including some of his own favorite fonts, and some that some designers he knew had designed. This ended up being one of the major expenses of the redesign because proprietary typefaces are rather expensive,” he says.
Throughout all of these changes, many aspects of The Crimson have remained the same. “The Crimson has a very strong tradition,” Weinstock says. “I think we and classes before us were in some ways a little more hesitant to radically change things like the way the name of the paper is printed, which is something that really hasn’t changed at all in many years.” The philosophy of the redesign was to stay as much as possible in touch with the tradition of The Crimson, while making the website look modern, sleek, and useful. That strong tradition cuts both ways, however.
Some changes were made under a high-minded ideal of deliberately affecting the content that the newspaper would produce. “We wanted a paper that was going to, in our minds endure a little, against the unarguable tide toward short attention span online news, as opposed to more thought out, longer-form journalism,” Freyer says. “There’s this irony with a student organization that even though no one is there for more than four years and everyone is constantly relearning how to do things, there’s an amazing amount of inertia. So people were nevertheless resistant to change. In the end, we’re quite happy with the way the paper looks, but our broader visions of how the content might change didn’t quite come through.” From print journalism to a hybrid that incorporates online content, The Crimson has been indelibly transformed in the past two decades. It remains to be seen just how far that tide will take it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 12, 2015, at 12:05 p.m.
In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Harvard Dance Center, the Harvard Dance Program debuted “GYM DANCES,” a performance of pieces made “in and for gymnasiums” that ran from Nov. 11 to 15. An effort to capitalize on the natural spirit of improvisation that pervades these spaces, GYM DANCES is a product of both student and professional creativity. The show included a reinterpretation of Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s “Rosas danst Rosas” as well as an open rehearsal led by Jill Johnson, the director of the Harvard Dance Program. “GYM DANCES” also featured a piece titled "gym event for Harvard," choreographed by dancers in the Harvard Dance Project and directed by renowned dancer Silas Riener, as well as a closing number by Harvard Bhangra Dance Company. From the seemingly disparate styles of dance emerged a common theme of innovation and exploration, one that artfully manifested in both the individuals who performed and and those who choreographed the show.
Phoebe M. Lakin ’18, member of Harvard Bhangra Dance Crew
Dressed in a luxuriously soft cardigan with oversized sleeves for her interview, Lakin possesses a style that is the epitome of cozy chic. It is hard to believe that this is the same girl who danced in a parrot green and royal blue Bhangra costume and shouted in Punjabi to excite the audience—and even harder to conceive that Lakin had no background in dance before joining Bhangra. “I saw them performing at Visitas, and they looked like they were having so much fun,” she says.
Lakin’s unique vivacity and willingness to experiment give her a unique perspective on dance, even when things don’t go as planned. “After joining Bhangra, I learned that I have a pretty bad spatial sense,” Lakin says, laughing. “I’m also pretty clumsy. But after a while, it stopped mattering to me whether or not I was the best dancer on the team.”
For Lakin, there are certain serendipitous moments that make Bhangra worthwhile. “Sometimes during a performance, there is a kind of flow when we can tell that we are all doing the same movements at the same time,” she says. “That’s when the dance becomes something that we are creating together.”
Julia F. DeAngelo ’17, dancer in “GYM DANCES”
A history and literature concentrator in Leverett House, DeAngelo began dancing in the eighth grade, beginning with ballet and then joining a modern dance company at her high school. After coming to Harvard, DeAngelo knew she wanted to keep dancing, but didn’t know exactly how. Then she took two classes taught by Jill Johnson: “The Harvard Dance Project” and “Fundamentals of Improvisation and Composition: Dance.” “I just wanted to keep working with her,” DeAngelo says.
According to DeAngelo, “GYM DANCES” is all about blurring the boundary between process and performance. “Most people expect that everything will be completely polished, completely ready, and when we give them something they are not expecting, we are hoping to educate people on the many things that dance can be,” she says. This philosophy is especially salient in the “chance procedures” that "gym event for Harvard" employed. “[Silas Reiner] would give us a pair of die,” DeAngelo says. “The die would decide where in the body the next movement should come from.”
To the question of whether chance procedure counts as real creative process, DeAngelo responds, “Just like anything, the more limited your options are, the more creative you have to be. The more you give yourself limits, the more likely you are to get a product you otherwise would not have come to.”
Gabe S. Martinez ’18, dancer in “GYM DANCES"
Martinez views the spirit of dance at Harvard as an endeavour full of possibility. “Dance has always [been] my release from work,” he says. Like DeAngelo, Martinez connects his passion for dance with a spirit for inquiry. “There are a lot of academic and thought-provoking reasons to dance, as opposed to dancing for performance,” Martinez says.
Martinez envisions the visceral approach used in “GYM DANCES” as a way of thinking about social issues. In order to approach this broad goal, Martinez says that the choreography began with a very specific technique. “Certain ideas, certain events, these were the basis of the open rehearsal. Jill Johnson asked us, ‘What moves you?’” he says. “For me, it’s a feeling in my stomach…discrimination is very gut-wrenching, [it’s] so bringing the dance movement from my center and then relating to others through that movement. But each person expresses the movement in their own way because they feel it in their own way.”
Jill Johnson, Dance Director
As head of the dance program at Harvard, Johnson melds together the languages of art and science. She uses phrases like “dance research” and “three-dimensional mathematics” when discussing dance. This interdisciplinary spirit is especially relevant for the experimental nature of “GYM DANCES.” “If you take out the end product of research out of the equation, and you focus on the fact that people are engaged in dynamic inquiry...we’re engaged in precisely the same thing,” Johnson says.
For Johnson, “Rosas danst Rosas”—a production she says was filmed in an abandoned gymnasium in Europe and describes as groundbreaking in its camera work—was a large part of exploring the long tradition of gymnasiums in dance. The work is a part of choreographer Anne Teresa DeKeersmaeker's online video project. Students used phrases from the second movement to create their own version of the piece. “Our goal is to expose students to as many different perspectives of making dance as possible,” she says. “Performing our version of ‘Rosas danst Rosas’ is a way for students to have a lot of agency in the now…it has a lot of classicism, but also a lot of possibility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’re all kind of performing in an art museum,” says Liz Munsell, assistant curator of contemporary art and special initiatives at the Museum of Fine Arts. “There’s all kinds of protocols and rituals wrapped up in the experience of being a body and space in the museum. So live art...really isn’t that foreign to a museum environment.”
Late on Nov. 13, the activity in the MFA attested to Munsell’s statement. Staff waited at the museum’s front desk, ready to greet any straggling visitors trickling in or out. Security stood guard in the galleries. And performance artist Marilyn Arsem was at work in her own place—an exhibit called “100 Ways to Consider Time.” As visitors walked in and out of Gallery 261, Arsem, wrapped in a black shawl, sat in a wooden chair facing a rock illuminated by a black lamp. When the clock hit 9:30, Arsem lifted her head from the deep trance she seemed to be in and rewrapped her shawl. She stood up, turned off the lamp, and headed to the corner of her exhibit’s room where a calendar hung. Arsem ripped off the day’s date, folded it, and walked away.
For 100 days, Arsem will be doing something similar to—but not quite the same as—Friday night’s performance for six hours a day. “There’s infinite possible positions that she may take,” Munsell says of the exhibit. “Generally every day is focused on a different action, which for Marilyn is a different way to consider time.”
Frequently, Arsem is still. She may lie on the ground, framed by lines of blue tape, with different stones resting in a line on her body. She may sit at a table, staring at melting ice. Or she may move slowly and purposefully through the space, inviting the audience to join her as well. “She’s asking us to sit with her,” Munsell says. When Arsem is in the exhibit, people can walk in and out, or they can sit with her for half an hour or more, something some visitors have done before. “People are really looking for an excuse to slow down.”
This break from a frantically moving culture is represented not just in Arsem’s beckoning presence but also in the neutral colors and natural objects that she chooses to incorporate in her work, as her environmentally conscious, minimalist aesthetic makes use of materials like cotton, stone, or water. “Our visually-oriented culture teaches us to believe that the more we see, the more we’re experiencing,” Munsell says. “And I would really say that it’s the opposite. When you’re overwhelmed by imagery you become desensitized.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m not going to pretend I was really invested in everything going on in the world over the last two weeks. Mostly, I was trying to ignore it. I was cracking jokes about how it was so difficult to tell who was who on group chats now that everyone had turned into the French flag. I was rolling my eyes at any mention of our “racist media culture” and the fact that people actually thought we could cover every tragedy going on in the world in a five-minute news clip. I thought the people railing against the media were hypocrites at worst and easily offended at best. I was scrolling through last week’s columns, pointing at every one not about Paris or Beirut or Yale to convince myself I didn’t have to write about bombings or racism this week. I had a plan of attack for every possible conversation, how to deflect every mention of protest and death, and even if I thought I was saving myself from thinking too hard, I realize now that I was walking around with my fists clenched and my jaw so tense I would have imploded if I didn’t explode first.
On Monday, a friend from high school called me up to ask if I was still alive after the bomb threat, to which I replied, I was. Then she said the world was going to shit, and I agreed. Anything else, even a good-bye, after that statement would have felt disrespectful, so we stayed silent for a minute and hung up.
On Tuesday, I saw Joann Sfar’s comic about praying for Paris for the first time and spent most of the day wondering if it was enough to be about life. I thought it was too forgiving. I thought it was too simple. I thought it didn’t have a point. I had lunch with a friend to talk about a short story I’d written for class, and she told me to cut my darlings, so I spent that afternoon eliminating every pretty phrase in the manuscript that was there just to be pretty, and I was surprised by how much it hurt. What was the point of hearing a police siren like a song if it didn’t reflect trauma/enhance the plotline/provide characterization/make the reader want to keep reading/match the aesthetic? Why isn’t it enough to just be?
On Wednesday, someone tweeted that they were going to shoot every black woman and man at Kean University, a college ten minutes away from the town I grew up in. I once went to chamber music summer camp at Kean and overheard an older boy describe the viola as an emotional instrument. I was trying to picture the perfect caricature white supremacist on that campus, but all I could remember was that summer, my foot slipping bare on the sidewalk, Schubert surrounding my mental, and the stupid poetry in my head convincing me that every tree I passed by had the possibility of being sassafras.
On Thursday, black tape clung to portraits of tenured black faculty at Harvard Law School, and for the first time in weeks, maybe months, I let the ground below me quiver.
I made a list of topics I could write about this week that did not involve terrorism, race, militarism, loss, or anything else remotely related to last week’s events. I let it all flutter to the floor.
I tried to write this week’s column with an opinion embedded in it. But each point I tried on sounded too final, too insignificant. It left me wondering why opinions could be so easy to have and yet mean so little.
I was wondering how my little opinion in my little column could even attempt to address loss, either the global type that leaves you numb or the personal kind that makes you weak. Because when you write an article, when you write anything, you need a beginning, middle, and end. You need a point. You need to find a way to interlock your fingers in your readers’ fingers. You need to let them feel until the very last period.
But there is no story to loss. There is no plotline, no climax, no structure. It never ends. Its baggage is relentless. A bystander, by definition, never understands, and even so, only baby portions of what is really felt get transmitted to the reader. Maybe expressing your feelings is the single most inefficient thing you can possibly do with your life.
Maybe language will never be sufficient. Maybe there’s only a finite amount of poetry in the world. Maybe what I’m really doing, by writing this column, by being so easy to stun into silence, by taking so long to take in the world, is copping out.
But, today, maybe I am writing for people who stutter. Maybe I am writing for the French boy who told his father that the bad people have guns, and maybe I am writing for the father who responded “but we have flowers.” Maybe this is for Sudanese migrants, maybe for funerals in Baghdad. Or maybe this is for a girl watching the Yard through the glass of her window, dreaming of home. Maybe this is for not wanting to write because the things you should write about are spelled out, splayed lazily, spilled like a smile in front of you, and maybe they are still too big to swallow. Maybe if you strip down these sentences and eliminate every pit-stain of style, every rhythmic lilt, every pretty word, you’ll see nothing but space. I wish there was time to let tragedy settle into bones. I wish there was enough time to watch anger melt. I wish I had an opinion sharp enough to break skin. But maybe it’s okay to be reduced to silence, to be ineloquent. Maybe this hesitation is what it means to feel.

When I heard about the vandalism incident at Harvard Law School on Thursday morning, in which someone placed black tape over the faces of portraits of all of the black professors in Wasserstein Hall, I felt a visceral kick in my stomach.
It felt visceral because I had, in some way, expected this. It felt visceral because it followed the wave of voices from Missouri, Yale, Duke, Ithaca, and college campuses nationwide.
And it felt visceral because though the black tape stated no words, it screamed something loud and clear: Achievement is not and will never be immunization from racism.
I’ve been told my entire my life that the best response to racism was to work harder. Hate against you, we’re told from early on, should only motivate you to achieve higher.
So when your sixth grade classmates scream “go back to your own country, fucking chink,” you should study harder. And when you get thrown against a wall and searched by police on your way home from your Advanced Placement exams, you should study even harder. And when you get followed because the way you look makes you a supposed national security threat, you should, of course, study harder.
Why?
So you can get into a respectable university.
Why?
So you can get a respectable job. And become accomplished in your respectable profession. And associate with respectable people and gain membership to respectable organizations. And maybe, just maybe even have your portrait hung on the wall of some respectable institution where once people who looked like you couldn’t even dream of entering.
So you go through countless nights of working yourself to the bone and quietly endure all the humiliations along the way, only to find—when you have reached the apex of respectability—black tape over your face, screaming you still do not belong.
So, what now?
***
I admire the black HLS professors and the many others who overcame obstacles I can only imagine to be where they are, and do the inspiring work that they do. I’m not chalking up their paths to securing respectability, but this mindset is not without its followers.
And I don’t fault my mother and all the mothers for telling their children to work harder when they come home dazed and confused from their first experiences with racism. I can only imagine the hope they have for their children to not suffer the humiliation they had faced once they climb up the respectability ladder.
I can only imagine the deep fear these mothers and fathers have when they tell their sons and daughters to never wear hoodies, to dress up, to whistle classic tunes, to lose their accent, to shave before going to the airport, to avoid their own cultural organizations, to not look or sound or be too much like themselves.
It’s all a survival strategy, I know. Every reminder, every “just ignore it” and “work harder” is but a strategy to survive, whether in sixth grade classrooms, on the streets of New York, or at Harvard.
But let us be reminded that human dignity cannot be earned by respectability politics. An Ivy League diploma or a six-figure paying job doesn’t come with equality on the side. It won’t protect us from all the screams and threats and silent humiliations.
And it shouldn’t.
We shouldn’t be considered more human because of what school we went to or where we work. And we shouldn’t be deemed any less deserving of life when we are in our hoodies, when we don’t shave, when we aren’t twisting and shrinking and shushing ourselves to be respectable.
While I am glad that people are outraged by the hate crime against HLS professors, I wonder if we are able to extend that rage, that kick in the gut feeling to individuals who don’t fit the dominant notions of respectability. I wonder if we will think twice before guessing there is a good reason the boy in the hoodie, that street vendor, the bearded man have bullets in their bodies. I wonder, when we let go of the degrees and wealth we’ve accumulated to shield ourselves from hate and discrimination, how much more of others’ pain we can feel, and feel as our own.
So, now what? Now and ever, the black tape will not vanish when we work harder and climb higher. It will not vanish when we ignore that visceral kick in our stomachs, when we keep our heads down and eyes on the next prize. But I think, when we rip off the invisible tape that silences our bodies and minds into being respectable, the black tape will begin to tear, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday morning, Harvard Law School students and faculty arrived on campus to find that a disturbing act had been committed the previous night: Among the hanging portraits of tenured faculty that run along the walls of Wasserstein Hall, black tape had been used to cover the faces of African-American faculty. This incident occurred in the wake of escalating racial tensions at the University of Missouri, Yale University, and other institutions of higher education across the country.
What occurred at the Law School that night is a hate crime—of this fact, there is no doubt, and we commend the Harvard University Police Department for investigating it as such. But looking beyond the surface of this single, visible incident, it is imperative that the Harvard community realize that these issues run deeper than this reprehensible act. The symbolic erasure of the Law School’s black faculty reflects the structural issues that still hinder Harvard from being a community where all of its members are wholly included.
The Law School—an institution that did not hire its first tenured black professor until 1969 and its first tenured woman of color until 1998—still has a faculty composition that is unrepresentative of the diversity of its student population. Of its 88 senior faculty members, only nine are black and less than 25 percent are women. This disparity is at odds with the University’s stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. Moreover, our university has a responsibility to be proactive, rather than reactive, with respect to making this campus a community where all students can feel safe and included. We fail in this mission when we wait until overt acts of hate occur to even consider seriously the broader structural issues that minority students have been reporting.
Moreover, we should recognize that Harvard’s history, with regards to exclusion and marginalization, is not much different from that of Yale or the University of Missouri. The disbelief shown by many that such an act could occur on our campus is regrettable and surprising, especially given the ongoing protests regarding the HLS seal. In the aftermath of this incident, it is clear that the problems and issues going on at peer institutions are not isolated; instead, they are relevant to us as well.
By Thursday afternoon, the black tape meant to erase the Law School’s black faculty presence in Wasserstein was replaced by post-it messages of love and solidarity from students. In the face of such a disgraceful act, we consider these students’ outpouring of support for their black faculty to be especially notable and praiseworthy.
We urge the broader Harvard community to follow their example by affirming now, as always, that black lives matter. We urge the Harvard community to proactively work to examine, address, and dismantle the structural factors that continue to exclude and marginalize minority students and faculty. The first step in solving any problem is to recognize that the problem exists: When minority students at Harvard report experiencing racism, marginalization, and isolation on a regular basis, our university community’s first reaction cannot be to cast doubt on those experiences. To disregard racism and marginalization as valid, lived experiences on this campus is to put black tape over Harvard’s history and the structural issues that that history produced. If Harvard is to succeed in becoming an inclusive campus, inclusivity must truly become an indispensable and persistent fiber within the fabric of our institution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 24, 2015, at 4:39 a.m.
The graduate board of the Fox Club, one of Harvard’s historically male final clubs, shut down the organization’s house earlier this month just weeks after undergraduate leaders decided to add women to their membership for the first time and a day after a party there prompted controversy among alumni. 
“In light of recent events involving conduct unbecoming [of] members of the Fox, the Board of Directors has closed the Club immediately until such time as it sees fit to reopen it, but not before January 1, 2016,” an email, signed by the Fox’s board of directors, told club affiliates on Nov. 14.
The email, one of several pieces of internal club correspondence recently obtained by The Crimson, did not specify exactly what had prompted graduate members to close the club. But it came a day after undergraduates threw a party that proved controversial when photographs of the event circulated among alumni, according to one club graduate member, and two weeks after nine women were scheduled to be inducted into the off-campus social organization.
Together, the correspondence indicates that the Fox’s historic move to accept women has met several roadblocks, including pushback from club alumni, some of whom have raised concerns about the membership change, even before the party controversy on Nov. 13.
Shortly after undergraduate club leaders told alumni that they had moved to go co-ed, graduate board members called for a special meeting to discuss the change and stipulated that the fall’s class of new members—including nine women—would remain provisional until they are approved. Now, their clubhouse closed, the Fox’s transition remains in flux.
‘POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER THE CLUB REOPENS’
The Fox Club’s abrupt closure came at the tail end of the fall semester’s process for selecting and inducting new undergraduate members. The club was scheduled to host alumni at its building at 44 JFK St. for a black-tie initiation dinner at 6 p.m., according to an invitation.
When Hugh M. Nesbit ’77, the head of the Fox’s graduate board of directors, emailed other club affiliates about the club’s closure on the afternoon of Nov. 14, however, he stipulated that the “Initiation” event, originally scheduled for that evening, would be “postponed until after the Club reopens.”
Shortly before the Fox’s building was closed, according to an active graduate member of the club, some club alumni had reacted negatively to a party that Fox undergraduates had held that Friday. Photographs of the students were circulated among graduate members.
The day following the club’s closure, on Nov. 15, Nesbit wrote in an email addressed to a “Fellow Fox” that the previous day’s “decision by the Board of Directors was made with due deliberation and unanimity.”
“All of us need a little time and space to reflect on what it means to be a member of the Fox,” Nesbit, who did not respond to a request for comment, wrote in the message. “Reasonable people of differing views can reason together toward a common goal, the welfare of our Club. Without that, what do we have?”
‘DIFFICULT DECISIONS FACING THE FOX CLUB’ 
Weeks before the graduate board formally closed the clubhouse, though, there were signs of discord between undergraduate and graduate members of the Fox unrelated to the November party.
The undergraduate Fox Club leadership moved to accept women to the more-than 100-year-old social organization in October, even though undergraduate club members who had advocated going co-ed in 2014 had already faced pushback from graduate members.
When club officers described their decision in an Oct. 19 letter to graduate members, they pitched it as a decision of their own, but one expedited by pressure from Harvard administrators, who have become increasingly critical of single-sex social organizations, and particularly male final clubs, which are not recognized by the College. Under this scrutiny, the male Spee Club invited women to participate in the final club selection process, known as punch, for the first time this fall.
The Fox undergraduates’ Oct. 19 letter indicated that they had gone ahead and asked a group of women to join the club before receiving formal graduate board approval.
Fewer than two weeks after the undergraduate letter was dated, on Oct. 30, the Fox’s graduate board of directors wrote an email of their own, maintaining that new members’ full acceptance to the club was pending, a policy evidently applied to both the club’s new male initiates as well as the nine women. That message indicates that there had been pushback from graduate members in response to the membership changes.
“In view of concerns expressed by the Grad Board and other Club members, the Undergraduate Board has agreed that all new members will be initiated as Provisional Members for the remainder of this academic year, with such memberships to be converted to permanent memberships only after confirmation by the Grad Board and Graduate Association that appropriate house rules, policies, and procedures are in place to their satisfaction,” the board of directors wrote on Oct. 30.
Graduate members of the Fox also scheduled to meet this past Sunday at the Sheraton Commander Hotel in Cambridge. That meeting, detailed in a Nov. 4 email sent on behalf of graduate club members to “Friends of the Fox,” was convened to discuss membership policies and the “difficult decisions facing the Fox Club.”
“The overall objective of this initiative is to actively engage a large and broad cross-section of club membership in refining/affirming the key values and principles of the Fox Club and ascertaining, in a more structured, comprehensive way, the views of the membership on a number of key policy areas including, but not limited to, club membership (male only vs. co-ed) and the broader role of the Club in the lives of our undergraduate and graduate members,” the message said.
The Fox’s graduate board leadership has also reshuffled in the weeks since the club moved to go co-ed. Earlier this fall, Nesbit replaced Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, the former Fox Club graduate board president, according to a Nov. 1 email to club affiliates signed by the Fox board of directors. Sears “expressed his desire to cut back on his duties” and will continue to serve on the club’s board of directors, the email said.
Sears, previously a vocal critic of the Fox going co-ed, declined to comment. The Fox’s undergraduate president, Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16, and vice president, Patrick E. Dowling ’16, also declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert K. Shapiro has lived at Harvard for nearly his entire life. His mother is Catherine Shapiro, the freshman resident dean for Crimson Yard, and he has spent the better part of his 15 years living within close proximity to undergraduates.
At 15, Shapiro is younger than most College students, but he is among the oldest of administrators’ children who live on campus. He spent his childhood in Leverett House when his mother was a resident dean there, and he now lives in Greenough with her. Because he lives surrounded by students, he regularly interacts with them and sometimes even gets mistaken for an undergraduate.
Though his age makes Shapiro’s experience unique, there are dozens of other proctor, tutor, and administrator families who live on campus, many with young children. Their living situation is anything but conventional, as the families live in College dorm rooms and eat with students in undergraduate dining halls. 
This nontraditional upbringing comes with its challenges and upsides: The College lifestyle is not designed for young children, but at Harvard, proctor and tutor children are exposed to a wide diversity of people and experiences, and in turn, influence the daily lives of residential undergraduates.
DORM LIVING
Toddlers are not typical college dorm residents, but often at Harvard tutors and proctors raise their young children alongside undergraduates in similar living spaces.
Like many undergraduates, some proctor and tutor families live in small, one-bedroom suites that lack the ideal amount of space for raising children. When proctor Jason S. Saretsky and his wife lived in Straus Hall, they resided in a one-bedroom suite, which limited their space when their daughter went to bed at night, because she slept in their common room. They upgraded to a two-bedroom suite when they moved to Grays, though, where they currently live with their two children.
According to Jasmine M. Waddell, the freshman resident dean for Elm Yard who has two children of her own, freshman proctor suites are assigned based on seniority. Often times, proctors with children have been at Harvard long enough to attain nicer and larger suites because of that system.
Regardless of seniority, though, Harvard must provide proctors and tutors with suites that do not contain lead paint, according to Adam Muri-Rosenthal, the dean of Adams House. In Adams, all suites without lead paint have kitchens, and Muri-Rosenthal said administrators in Houses try to give tutors with children suites with kitchens whenever possible.
Waddell said Yard Operations, a group responsible for the maintenance of freshman dorms, is working to improve proctor living conditions, which proctors and tutors with families say are generally satisfying.
In dorms, proctors and tutors share close quarters with undergraduates, and sometimes other families. They eat in the same dining halls as College students and often bring their children to dorm or House events.
Saretsky said proctor families often interact with one another as well, generally through shared meals in dining halls.
“It’s a really close-knit community; that’s one of the real advantages of being here,” Saretsky said. “[My wife and I] have often talked about how if we weren’t on campus how tough it would be to not have that community.”
NOT THE SUBURBS
While proctors and tutors with children may find their living experience slightly unusual, for many of their children, living on a college campus is all they have ever known. Because they live with undergraduates, the children meet diverse groups of people from around the world.
“There’s...a huge benefit in terms of exposure to culture,” said Alexander P. Douglas, a proctor in Lionel who lives with his young daughter and his wife, Celeste M. Douglas, another proctor. “Just living in the dorms, you come across people from all different races and backgrounds and countries that you would never come across otherwise.”
Celeste Douglas added that her daughter has many opportunities for speech development because of how often she interacts with undergraduates. Their daughter, Celeste Douglas says, also enjoys campus petting zoos, football games, and, of course, the wide expanse of the Yard.
“She’s basically got the biggest front yard of anyone in Cambridge,” Alexander Douglas said.
Waddell said undergraduates often read or sing to her two children and play soccer with her 6-year-old son. In general, she said, her children are exposed to a broader array of people than they would meet “if they lived in the suburbs.”
Shapiro, the 15-year-old, also said living on Harvard’s campus for his entire life has exposed him to interesting people and opportunities he would not have had otherwise. He often goes to Harvard events—mostly for the free food—and, because he has swipe access to many Harvard buildings, he can spend time nearly anywhere on campus. Shapiro has also worked at events run by Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and knows the locations of most campus vending machines.
And when he was younger, Shapiro said, he was the ball boy for the varsity men’s basketball team.
“The basketball team, they were kind of my heroes and stuff, so I definitely looked up to those guys,” Shapiro said.
Now that he is older, Shapiro said he interacts with students less frequently. He’s even occasionally mistaken for a student himself.
Waddell, the dean for Elm Yard, said seeing Shapiro live on campus as a teenager has made her comfortable with the idea of her own children living at Harvard when they are older. But not all tutors and proctors feel the same way.
The Douglases plan to move off campus when their daughter, who is now a toddler, “starts to understand college culture,” Celeste Douglas said.
“At some point we don’t want our 10-year-old to be living like a college freshman,” she said. “She just doesn’t need to be exposed to certain things.”
Shapiro, though, said his social life is not quite the same as freshmen in the dorm where he lives.
“People are always curious. They always wonder if I get invited to the parties,” Shapiro said. “No one invites me to the parties, because I don’t go looking for parties, and if they’re in the dorms they’re not going to invite me because they know who my mom is.”
FEELING AT HOME
Having a family that lives in the entryway can also create a warmer atmosphere for undergraduates, some students day.
The setup “makes it seem more domestic,” said Delaney Tevis ’19, whose proctor has a child. “You’re more at home because there’s not just other college students” in the building, Delaney added.
Patrick T. Hansen ’18, who lived in the Douglases’ entryway last year, said he initially thought it was “a little weird” to have a child in his dorm. As the year progressed, however, Hansen said he grew to appreciate her presence.
“It made the whole entryway feel a bit more like a family,” he said.
The family atmosphere also “made the idea of a proctor less imposing,” Hansen said. “They were more of just like parental figures or also mentors.”
Looking to be respectful of the young children in her entryway, Tevis said she and her roommates are careful to be quiet when they stay up late. Generally, Tevis said, students in her entryway try to minimize their noise levels, which might disturb their proctors’ children.
Muri-Rosenthal, the Adams dean, initially worried that potential noise from loud college students might pose a problem for his son. Now, though, he said the noise has helped his 10-month-old son adjust to sleeping in louder environments, which he sees as a positive.
Plus, because he lives among undergraduates, there are plenty of students interested in babysitting his son.
Besides wanting to babysit the children in their entryways, undergraduates also often enjoy chatting with the families over dinner or in the Yard, proctors say. Saretsky said he and his wife host weekly dinners in Annenberg, when they encourage his students to eat with his family.
By interacting regularly with undergraduates, the Douglases’ daughter has become an integral part of her entryway. According to her mother, she draws birthday cards for every student in her parents’ entryway, and for the past two years, they have invited students to a cupcake-decorating study break to celebrate her birthday.
The presence of families in undergraduate entryways can be mutually beneficial for both the students and the children, as children grow up in a diverse environment and students experience a more homey atmosphere in their dorms.
Shapiro said he “feel[s] very lucky” to live on Harvard’s campus because he has met interesting people and taken advantage of the College’s resources.
But given that he has lived here for most of his life, Shapiro said he does not plan to attend Harvard once he graduates from high school.
“I think when I go to college I want to try something where I can really be independent and really get a new experience,” Shapiro says. “And while I really like Harvard, I don’t think I’d get that going here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders and academics may be able to predict the collapse of political states by analyzing population data, said Oxford professor Monica Duffy Toft in a lunch presentation at the Kennedy School of Government on Monday.
Toft’s lecture focused on the application of demography, the study of human population metrics, in the present global climate. She explained how ethnic group dynamics in themselves were responsible for political tensions and state development. Her research spans settlement patterns, ethnic and religious violence, and global demographic trends.
“I love data,” Toft said as she presented her empirical analysis of state-groups and their development of power.
Toft, who has researched population data from historic and current case studies of political destabilization, explained the connections between these data and causes of conflict. Examples of regions she analyzed were the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.
“In my research, I’m looking at a particular portion of people within a given society,” Toft said. “Where people live and the power of territory and the power of belonging are very important—humans have this very basic attachment to particular territories.”
In her presentation, Toft highlighted her emerging population transition theory, which posits that changes in state population configurations—especially among religious, ethnic, or racial identity groups—can portend civil conflict and destabilization.
“The predictive capacity that we’re trying to build is, ‘If we see these demographic conditions, we might expect a state collapse,’” she said.
In addition to predicting conflict, Toft said, demography can be useful in constructing sound social policies that can bolster countries’ internal stability.
“If it is the case that we can change populations, then there’s real policy traction with that—states can administer their policies better to make the situation better,” she said.
Stephen G. Ruth, a seminar attendee and National Security Fellow at the Kennedy School, said that Toft’s discussion of demography is especially apt, in light of contemporary ethnic conflicts and challenges.
“I thought the lecture helped one appreciate the nature of dissolving and evolving borders that have been predominantly based on minority—how they open one’s apertures to understanding the problems of the 21st century,” he said.

As racial tensions flare on college campuses across the country, Harvard Police continue to probe vandalism at Harvard Law School that was discovered last week, investigating the incident as a hate crime.
Law School students and professors arrived in Wasserstein Hall last Thursday to find pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black professors at the school. Police launched an investigation, and Law School students, faculty, and administrators were quick to denounce the act as hateful.
Steven G. Catalano, a Harvard University Police Department spokesperson, wrote in an email that the investigation is “active and ongoing.”
Several students have said that the incident is indicative of what they describe as a sometimes hostile and racist environment at Harvard Law School. In a community meeting on Thursday about the vandalism, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow called racism a “serious problem” at the school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Benjamin C. Barnett ’17, the first and only student from his public high school in rural Kentucky to apply to Harvard, studying the humanities in college never crossed his mind. Even before he arrived on campus in 2013, Barnett knew he would pursue a pre-medical track and a corresponding degree in the sciences.
He attributes this in part to the courses his high school offered. Aside from AP English and AP Spanish, the only Advanced Placement classes he had the option to take were in mathematics and science. Somewhat naturally, according to Barnett, the latter subject area ended up piquing his interest.
“I’m sure there are definitely things in my high school that caused me to like chemistry more than other stuff,” Barnett said. “Had there been AP Latin or AP Psychology or something, I probably would have taken those classes and would have found out whether I was interested or not.”
“I didn’t even get a chance to know if I liked psychology or Latin,” he added.
When he ended up in the Chemistry department, Barnett was not alone in choosing an area of study he had explored before coming to college and that he thought would best prepare him for his career. While Harvard offers 49 concentrations—ranging from the History of Art and Architecture to Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology to the new Theater, Dance, and Media program—students often outline their academic paths before they set foot on campus.
Year after year, a plurality of students choose to study economics, and an increasing number computer science, many with expectations that those plans will catapult them into top-tier business schools or lucrative consulting jobs, a fact that some people in and outside the academy decry. Experts suggest that students from underprivileged backgrounds in particular might feel pressured to pursue courses of study with clear professional paths.
But students’ concentration choices are influenced by factors other than concerns about their careers. Some students feel underprepared to study certain fields—especially those in the humanities—because they were not exposed to them in high school or lacked the resources to explore them on their own.
A recent report by a College working group on diversity even suggested that some fields, unintentionally or otherwise, repel “women and underrepresented minorities.” The report calls on departments to create clearer and more accessible paths for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“There are pressures on individuals to avoid certain concentrations that they might want to do,” said Howard E. Gardner ’65, a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. “There are powerful messages in society.”
A DOCUMENTED TREND
English department chair W. James Simpson says a rags-to-riches story has colored the Western view of higher education for hundreds of years.
According to this narrative, great-grandparents will come from nowhere and start a business with little interest in education. Their children, the story goes, will go to school but receive wholly practical training to build up the family business. The next generations might also take over the business, but with an eye toward providing their children with the best education money can buy.
“And what does that child do?” asks Simpson, the first in his family to attend college. “That child tends to repudiate the commercial and the industrial—the wholly pragmatic culture of both their parents and their ancestors. That child chooses to study the liberal arts.”
“Now I’m actually describing my own quadri-generational story,” Simpson added.
Research on students and their educational choices tends to support the trend Simpson describes—that students from underprivileged backgrounds gravitate toward seemingly vocational undergraduate degrees in fields like economics, biology, and computer science, while their well-off counterparts might study art history, literature, or Latin.
Earlier this year, writer Joe Pinsker argued in The Atlantic that “Rich Kids Study English,” citing data from the National Center for Education Statistics that found that a student’s family household income correlates with choice of study. According to the data, the mean household income of students who study English is near the $100,000 mark, while the mean income of parents of students who pursue medicine and nursing is about $78,000. Students who obtain pre-professional degrees in areas such as law enforcement and firefighting come from households with a mean income of just under $67,000.
“If you just look at the raw data, you do see that the young adults who come from well-off backgrounds tend to major in the humanities,” said Kim Weeden, a sociology professor at Cornell who interpreted the National Center for Education Statistics data in the Atlantic piece.
Weeden attributes this trend to four factors: a student’s family income; the selectivity of the college the student attends and the opportunities it accordingly provides; the student’s post-undergraduate expectations of attending a professional school, such as law school or medical school; and the student’s attempt to counter anxieties about what happens if those plans go awry.
The societal rhetoric and assumptions about post-college life exist on both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, according to Gardner. While students from underprivileged backgrounds envision their undergraduate degrees as launching points into the world of Wall Street or Silicon Valley, their wealthier peers may choose concentrations to please their multi-millionaire parents or not to have to apologize to anyone for a choosing a vocational path in the liberal arts.
“It’s not like anyone is off the hook from pressure,” Gardner said. “Kids who go to Harvard panic if they don’t do the ‘right’ major.”
MANY OPTIONS, WITH LIMITS
Beyond thoughts on their future careers, students at Harvard share anecdotes suggesting that their backgrounds and prior academic experiences inform what they study at the College. From the get go, they say they have limited options that are both accessible and appeal to them.
In particular, while some private and elite or specialized public high schools that send many students to Harvard offer their students a wide range of languages and teach disciplines such as art history, students who hail from average or under-resourced schools may come to Harvard with little to no knowledge in those subject areas.
An international student from India, Varsha Varman ’18 had three options for her course of study in high school: science, math, and commerce, each with corresponding paths in medicine, engineering, or law or business school.
One of the more than 200 sophomores who declared a concentration in Economics last Thursday, Varman said she knew she would choose this field even before she left India and high school for Harvard. Studying English or Folklore and Mythology was never on the table.
“I partly feel that it’s because, I’m from India...where either math or science is considered acceptable and if you’re not doing either of those, economics is the only thing...which...would still be kind of acceptable,” Varman said. “Back home, you decided your life path at the age of 16.”
“Though things like art history sound interesting to me, I feel like because of my background...I don’t really feel an interest to exploring it,” she added. “I feel like that stems from the fact that it was something that is just not a part of my education.”
Maeve E. McMahon ’17 also had a sense of her collegiate path, and it contrasts starkly with one Varman envisioned. She attended the Groton School, a New England boarding school that she described as “very focused in the Classics” and where McMahon started studying Latin as an eighth grader. Her school also exposed her to ancient Greek.
Now a Classics concentrator at Harvard, McMahon feels grateful for the small size of her department and the intimate relationships she has fostered with professors, advantages that her peers in other, larger concentrations may not experience during their time here. Had she not been exposed to the Classics in high school, McMahon, who plays on the women’s varsity lacrosse team, said she most likely would have gravitated toward the concentrations her teammates chose because of the comfort level those peers would have provided. Their concentrations include Government, Psychology, and Economics.
“I think there’s a risk of not making it clear that you can come to Harvard not having heard of Classics before—not having looked at a Greek or Latin book—and start those classes here,” said Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, a joint Philosophy and Classics concentrator and a self-described humanist. “I think within Harvard there are certain reputations that get attached fairly or unfairly to particular concentrations.”
Blecher-Cohen attended a math and sciences high school and did not continue on the business and economics track when he arrived at the College. Blecher-Cohen—who studied Latin in middle school—said he thinks his concentrations may alienate interested students because of the assumptions that they need previous experience in those areas or that those fields will not lead directly to careers.
The Classics department offers entry-level courses, and Kathleen M. Coleman, a Classics professor and the department’s director of undergraduate studies, said the concentration draws some students who had “no opportunity whatsoever to do anything remotely approaching the study of antiquity” before Harvard. Still, they do not constitute as large a proportion of the department as Coleman said she would like.
Simpson, for his part, has noticed that as students have to confront previously untrodden academic ground, including close reading and writing increasingly lengthy papers, they shy away from those areas of study.
In some of his General Education courses, for example, Simpson has taught students who have decided to concentrate in the social sciences and hard sciences despite a desire to study the humanities. “Students...really love literature but...are a bit tentative about doing it, because they feel they haven’t had a sufficiently strong background,” he said.

Students without sufficient high school preparation, but with familial financial security, ultimately may make the leap of faith, according to Pinsker, who wrote the Atlantic piece earlier this year. Their peers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, by in large, do not.
“Yes, it is troubling—and at this point sort of undeniable—that children with privileged upbringings are presented with a wider palette of options and, on top of that, encouraged to follow wherever their passions take them, probably to a larger extent than is the case with children who didn't,” Pinsker wrote in an email.
According to Weeden, research indicates that this is a trend. “Students from low [socioeconomic status] backgrounds could feel like they’re behind, in terms of being able to engage, especially in the humanities and a style of arguing that may be unfamiliar to them because of their prior experiences,” Weeden said.
CONCENTRATING ON THE FUTURE
Douglas T. Maggs ’17 never took a Latin class before coming to Harvard. Although his school offered the language, he chose to study French. As a sophomore with an opportunity to make another academic choice, he decided on Classics, even though his peers in the program had more experience in the field than he did.
A course on the Roman empire, taught by Classics and History professor Emma Dench, informed his course of study. Since then, Maggs said, he has not felt disadvantaged by the course material; he called his requisite beginning language classes well-structured, informative, and engaging.
“If you come into college without a classical background, you shouldn’t be deterred,” Maggs said. “That just speaks to the strength of the department.”
Maggs is, however, an exception, rather than the rule. “I’m definitely in the minority in this department,” Maggs said. “I know most all of the concentrators, and I can’t think of any of my friends who didn’t have exposure to Latin or Greek.”
Although departments like Classics open their doors to undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds, students like Maggs remain outliers.
Charged with looking into the broader issue of diversity at Harvard and the inclusion of students of various identities, a working group recently published a report whose findings confirm that all students do not take advantage of the College’s academic offerings. The group, chaired by Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton, says that system needs to change.
Without faculty mentors to whom they can relate or adequate high school preparation, students shy away from departments they otherwise would have been interested in exploring, according to the report. “[E]xplicit and implicit messages of ‘you won’t do well’ lead to a disproportionate number of students opting out of certain concentrations,” the report says.
The College’s concentrations, the report proposes, should create clearer entry points and paths for students regardless of their backgrounds. Specifically, the report urges departments to create mentoring programs, share minority students’ success stories on their websites, and give students resources to attend events sponsored by organizations, such as the National Society of Black Physicists or the Society of Women Engineers, to provide networking opportunities among minority students.
“Harvard is committed to granting admission to high-achieving students who take advantage of all possibilities available to them, as opposed to students who simply attend the most elite high schools. This is correct and appropriate,” the report says.“Students can succeed from different curricular entry points, so it is incumbent on each department, as well as the University, to provide students with alternative narratives of success and multiple pathways to fulfilling all departmental requirements.”
Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion who sat on the working group, said solutions like strong advising conversations may also remedy the situation.
“Good advising really should take into consideration what students backgrounds are and how we can create multiple pathways into concentrations for which students may not have been able to prepare for when they were in high school,” she said.
Dela Peña herself attended an under-resourced high school—one that offered neither pre-calculus nor calculus, let alone computer science—did not have access to a computer at home, and said she struggled in that college major, compared to peers from affluent backgrounds. She ultimately switched fields, receiving her undergraduate degree in ethnic studies instead of computer science.
“I absolutely believe that sometimes it’s challenging for folks who are underprepared to...endeavor in certain concentrations, but it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a path to do it, and we have to help students find that path,” dela Peña said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joining various schools and Harvard as a whole on an impressive fundraising pace, the Kennedy School of Government has raised at least $460 million as it works toward a $500 million capital campaign goal.
The $460 million figure represents the fundraising drive’s progress as of late September, according to Archon Fung, the Kennedy School’s acting dean. It also represents 92 percent of the school’s fundraising target.
The public phase of the school’s capital campaign kicked off with a two-day event in May 2014, by which time the school had already raised $336 million in the campaign’s quiet phase. The school had raised $383 million by last February.
Although Fung and former Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75—who stepped down last semester after a decade at the school’s helm—had previously predicted an “inevitable slowdown” in fundraising after Ellwood’s departure, Fung said the campaign has not lost its momentum. 
“We booked $460 million in this goal out of $500 [million], so we’re going to reach that, our goal, very soon, and that’s in large measure thanks to Doug,” Fung said, referencing former U.S. Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas W. Elmendorf, who will assume the deanship on Jan. 1. “Even though he’s not officially on the job, he’s been working hard on the development front and building the personal relationships among the people that have supported the school for a long time.”
In an interview last February, Ellwood had said he expected fundraising to slow in the next few years once the new dean comes on board, suggesting that since the “vast majority of [the Kennedy School’s] money comes from people who aren’t even Harvard graduates,” philanthropy is based on confidence, trust, and long-term relationships that could be disrupted by the transition.
Although Fung said the school “fully anticipate[s]” exceeding its capital campaign goal, he does not plan on raising the official target, following the lead of University President Drew G. Faust, who has said officials have no plans to raise the $6.5 billion goal of Harvard’s overall campaign. Still, Fung said Elmendorf will have to carefully consider priorities for the second phase of the campaign and align them with institutional aims.
“A couple of the issues we’ve been talking about internally are the need for even more on the fellowship front, especially endowing fellowships, so that there’s lasting sources of money for students so that they can pursue publicly-oriented careers, and also professorships,” Fung said. “One of the things it would be great to walk out of the campaign with is more professorships, more chairs, so that we can bring in additional people to the Kennedy School on the faculty side.”
The capital campaign supports a number of Kennedy School initiatives, most notably the ongoing $126 million campus remodeling and expansion effort, which Fung said will be funded entirely through philanthropy. The construction will add 77,000 square feet of new building space and is focused in part on facilitating an active and experiential learning experience. Other focus areas include fellowships, research funding, and investments in the school’s pedagogical operations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen is spearheading an effort to raise Cambridge’s minimum wage to $15 an hour, though it remains unclear whether such a policy shift would affect some of Harvard’s temporary and part-time employees.
The legislative process surrounding the effort, Mazen said, could take six to 18 months, and the Council has not yet drafted legislation. At a recent committee meeting, Council members agreed to form a task force, appointed by the City manager, to “actually come up with legislation suggestions,” he said. 
Mazen said he is unsure whether proposed legislation would affect Harvard. “All regular benefits-eligible hourly staff” at the University earn more than $15 per hour, according to spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, but some student and temporary workers do not earn more than that rate.
For students currently employed by Harvard through the Federal Work Study Program, wages range from $10 to $13.50 an hour for undergraduates and from $12.50 to $18.15 for graduates, according to the Student Employment Office website.
Some temporary workers, too, may earn under the $15 threshold. Bill Jaeger, the director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, suggested in an interview that “where there could be some significant impact on the University is in the…contingent worker category,” referencing workers who are employed temporarily or for a small number of hours a week.
According to deLuzuriaga, of the non-student workers on temporary assignments—roughly 1.5 percent of Harvard’s total employee count—the “vast majority” in that category earn more than $15 per hour.
Still, Jaeger said that group is one that members of HUCTW—Harvard’s largest union—have been “worried about for years.” He said they have “tried to ask Harvard to keep to a higher standard of being thoughtful and generous and careful about the terms under which those people are…employed.”
Mazen, for his part, argued that Harvard is “morally bound” to ensure that workers are paid $15 an hour, independent of any ordinance requiring it.
The Council previously convened on the minimum wage issue in June 2014, when the body requested that Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi consult with the Law Department to determine whether the Council has legal standing to establish a $15 minimum wage via ordinance.
In response, City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa suggested to Rossi that “such a measure does not appear to be a valid exercise of the City’s municipal power under the Massachusetts Constitution” in a letter dated Nov. 14 of last year and published online.
Mazen, who said he disagrees with Glowa, is still determined to push through a minimum wage increase. An alternative to issuing an ordinance, he said, would be requiring Cambridge businesses to pay a $15 minimum wage to obtain a business permit.
“I’m not super concerned with how we implement it,” Mazen said. “What I am concerned with is the absolute imperative to increase wages in the city.”
Rossi, for his part, said raising the minimum wage in Cambridge would be a positive step, but he emphasized the need for a “clear-cut community process” in shaping such a rule.
“All the businesses and nonprofits that would be affected by this law should have an opportunity to weigh in,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week after an unfounded bomb scare in and around Harvard Yard halted some University activities for five hours, police are still investigating the source of the threat.
The investigation into the origin of the emailed threat is still “active and ongoing,” according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. 
Last Monday, in a scene similar to an incident two years ago, four Harvard buildings were evacuated and searched after Harvard Police received a report of a bomb threat. The evacuation prompted police to restrict access to Harvard Yard, subsequently interrupting or canceling some classes. Law enforcement deemed all locations safe after local and federal agencies conducted an extensive search of the buildings.
Days after the threat, a Crimson reporter received a cryptic email entitled “Harvard Bombing Confession” from an unidentified sender who claimed to be involved in the bomb scare. The sender also threatened action if The Crimson did not publish the email.
Police later delivered a subpoena to The Crimson requiring it to turn over a “narrow” span of traffic logs to its website, though it remains unclear whether the subpoena relates to the bomb threat. Crimson President Steven S. Lee ’16 complied with the subpoena but declined to share its contents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An undergraduate recently received a Facebook message from an account bearing a name associated with racially charged death threats that more than 100 Harvard students received via email last year, prompting administrators to update student leaders on the ongoing police investigation.
In October 2014, hundreds of students—many of them women of Asian descent—received death threats from multiple email accounts, spurring a police investigation that later moved overseas. One of the accounts associated with the violent threats, used by a person who self-identified as “Huy Dinh,” had been sending Harvard students messages for months before the high-profile October incident. 
More than a year later, one of the students who had been the target of the October 2014 threat, Adela H. Kim ’16, said she received a Facebook message from a person who also self-identified as “Huy Dinh.” Noting a possible connection to the 2014 threats, Kim reported the message to the Harvard University Police Department earlier this month.
The Facebook message Kim received earlier this month was written in German, a fact that draws further similarities to the 2014 threats. The person or people who sent those violent emails to Harvard students last year claimed to live in Germany, and HUPD eventually handed off the investigation to German authorities after determining that the messages posed no threat to campus.
That investigation is still “active and ongoing,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email last week.
After notifying the police, Kim said some College administrators emailed her and acknowledged her concerns. She also met with Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Many undergraduates, calling on Harvard to support affected Asian women on campus, criticized College administrators last year for what they said was a delayed response to the threat. When the investigation remained ongoing this past spring, some students said they were still awaiting closure after the incident.
Kim renewed these criticisms after she received the recent Facebook message.
“I thought the response was slow, and they didn’t address the big elephant in the room until much later, which was that this was primarily targeted towards Asian female students,” said Kim, who is a former Crimson Arts executive.
Dela Peña updated undergraduate leaders of Asian-American student organizations on the status of the police investigation earlier this month.
“I'm sure this news that he may have resurfaced will be troubling to many of you. I want you to know that we are communicating with HUPD to ensure your safety,” dela Peña wrote, according to a copy of the message she shared with The Crimson.
“Although we have conferred with the HUPD and have no reason to believe there is risk of physical harm, we certainly understand why any communication from this individual would feel threatening,” she wrote.
Although dela Peña wrote that administrators were limited in their ability to prevent the flow of threatening online messages, she encouraged other students to notify the College of any messages they receive from a sender with the last name “Dinh.”
Administrators rolled out a new bias reporting system following last year’s emailed threats. Under the new system, students may now submit anonymous reports of incidents of bias via email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When sophomore Courtney Smith ran at Tom Sawyer Park at the University of Louisville at the NCAA National Cross Country Championships this Saturday, she carried the weight of the entire Harvard cross country program on her shoulders.
The Westchester, Pa. native finished 60th of 254 runners as the Crimson’s only runner to qualify for the NCAA Championships after placing fifth at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships just eight days earlier.
“It was an honor to be there,” Smith said. “It was my first college national meet, and I’ve never been to a meet at such a high level before. It was almost inspirational to see so many great runners all working toward a common goal of being a national champion.”
The sophomore was the first female Harvard runner to qualify for the NCAA Championships since the 2012 season, when the women’s team qualified for the meet for the first time since 1983.
“I ended up falling short of my goal,” Smith said. “I was hoping to be an All-American, of which I was about eight seconds short. I was a little disappointed in that end result, but I was happy with the process goal of having a successful season.”
The performance on Saturday capped off a stellar second-year campaign for Smith, who finished 16th at a highly competitive Wisconsin Invitational and third at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, earning All-Ivy First Team honors in the process, the only Crimson women’s runner to earn a spot on the All-Ivy First or Second team.
While the outdoor season might have concluded for Smith and her teammates, the sophomore is already looking ahead to next season.
“Next year, I’d like to make another run at qualifying for the NCAA Championships and getting another shot at being an All-American,” the sophomore said. “I’ll apply a lot of the knowledge and experience I’ve gained this year to next season.”
On the other side, the Harvard men’s cross country team competed at the IC4A Cross Country Championships at Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, N.Y. this past Saturday.
The Crimson finished third of six teams competing at the event, finishing behind Columbia and Saint Joseph’s University who placed first and second, respectively.
Co-captain Chris Allen paced the men’s squad, finishing second overall just behind junior Jack Boyle of Columbia.
“I was pretty motivated,” Allen said. “It was my last cross country race in a Harvard uniform, and you only get to put on that singlet so many times, so it was great to go out and have a great run like that for my last race.”
Sophomore Ben Huffman and junior Brandon Price crossed the finish line in 13th and 14th places, respectively, with Price just a half a second slower than his Harvard teammate.
Rounding out the men’s finishers were four underclassmen, including freshman Austin Gilbert and fellow classmate Kieran Tuntivate, who took 29th and 34th, respectively. They were followed by sophomore Gabe Montague and freshman Robert Hope, who claimed 41st and 42nd.
“[As a team], we were satisfied with how we performed,” Allen said. “Especially considering we only had eight days between regionals and the meet on Saturday and we had a tough go at the Ivy League Championships, I thought we bounced back well as a team.”
The end-of-season meet capped off a season that fell short of preseason expectations for the Crimson, whose men’s and women’s team finished seventh of eight teams at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and qualified only one runner, Smith, for the NCAA Championships.
“I’m excited to improve on this past season,” Smith said. “Next year, we’ll do a lot of the same things we did this year, but learning from our mistakes this year. We’re going to train harder and smarter. We will bring back a lot of runners next year, so it will be interesting to see how that manifests next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Murphy’s Law is a commonly known adage which posits that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
But just because your last name is Murphy does not mean that this law applies, especially if your first name is Tim and you coach the Harvard football team. In fact, there seems to be a very different Murphy’s Law in place in Cambridge, and the result is a system that not only doesn’t fail most of the time, but also refuses to fail.
The power of this system was out in full force on a crisp Saturday afternoon at Yale, as the second-longest college rivalry was set to play for the 132nd time.
Had the traditional Murphy’s Law held, the home team should have won—after all, Yale was facing a Harvard team that was reeling from its first loss since Oct. 2013. Harvard had seen its shot at an outright conference championship slip away with the defeat, and was dealt another blow when the team lost its top running back, senior Paul Stanton, who was so instrumental in the last two showdowns against the Bulldogs.
Murphy’s Law should have predicted that things would continue to unravel for the Crimson. That without Stanton, the offense would sputter and struggle to jumpstart as it had the past few weeks. That the defense, shaken from its confidence after giving up 35 points and essentially a share of the title to Penn, would falter.
And three-and-a-half minutes into the game, it appeared that this might be the case. The Bulldogs took the opening kickoff and marched 75 yards down the field, ending with a beautiful 28-yard touch pass from quarterback Morgan Roberts to receiver Chris Williams-Lopez to give Yale the early advantage.
But Saturday was not governed by Murphy’s Law, as the Bulldogs would quickly find out.
Under a minute later, the offense answered, through the form of freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, flying past his corner, to catch the 53-yard ball from quarterback Scott Hosch, in stride all the way to the end zone. The Crimson hadn’t scored in the first quarter in nearly a month, and this boost seemed to be all that its compatriots on the other side of the ball needed.
The defense, as if not at all rattled by the early touchdown, proceeded to hold Yale to 28 yards total offense over the next five drives. The Bulldogs did not make it into Harvard territory until the final drive of the half. Kicker Bryan Holmes lined up to try the 30-yard field goal attempt after being iced once with a Harvard timeout. Yale snapped, the kick was up, and looked good. But before the referees raised their arms, the sideline referee ran out—Murphy had called another timeout.
Was the second timeout excessive? Not in Murphy’s world. A minute later, Yale snapped the ball once more, Holmes booted the ball, and this time, it sailed wide right.
Murphy, it appeared, was making his own laws, because on Saturday, it appeared that Harvard could do almost no wrong. Setbacks became opportunities, and mistakes seemed to do no harm.
Not having Stanton shined the spotlight on Hosch, and the senior took advantage, surpassing Harvard’s single-season passing record en route to tossing for 320 yards and four scores. And even Hosch’s lone sizeable error—an interception late in the second quarter—became simply a two-minute interlude in the Crimson’s scoring deluge as the defense forced Yale to punt for the sixth-straight time. Less than three minutes later, Hosch found senior tight end Ben Braunecker, who clung onto Hosch’s fadeaway 18-yard touchdown pass.
Even when the Crimson couldn’t punch it in for six, sophomore kicker Kenny Smart—not the most reliable kicker in the Ivy League with a 56 percent field goal success rate—came through. Smart split the uprights on a 38-yarder, two yards shy of his career high.
A late comeback attempt by the Bulldogs might have worked against a different team, but not on this Saturday, not against this Harvard team, led by this particular senior class. The most recent group to spend four years in Murphy’s system, the 30 seniors on the 2015 Crimson squad will never know what it feels like to suffer defeat in The Game, have only lost four times in a Harvard jersey and were merely freshmen the last time a different Ivy team took home the conference title.
However, (Tim) Murphy’s Law is not applicable only to veterans. Sophomore Semar Smith, just two weeks back from injury, filled in for Stanton on Saturday and ate up precious clock with bruising runs to kill Yale’s comeback en route to the 38-19 win. Shelton-Mosley, in just his third month of Division I college football play, danced and spun his way to 153 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns.
This year will be remembered as a year when the Harvard football team made history with its first ever three-peat, and the players of this squad are certainly a large part of that success.
But even after Smith and Shelton-Mosley depart Cambridge and a completely new set of players enter the Harvard system, as long as Murphy is still at the helm, it’s hard to imagine that he won’t still be making his own laws, shaping those players into champions of their own right, and cementing his place in the history books.

­The No. 12 Harvard men’s water polo team took down Navy and No. 10 Brown in its final weekend of the season en route to third place in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Championships at MIT.
Led by redshirt senior Noah Harrison—whose eight goals this weekend put him at a team-high 74 for the season—the Crimson (21-10, 9-3 CWPA Northern) defeated the Midshipmen, 19-12, in the tournament’s opening round before falling to No. 11 Princeton in the semifinals, 10-8. It rounded out the weekend with a 14-9 victory over Brown in the third-place game.
HARVARD 14, BROWN 9
Harvard faced rival Brown (24-8, 12-0) on Sunday in the Championship’s third-place match. Having lost in all four previous encounters with the Bears—twice by one goal—the Crimson came in as underdogs but came out on top, 14-9.
“There was a lot of extra motivation,” junior two-meter defender Dan Stevens said. “Not only was this our fifth shot at Brown, we also wanted to send our seniors out on a high note. A win against Brown was an incredible way to send our seniors out the way they deserved.”
Stevens was the team’s catalyst throughout the game, netting two goals immediately after the opening swim off to hand his team a lead it would never relinquish. Another two goals from Stevens helped Harvard take a 9-3 halftime lead.
“My teammates set me up very well, and I was able to finish what they started,” Stevens said. “I’m excited to have the four goals. I’m excited with the way we were able to play, but it was a team effort and I’m proud of how the team played overall.”
Senior goalie Colin Woolway made seven saves to keep the Brown offense off the scoreboard enough to lead the team to a victory, as the Crimson were able to close out the game.
The Pasadena, Calif. native came one save shy of recording 100 on the year.
PRINCETON 10, HARVARD 8
Harvard faced off against the Tigers (23-4, 8-0 CWPA Southern) on Saturday night, falling just short in a back-and-forth affair to its conference rival, 10-8. The Crimson was paced by senior attacker Blake Lee, who scored a hat trick.
Harvard was down 2-0 less than a minute into the game, as holes appeared in the Crimson defense. But goals from co-captain Ben Zepfel and Lee leveled the game midway through the quarter.
But Princeton responded promptly with two goals before the end of the quarter, taking a 4-2 lead.
“I think Princeton is very fast,” said coach Ted Minnis, “and they transition very well. We had some breakdowns early for them to take that 4-2 lead…. A couple of hiccups in the first quarter kind of cost us the game.”
Stevens and Lee cut Princeton’s lead to 5-4 in the third quarter, but a flurry of Princeton attacks returned the lead to 9-5.
Princeton goalie Vojislav Mitrovic was instrumental in keeping Harvard at bay, making over a dozen saves.
“We did not execute quite as well against Princeton,” Stevens said. “Princeton has a very good goalie, but if we’re going to let in 10, eight isn’t enough.”
HARVARD 19, NAVY 12
Harvard avenged last year’s CWPA Championship first round loss to Navy (15-13, 4-4) with a 19-12 rout, paced by Harrison’s five-goal, three-assist effort.
“[Harrison] has picked up right where he left it,” Minnis said. “I think everyone on our team is very talented and we can play inside and out, but he is a big threat on the outside. It’s going to be nice for him to come back for one more year.”
The Crimson jumped out to a 4-1 lead through a hat trick of penalty shots taken by Zepfel and Lee. The Midshipmen staged a successful comeback, tying things up at five by the end of the first eight minutes of the contest.
The Crimson were unable to pull away until the third quarter, scoring five unanswered goals to open up a 16-10 lead.
The win was Harvard’s 20th of the season, marking the first time it has done that in back-to-back seasons since the beginning of the century.

The Harvard women’s swim team travelled to the Big Apple over the weekend and beat the Columbia, 201.5-98.5. The Crimson (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) also went on to break two pool records in the process in the rout of the Lions (0-3, 0-3 Ivy).
Jing Leung, a Harvard sophomore diver from Orpington, England, consistently outpaced the competition, finishing the meet with a record score of 321.30 on the three-meter. Previously, the pool record for the three-meter stood at 319.73, which had been set by Yale’s Lilybet MacRae in 2013
Leung went on to sweep the boards, with a winning score of 291.23 in the one-meter competition.
Other Crimson divers had strong showings as well. Freshman Katie Russ finished second in two diving events with scores of 291.01 and 277.35 in the three-meter and one-meter competitions, respectively.
The standout on the swimming side of the team was Harvard freshman Sonia Wang. Wang swam in four events—the 200 yard medley relay, the 200 butterfly, the 200 backstroke, and the 400 yard IM—winning each of the individual events handily.
Wang was most impressive in the 200 butterfly, in which she broke Columbia’s Courtney Otto’s record of 2:00.32 by a 0.31 margin to claim the pool record and a full six second quicker than the next-best finisher in the heat.
In addition to the record-breaking showings, Harvard put up first place showings in 13 of the 17 events. These strong performances led to a big lead after the first half of the meet against what some of the swimmers thought was an unpredictable opponent.
“It’s always hard to know what to expect,” sophomore Gabby Sims said. “When we travelled to Columbia two years ago, they wore racing suits and they beat us, which had never happened before, so this year we didn’t want to underestimate them.”
Teammates echoed Sims’ outlook.
“We didn't know if Columbia was going to taper and suit up for us or not, so we were going in expecting them to really put up a good fight,” senior Danielle Lee said. “This meet has always been pretty close in previous years.”
Crimson coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 had this in mind when she picked out the lineups for the meet, stacking the first half of day with Harvard swimmers swimming their best events. But the Crimson women also showed their versatility and endurance gained through a strenuous workout program with a comprehensive second half performance that wrapped up the big win for Harvard.
“We have been training so hard both in and out of the pool,” Lee said. “In fact, I think this is the most dry-land training that we have done in the past 4 years.”
Even with the program’s recent successes, the goal has continued to be further improvement. Though undefeated in league competition last season up until the Ivy League Championships, the team finished second to Princeton in the final Ancient Eight competition of the 2014-2015 season.
“I think our coaches have been pushing us more than last year,” Sims said. “The team is looking better and stronger than it was at this time last year. We are still working on our racing, and some of us are still trying to figure out what events we will be doing at the end of the season, but in general I think training and our performances at the meets have been going really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Playing at the University of Rhode Island Tip-Off Classic tournament this weekend, the Harvard women’s basketball team split its matchups in two games that would both be decided by single digits.
Without senior standout Shilpa Tummala on Friday and with a starting lineup that featured two freshman on Sunday, the Crimson (2-2) came into the last minute of both matchups within a bucket of the opponent.
RHODE ISLAND 56, HARVARD 52,
Down by six with 1:23 left on the clock, co-captain AnnMarie Healy pulled up from beyond the arc to put Harvard within three. Sophomore Kirby Porter would go to the line 40 seconds later to put the Crimson within two, but the late rally wouldn’t be enough as the Crimson fell to the Rams in a close matchup on Saturday evening.
In a game that featured poor shooting from both teams, it was the turnovers that Harvard struggled with against Rhode Island. Turning the ball over eight times in the first quarter and 21 times total, the Crimson struggled to run the floor on offense.
“I think it was really close, but I think what it came down to was our turnovers and we let up to many points in the paint,” Healy said. “Going into the game we knew they were a team that could drive and I think that if our rotation help and defense on the dribble were just a little better we would’ve been able to come out with the win.”
Harvard scored 14 points in the paint, which was dwarfed by Rhode Island’s 30.
Even without Tummala and with Healy committing two fouls early in the matchup, the Crimson managed to edge the Ram’s on the boards. Harvard outrebounded Rhode Island 46 to 38.
“I was thrilled. On top of not having Shilpa, AnnMarie got into foul trouble and basically sat out more than half the game,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We were very, very short at the four spot, we even had to play Kirby at the forward spot.”
Healy led the Crimson with 13 points and 8 rebounds in 22 minutes of action. Also scoring double digits were sophomore Kirby Porter and freshman Madeline Raster with ten apiece. Raster also contributed eight rebounds, five assists, and five steals.
In a matchup that featured seven ties and five lead changes, the Crimson struggled to make shots late and turned the ball over.
“We turned the ball over, and not forced turnovers—unforced turnovers, almost every single one of them. They were bad turnovers, panic turnovers,” Delaney-Smith said. “That was the game.”
HARVARD 76, TOLEDO 70
Playing a consolation match against Toledo on Sunday, the Harvard offense came to life, with the Crimson shooting a season high 47 percent. In a game that had nine lead changes, the Crimson pulled away late in the match, with Harvard’s last seven points coming from the free throw line.
“I think the big difference in us today and us in every other game we’ve played is that we finally executed our offense, so it was a good day,” Delaney-Smith said.
After going up by eight with three minutes left in the fourth, the Crimson struggled to keep the lead in the closing minutes of the match. After a long three and two layups, Toledo found itself within four, but never managed to close the gap as Harvard shot 5-for-7 from the line in the last three minutes.
After rotating in three freshman at the guard spot throughout the first three games of the season, Delaney-Smith started freshman Madeline Raster and Nani Redford at the one and two spots on Sunday.
“They were defensive decisions to be honest. We wanted to start with a strong defensive statement and both Murphs and Nani are very strong defenders, athletically and otherwise,” Delaney-Smith said.“It worked out, Nani can get in your head, she was probably very bothersome to the opposing point guard.”
Four of the Crimsons starters scored in double digits on Sunday. Again, Healy led the squad with 20 and Raster scored a season high 16 with four rebounds and three assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team has a tradition of winning. Since Katey Stone took over as head coach in 1994, the Crimson has only had three losing seasons. Stone is the all-time wins leader in women’s college hockey and is coming off her fourth runner-up finish in the NCAA tournament with a 4-1 loss to the University of Minnesota in the final.
This season isn’t appearing to buck that trend. After losing the first game of the season, the Crimson (6-1-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) has not dropped a contest. Harvard is undefeated at home, with the only tie coming in a scoreless game against then-No. 4/4 Clarkson. Since then, Harvard has gone on a six-game winning streak, beating five conference opponents in the process.
“These kids are tough, they’re resilient,” Stone said. “They’re finding a way to win. It’s a real good start, but we’ve got a long road ahead of us…. We’ve got the moxie. We’re finding a way to win games.”
Heading into its matchup against crosstown rival No. 4/5 Northeastern (11-2-1, 7-1-1 Hockey East), the No. 8/8 Crimson look to continue this streak. The two teams have faced off each of the last three seasons, with the Crimson emerging victorious all three times. The Crimson’s season so far has included five of eight games being decided by one goal or less. On the other hand, the Huskies have won by two or more goals in nine of their 11 wins.
“I think we’ve been doing really well,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “Each game has been different, and we’ve won a different way. Tomorrow night will be a huge task. Northeastern has a really good team, so we’re really excited for that. So far I feel pretty good. There’s always a lot of work to improve, but we’ve gotten better every game.”
After a loss in the NCAA tournament final last season, Harvard is currently in second in the ECAC. However, they face a prolific scoring team in Northeastern, which averages five goals per game. Northeastern also boasts the nation’s leading scorer, senior forward Kendall Coyne, who has scored 21 goals and 33 points over 13 games.
“It’s going to be a track meet,” Stone said. “They’re a very fast team, and we need to be ready. We need to play great transition defense and take advantage of our opportunities when they present themselves.”
The Crimson defense, on the other hand, is giving up less than one goal per game. Splitting time almost evenly, Harvard’s three goalies have a .963 save percentage. Senior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer is currently ranked second in the country with a .967 save percentage.
A standout on the offensive side for the Crimson is D’Oench. After finishing last season with 33 points, good for second on the team, the New York City native has nearly a third of her goals and assists from 2014-15 after only eight games. She leads the team with six goals and is tied for third in assists with four.
“I feel pretty good about how I’ve personally been playing,” D’Oench said. “I think a lot of it has to do with as a team we’ve gotten going offensively…. In the last couple of games, we’ve really been clicking on all cylinders. That definitely helps me personally as well as the team. I always want to have the best season yet”
Harvard will look to upset Northeastern this Tuesday in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. However, despite the in-state rivalry and the Huskies’ higher ranking, the Crimson is treating this like any other game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, the Harvard women’s basketball team (2-2) will welcome crosstown rival Boston University (0-3) to Lavietes Pavilion, looking to avenge last year's loss to the Terriers.
Over the last five years, the Crimson and the Terriers have been in close contention, with Harvard winning three of those games compared to BU’s two. In each of these five games, no team has won by more than 11 points.
The Crimson has been up-and-down through the early portion of its schedule, with wins over Massachusetts and Toledo interspersed with losses to Maine and Rhode Island.
Harvard employs a motion offensive system, using its versatility in speed and size to its advantage. Aside from the system, what has been clear so far is that the freshmen have been given the opportunity by Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith to make an instant impact.
Freshmen guards Nani Redford, and Sydney Skinner have averaged around 20 minutes per game, while other freshman guard Madeline Raster has registered just over 30 minutes per game. Raster also leads the team with 2.8 assists per game and leads freshmen scoring with 7.8 points per contest.
The biggest standouts come on the other side of the experience spectrum: co-captain forward AnneMarie Healy and senior guard Shilpa Tummala, who lead the team in scoring.
The duo averages almost half of Harvard’s 63.8 points per game, with Healy pounding it down low with more than 15 points and 5 rebounds per game and Tummala contributing 14 points per game. Tummala has found success from downtown this year, shooting 47.6 percent from the three point line.
Though there will always be standouts, the team will look to work together as one cohesive unit in its attempt to fend off the Terriers.
“One huge emphasis this year is that we play team basketball,” Healy said. “Being a top scorer doesn't outshine rebounds, rotation on defense and positive energy – this is something that everyone on our team brings.”
With everyone contributing, the Crimson must continue to improve from each game and focus on reenacting the great parts of its game.
“This season we have seen flashes of how good our team is,” Healy said. “Our next step is going to be showing consistency. That is the real accomplishment of a championship team.”
Playing the Terriers present an excellent opportunity for Healy and her teammates.
BU has struggled so far this season. After just three games this season, its squad has given up 218 points and scored just 124 points. Last week proved difficult for the Terriers, losing to Albany by 40 points then to rival BC by 21 in its own gym.
For a team that scores just 41.3 points per contest, coach Katy Steding does not seem to have one go-to player. The team as a whole shoots just 30 percent from the field while its opponents enjoy good shooting nights at 47 percent from the field.
Though it is still early doors in the season, this game could prove to be pivotal for BU. After having been blown out in each of its opening three games, another one tomorrow in the Lavietes Pavilion could set the Terriers’ back even further.
The Terriers are looking to build off a difficult season last year, where the squad limped to a 5-25 record. One of those wins did come against the Crimson.
In the coming weeks, the Delaney-Smith and her squad will look to build upon the foundation so that by the time its Ivy League opponents come around, the team will be ready to battle for the title.
“We are working on running the floor the way we are capable of athletically, [and] minimizing defensive errors,” Crimson Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
However, improvement for the offensive side of the game is paramount for the Crimson.
“At the top of the list is offensive execution which we actually did our best in the Toledo game. Hopefully we will keep heading in the right direction,” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard student-athletes do not pursue careers in professional sports, a select few are able to make the leap. Not only do some of them make the pros, but some of them also shine.
Dominic Moore ’03 (C, New York Rangers - NHL)
Coming off a successful playoff run last year, Moore has been making major contributions for the New York Rangers who currently stand at the top of their division. Moore lines up at center for the Rangers’ fourth line. Moore was the only Ranger on the board, ending a personal 13-game goal drought. Moore then registered 11:50 playing time in New York’s win against the Florida Panthers on Saturday.
Dominic and his two older brothers, Mark and Steve, were the first-ever brother trio to share the rink at the same time for the Crimson. Moore is currently tied for third in game-winning goals and eighth in career goals for the Crimson.
Alex Killorn ’12 (C, Tampa Bay Lightning - NHL)
Another Harvard alum, Alex Killorn faced off against the Rangers this past week for the fist time since Game 7 of last year's Eastern Conference Finals.
Killorn, centering the Lightning’s third line, scored in the first quarter to establish a lead early on the game, only the second time this season Tampa has held a lead after the first period. The Lightning win ended the Rangers’ chance to equal the longest winning streak in team history. Tampa then blanked the Florida Panthers 5-0 on Saturday where Killorn had one assist. The Lightning improved to 10-9-3 on the season.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’04 (QB, New York Jets- NFL)
Fitzpatrick faced his former team this week when the New York Jets visited the Houston Texans. The Jets fell to 5-5 on the season this week with a 24-17 loss to the Texans on Sunday. Dreams of a playoff run are quickly fading for the Jets, who started the season with an impressive 4-1 record.
Fitzpatrick started for the Jets after having thumb surgery last week. The former Crimson Quarterback completed 19 of 39 passes for 216 yards with one touchdown and ran in for another touchdown, but two interceptions late in the fourth quarter thwarted any comeback attempt.
Mike Fucito ’09 (F, San Jose Earthquakes- MLS)
Fuctio completed his collegiate career at Harvard ranked fourth in career goals and in assists and led the Crimson to three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances from 2006-08. Fucito was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes from the Portland Timbers in 2013. Fucito has appeared in two games this season for the Earthquakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that your rival one year becomes your teammate the next.
But that’s exactly what happened with Michelle Xie and Anna Zhou, the lone two freshmen on the Harvard women’s golf team. Both hail from Palo Alto, California, where Xie graduated from Palo Alto High and Zhou from Gunn High—two schools notorious in the San Francisco Bay area for their intense rivalry.
Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that Xie and Zhou competed against each other quite often in high school at local and regional tournaments. Perhaps it’s a little more surprising, however, that the two, despite the competition and intense school rivalry, had already become close friends even before committing to play together for the Crimson.
“Anna and I have actually known each other well since she first moved to Palo Alto,” Xie said. “We’ve played many tournaments together, and she’s become a really good friend.”
Indeed, the connection between Xie and Zhou extends to even before high school; all the way back to elementary school, when Xie and Zhou used to practice at the same municipal golf course.
Over the next several years, their paths diverged: each found a different coach, a different style of play, and a different high school. But somehow this year they have converged, and once more they have found themselves practicing on the same golf course. This time, though, they are not rivals but teammates instead.
For both women, the experience has been a positive one.
“It’s really cool to be able to say that she’s my teammate,” Xie said. “Now I work with her, instead of competing against her…. [I] feel the team spirit so much more.”
Zhou echoed the sentiment.
“It’s nice to have Michelle on the team because there’s a sense of familiarity,” Zhou said. “When you’re first meeting the team, you don’t feel completely out of place. We can also relate to and rely on each other a lot especially since we’re both freshmen.”
Junior Anne Cheng, a mentor to the two women, recognizes the old competition between the newest members of the squad but emphasized their current status as teammates and friends.
“They might have been from rival high schools,” Cheng said. “And, because I think since golf is an individual sport, there’s always some sort of rivalry—but overall, they’re still teammates and good players.”
Cheng’s statement has a strong statistical backing—in high school, in fact, each ranked among the top 20 nationwide in their recruiting class. But college golf is a different world and something both players are still figuring out.
For Xie, the 16th-ranked golfer in the nation in the class of 2015, the most jarring transition between high school and college golf has been the step-up in academics at Harvard.
But Xie is no stranger to a high standard in the classroom. Last year, she was named a National Merit Finalist and attended Paly High, a school consistently ranked among the best public schools in California.
But at Harvard, the intense academic environment coupled with the varsity sport time commitment has been particularly difficult to adjust to.
“This fall, it was a huge transition period for me to go into college, so hopefully in the spring I’ll be able to manage my time a little better,” Xie said. “Being able to find that balance again is really important to me.”
Helping her adapt to college life have been her fellow members of the golf team; which, with only eight members, is one of the smallest varsity sports teams on campus.
“The size of the team brings us very close to one another,” Xie said. “It’s really cool how we can all fit in one van together and practice together every morning and just get to know each other. We’re all pretty different, but somehow it works.”
For Xie, perhaps the most important distinction between high school and college golf has not been the workload but the tightness of the college team, a sentiment Zhou echoed.
“Everyone on the team is really close to each other, and we all have this mentality of team first,” Zhou said. “You really get to connect with all the team members personally, and it’s a good support system because when everyone else is having trouble, we’re all there to help each other.”
Like Xie, Zhou—the 19th-ranked golfer in the nation in the class of 2015—also excels in the classroom. She was recently named a U.S. Presidential Scholar candidate on the basis of her academics, and attended Gunn, which, like Paly High, is known for its highly competitive atmosphere. For her too, balancing college golf and school has been a different beast.
“[College] was a bit hard to adjust to at first, especially with the step up in academics as well,” Zhou said. “Also, with new responsibilities and having to live far away from home and having to take care of everything myself, high school to college was just a hard transition.”
Judging off of Xie and Zhou’s performances on the golf course, though, you would not be able to easily pinpoint their difficulties.
Xie, who has started all four tournaments of the year thus far, has stood out on the team since her collegiate debut at the Diane Thomason Invitational in September. There, she led the team to a fourth-place finish thanks to a team-best second place individual finish. Since then, she has proven to be one of the Crimson’s most consistent players, landing in the top 20 individually in every tournament she has participated in.
Zhou has also played a crucial role on the team, helping lead the Crimson to top six finishes in each of the three fall tournaments she competed in. Her best performance thus far occurred at the Yale Invitational, where she placed 20th overall en route to Harvard’s sixth-place team finish.
Together with sophomore Lita Guo, the two freshmen figure to play big roles in the future of the Crimson, which won two of the four tournaments it participated in this fall.
“I think it’s pretty apparent that everyone’s doing well,” Cheng said. “In the next few years, I’m sure we’ll keep trending in the right direction.”

The opening tip bounced fortuitously into her path, and Harvard women’s basketball co-captain AnnMarie Healy took advantage, beating two defenders and converting the layup. Just four seconds into the contest, the game’s course had been set.
Fueled by a trio of hot-shooting seniors, the Crimson (3-2) defeated Boston University (0-4), 73-55, at Lavietes Pavilion on Tuesday night. Despite the holiday, there was a sizable crowd on hand to watch Harvard climb above .500 for the first time this season.
“As a young team, it’s nice to get a couple wins under our belt in a row,” senior guard/forward Shilpa Tummala said. “Knowing we can win consecutive games is huge for us, so that really builds on our confidence. It’s a big win.”
The Crimson’s three seniors—Kit Metoyer, Healy, and Tummala—combined to go 18-for-35 (51.5%) from the field in a game in which Harvard never trailed. Tummala was the Crimson’s catalyst, leading the team with 17 points, 14 rebounds, and four assists.
Harvard broke the game wide open in the third quarter, firing on all cylinders offensively. After a pair of layups by the Terriers forward Meghan Green, the Crimson’s lead was cut to nine early in the period. Harvard would respond, going on a 10-3 run to extend the lead to 16. Tummala registered seven of her team-high 17 points in the third quarter.
A half-court press from the Terriers caused the Crimson problems during a difficult second quarter, with Harvard turning the ball over on three straight possessions at one point. BU also found itself at the line often, converting 16-of-22 attempts from the charity stripe as opposed to the Crimson’s 9-of-16. Four straight points from Terriers guard Troi Melton capped off a 9-2 run that saw BU close to within six.
“I felt that we made mistakes that I feel we didn’t make in our last game, and so I want to keep on growing,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t want to step backwards. I thought they beat us on the drive too often, I thought we sent them to the line too often, I thought there were some rebounds that we should have secured…. There were a lot of things I wasn’t happy with.”
Despite struggling to find chemistry in the half-court, Harvard managed to fight off the visitors’ rallies thanks to Metoyer, who buried a trio of three-pointers in the second quarter to reclaim momentum for her team. The 5’10” Houston, Texas native finished with 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting from beyond the arc.
“She’s a phenomenal shooter… but she’s so much more than a shooter for us,” Delaney-Smith said of Metoyer. “She’s our captain, she has great court IQ, she’s able to talk and communicate, and that’s what our young kids need on the floor. So she’s invaluable for us out there.”
The Crimson’s guards were unselfish throughout the game, with 19 of the team’s 28 made field goals being assisted. Tummala and freshman guards Nani Redford and Sydney Skinner each had four assists to lead the way while Metoyer added three of her own.
“I think everyone gets touches,” Tummala said. “Everyone knows what shots are good for them, what shots aren’t good for them, and we’re really smart. We play within the system.”
The rivalry between Harvard and the Terriers is a growing one, with none of the last five meetings being decided by more than 11 points—until tonight. Despite taking a comfortable 15-point lead over its crosstown rivals into the fourth quarter, Harvard continued to keep its foot on the pedal, going on an 11-0 run midway through the fourth to open up a 71-48 lead. The surge was capped off by a long three from Tummala, one that brought a bright smile to the Arizona native’s face.
Holding a comfortable lead, Delaney-Smith brought in freshman guard Kelsey Bogdan who scored the first points of her college career as the Crimson finished off the game. The basket elicited quite the response from the bench on a successful night for the home team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 8/8 Harvard women's ice hockey team extended its winning streak to seven on Tuesday night as it blanked crosstown rival No. 4/5 Northeastern, 3-0, at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The Crimson (7-1-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) managed to shut out the Huskies (11-3-1, 7-1-0 Hockey East), who averaged five goals a game entering the matchup. Defense proved key as senior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer had 31 saves in the fast-paced battle.
“I think [the game] was really like a track meet; it was really up and down action,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Both goaltenders played well and we had to really contain their team’s speed today, and I think we did that with really good team defense.”
Harvard opened the first five minutes of play battling for possession but controlling faceoffs by a 3-0 margin. A Crimson penalty and resulting Northeastern power play six minutes into the first period drastically tilted shots on goal and possession in favor of the Huskies. Multiple saves by Maschmeyer, who ranked second nationally entering the game with a .967 save percentage, ultimately killed the power play.
Despite Northeastern almost doubling Harvard in shots on goal, 12-8, junior forward Sydney Daniels found the back of the net with a shot to the top right corner with less than two minutes left in the first period. Sophomore forward Haley Mullins and senior forward Miye D’Oench claimed assists for the first Crimson goal as D’Oench’s shot deflected to Mullins, who found Daniels inside the left faceoff circle for the Southwick, Mass. native’s fourth goal of the season.
“We were just ready to play. We were on our toes and our kids really were flying,” Stone said. “We were very committed to playing at both ends of the ice and in all three zones. We made the little plays, blocked a lot of shots. We were pretty tough on the puck. Our defensemen again played really well.”
As second period play began, an impressive save by Maschmeyer kept the score at 1-0 five minutes in as the Huskies continued to apply pressure and lead in shots on goal.
Five minutes later, Harvard almost got on the board for the second time when sophomore forward Karly Heffernan wrapped behind the Northeastern net and popped the puck behind Huskie rookie goalkeeper Brittany Bugalski. The goal was immediately placed under review and ultimately wiped away due to sophomore Lexie Laing having been pushed into the net and displacing Bugalski.
A penalty on Northeastern senior forward Jordan Krause afforded the Crimson the opportunity to redeem itself for the lost goal. Only 13 seconds into the power play, freshman forward Grace Zarzecki tipped the puck in with the help of an assist from junior defenseman Abbey Frazier after Laing won possession from a faceoff to start the play. Zarzecki improved to five goals on the season.
By the end of the second period, Harvard’s total shots on goal started to creep up on the Huskies as both teams totaled 11 in the second period alone.
“I think as the game went on we got better,” Maschmeyer said. “We started getting more opportunities to get pucks to the net, and we looked more confident as the game went on. A pretty solid effort all around.”
The Crimson solidified its lead five minutes into the third period when senior forward Jessica Harvey scored her third consecutive goal of the season after a shot by freshman defenseman Kaitlin Tse was swatted away.
By the end of the game, shots on goal had shifted to Harvard’s favor, 34-31, helped by 15 in the third period.
Penalties ran high for both teams on either side of the puck with Northeastern registering four penalties and Harvard registering five. But the Crimson’s ability to kill all five power plays proved vital to its victory.
“We had a lot of penalties called against us,” Maschmeyer said. “So I think just not getting down on those penalties, battling through that, and killing off the penalties and after that gaining that momentum and bringing it forward in the offensive zone.”

On Nov. 10, amid photographs of sugar cubes doused in oil, the ICA held its first College Night to introduce college students to the fascinating and sometimes inscrutable world of contemporary art. This Roving Reporter attended the event, trying to figure out the meaning of modern art and to chisel away at the mystery of the perfect date night spot.
Simi Fanalusi, Northeastern UniversityRR: Do you think people are intimidated by contemporary art?SF: Possibly, because it sounds so upscale and so hipster. Contemporary art makes people think, “Oh! I should be wearing my Paul McCartney sunglasses with some sort of fedora!”RR: What kitchen appliance or cooking utensil does the ICA building most remind you of?SF: An ovenRR: A microwave oven?SF: Yes!RR: Despite looking like a microwave, does the ICA earn your seal of approval as a good date night spot?SF: Yes! It has two essential things: low lighting and good music.
Mia Carter and Dan Ausberg, Northeastern UniversityRR: What brings you here tonight?DA: Free food.MC: Art, and it’s free.RR: How do you feel about contemporary art?MC: I think it’s cool and interesting. I don’t always get it but it’s nice to look at.RR: Why do you think people find artists so attractive?MC: Oh wow, that’s tough!DA: They are high profile and they have very different minds.RR: Is there any artist you would like to go on a date with?DA: Pablo Picasso. I would love to go on a date with Pablo Picasso.
Mirabelle Raymond and Kacie Guillard, Boston UniversityRR: Does this fit your idea of “the club goin’ up on a Tuesday?”MR: Not really. It’s more of an art exhibit, and it should be focused more on art and not on partying.KG: The one thing it is lacking is more people. The music is great, and the set up is good. RR: Would it make for a good date night though?MR: Yes. It’s cute, and it’s not Netflix and chill.
Madeline Carr and Maggie Loan, Boston UniversityRR: Can you tell me what you are looking at?ML: [A] Rube Goldberg Machine, but someone else’s version.RR: So you’re basically watching some sort of liquid metal pour over concrete and it’s all on fire. What do you think this means?ML: I think the machines are a bunch of random shit that happens to promote other random shit happening.
Larisha Bailey, Boston UniversityRR: Can you tell me what you are looking at right now?LB: I am looking at a giant cube of needles.RR: So it’s not finding the needle in the haystack—LB: It’s finding the hay in the needlestack!RR: What do you think the meaning of this piece is?LB: I want to say that there is a deeper meaning, but I also don’t want to put meaning where meaning [does] not [exist]. I feel like a lot of times we try to extract something that’s not there, and that takes away from taking in the art.

Now that Thanksgiving break is finally here and we'll be separated from all our school friends for a brief period of time, it's time to make sure they are all aware of how you're spending every minute of your break via social media. Why not share these pictures with Flyby and potentially be featured on our *esteemed* blog?
When you post your perfect photos on Instagram, include the hashtag #flybythanksgiving so we can show off your aesthetically pleasing break to the rest of Harvard when we all return.
Take photos of your feast (and feel guilty about eating turkey because you'll think about our favorite bird who loves prowling the Square), take photos of your view, take photos of your family and friends, and since it's the season to do so, take photos of what you’re thankful for (ex. stretchy pants).

Flyby writers Eva S. Monroe ’18 and Ignacio Sabate ’18 have a lot of feelings, and they’re ready to share them. In Flyby’s newest series, these two sit down to discuss the more weighty topics on campus, like Bean boots, Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and how to get the best lighting for your Instagrams. Wait, that makes them sound really basic. You know what, ignore all of that, let them do the talking.
This week, Eva and Nacho take on Tinder, Bumble, and the confusing world of online dating.
Eva: Okay, so Tinder. Everybody’s favorite way to waste time.
Nacho: Please explain what Tinder is for our readers, Eva.
Eva: Tinder is a dating app where you swipe left or right on people’s pictures. If you match with someone, you can talk to them, or you can recognize them from section and try to pretend nothing happened...Do you really not know what Tinder is?
Nacho: No, of course I do.
Eva: Have you ever really been on a date with one of your Tinder matches?
Nacho: I mean, I’ve dated people I had matched with, but we didn’t really start talking on Tinder though.
Eva: I did once when I was back in D.C. It wasn’t great, to be honest. He, like, yelled at me to change my concentration before I even introduced myself. It was super weird. But I’ve also hung out with people I already knew after matching with them on Tinder and it’s been fine, I don’t think they were Tinder dates though.
Nacho: Oh?
Eva: Yeah, I have this tendency to go on dates and not realize they’re dates. Remember that one time I went to a networking event and ended up on a date? Yeah, like that.
Nacho: Impressive. Do you ever swipe right on people you know?
Eva: Yeah for sure. But sometimes it can be kind of weird, like people expect that you want something to happen now that you’ve swiped right, when really you just wanted it to be funny.
Nacho: I love matching with friends. I really only swipe right on friends if it’s super funny if we match.
Eva: So you mean like me? [We’ve already matched around six times].

Nacho: Nah, I’ve started swiping left on you. The weird thing about Tinder is that it’s awkward to explain to people how you and your significant other met. If someone at the Thanksgiving table asks you how you and your girlfriend met, what do you say?
Eva: You do what a bunch of couples already do: you lie.
Nacho: Fair. But I don’t think my parents lied about how they met— my mom asked my dad and his friend if they wanted to have dinner at her apartment and my dad said no because he didn’t like what my mom cooked. That would be a weird lie.
Eva: But what about this new app, Bumble? It’s like Tinder, but the girls have to contact the guys first within 24 hours, or else the match disappears. If you’re both of the same gender, then either one can message first.
Nacho: I mean, I’m pretty indifferent about it. Mainly because it hasn’t been released on Android.
Eva: Well, issue number one is that you have an Android. But I think Bumble is fun, except I’m really bad at starting conversations.
Nacho: Are you really on Tinder/Bumble for the conversation, though?
Eva: Absolutely, yes. Tinder in D.C. is great because I just end up getting into arguments about politics. It’s fun. But what do you think, are these online dating apps a good thing? Are they going to help college students break out of hook-up culture?
Nacho: I’m sort of like an old man, Eva. Things just sort of happen and I’m just here, watching things unfold. Soon, Tinder will just be the norm. I’m just here for the ride.
Eva: That’s...very weird to say, Nacho. Left swipe.

Dear Mom/Dad/Grandma/Great Uncle Stewart/any other family members who will be at Thanksgiving dinner,
I know Thanksgiving is something that you look forward to all year long for the food, great company, and most of all, to welcome me back home by grilling me with all the questions you’ve ever had about my life at college. Let me fill you in on a little secret: as fun as it may be for you to bombard me with a million and one questions, as it turns out, this isn’t so fun for me. So in attempt to make my time at home an enjoyable/bearable one, please do your best to refrain from the following:
Asking me about my classesChances are by this point in the semester I am sick of all of my classes and bitter about the lack of sleep that each and every one of them is causing me. This is the first opportunity in longer than I can even remember to get a break from psets, papers, and midterms, so no, talking about academics for the entirety of dinner is not ideal.
Following up with “Hmm, what do you plan on doing with that?!”Let me be, mom, didn’t you always tell me to do what I love? Don’t make me feel guilty for my infinitely relevant course load consisting of Swahili, Hebrew Bible, and that one class where you read children’s stories. I’ll find a job someday, I promise.
Asking me what it’s like to go to HarvardI hate to let you down, but my friends and fellow students are the same immature college students that you would find at any other school. I don’t know anyone who cured cancer or won a Nobel Prize, and I’m sure my conversations with my roommates are not as intellectually stimulating as you would have hoped. No classes have been so awe inspiring that they’ve changed my life, and no, I haven’t met any celebrities.
Seeking advice for your child who is applying to collegeAunt Judy, I took the SAT 3 years ago and couldn’t even tell you what the 3 sections are anymore. I also don’t have the secret recipe for getting into Harvard because I’m still convinced that my acceptance, and that of everyone around me, was a fluke.
Speaking to me so much that I don’t have time to eatIf we’re being completely honest here, the only real reason any of us come home is to cleanse our palates with something even mildly better than HUDS. If you talk my ear off for the entire meal, my turkey will get cold and I will be grumpy. Just ask my roommates, nobody wants that.
Sincerely,
Sections
If you are staying on campus over Thanksgiving, it can be painful to watch your roommates pack their bags and rant about their moms’ home-cooked pumpkin pies. What your roommates don’t know is that being in Cambridge over Thanksgiving is low-key the way to go. Whether you live too far away, you don’t celebrate Thanksgiving, or you simply don’t want to get used to the luxuries of being home, Flyby has the perfect week planned for you:
Figure out who is staying on campus and make a group chatBreak the ice by naming the group chat “Friendsgiving” (don’t forget the turkey emoji). This is definitely a gutsy move, but there is nothing more gratifying than a full table for the Thanksgiving meal that will be served at Dunster on Thursday, November 26. Stuff your face, there will be no judgment.
Continue your Friendsgiving festivities by preparing for Black Friday ShoppingThis is arguably the best and most dangerous part of Thanksgiving. Whether you decide to go to Newbury Street or to the Wrentham Outlets, make sure to wake up early to get the best deals from your favorite stores. Beware of ruthless moms looking for Christmas gifts, seemingly sweet old ladies, and line-cutters who might leave you wishing you had slept in.
Become homies with the PilgrimsGrab the Kingston/Plymouth Train and head to Plimoth Plantations to learn more about the history of Thanksgiving.
Lastly, throughout your Friendsgiving break, make sure to take plenty of pictures and post them on Instagram #flybythanksgiving to let your roommate know that, after all, homemade pumpkin pie is overrated.
