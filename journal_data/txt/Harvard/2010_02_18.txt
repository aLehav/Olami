After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When correcting government deficits, politicians sometimes propose imprudent measures in an effort to be novel and innovative. Faced with the task of closing Utah’s $700 million budget gap, State Senator Chris Buttars has introduced a plan that would save the state up to $60 million by making 12th grade optional and offering incentives to students who graduate early. By making the final year discretionary, this proposition sends the wrong message to citizens about the value of schooling.
While budget matters inevitably lead to tough decisions, education should be shielded from spending cuts as much as is realistically feasible. The importance of learning cannot be understated, and this proposal gives off the impression that education is optional and hence dispensable.
The logistics of the proposal are also cause for concern. Although the plan is in its preliminary stages and the details are currently hazy at best, one would assume that, similar to the advanced standing option at some colleges, high schoolers would have to decide fairly early whether they will opt for an abridged secondary education. The prospect of a 14 or 15-year-old, with the counsel of his or her parents, making such long term plans so soon out of middle school is troublesome and calls into question the rationale behind the program. A student unacquainted with the academic challenges and social dynamics of high school—and even more uncertain of what the future holds—cannot be depended upon to always make the most informed and appropriate decisions. The introduction of incentives merely exacerbates the issue further. Choice, although rarely a negative in the world of public policy, might present problems here.
While Buttars raises an important issue about the educational rigor of 12th grade in regards to “senioritis,” cutting senior year will not eradicate the problem; instead, the state should focus on developing ways for the education system to sustain students’ interests throughout all of high school. Buttars believes that students squander their senior years, meaning the state is “spending a whole lot of money for a whole bunch of kids who aren’t getting anything out of that grade.” However, there is nothing intrinsic to the 12th grade that breeds a decline in intellectual curiosity among students; early graduates might just as easily experience an equivalent “junioritis” effect. To address the underlying issue here, the current educational system would benefit from fundamental reform aimed at keeping school meaningful to students throughout their high school careers.
Encouraging students to rush through their high school curricula leads to the crowding out of electives that otherwise would have enriched their education. Electives, whether they be fine arts, music, or home economics courses, are a valuable and traditional aspect of secondary schooling. They often teach students more practical skills and expose them to different methods of learning and classroom interaction. By compressing their graduation requirements into three years, students will be forgoing opportunities to diversify their experiences and capitalize on the full range of options available to them.
Should this measure pass, the state would do well to provide students who exercise the option to graduate early with productive outlets for their time. Facilitating student internships or job experience in place of 12th grade might serve to offset the negative effects of the program. Additionally, schools in Utah must ensure that these students graduate with the same educational qualifications as their peers; their three years of high school should contain as much subject matter as possible.
Ultimately, states should prioritize education even during times of fiscal difficulty. Allowing schools to suffer budget cuts sends an undesirable message to students. In light of this, the Utah legislature must act on other means to remedy their deficit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My friend called me a slut. “A hot slut! A classy slut!” she quickly qualified when she saw my death glare.
I had to wonder how exactly my behavior qualified me as a slut. I don’t have a boyfriend or anything remotely resembling one. I’ve had a handful of intimate encounters and two dates since September. But next to the average Harvard student, I may indeed look slut-like. We frequently bewail our unwilling celibacy and lament the non-existence of our dating culture. Next to the average Boston University, Georgetown, or University of Arizona student, however, this behavior may look positively prudish. Regardless of how I rank overall, the fact remains that we, the students of Harvard, seem to have forgotten that we create our own social and sexual culture, and have no one to blame for it but ourselves.
The complaint that Harvard is a barren wasteland of sexual destitution is not without merit. According to a Crimson survey of the class of 2009, in their four years at Harvard, 52 percent of the students had one or zero sexual partners, and only 28 percent had even one dating partner. Add these statistics to the blogs, studies, and numerous recent articles about how Harvard students can’t get any, and you can’t help but feel bad about your sex life. Harvardfml and d-hall gossip don’t help either.
Luckily, the illusion that everyone else is having more sex than you is not specific to Harvard, so if your neighbor’s all-too-audible Saturday morning romps have got you feeling blue, take heart. “Go Ask Alice!”—Columbia University’s Dear Abby-equivalent—reports that the majority of polled college students also had zero or one sexual partners in a given year, while believing that their peers were having three times as much sex as they were. Other revealing statistics include that 31 percent of U.S. college women are still virgins at graduation and that college male sexual activity is down from 2.1 partners in 2001 to 1.6 partners in 2006.
These stats are comforting until you realize that Harvard is still only at or below the mean. This perhaps indicates that Harvard is indeed a barren wasteland of sexual destitution. Why? “Because you all are so dang hard to get a hold of!” quipped my MIT friend. It’s true. He and I spent two weeks trying to find a time simply to get coffee. Every cancellation and re-schedule had been my fault, because of lab, section, rehearsal, or work. This type of social avoidance and excuse making is distressingly common in our college’s culture. As has been pointed out in all those “Harvard-doesn’t-have-sex” articles, every Harvard student is chronically over-scheduled. What they don’t point out is that we are over-scheduled of our own volition. Everyone puts their work first, believing that in the long run, an on-time Gov 20 paper will be more beneficial than a potentially-awkward date with last Saturday’s hook-up. This generates a society of isolated academia, and we lose sight of the fact that one year from now, that paper’s grade will mean nothing. And that date may have been the start of something really special.
Our social lives and our academic success don’t have to be mutually exclusive, but we have chosen to make it so. Eventually, we’re going to have to realize that it’s okay to postpone finishing that CS 50 problem set in favor of actually going on a date with our boy/girlfriends. That it’s actually normal to not stay in and study on a Saturday night. And how do you know that a date with Saturday’s hook-up will be awkward? You won’t until you give it a try.

Sloane Square is a neatly laid out quadrangle in London’s borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Quiet streets are lined with high fashion labels, and carefully plotted plane trees provide shade and leafy overhead. Hardly, in other words, the place for revolution. It takes some imagination to think that it was here where John Osborne’s “Look Back in Anger” premiered in 1956. Osborne’s play took a harshly realistic look at working class life, marking him as one of several British playwrights and novelists in the late 50s who had grown disillusioned with the way their government was running things. “It’s best to be a rebel so as to show ’em it don’t pay to try to do you down...Factories sweat you to death, labour exchanges talk you to death, insurance and income tax offices milk money from your wage packets and rob you to death,” one book bluntly put it. Publicity materials for Osborne’s play invented a label for the group: they were to be referred to as the “Angry Young Men.”
I’ve jumped an ocean and half a century to bring forward this episode only because it seems so strikingly relevant. In a curious trick of history, the American Tea Party—those who protest Obama’s tax policies by evoking 1773’s colonial steeping of three shiploads of British loose leaf in Boston Harbor—have much in common with their ex-antagonist country’s Angry Young Men. They’re deeply dissatisfied with the status quo. They think (justifiably) that nobody takes them seriously. They lack any theoretically rigorous suggestions. And yet their frustrations point to a real complaint with the way things are being done, one that deserves far deeper engagement than it’s being given.
“Have you not seen pictures of their rallies?” a friend back home asked me. I have; they’re absurd. Like any gathering of the politically discontent, the movement has its share of loonies, guys in tar-and-feather just as happy smearing Obama as handing out Oswald conspiracy pamphlets. But the Tea Party still isn’t just some barmy half-brother of the GOP. Genuine Tea Partiers find much to blame with both major parties; beneath the noise, there’s a serious desire to re-examine the nation’s core values. They’d like to find their way back to those John Wayne-style golden prairies where strength, independence, and cleverness are rewarded, rather than suspected. Surface theatrics aside, the Tea Party is nearly alone in asking serious questions about the meaning of politics in America. After all, it takes a great deal of gravity in one’s mission to confidently employ such public, attention-grabbing techniques.
So how does this play in England? It’s hard to say; across the pond, the movement doesn’t get much press. Of far more interest in the past few weeks has been the Cadbury-Kraft merger, generally accepted as a regrettable, yet inevitable, victory of Yankee spray cheese over Britain’s more discerning palate. America is viewed with a sad indulgence—a nostalgia for the once-upon-a-time when it was an unruly little brother rather than a cold, efficient capitalist machine—even if it did bite the hand that fed it crumpets.
But Brits might fondly recognize in today’s Tea Partiers some of the old colonial intransigence, so oddly like that of their own Young Men. It’s telling that the names of anti-fascist writers like Ayn Rand and George Orwell are so often invoked. In Tea Party eyes, the problem is simple: the U.S. government won’t leave well alone. All they really want is a bit of land and a house, maybe a firearm or two, and certainly the freedom to do as they like (within legal limits) without any civil servant nosing in. And they’re not willing to take any threats to that sitting down.
The Angry Young Men—even if they were just a couple of malcontent writers with a grab-bag of social gripes—ultimately succeeded as a purifying force for Britain. The great kick they aimed at the nation’s too-comfortable posterior helped send it flying into the next, culturally revolutionary decade. As long as the Obama administration apes the Churchill cabinet in continuing to demand sacrifices and a cut of each month’s paycheck without results, there will be a similar reaction—and as the movement this time isn’t quite so literary, there’s no guarantee it will behave quite so well. That’s what the Tea Partiers and the Angry Young Men really share: the desire for some display of humility from a government all too willing to collect our money, and not willing enough to explain just why we should let it run things.
Liberal tendencies notwithstanding, I can’t help but admire the defiance of this opposition and its belief that it’s the principle of standing on one’s own two feet that matters most. In the 1962 British New Wave (and Angry Young Men) classic “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,” based on the book by Alan Sillitoe, Colin Smith is a boy at reformatory whom the director’s primped to win a cross-country race against a nearby prep school. Coming down the last stretch, he’s got a solid lead; no one doubts he’ll win. As he tires, images run through his mind of his bleak life: his harried and shrill mother, his dead father, the cash he swiped from a bakery, the copper who nabbed him, the condescending director who’s dangled the prospect of an Olympic future or at least better treatment in the present. A few yards from the finish line, he stops. A crooked grin spreads over his face. The second-place runner passes him. Life will deal him a hard blow for not compromising with those in charge, but he’ll never be anybody’s blue-eyed boy.

Whenever we hear the word “nuclear,” we think of a tremendous mushroom cloud in a gloomy sky, followed by images of a desolate, uninhabitable, and barren land. For many of us, “nuclear” translates directly into “nuclear weapons.” We should not, however write off “nuclear” so easily, as the same technology used in such devastating weapons offers much potential for positive growth in the energy sector. President Obama acknowledged this possibility when he announced Tuesday that the Energy Department will give an $8.3 billion loan in order to construct two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. Nuclear energy offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels as an energy source, does not produce greenhouse gases, and can help decrease the United States’ carbon footprint. We applaud Obama’s initiative to explore different power sources. Yet, as nuclear energy does produce radioactive waste that is difficult and dangerous to manage, we also encourage Obama to explore other alternative technologies that do not involve radioactive byproducts.
Some people are concerned about the safety of nuclear power plants. To that, we answer that global warming greatly outweighs the nearly infinitesimal risk from the plants. So far, nuclear energy has proven to be remarkably safe as its production has become more computerized and has removed most potential human errors from the equation. The only notable nuclear accident in the United States was the Three Mile Island incident, but no one was injured there. Additionally, the incident was caused by a human error, and such concerns have become obsolete with the latest generation of reactors. However, the president will still have to dispel myths about living near reactors. Accordingly, we encourage the administration to be transparent on the matter of public safety concerning such reactors and to fight unsubstantiated rumors by providing the public with adequate data and any new findings.
Though we commend the president’s effort to encourage new forms of harnessing energy, the nuclear option is not perfect. Most importantly, the problem of nuclear waste merits attention—currently, only 10 percent of the energy contained in nuclear fuel is extracted while the remaining 90 percent is left to decay as a by-product. Even though a federal law passed in 1998 requires the government to create storage spaces for such waste and to move it off-site, most nuclear power plants in the U.S. still store this waste on-site in steel-reinforced cement silos or airtight water-filled pools. However, such storage methods are supposed to be temporary, and many plants have run out of space. Now, the government absolutely must invest in finding new ways to deal with nuclear waste. We suggest that the U.S. collaborate with other nuclear countries—such as France, which has developed a new recycling method that allows the waste to be re-used—in order to develop new techniques to limit the environmental impact of nuclear waste.
While the government’s decision to back two new nuclear reactors shows a commitment to reducing climate change, the technology is a complex one with various drawbacks, and the president should keep an open mind with regard to new technological innovations that might offer a better solution. One such innovation is the nation-wide Smart Grid that is being studied by the Department of Energy. A Smart Grid is expected to be more efficient in delivering electricity and has a smaller environmental impact than conventional methods. We hope such projects continue in tandem with the new nuclear initiative. Until the Smart Grid and other plans come to fruition, maybe nuclear will grow to no longer have such a grim connotation.

To the editors:
Ms. Kimberly N. Meyer’s op-ed piece (“The Audacity of the Voters,” Jan. 27, 2010) aptly describes the growing sense of disillusionment that many voters feel toward our elected leaders in Washington.
She is wrong, however, to lay the blame for this squarely on the doorstep of President Obama and calling for an end to the Democratic Congressional majority in 2010 and the ouster of the president in 2012. This would be no solution to our country’s problems.
Mr. Obama has been president for little over a year. He inherited from his predecessor an economy deep in recession and two costly and ill-managed wars that have done serious damage to our exploding federal deficit. Few American presidents have entered office under such trying circumstances. This makes Ms. Meyers’s defection all the more distressing, especially given that she is a registered Democrat who “vigorously campaigned” for the president.
Ms. Meyers does bring up valid criticisms of the young administration and its congressional allies: Not nearly enough has been done to address an unforgivably high unemployment rate. Health-care legislation—poorly marketed from the beginning—has stalled, and with the election of Scott Brown to the Senate, might not be revived until the end of the year, if at all. Banks and financial companies that played a major role in our economic meltdown have not been regulated effectively and, in some cases, were even allowed to reward their top employees with large bonuses while surviving off the taxpayers’ money. Lobbyists and corporate cash still control the electoral fates of many officials and the Supreme Court’s ill-advised decision to strike down important campaign-finance laws will only worsen the problem.
Yes, Mr. Obama might have bitten off more than he can safely chew in his first year. He seems to have misjudged the appetite of the nation (or at least the Senate) for the change he promised during his campaign. Independent voters have been running for the hills since health-care reform became his administration’s number-one domestic priority, encouraged by the irresponsible cries of “death panels” from once-respectable public servants like Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and the populist anti-rhetoric of Sarah Palin, which veers daily into demagoguery. The 24-hour misinformation spread by Fox News has also been responsible for stoking Americans’ latent anti-government tendencies.
Ms. Meyer, despite her left-wing credentials, seems to have fallen prey to this nonsensical right-wing hysteria, writing that “[t]here are three branches of government, not one. Presently, the executive branch is being ruled by a demigod who wants control of it all.”
Mr. Obama is not a god, demi or otherwise, but a mere politician and must work within the realm of political reality to achieve his goals. In fact, far from attempting an executive take-over of public policy, Mr. Obama has arguably left far too much of the responsibility for enacting his agenda of change in the hands of Congress, leading to protracted and unproductive negotiations on Capital Hill. While Mr. Obama promised change in Washington, he cannot alter the nature of parliamentary democracy, which relies on such wheeling-and-dealing as the legislative pay-off to Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Nebraska) during the health-care negotiations that Ms. Meyer rightly derides. But surely the complete unwillingness of congressional Republicans to cooperate with Mr. Obama is just as despicable. Given the constant Republican threats of filibuster, an increasingly out-of-reach supermajority of 60 Senate seats is now required to pass any kind of progressive legislation.
The Republicans’ cynical delaying tactics are designed to force the Democrats into entering the mid-term elections of 2010 empty-handed. In doing so, the Republicans are assuring a legislative dead-lock at a time when our country desperately needs new ideas and approaches. It seems that substance-less populism and counter-productive anti-government sentiment are in danger of carrying the day, especially if Democrats like Ms. Meyer are already willing to throw their president to the dogs. Does she really believe that the Palins, Boehners and Cantors of the world will deliver more jobs, better health-care and a speedier withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan than Obama can? Change can only be achieved incrementally, and the president’s fiery and inspiring State of the Union—in which he outlined plans for reining in the deficit, improving the economy, and alleviating the unemployment problem—was a step in the right direction. Let it be one of many.

For tips on reducing time wasted chewing, talk to the Harvard-based champions of last Thursday’s Rice and Bean Pot Burrito Eating Contest hosted by Qdoba. Nicknamed “Team Owl” for their final club membership, the quartet of Ryan K. Burke ‘10, Tyler D. Sipprelle ’10, Christian D. Wood ’11, and Daniele M. Pellegrini ’11 claimed victory over teams from Boston University, Boston College and Northeastern—the other schools of the actual Beanpot, a hockey tournament—downing a burrito each for a total time of under 3 minutes and 15 seconds. The prize was a trip to a Mexican or Caribbean destination of the team’s choice.
The competition began on a less intense note, with each college first battling it out locally over a spicy but meatless burrito, complete with Nantucket Nectars. The teams with the fastest times then moved on to the semi-finals and finals at The Paradise Rock Club in Boston. There they faced the same task with a more daunting obstacle: a burrito con carne.
While the eaters may not be competing in Vancouver this winter, they still take their sport and competitors seriously. “I was nervous because I was facing this legendary Northeastern kid; he was kind of the premier burrito eater,” said Burke.
Behind the glory and crushing victory, dedication was key to the team’s success. Qdoba offered free burritos to the trainees, and according to team coach Douglas L. Schadewald ’10, they took full advantage of it. “We’d go to Qdoba once or twice a day,” he said. “We researched different types of techniques.” After many practice runs, they found that the best method was to take two bites of the burrito before dumping the drink on top to make it easier to swallow.
The strategy worked. When the last bite of burrito was gone, Team Owl’s fans crashed the stage and sprayed beer according to Kevin F. Burke ’10, brother of Ryan. “Everyone there hated us. We were truly obnoxious,” he said.

I’ve known my friend (let’s call him “Rubin”) since we were 12 years old. I didn’t want to let him on my parish basketball team because I thought he was a ball hog. Today he goes to school at Brandeis University. We still play basketball recreationally, but neither of us is going pro, though Rubin swore he’d be the first Israeli in the NBA when we were 13.
Brandeis has a free shuttle bus (the Diamond Line) that runs from the school to Harvard Square, Boston, and back. I get on outside Boylston Gate to go to Brandeis, over Rubin’s protests (“Come, of course you should come, I want you to come, but I’m just saying that campus is dead tonight”). It’s the first of Brandeis’ two spring breaks, and many people are home. But Rubin and a few of his roommates are still there. The bus takes maybe half an hour, and you get good views of Fenway, the Citgo sign, the Boston skyline out the back.
I call Rubin once I arrive, and we go to his room. Rubin and I are from the part of Brooklyn that isn’t hipster yet, but it’s feeling the urges, and Rubin has on tight jeans and a white v-neck. His room is below ground in one of the sophomore dorms (you could say the basement) but it’s fantastic, a full lounge with couch and an enormous sound system, single bedrooms sprouting off to the side. Rubin’s own room is filled with music equipment; he’s a music major now, and he’s really good on the piano. He and his roommate Dave are in a band together, and they’re always recording in Rubin’s room. There is an enormous Mac desktop, synthesizers and drum pads, keyboards on the bed.
Everyone starts drinking quickly because we’re going to someone’s friend’s birthday party, and everyone’s almost here, and we’re all going together. So far there are six of us, all guys, and we’re listening to Rubin and James’ new songs: dance-type mix-ups, similar to Girl Talk or Ratatat but more musical, with more training.
We’re on our way to the party, we’re walking up the stairs, we’re outside the door, and it’s strange because it’s pretty quiet. Inside we find more guys, the lights all on, drinking and watching the Olympics. We decide to stay. They offer drinks. At this point it’s midnight, and it has become Valentine’s Day without us noticing. We talk about girls. There’s one, Orli, whom a few of the present company (still all dudes) have been putting the moves on. One took her to the Boston Aquarium (he had free tickets), another out to dinner. Nothing. How does a girl go with you to the Aquarium and then nothing, we cried. I look at Rubin and ask him if she’s good looking. He rolls his eyes.
“Sorta,” he says.
We have our coats on and we’re outside, in a parking lot, on the cement. A block away there’s a circle of heads passing cigarettes around and nodding. Dave begins to beatbox. Rubin begins to rap. The rest of us are dancing. I’m beatboxing. Rubin is good, actually. He was always a performer, even in basketball. Here, Rubin is in his element.
We are walking around campus, all dudes, hands jammed in pockets. There is a castle—built in the ’70s as a dorm—that we head for, to climb to the top. They’d never done it. We’re on the ramparts, and there’s a staircase weaving around the tower. There are turrets. We discuss places where Rubin and Dave can have their first concert: out a window, above the portcullis. This is the realest castle we’ve ever seen. We get as far as we can go, stopped by a wooden door, and the guy who went to reform school gets it open. We’re inside. It’s just a residential hallway and we’re disappointed. But on the edge is another door, one we can’t open. Through the chinks underneath you can see within: the walls are stone, graffiti dragons and gang signs all around.
Outside we lean against the railing, as high up as we can go, Boston’s lights laid out in front of us. Right here, says Dave, this is where we should do it.
We’re back in Rubin’s room, we’re beatboxing some more, there are fliers on all the walls: The Roots’ “Phrenology,” Talib Kweli, “Grindhouse,” “No Country for Old Men,” a fake copy of The New York Times with the headline “Iraq War Ends.” There’s a book on the shelf called “Cinema Now.” We eat crackers and hummus while everyone winds down, and I look at the Clash’s “London Calling” poster, Paul Simonon smashing his guitar.
I’m headed home. The bus goes back to Harvard Square. I feel I haven’t given Brandeis a fair chance: I’ve been there many times before. Rubin and I have played basketball in the gym, seen Nas perform on the same court later that night. They have frat parties that spill happily from upstairs bedrooms to basement dance floors where water pipes slither overhead. Rubin has already reserved my ticket for Pachanga, the greatest dance party of the year—a student newspaper editorial calls it “moderated madness” and likens it to tribal rituals. But often we sit in his below-ground room and turn the lights off, the bass up loud: me sitting on the couch, Rubin on piano, Dave drumming with something or another, me talking about how they’re going to make it big someday, bigger even than NBA stardom. Or else we’ll go to a room somewhere in the castle where they’ll have music on and everyone will bob their heads and bend their knees.

When Bianca A. Verma ’10, captain of Team Quasar, says she plays “Ultimate,” she isn’t kidding. Two weeks ago Red Line and Quasar—the men’s and women’s Ultimate Frisbee A teams for Harvard, respectively—went all the way to Las Vegas to play in the annual “Trouble in Vegas” tournament. Both teams played well, but when the tournament was canceled due to freak rainstorms, they had a chance to show that more than their frisbee game could be ultimate.
Extremely disappointed at their tournament’s abrupt end, the teams soon realized what thousands of tourists, misfit best friends, and Katy Perry have realized before them: when there’s time to kill and nothing of interest for thousands of miles, the bright lights and dark clubs of The Strip beckon.
After checking in to the Tropicana, some members of Red Line played poker in the Excalibur. Later, the teammates each put $6 towards a well-equipped room in Caesar’s Palace where they watched the Super Bowl. “I thought a Jacuzzi bath would be nice,” said Alex Y. Yang ’10, captain of the Red Line team.
As the Nevada sun gave way to Vegas’ famous fluorescent lights, those members of the women’s team over 21 were given wristbands for free beverages in Treasure Island, and some “lost track of time” with a bachelor party in the Luxor. “We felt like we were sort of thrown into the big, bad world in some way,” said Verma. “There were definitely a lot of hangovers, a lot of fun.”
Not to be one-upped by bachelor parties, three players on the men’s team aimed a bit higher. Having set their sights on Vegas’ crown jewel, they waited in an elevator in the Bellagio until they were able to hitch a ride to the 35th floor. From there, they took a service-only elevator to the 36th and finally snuck into a UCSD frisbee party in the Bellagio’s Penthouse Suite.
But, of course, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. “It’s the kind of thing you could never experience in Cambridge because, in the end, well...it’s Cambridge,” said Yang.

A hybrid of a scad of social networking sites, the new Google Buzz is, well, all the buzz among everyone whose lives depend on Gmail (namely, all of us). Buzz, like Facebook and various blogging platforms, enables users to post texts, pictures, videos, or links. The posts can be private or public for all your “followers” and your public Google profile (yes, you have one of those now). Your followers can comment on or “like” your posts. All in the name of merry, modern socializing.
Sounds a lot like the million of sites you already have, right? Well, the nifty thing about Buzz is its integration inside Gmail. Gone are the days where you must agonize about whether or not to create yet another profile on yet another social networking platform, choose a username, find friends, and log in daily (or for some of us, hourly). Buzz, conveniently located just under your inbox, is already there for you to use, love, and procrastinate with. So even though it allows you to do things you are already doing, Buzz, like all things Google, will make your life easier and more efficient.
Perhaps the one defect of Buzz is that it enables virtually anyone you have ever e-mailed to follow you. Needless to say, this could have dire, awkward consequences, especially, say, if you posted a Playboy article before realizing that your TF was following you. Sure, you can “block” followers, but not until after they have started following you. However, this little function can easily be fixed—get to work, Google!
Let’s face it, Google has changed the way we use the Internet. We can’t live without G-chatting our blockmates from a few feet away or Google Mapping the post office down the street. Looking at Google’s track record of success, it seems that Buzz is here to stay.

Like the opening notes of a Logarhythms A Cappella set, the beginning of a night out at MIT was filled with upbeat promise and anticipation. Having only been there briefly  during the fall of my freshman year, I was ready to give the home of the disco dance floor another shot. The allure of science, math, and physics partying called to me.
I recruited two friends to go on this journey across Cambridge. Since my blockmates were otherwise occupied during the three­-day weekend, with a Chinese New Year’s party at the Spee and Valentine’s arrangements, I reconnected with some people from my freshman year dorm. While looking up departure times for the #1 bus, we prepared to embark on an uncertain adventure.
The plan had originally been to contact some friends at MIT and inquire about the events taking place that night. Unfortunately, everyone we talked to was unclear about exactly what would be happening—so we decided to wing it. We were going to a college campus on a Saturday night; the odds, as any math student could tell you, would surely be on our side.
Upon arrival, the first flashy sight that greeted us was a sign advertising Anna’s Taqueria, one of several food establishments located in the MIT Stratton Student Center. Multicolored chalk adorned the entrance to the center, advertising a party sponsored by the International Students Association called iNight. We peeked in to find a venue vaguely reminiscent of the SOCH and decided that the resemblance was too uncanny.
The next stop was a cluster of waterfront fraternities located on Memorial Drive. Expecting music and sick bass beats, we were disappointed by the sound of silence. The only bass resonating from the row of houses came from one that was fully lit, a virtual beacon for those sailing the Charles at night.
After wandering for a bit, we meandered back to the student center and were approached by some of the international students mingling near iNight. They offered both advice and help. We wondered—how could we turn this iNight into an iParty?
Many MIT regulars pointed us toward events on Beacon Street in Boston, where some of their other fraternities were located in brownstones. Since my friends who had been supportive through this ordeal had no interest in venturing into the city, we decided to head home.  Although we had some major setbacks during the night, it was nonetheless fun getting to know the people on campus including a Russian math major who broke us into the computer lab to get house addresses and a posse of sweatpants-clad students who tried to guide us to various festivities.
By no means do I think my experience is representative of a typical night at MIT besides the chance I had to meet some interesting people. I’d heard from others that just the day before, both the main campus and Beacon Street were abuzz with parties. The last time I was there, things were going on all over the place. What my friends and I went through seems like an unlucky case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Home to 27 fraternities, 6 sororities, and an African-American brotherhood called Chocolate City, MIT has an array of social spaces and groups. According to a friend, their frat parties are generally less restricted than some of the final club gatherings at Harvard and there’s a shuttle that connects the frats on main campus and the ones in Boston. It’s been said that MIT students p-set during the week and party during the weekend; nerds know how to throw down like the best of them.
Despite the inclusive social culture there, I recommend having a friend at MIT to guide you around for your first time, so you know where things are happening and what’s going on. Otherwise, you might end up like me, all dressed up with nowhere to Asian glow.

Facebook. Gmail. Facebook. Gmail. Facebook. My.harvard.edu? Gmail.
This is what my browser history typically looks like the night before a paper is due. Or anytime, honestly.
You know the story: it’s 2 a.m., and you’re trying to finish that paper due tomorrow. Or start it. Whatever. Doesn’t matter—you’ll be on Facebook, probably experiencing that gnawing “go-do-something-with-yourself-already!” feeling. But that doesn’t mean you’ll stop clicking links until you somehow end up looking at photo 154 of 835 of you-aren’t-actually-sure-who. Or maybe now you’ll be Buzzing.
I used to feel like I was doing something at least marginally constructive during my Gmail breaks from Facebook. In fact, I still remember that renewed sense of control and eagerness I felt the moment I got my Gmail account 14 months ago—that new school supply high (what, this doesn’t happen to you?).
My inbox is meticulously organized with about 18 of those color-coded labels, and ridiculously long threads are contained within a single line. I won’t lie—looking at an inbox devoid of unread and unclassified messages gives me a small (okay, large) sense of accomplishment. But now with Google Buzz weaseling its way in right under my inbox, I’m getting nervous about social networking paralysis extending to my Gmail life, too.
I’m not so concerned about the privacy issues bloggers have been ranting about—“what if my husband/boss/TF sees that I’ve been sending enough emails to automatically follow my ex/competitor company/that cute boy in section?”—because, despite what you may think after reading the above, I’m actually not too lazy to just edit the settings. And I also know that technically I could just remove Buzz from my Gmail page.
But really, do you think I will? My browser history indicates it’s much more likely that “buzzes” (is this a term yet?) will be joining the ranks of outdated photos and Facebook homepage refreshes that currently dominate my Internet usage. Google Buzz, I’d like you to apologize to my GPA in advance.

Where I come from, dreams go to die. I don’t mean Mordor. That’s where Balrogs go for iron-plated armor. I mean Fresno, California, which was recently ranked by Men’s Health Magazine as the drunkest city in America—this coming off of a 2009 distinction by the Daily Beast as America’s dumbest city.
Take a moment. Let this sink in.
The drunkest, dumbest city in America, the country that non-ironically embraced the Macarena, the country that went wild when one fat guy shed some pounds by eating Subway. The dumbest of all that.
And it’s not like we can blame it on a small application pool. The U.S. is huge. You could fit eight South Koreas in Texas, 2,700 Liechtensteins in California, and like, maybe an Australia and a half in, like, the southern-ish part of, like, most of the country...But I digress, which, incidentally, is a word I’d get shit for using in Fresno.
Before you go judging me and my native brethren for our wet and wilted intellects, perhaps I can do a bit of explaining.
The Fresno metropolitan area, located in California’s Central Valley, is home to over a million people, 90 percent of whom own cows, 10 percent of whom are cows. Not that I’m saying this is a bad thing. Somebody has to grow cows. And unless you’ve got bovine saplings sprouting in your closet, Fresno’s going to have to pick up your slack.
But Fresno pays a price for this. Time spent in the field is time spent out of the library, concert hall, or studio. Fresno’s essential preoccupation with agricultural matters leaves Fresnans few cultural or recreational options. In short: we drink.
In high school, before I discovered alcohol, I spent most nights deciding between doing nothing at my house or driving to the mountains and chucking dirt clods at trees.
Whenever I reveal that I’m from Fresno, people respond in one of three ways.
Some say, “I’m sorry,” which I find both offensive and compassionate. Others say, “Oh,” as in, “Oh, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And some, the worst, those with knowledge of Fresno’s low average IQ and resemblance to Middle America, say, “Oh,” as in, “Oh, you must be an ignorant, god-fearing, war-mongering crazy.”
While such assumptions of ignorance are themselves somewhat ignorant, they’re not entirely unfounded.
Fresno, sitting between Los Angeles and San Francisco, suffers from the most heinous brain drain of any American city. With such satisfying metropolitan alternatives so close by, few people with advanced degrees choose to stay in Fresno. For most, Fresno’s just the place where “that homeless guy once licked my hand” or “where Ron Howard once left his son at the Krispy Kreme” (this is one of the most exciting things ever to happen in Fresno).
From our ivory tower here at Harvard, it’s easy to unsympathetically dismiss or even resent intellectually undeveloped Fresno.
After the 2004 election, Robert Smigel wrote an SNL skit in which Santa Claus brought presents only for the blue states, insisting that Middle America (to which Fresno is party ideologically, if not geographically) was not actually part of the Union and was instead a separate state, “Dumbfuckistan.”
But there is a huge difference between consciously choosing to live in Dumbfuckistan and living in Dumbfuckistan by circumstance. It’s true that Fresno is a sad place intellectually—an ad in our airport says “Welcome to the land of free TV”—but it’s not exactly Fresno’s fault.
It’s easy to understand the value of Matisse when you can sub to Midtown for an afternoon at the MOMA, but Fresno’s only real museum recently closed, leaving no communal cultural outlet for its more than a million potential patrons.
After my first year of college, I found myself frustrated and angry at the ignorance, bigotry and intolerance of my hometown. It felt like Dumbfuckistan, and I counted my lucky stars (four!) at having escaped it. But more time and more exposure to people jumping to conclusions about the Fresno way of life have led me to feel differently.
It’s true that no Fresnan will soon be winning a Nobel, but to judge and despise Fresno for its shortcomings without considering what it struggles against is as ignorant a thing to do as, say, spending $36 million on a minor league baseball stadium (Fresno’s Chuckchansi Park!).
And with that, I’m going for a drink.

In May of 1920, a five-person committee of high-level Harvard administrators, including President A. Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877, began an investigation of students suspected of homosexual acts. The committee, known as “The Court” by its members, went to great lengths to keep these trials a secret, redacting all names and securing all evidence in the University Archives under the title “Secret Court Files, 1920.” This spring, with the development of a play that credits the secret trials as inspiring a “journey behind ivy-covered walls,” it’s difficult not to imagine Lowell rolling in his grave.
On November 21, 2002, Fifteen Minutes magazine published an article by Amit R. Paley ’04, exposing the secret trials Harvard administered to expel students accused of “homsexualism.” Paley first discovered the files regarding the secret court while researching in the University Archives for a different project; with the students’ names redacted, Paley painstaikingly began combing through Freshman Registrar information and old yearbooks in the spring of 2001, trying to piece together an account of the trials.
Though it required several months of diligent research, Paley’s story resulted in a tremendous impact on both the University and national levels, with swarms of news trucks and television interviews becoming a regular presence at The Crimson.
“Once we saw the national reaction, we saw it wasn’t something Amit had just been digging for. It was this huge revelation,” recalls Rachel E. Dry ’04, Paley’s fellow magazine associate editor when the story was written.
FROM SCANDAL TO STAGE
Since then, the national buzz surrounding the scandal has spawned a book, news specials, and most recently, a theatrical production under the working title of “The Harvard Project.” The play, which has already undergone three workshop performances at Manhattan’s East 13th Street Theater, chronicles the lives of Harvard students who were investigated and expelled for “homosexualism” during those clandestine proceedings.
According to Tony A. Speciale, the production’s director and co-writer, he first conceived of “The Harvard Project” when he read an article about the secret trials in Out magazine; as a graduate student at Columbia University at the time, he knew he wanted to do something special with the story.
“I put it on the back shelf, but I knew I wanted to make it a great play,” Speciale recalls.
Co-writer and actor Jess R. Burkle ’06 also realized the episode’s theatrical potential as a freshman at Harvard.
“I remember very distinctly the cover of FM and what it was about and everyone finding it shocking,” Burkle says. “I was like, ‘This is a really great story ripe for dramatic interpretation.’”
But the road to transforming one of the Ivy League’s best-hidden secrets into a factually-sound, modern play has been a challenging and ever-evolving process.  After securing photocopies of the court files from Harvard’s archives, documents—including handwritten notes from the trials—still had to be transcribed. “There were missing pieces, so we looked at the names and tried to create timelines,” Speciale says.
And even with these documents, getting at the hard facts of the trial has remained a struggle.
“The fascinating thing is no one really knows the truth,” says Burkle. “It’s hard to parcel through and get to that kernel of what is true.”
Since relatively little is known about the students involved in the trials, Speciale chose a more atypical route for creating the script. He handed the actors all of the available biographical data about their characters, and began holding two- to three-hour-long improvisation sessions.
“We would video record and capture all this material and transcribe and edit it, and the script grew out of [that process],” said Speciale.
Speciale’s actors doubled as writers, with everyone contributing his share to the play’s development.
“Everyone was responsible for reading it, analyzing it, suggesting cuts, and putting it together.”
In keeping with this unconventional style of playwriting, “The Harvard Project” has included more creative structural elements–having the same actors play both the group of Harvard friends and members of The Court, for example–in an attempt to emphasize different layers of meaning to the audience.
“You have friends that are in close circles and confidantes, and when they are interrogated, those friends become the faces of the court,” said Speciale. “We are playing around with it theatrically, an almost meta-theatrical way of dealing with The Court.”
AN ORGANIC HISTORY
As unique as the collaborative creation of “The Harvard Project” has proven, there is deep concern for staying as true to the historical people and events as possible with the relatively limited information available.
“We’ve been creating characters based on real human beings,” said Speciale. “There is an inherent responsibility and respect for dealing with their lives.”
As a Harvard alum, Burkle feels he has his own unique responsibility to the accuracy of the play.
“We all bring different perspectives, and I put it into context, so we give the truest representation that we have,” he says.
By explaining everything from the timeline of reading period and exams to the significance of Harvard housing, Burkle has served as a firsthand Harvard resource on the project.
“I’m like a dramaturge. A Harvard-turge,” he says.
Burkle also feels that as a graduate of Harvard, he connects in a deeper sense to the kind of pain and shame the expelled students felt. “It is really a privilege to be a graduate of the College,” he says. “Knowing how much I relish it, I can speak to how heartbreaking it must have been for these students.”
But the emotional appeal of the play goes far beyond the Yard. “For an entire generation, people weren’t allowed to be true to themselves and live the lives they wanted, and it is as true today as it was then,” says Burkle. “It has been resonating across the board.”
And while “The Harvard Project” is far from being a finished work, Speciale is very pleased with the responses he has received from audience members.
“People are impressed by the scenes that came out of the improv, and it feels organic and live,” says Speciale. “At least if they are responding in an emotional way, we can fix all the other things.”
With another workshop performance expected next month, the crew of “The Harvard Project” hopes that audiences will soon be cheering on the play along with them.

Pick up the newest issue of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, leaf through the pages, and Sonia S. Dara ’12 will be staring back: sun-tanned, slim, and smiling, with the caption beside her reading, “My Harvard classmates will FLIP when they see this—especially the nerds.”
For this year’s Swimsuit Edition, Sports Illustrated flew their 20 models to different locations arounnd the world for photoshoots—Turkey, the Maldives, Chile. Dara traveled to Rajasthan, the northern state of India where her ancestors lived, and posed in the summer heat of September.
“The photoshoot was incredible,” Sonia recalled on a phone interview from New York, where she is taking a year off to help launch and promote the issue. “I wore roughly 15 different swimsuits out of a rack of 700-plus. I was really nervous, but the Sports Illustrated team made me feel very comfortable and never forced me to wear a swimsuit I felt uneasy about.”
The photos are only the latest in a modeling career that began years before Dara came to college.
“My interest really began when I was 14 years old and realized I was terrible at basketball, volleyball, and every other tall-person sport,” said the Economics concentrator, who stands at 5 feet 11 inches.
Though now touting a resume that also includes work with Vogue India and Neiman Marcus, Dara tries to stay down-to-earth. “She would describe herself as awkward, though. She doesn’t take herself too seriously,” said Santiago Daniño-Beck ’09, Dara’s boyfriend.
Sonia’s usual style isn’t exactly sweat pants, hair tied back, chillin’ with no make up on, but she does proclaim her love for low-maintenance shoes (“I’m a big, big fan of flats”). Her personal style changes depending on the specific day of the week. “For that 10 a.m. Stat 100 class last semester, I would sport a hoodie, jeans, and glasses pretty much every morning,” she said. “But other than those instances, I would like to say my style is sophisticated and put-together, but with a bit of edge.”
So where is this unconventional Harvardian headed? “I’m hoping that with an Economics degree from Harvard, I will be able to find a career that will allow me to combine elements from fashion with business,” she said. But no matter what she does, she can be assured that she’s got her people. “In the end, it is her passion, and she is fulfilling her dream,” said her mother Poornima Dara. “We are part of it, and we are 100 percent behind her.”

My first e-recruiting interview was an abject disaster. My interviewer walked out to get me. We shook hands. We exchanged names. He beckoned me to follow him down the hallway to an office. It was a long hallway, and in my nervousness I was swinging my arms perhaps a bit too aggressively. And so then, all of a sudden, it happened: my naked notepad grazed his wrist, delivering a massive and fatal paper cut. As he fell to the floor gushing blood, his last words in this world were to me: “WHY...couldn’t you have...had a leather folio?”
So that is why I now have a leather folio for my notepad. Yes, I am only going to use it for another week, at most. Yes, every time I flip open its gracefully manicured cover to write down “300 million * 0.25 = 75 million babies,” I look like not only a douche but also a fool. Yes, as it sits on the desk between my interviewer and me, its large gold Harvard logo is an awkward reminder of the only reason I got this interview. Yes, walking around with it is the equivalent of wearing a Harvard backpack to school the day after early decision letters came out. Yes, it has a built-in calculator and pen loop. But people could die.

Sporting a faux-hawk with a red streak, Jerry Tran may not seem like a man people would flock to for serious advice. But the famed pickup artist, who goes by “JT” or “The Asian Playboy,” has revolutionized the “Seduction Community,” an underground network for males seeking to improve their dating capabilities. Last Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association invited JT to speak at an event “Between the (Pickup) Lines.”
The information session went to great lengths to dispel some commonly held beliefs. The Seduction Community, JT claimed, is about more than brutishly picking up a woman for a quickie. Through bootcamps and blogs, JT emphasizes self-improvement techniques and examines social psychology. “He provides the social lubricant for men,” said Wei “Rose” Wang ’13, who along with Ge “Andy” Zhang ’13 organized the event. Moreover, JT stressed, his teachings help Asian men—50 to 75 percent of his clientele—confront the racism they encounter in the dating world.
“Pickup lines do not work,” JT said as he began his presentation. In their place, JT broke down his “ABCs of Attraction” and provided various strategies for approaching women. He assured men, “If you have two balls, you can be good with women.”
In addition to drawing a nice smattering of the Harvard population—Asians, non-Asians, men, women—the event also attracted some from the local “Community.” Envy, as he is known in the seduction world, came to the event after hearing JT speak at the Pick Up Artists Summit this past September. “JT is the man,” he said. “I’m into guys with incredible skills.”
JT claims to have helped CEOs, lawyers, and doctors in addition to the everyday man. He does seem, however, to have a taste for grandeur. Adapting a Genghis Khan quote about the meaning of happiness, he hammers home the importance of physical and mental confidence: “To crush my enemies, to see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women...in my bed!”

Valentine’s Day is the holiday of commitment-phobia. Forced to mime the pitched perfection of a Hallmark card, many couples feel some small measure of doubt and fear along with all the lust and excitement. Is the cozy corner table at Finale’s a little too…well, final? Is the long weekend at the Berkshires a bit too real? Well, Harvard, we have been married to you for a while and always faithfully back in your arms at bedtime, but this past Sunday we too began to squirm a little. It was time to get out.
Tufts at first seemed like a perfect fantasy option, ripe with potential and waiting to spring to life. We had a friend who knew about a party—a big one, with frat-ish people doing keg stands all over the place, and thousands of girls just waiting to slay themselves at our feet the moment they first got a peek at our Harvard gear. After all, isn’t this exactly what happened in high school?  But we would brush away the siren fingers that playfully traced out the H’s on our jackets, knowing that on Valentine’s night, we would accept nothing less than true love.
Here is where a piece jointly written by a male and a female becomes somewhat tricky to navigate. If we seem to imply designs of some weird polygamous tryst, or appear to confuse our own sexualities, please bear with us. This is a bit difficult.
Anyway, we would find him/her somewhere in the haze of college revelry, and it would be love at first sight. That was how our night was going to pan out, no more, no less. Harvard, please forgive us.
The first minor problem came along when we found out that the party had actually been on Saturday night and that tonight our friend was going on a romantic date with his girlfriend. We sat mournfully in our common room where one of our roommates was having something of a singles’ soiree, and we asked everyone present if they had friends who had parties off-campus. At last, as 11 o’clock rolled around, we decided to just go.
Tufts is surprisingly close to Harvard—a $15 cab ride close—and logistically comparable in that it is also a private university with a medium-sized student body of about 5,000. Like most colleges and unlike Harvard, Tufts boasts a robust fraternity and sorority scene. With our hopes high about its Greek nightlife, we journeyed from the desolate, lonely streets of Cambridge to what we hoped would be the buzzing roads of Somerville. We had no idea where we were going, but it was an invigorating feeling to so suddenly recapture—the feeling of being a freshman, of being lost, of having blind hope that the night would absorb us and then spit us out into someplace truly new.
So, bantering in French with our cab driver, we eventually learned that frats were apparently the place to party at Tufts. Throwing all of our faith into the genial man, we soon found ourselves en route to frat row. As we drifted along the empty streets, we heard the muffled hum of what we hoped and prayed might just be Ke$ha. Desperately and sketchily, we leaned out the window and asked (demanded?  Leeringly yelled?) the first collegiate-looking bunch we saw on the street where we could break a move or maybe find a quasi-pseudo-valentine. They pointed—probably just out of fear—to the closest frat house in sight.
With our hopes high and confidence higher, we walked into the foyer. A few guys were playing Beirut in one room while a handful of others were idling by the stairs. The turnout was surprisingly scarce, but we now had a more urgent problem: our friend C. had elusively disappeared into the skimpy pockets of people and become our night’s Waldo.
We began our search in the small room that was serving as a bar. Three girls pirouetted violently on the dance floor while a frazzled frat brother nursed a paper cup. A collection of listless sorority girls loitered in the hallway, coats on as if about to leave. We sauntered past lots of rooms, some with people in them, none with anyone even close to making out. Oddly it reminded us of Revenge of the Nerds.
Suddenly, we glimpsed what distinctly seemed to be a familiar well-trimmed afro disappearing at the crest of the staircase, and we pushed our way through the crowd of three people in hot pursuit.  What fate had grasped C.? Was a fight brewing? Or had it been a feminine grace that had led him upstairs, and had he found true love? He was nowhere to be seen in the upstairs hallway. We began to feel great concern and a twinge of jealousy.
Debates are heated back at Harvard over whether the level of attractiveness goes up or down at other colleges. But all of this meant nothing when we first saw her standing there (again, please cut “us” some slack with the whole POV thing). Aqua-shirt girl— this is what she was wearing—was simply breathtaking. It was an intimidating proposition to approach her, but we mustered the courage to initiate conversation. She was a freshman, studying engineering—a model Tuftette. Her smile itself was everything the young night had promised us; her demeanor, though a bit quiet, was charming and kind. It might have been love. If you were waiting for some torrid climax to this story, here it is.
But just then, her vomiting friend emerged from the bathroom and demanded to be taken home. Also at that exact moment, C. walked in. He was absolutely fine, and we left the party.  Nothing had happened.
To be fair, Tufts made an effort. There was at least one more party there than there was at Harvard. And obviously, it was a poor decision to go out on Valentine’s Day, and for that we acknowledge the inevitability of the night’s outcome. Poor planning and lofty hopes rarely make for a rewarding night out. But then again, just getting out is sometimes rewarding enough.

Yours truly here at 14P had a triple-hitter weekend: while a former (illustrious) chair was carried home, intoxicated and  incapacitated, after a changing of the guard, newer contributors were busy greeting the old in the most scandalous of drunken attempts at lip-locking. Meanwhile, a certain business-oriented chap was frantically conveying his concerns over orientation to a future Cantabridgian, pita-wrapped Greek delicacy in hand all the while. For one special birthday bird, it was the thunder that was chocolate-flavored this year, not the cake, which was instead perfumed with the scent of intoxicating herbs. ‘Girl’ needs to make sure that when she heads to a party with the intention of tracking down some supplements, she doesn’t end up getting dragged out, kicking and screaming, by a freshman. Maybe two touchy-feely foxes kept her company.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s internal risk management services will audit the Undergraduate Council this semester to critique the organization’s current financial practices and to ensure appropriate use of funds.
The University’s Risk Management and Audit Services conduct the examination of the UC every three years in a process that takes about three months. In that vein, this year’s audit did not spring from any circumstantial conditions or allegations of poor fiscal discipline, according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11.
“We don’t expect this to be that controversial of an issue,” Hysen said. “I think it’s nice to have to make sure our financial practices are sound.”
In the UC’s last audit in 2007, the RMAS deemed the organization’s financial procedures “inadequate”—the result of a variety of “high and medium risk issues” that could have led to fraud or misappropriation of funds, according to UC Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11.
Fiscal management practices that sparked concern included the UC’s failure to co-sign checks, retain documents in an organized and systematic fashion, and store files off-site in the event of damage. Another noted deficiency in the 2007 audit was the lack of a memorandum to guide the transition period between outgoing and elected treasurers, according to Paraszczak.
“We have eliminated every problem [from 2007],” he said. “We are trying to express as earnestly as we can how far we’ve come in terms of being transparent and having a system that students can trust.”
Throughout the auditing process, the Finance Committee will focus on ensuring the maintenance of proper documentation and the systematized organization of receipts for every grant issued by the UC, according to FiCom Chair Amanda Lu ’11.
The majority of the UC’s funds—which are primarily from the optional $75 activities fee included on undergraduate term bills every year—go toward funding student group grants, according to Lu. She said that the UC awarded over 1,200 of these grants last year, amounting to about $500,000 in total allocated funds.
The UC is currently funding an unprecedented number of self-initiated projects, Paraszczak said, pointing to recent initiatives such as UC TKTS, which raffles free tickets for campus and local events to the student body, and UC Cameras, which makes camcorders available to undergraduates for personal use.

While the faithful in the Harvard community were receiving ashes on their foreheads in observation of Ash Wednesday, Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker and his wife, Rebecca N. Goldstein spoke on the similarities between  moral communities formed both within and outside of the context of religion.
A crowd of about a hundred attended “Mind-Body Problems: Science, Fiction, and God,” which centered around the release of Goldstein’s newest novel, “36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction.” According to Pinker and Goldstein, the novel straddles both sides of the argument on God’s existence, creating a holistic approach to the question of whether religion is necessary in order to have morality.
According to Pinker, both he and his wife are atheists and also believe in morality. The core of last night’s discussion, as well as the argument of Goldstein’s novel, is an effort to dismantle the idea that morality stems from religion and that without religion, there is no morality.
“You don’t have to believe in God to believe there is morality,” Pinker said.
During  the talk, Goldstein said that belief is not actually central to religion.
Instead, Goldstein said, the community of shared values provided by religion can also exist in atheist communities.
In an interview after the discussion, Pinker said he thinks that fiction can allow those on either side of the debate to understand one another’s arguments.
“A position that might seem intellectually foreign to you, say the way religion seems to an atheist, can be made more comprehensive,” said Pinker. “We can see the world through their eyes, and that’s something that fiction can do.”
Pinker said he still feels that as a psychologist, he has more to understand about the role of religion and morality in society.
“There’s also an interesting scientific problem: why religion is so compelling to so many people from so many cultures,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philip H. Gordon, the U.S. assistant secretary for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said in a lecture at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday that Eastern Europe needs to be better integrated into NATO and the European Union in order to achieve regional stability.
Gordon admitted that attempts to incorporate southeastern Europe into Euro-Atlantic organizations had been “difficult in the past.” But he emphasized that the Obama administration would try to finish “the historic project of trying to bring democracy to the whole of Europe.”
“To fully achieve European and therefore American security, we believe that peace and stability should not only extend across northern and central Europe, but also southeastern Europe,” Gordon said in his speech, called “The Obama Administration’s Vision for Southeastern Europe.”
While he addressed political, social, and economic concerns relating to a variety of Balkan states, Gordon paid particular attention to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Turkey.
“The door to NATO membership is open,” said Gordon, referring to Serbian interests in particular.
Gordon also expressed hope about U.S. relations with Bosnia. He said that though the United States and Bosnia have not been willing to agree on how to move forward, the Obama administration will seek to position Bosnia for future membership in the European Union and NATO.
The lecture drew about 50 audience members—including graduate students, undergraduates, professors, and academic fellows from the Kokkalis Program on Southeastern and East-Central Europe.
“Everything that he said about Bosnia was a little vague, but very good,” said Emir Skokic ’12, who grew up in Bosnia.
Gordon noted in his speech that yesterday marked the second anniversary of Kosovo’s independence: a sign that progress has been made.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has prepared a road map for its departments and centers as they construct the budget for the upcoming fiscal year in the face of an $80 million deficit.
Earlier this month, Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 presented administrative heads of FAS units with a time frame detailing the planning process of the budget for the fiscal year beginning this July. The budget will be finalized by May 30.
Kirwan’s letter dictates that all FAS departments, centers, and tubs submit budget forecasts to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith by the end of February. Between Feb. 28 and March 15, each unit will work with FAS administrative deans and finance analysts to fine tune their respective budgets.
Kirwan calls for a more centralized budgeting process that will place decisions in the hands of FAS finance administrators. In accordance with the “first-dollar principle,” units are being asked to work with FAS administrators to determine “core expenses” and to duly prioritize the units’ restricted resources.
Kirwan’s letter does not define the exact nature of these “core expenses,” choosing to leave interpretation open to the collaborative efforts between the unit, the appropriate divisional dean, and the central Recording Secretary’s Office.
By the end of March, administrators will draw up an estimate of FAS’ total expenses for the fiscal year ending in June 2011 and reevaluate the status of the deficit, which currently stands at $80 million.
Departments will then vie for subventions—unrestricted funds that Smith will distribute to units as he chooses.
In the past year, FAS has undergone a tumultuous budgeting process that included various town hall meetings conducted by Smith, who trumpeted the need for massive “reshaping” to confront a looming $220 million deficit brought on by the financial crisis.
As the financial picture soured in the fall of 2008, Harvard’s endowment fell 22 percent in the span of four months.
University administrators then awaited the endowment payout for the coming fiscal year, but the news from the Corporation—the University’s top governing board—did not materialize until March 2009.
But this spring, budgetary planning for fiscal year 2011 will proceed on a more traditional schedule, given that FAS will be working off of long-standing projections.
In the month following the March 2009 announcement of the payout, Smith projected the 2011 fiscal year budget would see an additional 12 percent decrease in the payout to FAS.
“We are already working collaboratively with departments, centers, and other units of FAS to develop [fiscal year 2011] budgets in line with the guidance issued on February 4,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement on behalf of Kirwan.
Armed with the schedule and tentative projections, department administrators are entering into the early stages of the budgeting process.
“Last year was so unusual of course,” said Sociology Chair Robert J. Sampson. “Hopefully this year will be smoother.”

Harvard University will attempt to sell off a portion of its real estate assets, a type of investment which has suffered serious losses during the past year, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
The University is seeking to divest about $500 million dollars of a real estate portfolio that includes  $2 billion in current assets as well as $3 billion in future commitments.
The value of Harvard’s real estate portfolio fell by over 50 percent in the year ending June 30, 2009, according to the 2009 HMC Endowment Report published in September.
The planned sale would include assets from both current and future obligations and would further reduce the amount of illiquid assets on the University’s books—an effort that has been ongoing for the past year and a half.
According to sources cited in yesterday’s report in the Journal, officials at Harvard grew concerned over real estate and private equity holdings that are difficult to sell and require future cash commitments—the types of holdings that make the University more vulnerable to economic downturns.
During the financial crisis, several media outlets reported that the University scrambled for cash last year and was forced to sell bonds in order to meet operating expenses and pay off older debt.
Harvard and other universities with large endowments have taken several steps to increase liquidity in their endowments. According to the most recent HMC report, the University has added a cash reserve to its policy portfolio—a model for the University’s investment strategy that serves as a baseline against which the actual performance of the endowment is measured.
Reducing the size of the real estate portfolio also improves liquidity, but such sales involve risks as well.
“Recently, the prices available to sell such assets often have been at a sizable discount, and therefore not all announced disinvestments have been completed.” said Chris Cowen, a managing director at Prager, Sealy & Co, referring to Stanford’s recent decision to sell its illiquid assets.
Harvard tried to sell about $1.5 billion in private equity holdings in Dec. 2008, but rejected most bids after garnering lower-than-expected offers, Bloomberg reported last year.

Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent, will address graduates of the College on Senior Class Day, the Senior Class Committee announced yesterday.
An internationally acclaimed journalist with nine Emmys, an Edward R. Murrow award, and six honorary degrees under her belt, Amanpour will speak to the Class of 2010 at Tercentenary Theatre on May 26—the afternoon before the students receive their diplomas at Commencement.
The host of her own CNN program, Amanpour has gained recognition for her hard-hitting coverage on domestic crises like Hurricane Katrina. The fluent speaker of English, Persian, and French has also reported in international war zones such as Afghanistan and the Balkans.
Amanpour is the first female Class Day speaker since Lani C. Guinier ’71, a Clinton nominee for assistant attorney general who delivered the Class Day speech in 1994 and is now a professor at Harvard Law School.
Amanpour joins the ranks of previous Class Day speakers who came from various walks of life. Many past speakers—such as Sacha Baron Cohen, Will Ferrell, and Conan O’Brien ’85—were comedians, while others, like Tim Russert and former President Bill Clinton, came from careers in media or public service.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, the first class marshal, said that Amanpour’s reporting on events that have taken place during the lives of the graduating class—such as the Persian Gulf War and the Rwandan genocide—reverberate especially deeply with the Class of 2010.
“All of these major historical events have defined this generation,” Ayogu said. “I can’t think of a more inspiring collection of viewpoints to bring together in one individual.”
Ayogu said that since yesterday morning’s announcement of Amanpour’s imminent arrival on campus, many students have expressed their approval of the choice.
“I’ve heard from a lot of people who have been really enthused, people who are familiar with major current events,” Ayogu said. “People who are well versed in media are very excited. Other people have been less enthused.”
Detractors, he said, have voiced their preference for President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey as the Class Day speaker.
Several seniors expressed ambivalence about the choice—a sentiment that may stem from a lack of recognition of Amanpour’s name among some individuals.
“I’m not disappointed, but I’m not ecstatic either,” said Rosemary H. Han ’10, who said that she would prefer someone more in the vein of political satirist Stephen Colbert.
“I thought they would have a different mix of people this year,” said Wenna Jia ’10, an inactive Crimson business editor, in reference to Matt Lauer, another television anchor who delivered last year’s Class Day speech.
The announcement of Amanpour’s selection comes after a lengthy process that began in October, when the Class Committee polled seniors to determine which speakers would be feasible to invite to Cambridge.
Ayogu cautioned against judging the quality of a speech by the recognizability of the speaker’s name, recalling the 2008 Class Day speech of Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke ’75, who focused on energy and labor productivity in a speech accompanied by 12 footnotes and 12 references.

Grammy Award winner Wyclef Jean will be presented with the 2010 Artist of the Year award by the Harvard Foundation at the Cultural Rhythms afternoon show on Feb. 27.
Jean, a multi-platinum artist, rose to fame as part of the Fugees, which released its first album, “Blunted on Reality,” in 1994. In 2005, he was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Original Song in a Motion Picture (“Hotel Rwanda”) for his song “Million Voices.”
He has drawn attention recently for his charity work. Jean, who was born in Haiti and founded the Yéle Haiti Foundation in 2005, has worked to help the Haiti recover from the Jan. 12 earthquake, which devastated the small island nation.
“We look for people who have contributed to society more than just their talent in the arts,” said Elizabeth O. Eze ’11, co-director of the Cultural Rhythms afternoon show. “We look for people who have given back.”
Cultural Rhythms, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, is an all-day event that includes an afternoon luncheon. Jean will attend the luncheon and the following 3 p.m. show. Fifteen groups will perform in the afternoon event including the Kuumba Singers, the Harvard Breakers, the Asian American Dance Troupe, and the Harvard Indian Intertribal Dance Troupe. There will also be an evening show, which will not feature the artist of the year.
Cultural Rhythms is “a celebration of the culture,” said Eze.
Jean, who will be presented with a medal during the show, will be joining the ranks of Sharon Stone, Andy Garcia, Will Smith, Matt Damon, Halle Berry, Jackie Chan, Denzel Washington, Salma Hayek, and Herbie Hancock, who have all received the award.
In order to be named as this year’s Artist of the Year, Jean was nominated by participating student groups and Harvard Foundation interns, who submitted candidates’ names to the Harvard Foundation’s director for consideration, Eze said.
This is not the first time Jean has been invited to Harvard’s campus. He was scheduled to perform Nov. 6, 2005, but when the Undergraduate Council was unable to sell enough tickets to finance the event the show was canceled.
Cultural Rhythms provides an opportunity for many of Harvard’s eclectic cultural groups to perform together. There will be a finale following the afternoon show which will bring all the separate performing groups together, according to Kevin X. Liu ’11, the other co-director of Cultural Rhythms.
“This is a very amazing opportunity for all the groups to showcase their talent and their culture to the Harvard community in a unified body,” Liu said.
Student tickets for the afternoon show will cost $12, while tickets to the evening show–which will not feature Jean—will cost $5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of Harvard researchers recently identified a gene that may play a direct role in developing aggressive prostate cancer—a discovery they said could lead to a more accurate technique to test for the disease.
The researchers told The Crimson yesterday that the gene DAB2IP has the potential to serve as a better marker for doctors to predict prostate cancer’s progression, which could translate into more appropriate treatments.
“Though other genes in this pathway have been shown to correlate with [advanced prostate cancer], this gene goes one step farther,” said Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Karen M. Cichowski, who led the study. Cichowski said the gene DAB2IP plays a direct role in causing prostate cancer to spread.
The study—published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine—found a strong correlation between lacking the gene DAB2IP and a higher chance of developing prostate cancer in mice. The scientists’ findings were corroborated when they analyzed the tissue samples of hundreds of prostate cancer patients.
The researchers also identified the pathway causing prostate cancer to metastasize—which involves a protein coded by the gene EZH2. Loss of DAB2IP “liberates” EZH2 to drive downstream metastatic genes, researchers said.
“Understanding how this gene [DAB2IP] regulates metastasis at a deeper level...can ultimately lead to a new step in understanding not just prostate cancer, but how metastasis occurs,” said HMS Professor William C. Hahn ’87, an author of the paper.
Prostate cancer, which affects one in six men, is one of the leading causes of death for men in America, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. If detected early, the cancer is curable, but in its advanced stage it is not.
Early stage prostate cancer can be harmless, and might never present health problems even if untreated. But in some patients, the cancer metastasizes, spreading to other parts of the body and becoming more dangerous.
According to the researchers, doctors cannot accurately predict if a patient’s tumor will remain benign or spread to other tissues.
“There’s a potential problem with both under-treating and over-treating,” Cichowski said.
“You don’t want to do a life-altering procedure if the patient’s cancer would have never progressed,” she added. “At the same time, you don’t want a patient to develop a malignant tumor and die if we could have simply treated [it] more aggressively.”
Both Hahn and Cichowski said they believe that the gene DAB2IP could be an answer to this problem, adding that they hope to see more research devoted to studying the pathway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a student did not get a job through on-campus recruiting last year, Robin Mount, then interim director of the Office of Career Services, helped her put things in perspective.
The student, Mount says, had not realized that the world of e-recruiting is an “interactive contact-sport.” The student had planned to stay at home for the summer, defeated, until Mount helped her develop a strategy and land a “spectacular” job in Washington D.C.
According to Nancy Saunders, an associate director at OCS, Mount has operated both as an administrator and adviser at OCS using three steps: contextualize, strategize, and succeed.
Mount was recently appointed director of the newly created Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities—composed of OCS, the Office of International Programs, and the Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives.
She was the only individual considered for the position, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, because “she’s been a fabulous interim director and that should be rewarded.”
“Bringing these offices together, she was the perfect combination of administrative savvy [and] knowledge of these areas, and we were so impressed with the work that she’s done revitalizing OCS,” Harris says.
Mount served as director of GSAS and Ph.D. advising at OCS for five years before becoming interim director in Sept. 2008.
THE BIGGER PICTURE
According to Saunders, Mount spends time walking around the OCS office at 54 Dunster, talking to students and registering their concerns.
“Even before she became interim director of OCS, Robin’s leadership qualities were recognized in her capacity as GSAS adviser,” Saunders says.
Mount took over as interim director in September 2008 amidst a financial crisis that shook Harvard’s e-recruiting program. The declining number of job opportunities in banking—coupled with growing concern about a perceived lack of support for careers outside of finance—led Mount to try to “[turn] up the volume on diverse career opportunities,” she says.
Mount soon started drop-in hours to better accommodate students who did not want to wait for an appointment, Saunders says. But Mount has focused most on clarifying to students the necessary steps to reach different careers—a practice Mount says she has learned from working with banks and consulting firms.
Harris credited Mount with revitalizing OCS’s web presence and electronic tools and expanding OCS’s offerings to include more than 124 career education programs in an e-mail he wrote announcing her appointment.
Saunders says she believes that Mount will succeed in her new administrative role because of her strategizing abilities, her connection with students, and her tireless devotion to the job.
Mount has a background in both academia and developmental psychology. After working in a Harvard lab researching infant cognition and learning in early development, she earned a doctorate from the Graduate School of Education. She then taught developmental psychology at Wheelock College, where she also served as associate dean of graduate programs, before returning to Harvard as director of GSAS and Ph.D. advising.
“When I got hired to come here, I had never worked in a career office,” Mount says. “But lifespan developmental psychology is about learning and changing over time, which is what careers are about.”
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
Mount says she plans to focus on developing a more holistic approach to organizing opportunities in international study, public service, and research.
This priority is in line with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’s plan to develop research opportunities in the humanities, as well as University President Drew G. Faust’s goal for more students to engage in public service, according to Mount.
Mount says she also hopes to employ the “crystal ball approach” to career advising.
She says that OCS will be working with intellectual leaders among alumni to try to determine what emerging sectors will offer more career opportunities in the future.
According to Mount, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, in a recent visit to OCS, quoted former National Hockey League player Wayne Gretzky: “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”
Mount says the quote can be an analogy for her work.
“We don’t want to help students skate to the puck,” Mount says. “We want to help students skate to where the puck is going to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Valentine’s day dawned cold and cloudy, but smiles were shining among the Harvard Queer Students and Allies board members as they walked together to the Queer Resource Center, rainbow ribbons pinned to bags and jackets, to vote on the organization’s new mission statement.
As part of their efforts to appeal to a broader range of students and help energize the political arm of the organization, the board voted unanimously on Sunday to change their official mission statement to include a broader range of identities, collaborate with other student groups, increase diversity within the QSA, and take political action.
“This isn’t just the QSA coming together, but all the communities we intersect with,” says QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11. “And that could be anyone and everyone on campus who’s concerned with issues of marginalization.”
Chan says that the new mission statement reflects the group’s increased focus on empowering the gay community and other groups on campus to take action on their own terms.
“We want to open a conversation about how these identities affect people’s lives and how they have political implications, whether through legislation or how people treat you when you walk into a coffee shop,” says QSA Co-Chair Christian L. Garland ’10-’11.
FORMING ALLIANCES
In keeping with the goals of expanding the club’s membership, the new mission statement now includes the words “questioning and allied students” in addition to the list of “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students,” which formerly constituted the description of the organization’s membership.
“Having the word ally as part of the mission statement makes it more welcoming to anyone who wants to get more involved in social justice,” says the Women’s Events and Outreach Chair Lena Chen ’09-’10, who has been involved with QSA since her freshmen year in 2005.
She explains that stressing inclusivity in connecting stigmatized groups was important.
“The QSA has always been really good about opening its arms to whoever is interested,” says Chen, who is also a former Crimson magazine writer. “The major transformation over the last few years is that now it has a major political presence.”
A STRONGER POLITICAL IDENTITY
Garland says that one of the group’s new goals is to focus on the link between politics and identity in determining how people from different contexts and backgrounds experience stigmatization.
This is encapsulated in a new clause stating the QSA’s commitment to “the recognition of the marginalization that exists as the result of the intersections of stigmatized identities.”
“When you start considering people’s class, race, gender, gender identity, and social position in Harvard, you’re looking at a lot of political identities at once,” says Garland, a former vice president of the Harvard College Democrats.
Chan says that race and class have a significant impact on how people live in their queer identities.
“It acknowledges that there are a lot more queer people than just gay white guys,” Chen says. “Even if someone is queer-identifying, that’s not their entire identity.”
The new mission statement also includes goals for expansion and collaboration, stating that the QSA “seeks to promote community awareness of and action on the social, socioeconomic, political, educational, and cultural issues surrounding queer identities and sexualities.”
Chan and Garland say they added the words “action” and “socioeconomic” to stress their goal to engage in more political activism involving a wider range of the Harvard community.
Political Co-Chairs Emma Wang ’12 and Lucy C. O’Leary ’12 have developed three new positions and several projects geared toward achieving greater political action. The service chair will work with the Phillips Brooks House Association in the first collaboration between the two groups to create a queer-specific service program in the Boston area.
The campaign coordination chair will organize collaborative projects with other campus groups, and the media and outreach chair will publicize ongoing political events to QSA members.
“The emphasis on outreach the political committee is undertaking reflects a shift in focus for the whole organization,” Wang says.
In addition to creating new positions, the political committee is also working on collaborative projects with other student groups. They are planning Women’s Week with the Radcliffe Union of Students in March and movie screenings with different cultural groups. They are also coordinating this weekend’s IvyQ conference for Ivy League LGBT activists and a progressive soiree with the Harvard Dems later this month.
EXPANDING MEMBER INVOLVEMENT
In keeping with their new political and collaborative goals, QSA is also seeking to increase grassroots activism within the organization.
The final clause of the new statement emphasizes the importance of “membership-driven events and campaigns in collaboration with other groups, organizations, and institutions.”
Chan says that the words “membership-driven” stress a drive for the organization to undertake its efforts from the bottom up rather than the top down.
QSA member Bradley L. Craig ’13 says that the emphasis on membership will help the organization become more adaptive to a variety of projects. The objective is to have membership-driven action based on the different members’ interests, from transgender issues to gender neutral housing.
“I think the new structure enables members to dictate the focus and the motivation behind things that the board does, and that is reflective of the fact that the queer community as a whole does not have a concrete set of needs and concerns,” Craig says.
LOOKING FORWARD
Ryan R. Thoreson ’07, former co-chair of QSA (then known as BGLTSA) and currently on the board of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, says that the new mission statement’s emphasis on inclusivity and collaboration is a step in the right direction for queer activism at Harvard and beyond.
“It reflects a change in the programming and a conscious change to reflect tangible efforts of the QSA and what they’re undertaking on campus,” Thoreson says. “The statement represents concerns and debates that have been happening for years. It’s representative of what people need the QSA to be by reflecting the short-term priorities and longer term evolution of the QSA.”
Chan says he is excited about this increased activity as a sign of gathering momentum for QSA.
“There’s an energetic spirit of change on the board, and everyone’s really dedicated to an inclusive community and being political in all definitions of the word,” he says.
But he says that this is only a first step in QSA’s goals for future years.
“Ultimately, this is really just setting the stage for longer term discussion and deliberation on the strategy for expanding our scope, choosing what’s important to us, and deciding what we’re going to do next.”

Continuing a storied Harvard tradition, four women’s hockey players have been nominated for the 2010 Patty Kazmaier Award, given annually to the best player in collegiate women’s hockey.
Senior Christina Kessler and juniors Kate Buesser, Liza Ryabkina, and Leanna Coskren are among 45 nominees for the award. The list of nominees was released by USA Hockey yesterday.
Kessler, a goaltender, finished her career with the Crimson career wins and shutouts records, as well as the NCAA career save percentage record. The senior held a 9-3-3 record this season before her year was ended with an ACL injury in January, but she still ranks fifth nationally in save percentage (.944) and sixth in goals-against average (1.39).
Buesser, a forward, is Harvard’s leading scorer this season, tallying 33 points on 13 goals and 20 assists. She ranks second among ECAC players with 30 conference points, and stands 19th nationally with 1.22 points per game.
Ryabkina has been an offensive force since returning from a dislocated knee in late November, scoring 11 goals in 18 games. Five of those goals came in the Beanpot, and the winger was named tournament MVP for her efforts. Ryabkina’s four game-winning goals are good for eighth in the country.
Coskren’s 16 points are tops among Crimson defenders, and her 15 conference points are third-best among ECAC blueliners. The majority of Coskren’s offensive production has come on the power play, and she is tied for first in conference play with 10 power-play points. The junior also anchors Harvard’s defense, which ranks second nationally with 1.44 goals allowed per game.
The Kazmaier Award has gone to a Crimson player six times in its 12-year history. A.J. Mleczko ’97-’99, Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 are Harvard’s previous winners, with Botterill taking the trophy twice.
The top 10 finalists for the award will be announced on March 2. The Kazmaier trophy will be presented on March 20 in Minneapolis, Minn. in conjunction with the 2010 NCAA Frozen Four.

Dorothy might say, “There’s no place like home,” but the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash (5-4, 4-2), which lost at its home court to No. 4 Princeton (10-3, 5-1) two weeks ago, hopes there will be “no place like New Haven.”
Tomorrow afternoon at Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the Crimson will have a chance at retribution for the recent loss, as it faces off in a rematch against the Tigers in the quarterfinals of the College Squash Association National Team Championships.
“It’s a great atmosphere down at Yale,” junior Reed Endresen said. “It will be very energetic. Great squash will be played.”
Though Princeton won the first meeting, 7-2, the match was closer than the score indicated.
Harvard won matches at the top two spots, as co-captain Colin West and junior Richard Hill each took home 3-1 victories.
In the number nine spot, the match between Crimson freshman Alexander Ma and Tigers junior Nikhil Seth came down to the wire, with Seth ultimately prevailing in five games.
Though the other matches were not as close, three or fewer points decided 16 of 34 games.
“[It] is a very balanced match,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “This time neither team has a home advantage. If we could win a couple of matches we [lost last time], then the pressure goes on other team and anything could happen.”
“Although Princeton, on paper, is the favorite,” he added.
The Crimson has won a total of 31 CSA Championships since the tournament’s inception, more than any other team, while the Tigers have claimed nine.
Last year, Harvard took home fourth place, and Princeton came in second. No. 1 Trinity won the national title in 2009, extending its Potter Cup championship streak to 11.
The winner of tomorrow’s match will take on the Bantams on Saturday. Due to the nature of tournament play, this game is a must-win for both the Crimson and the Tigers.
“[We’re focusing on] what each player feels they need,” said Bajwa of this week’s training, “and a lot of match-situational play.”
Harvard enters the national tournament after dropping its last two matches—losses to Yale and Princeton, respectively.
The Crimson is 4-2 in Ivy League matches, ending the season right behind the Tigers by finishing third in the league.
Harvard, ranked fifth nationally, has only lost four games this year—coming against teams ranked No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4.
West leads the Crimson with eight victories at the number one position and was the only Harvard player to record a victory against the Bulldogs last weekend, although freshman Zeke Shrel lost in a tight five-gamer and juniors Richard Hill and Eliot Buchanan each won a game.
“We’ve see [Princeton’s] lineup now and we have a little more experience,” Endresen said. “We can go in [to Friday’s match] knowing what to expect…Hopefully we can use that to our advantage.”
The Tigers, whose four-game winning streak ended in a 9-0 loss to Trinity, are coming off a win against Williams. Princeton welcomes the return of junior David Letourneau, who missed the previous matchup against the Crimson due to injury and will play at the number two spot tomorrow afternoon. The Tigers expect the rematch between West and Princeton freshman Todd Harrity, the second and third ranked players in the nation, respectively, to be competitive as well.
“It’s going to be a tough match,” Endresen said. “We need to go in as naturally focused and dedicated as we can [and play with] a lot of heart and intensity…It’s a must win situation if we want to finish in the top five.”
“Everything is done,” Bajwa said. “You get to a point where you [just] hope your best is good enough.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Aisha Price, there is no offseason.
Price, a freshman, competes for both the women’s soccer and water polo teams.  Like most fall athletes, she arrived on campus two weeks earlier than her classmates to begin her training for soccer.  Unlike her teammates, who had a long J-term break to recuperate from a grueling season on the field, Price’s vacation was cut short by two weeks, as she had to leave sunny Hawai’i for icy Cambridge to begin preseason training for water polo.
Price was a strong contributor on a women’s soccer team that finished a nine-win season with an Ivy League championship.  This winter, she has also established herself as a scorer on a Crimson water polo team that has yet to lose a game.
Price’s impressive athletic career began on the soccer fields when she was only three years old.  However, it was not until Punahou High School water polo coach Ken Smith spotted her cannon-like arm during a dodgeball game in a P.E. class in seventh grade that she began playing water polo.
“I noticed two things about her before I even knew her,” Smith recounts.  “One was that she could really throw a ball, and the second was that she was really athletic. And I thought, my gosh, that’s a great combination. If I could ever teach her how to swim, we’d really have something there.”
Smith, who was Price’s homeroom teacher, began hounding her every morning to come to water polo tryouts, and eventually, she gave in.
“I had no idea what water polo was,” Price admits. “[I] never saw it, never heard of it, but during tryouts, I went out finally and fell in love with the sport.”
Her decision to go to tryouts turned out to be a wise one. Price led the Buff N Blu to state titles in both soccer and water polo, and was named the state co-Player of the Year in soccer and the state tournament MVP in water polo her senior year.
Honolulu’s Punahou School is known nationally for its superb athletic program, as well as its most famous alumnus, current U.S. President Barack Obama.
The school’s athletic prowess led to a Sports Illustrated feature recognizing Punahou as the nation’s top high school athletic program, which prominently featured a picture of Price playing water polo.  She even attended her senior prom with Manti Te’o, the Sporting News High School Athlete of the Year in 2008 and a starter on the gridiron for Notre Dame last season.
One of the skills that separates Price from most other soccer players is her remarkably long throw-in, which can reach the far goalpost from the sideline, a distance of almost 40 yards.  This unique talent helped her garner interest from college coaches all over the country.
“It’s a special weapon that no one really has,” says women’s soccer coach Ray Leone.
In the state championship her senior year, Price’s long throw-in contributed to the only goal scored in the game.
“When she graduated, one of the opposing coaches said they were so relieved because they didn’t have to contend with all of those throw-ins any more,” Smith said.
“I might need to buy a machine to replicate [her throw-in]”, Leone jokes. “No one on our team can even remotely throw it as far as her.”
Though her arm strength is always in high demand by both of her coaches, even for someone as gifted as Price, it is impossible for her to be in two places at once. The eight-time letterwinner remembers the stress of getting out of water polo practice and immediately heading to soccer.
“During water polo, I would sprint from the pool, [change], put on my soccer clothes and as I was sprinting down, my mom would have half a sub and my cleats and everything laid out,” Price says.
Both her coaches lament the fact that they are unable to have Price participate in offseason programs because she is always in season for another sport.  The fact that she is able to devote herself to the two sports is indicative of how mature and well-rounded Price is as a freshman.
“She’s kind of the consummate player in the areas of mind, body and spirit, and she embodies all three really well, and that’s why she’s always going to be a success in whatever she does,” Smith says.  “Harvard’s got a good girl there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dropping each of the first two sets by only two points, the Harvard men’s volleyball team still had hopes of mounting a comeback for its first win of the season. But the Crimson was not able to pull through in the final frame, suffering a loss to its fellow Cantabrigians last night.
Despite a strong showing early on, Harvard (0-6) fell hard, 3-0, to MIT (12-4) at duPont Gymnasium.
“The first two sets, we were right in it with them,” said sophomore outside hitter Matt Jones, who had five kills and a block. “We had some opportunities at the end and we just couldn’t follow through to get the clutch points.”
The first set saw plenty of action from start to finish.
Except for a four-point deficit mid-set, the Crimson battled hard against the Engineers’ tough lineup and kept the score very tight.
With a kill by co-captain Erik Kuld, Harvard tied the score at 29, and it seemed as though the Crimson’s momentum would carry it through to a victory.
But a kill from MIT co-captain Mike Demyttenaere and an attack error by Harvard resulted in a tough loss, 31-29.
The second set also showed promise. Sophomore middle blocker Nikola Ivica brought the Crimson back from behind with a seven-point service run, but the team ultimately could not hold on for the win, and it dropped the set, 30-28.
“We showed some fortitude in being able to come back,” said co-captain outside hitter Gil Weintraub. “But it’s really tough to come from behind the entire game.”
In the third set, a different rotation of players took the court.
“We’re trying different lineups,” Weintraub said. “We’re working with a very depleted roster, and so people are playing in different positions.”
Despite the change, Harvard lost the third set to the Engineers, 30-19.
Harvard second-year coach Brian Baise noted the large impact injuries have had on the Crimson’s rocky start to the season.
“Four of our six players are playing out of position,” Baise said. “They haven’t practiced or trained to play there. It’s essentially starting from scratch.”
Having sprained both ankles four weeks ago, freshman Paul Glootz is just starting to practice with the team again. Also injured is middle blocker Soren Rosier. A dislocated shoulder has kept Rosier on the bench for the past two weeks.
Junior middle blocker Shaun Mansour will be out for the entire season, the result of a torn ACL sustained during fall training.
“When things don’t go well, we don’t have anyone to turn to or a lineup to change,” Baise said.
Despite its heavily-depleted roster, Harvard’s team showed flashes of potential.
Co-captain outside hitter Erik Kuld had a strong showing with a team-high 16 kills on the night. Weintraub also played well, demonstrating his versatility with 10 kills and 12 assists.
Freshman setter Rob Lothman had 26 assists against the Engineers, key in helping his hitters to get the kill.
In addition to his key service run, Ivica contributed four blocks and six kills.
“The team is playing extremely hard,” Baise said. “Their morale given the challenges is good—they’re determined.”
Weintraub reflected the positive attitude in his thoughts on the Crimson’s next match against UC Santa Barbara.
“Each match is an opportunity to change what’s happening and start anew,” Weintraub said. “We’re hoping to start with this game to pick up the pieces and start playing ball.”
Jones echoed the optimism in his hopes for the rest of the season.
“We just have to win those clutch points down the stretch and establish a tone of winning to get us back on track,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing a storied Harvard tradition, four women’s hockey players have been nominated for the 2010 Patty Kazmaier Award, given annually to the best player in collegiate women’s hockey.
Senior Christina Kessler and juniors Kate Buesser, Liza Ryabkina, and Leanna Coskren are among 45 nominees for the award. The list of nominees was released by USA Hockey today.
Kessler, a goaltender, finished her career with the Crimson career wins and shutouts records, as well as the NCAA career save percentage record. The senior held a 9-3-3 record this season before her year was ended with an ACL injury in January, but she still ranks fifth nationally in save percentage (.944) and sixth in goals-against average (1.39).
Buesser, a forward, is Harvard’s leading scorer this season, tallying 33 points on 13 goals and 20 assists. She ranks second among ECAC players with 30 conference points, and stands 19th nationally with 1.22 points per game.
Ryabkina has been an offensive force since returning from a dislocated knee in late November, scoring 11 goals in 18 games. Five of those goals came in the Beanpot, and the winger was named tournament MVP for her efforts. Ryabkina’s four game-winning goals are good for eighth in the country.
Coskren’s 16 points are tops among Crimson defenders, and her 15 conference points are third-best among ECAC blueliners. The majority of Coskren’s offensive production has come on the power play, and she is tied for first in conference play with 10 power-play points. The junior also anchors Harvard’s defense, which ranks second nationally with 1.44 goals allowed per game.
The Kazmaier Award has gone to a Crimson player six times in its 12-year history. A.J. Mleczko ’97-’99, Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 are Harvard’s previous winners, with Botterill taking the trophy twice.
The top 10 finalists for the award will be announced on March 2. The Kazmaier trophy will be presented on March 20 in Minneapolis, Minn. in conjunction with the 2010 NCAA Frozen Four.

Last Wednesday evening, Mather’s dining hall was host to lines of Eleganza model hopefuls awaiting their turn to audition for Black C.A.S.T.’s 16th annual show. One by one, the models disappeared behind the closed doors of the private dining room to face the judgement of the show’s producers. FM’s Roving Reporter wove through the crowd of high-heeled beauties and well-dressed men to find out just what brought them all here, apart from a shared love of self-exhibition and Prada.
Angelica J. Cristello ’12, Leverett, Auditioning ModelAlexandria Rengifo ’11, Dunster, Auditioning Model
RR: Why are you auditioning?
AJC: Well, we’re both veterans. We did it last year, and it was an awesome social experience, probably one of the best choices I made socially.
AR: It’s like really one big family; it’s a lot of fun. It’s theatrical, there are a lot of different components to it, so it’s fun to do.
AJC: Yeah, it doesn’t feel like...
AR and AJC in unison: Work!
RR: Do you still spend time with the people you modeled with?
(They point at each other)
AJC: I met her through Eleganza and she’s like one of my best friends.
RR: What’s your gameplan going into the auditions?
AR: Rock it, I dunno.
AJC: Yeah, fierce!
Alexandria Rengifo ’11, after her audition.
RR: How did it go?
AR: It went okay. I just haven’t walked in a while, so I always get nervous.
RR: What did you have to do?
AR: Just walk down, pose, come back, pose, walk back, pose.
RR: What was your song?
AR: “Bad Romance.”
RR: Why did you pick it?
AR: I just like the beat. I thought it would be fun to walk down to because it’s just like really steady. Um, “rah rah rah rah rah,” yeah.
Ross P. Ford ’12, Winthrop, Auditioning ModelAnneika M. Verghese ’12, Eliot, Auditioning Model
RR: What made you decide to audition?
RPF: My good friend right here (puts arm around Anneika), she made sure I came along.
RR: So you’ve done it before, I take it?
AMV: No, I just thought it would be fun to watch Ross get dressed up in cowboy boots and come on over.
RR: Do you think that you’re stylish or just made to be a model?
RPF: I’d say neither, but willing to try.
Jessica N. Buck ’12, Adams, Eleganza Publicity Associate
RR: How long have you been working with Eleganza?
JNB: This is my first year, so I joined around October.
RR: And why aren’t you modeling?
JNB: Um, I don’t know. I love being behind the computer and getting everybody else excited about it and learning about what the theme is and everything.
RR: Your posters advertise for those who are thin and fit, but then on Facebook it says, “All sizes welcome.” What are you looking for?
JNB: Well, I don’t think our posters try to target the thin and sexy. We try to emphasize the fact that Eleganze brings people from all different cultures, bodies, shapes, and types.
RR: Is there a theme this year?
JNB: There is, but we’re going to keep that secret.
Vidal U. Ekechukwu ’12, Leverett, Auditioning Model
RR: Say you’re on “America’s Next Top Model”, and I’m your judge. How are you going to sell your stuff?
VUE: Put, I guess, as much of my personality into it. It sounds kind of generic, but I’m not really flashy or over the top or anything.
RR: Can we see you walk?
(He walks)
RR: Did that have your personality in it?
VUE: I don’t know, maybe that’s a little cockier than I really am in real life.

You may have heard rumors from the Environmental Action Committee that green is the new crimson, but you’ll look like a fool if you wear either crimson or green to the upcoming men’s basketball games. (Well, if you wear green you’ll just look like an awkwardly misdirected Dartmouth fan). Turns out that the new crimson is...black and white.
If you're psyched to cheer your brains out at the next game, start with a trip to your closet. According to Kai-Cheng Ho ’10 on this Facebook event page, the upcoming Cornell and Columbia games will have pretty snazzy dress codes: white and black for Cornell and "Black Out" for Columbia.
Ho concludes with the following words of wisdom: “We're going to create a uniformed 'Sixth Man' section. Don't be that 'guy.' Trust me. You don't want to feel left out and dress completely different than everybody else.”
You heard the man. Forget all that crimson nonsense and pretend you're in a black-and-white film for a few hours. You'll be so classy, the opposing teams won't stand a chance.
This plan was cooked up by a passionate group of juniors and seniors who have taken it upon themselves to transform the student section at men’s basketball games into a giant mass of supporting fans.
Due to their Facebook-event-heard-round-the-world, tickets for the recent basketball games against Princeton and Penn were in such high demand that students had to register for them online days in advance. (You should check out the group even if it's just to read the moving thank-you note for the crowd’s cheering at the devastatingly close Princeton game. It’s worth it.)
All this fan frenzy started with intense Facebook pep-talks that urged students to become the “sixth man” (the “non-starter off the bench that contributes to the team's success,” according to the event description). Ho and crew then brought a massive whiteboard to the gym, displaying cheers for the crowd to chant—many of which involved highly nuanced jabs at players on the opposing team. What’s more, they coordinated gimmicks like passing out newspapers for students to "read" while the rival team’s starting lineup was announced.
Wish you’d been there?  You’re in luck! The contagious energy of the powerful “I Believe That We Will Win” chant from the Princeton game was captured on video for your viewing pleasure.

Porn.
Regardless of your opinion, dropping it in conversation will always provoke a reaction.
This was evident in a heated e-mail chain that circulated on the Cabot-open mailing list early Tuesday morning. Titled "Is there a right to watch porn?", the thread debated the moral, ethical, and economic grounds of pornography. We've got a run-down on the action for you.
The Yeas:
"Pornography is protected under freedom of speech. And since someone raised the question of whether there is a right to watch pornography, I feel compelled to ask the following: Do people have the right to impose their religious or moral beliefs by requiring that able-minded adults do not watch pornography?"
Props for knowing what's up legally.
The Nays:
"Sure, people have the right to do what they want in the privacy of their own home. But people who watch porn are absolutely contributing to sexual exploitation of men and women, endangering others' health, and perpetuating unrealistic expectations about male and female bodies, sex, and relationships that have very real consequences on how real people interact with and treat others in society."
Word.
The "Pressing" Question:
"If God didn't want us to watch porn, why did he permit computer geeks to invent private browsing?"
Well, Sarah Palin wonders: "If God had not intended for us to eat animals, how come He made them out of meat?"
The Hits-Below-the-Belt Comment:
"Can I just raucously LOL at this thread? Or would that be immature?"
Amen.

While these days he might not be as well-known as Justin Timberlake, another Grammy-winning musician will be gracing Harvard with his presence this month. Wyclef Jean, who earned his fame as part of the hip-hop trio The Fugees, has been chosen as the Cultural Rhythms 2010 Artist of the Year.
The award, which is given annually by the Harvard Foundation, will be presented to Jean at the afternoon performance of the Cultural Rhythms show on Feb. 27.
Jean, who was born in Haiti and founded the Yéle Haiti Foundation in 2005, has recently gained attention for his extensive involvement in the Haiti earthquake relief effort.
If you saw this video and assumed the recipient of this year's award would be Mel Gibson...well, we can now tell you with certainty that he will not be the 2010 Artist of the Year.  This, in case you were wondering, was the official Cultural Rhythms video.
Cultural Rhythms, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, is an all-day event. Jean will attend the afternoon luncheon and the following 3 p.m. show. Fifteen groups will perform at the afternoon event, including the Kuumba Singers, Harvard Breakers, Asian American Dance Troupe, and Harvard Indian Intertribal Dance Troupe. There will also be an evening show, but Jean won't be around for that one.
