After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’m sorry I can’t make section today,” I thumbed into my phone, four minutes before class was due to start. “Painting outdoors at this time is difficult because it’s sunrise here and the light keeps changing, and on top of that it’s currently raining,” I explained. “Can I do the painting later?”
The email whizzed off. I made coffee and looked out the window. The droplets were mistier now, and the sun had almost wiped out the baby-pink streaks of dawn with fully-fledged rays. Maybe I should just get through the work now, rather than have the task (“Studio Assignment #8”) sit on my mind for the next few days. My teaching fellow pinged me back, consenting to my absence from class. I deliberated, gathered my brushes in the name of anti-procrastination, and propped a gessoed canvas up in the backyard.
Ten minutes into tracing the edges of three empty pots in the crusted vegetable garden, I remembered that section was still happening over Zoom. Should I dial in? The inertia of my solitude groaned somewhere inside my body. I thought about the feeling of surveilling and being surveilled by pixelated classmates, and went on mixing paint.
***
After we’d been sent home in the middle of the semester, the teaching staff had done their best to keep our painting studio class edifying and enjoyable. Four days into my quarantine at home, a large square package reached my door containing four canvases, paper, oil paints, gesso, solvent, and extra brushes. I found the receipt in the box, realized how much they’d spent on me, and felt tired.
This is the first painting class I’ve taken. After an email notified us to leave campus, I rolled up my splotchy paintings in my suitcase, worrying that this gratifying experiment had met its end. Being physically splintered apart could twist this studio class so completely that, even with a personal tub of gesso mailed to my door, it was over.
In the past month, our painting section had morphed from studio time to breakout room discussions of each other’s photographed work. This week was actually unusual in that we’d attempt to return to live painting, and to evoke the coworking space that we’d had before.
I like having routines that slowly slide me out of solitude. The act of walking to class listening to music or coaxing the key out of the door gets me ready for public spaces, for giving and receiving attention. It’s like the feeling of grinding coffee in your pajamas, the beans nudging your dozing nose awake for another day of breathing. I dread the cold-water shock of joining group calls; the sudden surveillance of a webcam is too rude. The thought of dialing into section 15 minutes late was too weary to entertain, until guilt took over and I picked up my phone.
***
I get a similar feeling whenever I click on the link to attend my English seminar. I love this class, and the way it feels like a book club, but it now requires 3:52 a.m. alarms (noon in Boston is four in the morning in New Zealand) and focusing my straggling attention on flat little people in flat little boxes on my screen for two and a half hours. I’ll watch my professor explain some line from “Effi Briest” and imagine how he feels, trying to figure out if the 23 muted faces, eyes directed somewhere unknowable, are understanding your take on the merits of Mr. and Mrs. Briest’s parenting style. I imagine not getting any feedback from the usual shuffling feet or subtle eyebrow crinkles, and wondering whether the internet connection might have broken during a critical pedagogical moment.
Now he’s joking about people tuning out, and I anxiously raise my eyebrows at the computer — attentively, I hope — to stem the virtual awkwardness. Look, someone is paying attention to you!
I’m not such an eager student in other classes. The first week I had my video on in my quantum lecture. Only one other person did. I committed, stubbornly, to keeping the camera on. The norms for virtual attention were still malleable, I thought, and I didn’t want the professor to feel abandoned by default.
By the second week, I’d quickly learned that I was not influential enough to change virtual classroom norms, and the administrators had decided to change the grading status of all classes to a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory system anyway. I switched the camera off, rolled out my yoga mat, and spent lecture stretching on the floor. Barely listening, I played a round of minigolf on my phone with a friend, thinking absent-mindedly about how all the difficulties of the game were missing in its digital manifestation — you didn’t have to remind yourself to use the right power, swing your arms just enough, or maintain the perfect angle. Everything had lost its physicality recently; minigolf was just another example.
If I looked up from my screens, I’d become distracted by the immense dimensionality that exists in the physical environment. Reflections in a fork! Puckered leaves on a basil plant! Does anyone else ever think about throwing their laptop into the bushes and running away from a life of pixels?
At the end of the class, I unmuted myself. In my best casually-enthusiastic voice I projected “Thank you!” into the microphone and left as quickly as possible.
***
Virtual socializing has its intimacies. I no longer meet people in neutral public settings in which we follow the norms of being a guest in a third space. No more coffee catch-ups where jazzy café music and indifferent baristas subconsciously prompt us towards a familiar mode of public behavior. Now, we exclusively show up in our homes, implicitly giving every single person we meet a tour of our most private spaces. I see nice headphones and cats walking across keyboards. They see the titles on my bookshelf and the dramatically green desk my dad bought me in high school. Professors and acquaintances can read my space, deduce that I’m messy. My sister bursts in to call me to dinner, even though I texted her that I was on an important call.
Public and private have inverted, and finally melted together.
What are the new norms we’re establishing? How are we behaving now?
Before COVID-19 really hit, I was scheduled to participate in some informational visits to various organizations in the Bay Area. Now, instead of seeing industry leaders lecturing in their offices, I saw the family photos on their coffee tables. One prominent researcher apologized for the presence of an absurdly massive panda floatie propped behind his shoulder; he was using it to block the sun’s glare through the window.
It would have been so easy to take a screenshot of him and his inflatable panda with the creepy eyes — that’s the thing with digital interactions, you never know which of your footprints others are keeping — but it felt like he was investing in us an unanticipated trust, and I didn’t want to fracture the intimacy of our understanding.
There’s a specific angle that I never used to see people from — throat-first, upward-tilted. Now I see those tipped, exposed faces all the time from the fixed viewpoint of the webcam. It’s accentuated by furrowed brows as people look for the unmute button, blurred cheeks as they hurry through their living room. I never asked for this particular intimacy from others, nor did they ask for mine. It just fell on us.
***
Some days I love the limited interactions and the focused, quiet lifestyle I’m developing. I don’t have to engage in a social performance if I’d rather curl up in my thoughts. Other days I crave running into a friend at Peet’s and chatting about an upcoming concert, and I can’t quite stomach how different virtual conversations are from those accidental hellos. I plead with my brain to forget about that for a few months.
Often, I only recognize how introverted I’m feeling when I am actually confronted with the online interaction I’ve been indecisive about.
When I virtually entered the painting class, I sensed tranquility. No one was speaking. Some people had their microphone and their video off. My shoulders loosened.
I settled down and scraped burnt umber and ultramarine blue together with a palette knife as my classmates worked quietly, moving across my phone screen. It’s funny how a single sun can manifest as late afternoon rays on some pixelated faces and, at the same instant, as a feeble morning glow on others who haven’t quite reached that point in the day yet. A cricket chirped somewhere in cyberspace, and I heard it.
In retrospect, perhaps I should have known that this class would not exhaust my attention in the same punishing way that others tended to. We were gathered online to work alone.
“I wanted to ask something about lecture,” another senior began. My professor gave her the go-ahead. “Abstract Expressionism” —  this was the topic of his most recent lecture — “is often the movement that people point to when they talk of the moment that art became pretentious. People don’t look at Renaissance paintings and say that, really. What is your response to that?”
Wind rustled through a tree somewhere in San Diego. Solvent swished in Cambridge. I dabbed at my canvas with a caked paper towel, agreeing with her in my head. My professor mused on the question, said she was broadly right about that impression, aahed a bit about his opinion, and asked the teaching fellow for hers. She, too, seemed uncertain. “It’s hard to justify making anything,” she said finally. It spoke to a feeling of pointlessness that tinged my humdrum days in isolation, and yet it was a reassuring comment. I’d found solace in making things — buttercream macarons, portraits of my sister, fragments of writing — to stave off that nihilistic feeling, and although I still couldn’t quite justify these activities, maybe that didn’t matter either.
Amid the ebb and flow of sighs and swishes and occasional questions, I would find inspiration in one sound or another, each pulling me into a new well of thought. I floated in the pools in my head, without feeling the usual obligation to climb out of the water and begin the effort of camouflaging the gap between this effortless existence and The Normal Class Experience We Should Be Having using attentive-looking smiles and thumbs-up emojis.
We were hearing, feeling, painting together. A shared experience consolidated in virtual snippets of reality and unexpected abstractions, rather than the physical space of the studio.
I unfolded my legs and turned off the microphone and camera on my phone, then went inside to make a snack. As I stared at the closed blinds of the kitchen window, munching on a peanut butter and banana sandwich, birdsong emanated from the phone in my pocket. It sounded like someone was dialing in from a forest. I didn’t check to see who, just contentedly let another reality fill my ears. So many guessing games, so many unknowns — opportunities for speculation hide in every corner of a virtual interaction. Perhaps the birdsong broadcaster was unaware that they had their microphone on, or maybe they knew perfectly well that they’d set off ten different trains of thought (about blue jays or avian migration patterns or something else) chugging around the world. Maybe someone did suspect that I’d abandoned painting in favor of eating in the middle of class.
The professor’s keyboard clacked. The cyber cricket crooned, and the birds went on. I stood at the kitchen sink, letting the sounds from other people’s realities fill my own, become my own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the United States Department of Education continues to delegitimize victims of sexual violence, Harvard will need to step up more than ever.
On Wednesday, the Department of Education released new rules for the enforcement of Title IX — a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions that receive federal funding. In a radical departure from Obama-era guidelines, these new regulations restrict the definition of sexual misconduct, require schools to cross-examine alleged victims when investigating sexual misconduct allegations, and prohibit schools from investigating sexual assault claims that occur at off-campus locations outside of their control. This last change effectively ties Harvard’s hands in investigating misconduct occurring in social settings like final clubs, though a stunning 2016 report found that 47 percent of senior women who associated with these spaces experienced nonconsensual sexual contact.
The effect these changes will have on sexual misconduct reporting is chilling. Redefining sexual assault as “unwelcome conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” is a move that inevitably takes agency away from alleged sexual misconduct victims. Why force a victim to endure abuse long enough for it to become pervasive, and dire enough for it to become severe, before their Title IX complaint is considered valid?
We also worry about what sort of behavior the Trump administration, whose figurehead has written off his own bragging about sexual assault as “locker room talk,” would define as “objectively offensive.”
By requiring a higher severity of sexual offense to be committed before formal action can be taken and removing victim protections, these new stipulations make a flawed system much worse. Raising the barrier to entry for investigations into sexual assault claims, when many victims already do not trust the institution enough to come forward, will only serve to exacerbate the underreporting of sexual misconduct. To make matters yet worse, alleged victims will be cross-examined and allegations made in sexual misconduct cases may now be freely and publicly discussed by both parties, opening the door to the interrogation and intimidation of survivors.
We call on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to publicly condemn these regulations and to champion survivors' rights in Washington, D.C., as he has done before in opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration reforms. Harvard must use its institutional heft against these changes, which threaten the safety of many students at Harvard as well as on other campuses. This is not a fringe issue. As of 2019, one-third of Harvard undergraduate women said they experienced nonconsensual sexual contact. To fail to strongly combat these changes to how sexual assault is handled — changes Bacow agrees work against victims — would be to let students down. Further, we urge President Bacow to work with the Office of the General Counsel to circumvent and challenge how these regulations will be implemented on our campus as much as legally possible.
These changes to how sexual assault cases are handled will inevitably affect student life. Students who have experienced unwelcome sexual contact at a final club who can no longer have their complaints investigated by the Title IX office, which is far more accessible than a police station, may feel deterred from accessing resources to cope with their trauma. Fearing interrogation and the emotional toll likely associated, many victims may also choose to not report.
In response, the University should work independently to increase the availability of education, prevention, and support resources outside of Title IX proceedings. We urge Harvard to better train tutors and proctors to navigate issues of sexual misconduct and become trusted resources and advocates for survivors in light of Title IX’s gutting. The University should also continue to highlight and expand counseling for victims of sexual harassment and assault, including through RESPONSE peer counseling and Counseling and Mental Health Services, and work to improve preventative measures.
Harvard must also, as soon as possible, clarify to students and other affiliates how the new Title IX rules change existing policies and procedures. We call on the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response alongside President Bacow to outline the policy for affiliates in a clear and direct email. Students need to know what these changes mean for them.
These regulations may be the final word from the Department of Education, but their implications on campus have not been fully realized. As the Trump administration implements policies that harm sexual assault survivors, we need a University President that fiercely defends survivors’ rights and invests in sexual assault prevention, education, and counseling for all students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is prohibiting all University-related domestic and international travel until further notice, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email to affiliates Monday.
“This applies to all community members—students, faculty, staff, postdoctoral fellows, and other academics,” they wrote.
Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen announced on April 7 that non-essential domestic air travel and all University-related international travel was prohibited through at least May 31. They also barred all Harvard-organized and Harvard-funded international travel scheduled between April 7 and August 31.
Noting that travel “increases the risk of exposure to the coronavirus for you and your community,” the three administrators wrote that the travel guidelines are based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of State’s travel warnings and advisories.
“Harvard bases its travel guidance on a variety of factors, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Global Level 3 Warning – Avoid Non-Essential Travel, the U.S. State Department’s Global Level 4 Health Advisory – Do Not Travel, and the CDC’s recommendation against domestic travel,” they wrote. “Governments worldwide have issued similar warnings and entry restrictions, which can change without advance notice.”
Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen will continue to adjust University-wide travel guidance as the public health situation and various government travel advisories change, they added.
Harvard is also strongly discouraging personal travel, domestically and internationally, with the exception of individuals who stayed on campus after Spring Recess and will return home before the end of the spring semester.
People who do choose to travel should abide by local public health guidelines, Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen wrote, washing their hands and following local quarantine guidance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sprinting across the baseline, sophomore Brian Shi desperately stretched out his arm. A crisp pop resounded throughout the Murr Center as his racket made clean contact with the ball and sent it spinning over the net, just out of his opponent’s reach. He fell to the court, soon greeted by his whooping and cheering teammates as the Harvard (11-1, 1-1 Ivy League) men’s tennis team clinched a 4-3 victory over a strong Northwestern (8-5, 0-1 Big Ten) squad. Two weeks prior, Shi had closely battled the former No. 1 male college tennis player, All-American, and current world No. 59 Cameron Norrie in the professional New York Open tournament, falling 5-7, 3-6. After this victory over Northwestern and a defeat of Boston University on the same weekend, the Crimson moved up to No. 11 in the Division I rankings, the team’s highest ranking since 1998 and its third-highest ranking in history. This would be the final spot for Harvard mens’ tennis before the rest of the season was cancelled due to the coronavirus.
Harvard is led by Shi and a slew of accomplished and capable upperclassmen such as junior Robert Wrzesinski and captain Galen Lee. In addition to the experienced aces of Harvard tennis, a large part of the team’s historic year has come from the rackets of the current batch of first-years Ronan Jachuck, Henry von der Schulenburg, and Alan Yim. With all three freshmen in the starting lineup, the Crimson had gotten off to a nearly perfect start. The cancellation of all Ivy League sports mid-season ensured that the tennis team would not be able to fulfill its potential this year, but the young stars nevertheless showed that they will be a force to be reckoned with going forward.
“The underclassmen really picked it up,” Shi said. “Making that transition [to the tennis team and college in general] is really tough, but I thought the freshmen did a great job integrating into the team. They’re such hard workers and so disciplined.”
Support from the more experienced members of the team — like Shi and the solid nucleus of upperclassmen — played a crucial role in the first years’ contributions to the historic season.
“Being part of a team has definitely been the best aspect of playing college tennis so far” said Jachuck, who had not played for his high school team to focus on competing in national tournaments. “In the fall I was able to get to know the upperclassmen, and then coming to the spring and competing every week this team has really become my second family,” he said.
In his first year on the team, Jachuck was named to the No. 1 singles position, where he finished the season with an 8-2 record and a national ranking of No. 56 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. On his way, he handily defeated Minnesota’s (8-3, 1-0 Big Ten) ITA-ranked No. 38 Stefan Milicevic and other nationally recognized players as he advanced through the draws of national tournaments.
Jachuck attributes the early success of his career to the atmosphere of Crimson tennis.
“Playing for a team brings a new dimension for what I can bring to the court,” he said. “Collectively we all put in the work every day and have had some very good results and have seen our ranking climb, and I think we can go even higher,” said Jachuck, noting the effect his supportive teammates can have on the tide of a match. “Prior to coming to Harvard I knew that our recruiting classes were becoming very strong, but to have the impact that we’ve had right away in this first month of dual matches has been really impressive,” he remarked.
In addition to the contributions of Jachuck and Shi, the NCAA’s six-single format has allowed for more of the Crimson’s talent to be realized. Following Jachuck and Shi at No. 3 is von der Schulenburg, who concluded his first season at 9-1, defeating many ranked players and even capturing the singles title at the Harvard-hosted Chowder Fest in the fall. Crimson players had their names written all over the event; Jachuck and sophomore Harry Walker were crowned doubles champions with their undefeated record. Jachuck also commended the performances of freshman Alan Yim and sophomore Steven Sun, who both provided key victories throughout the year and the latter of whom clinched a tense 4-3 victory over Vanderbilt (7-6, 1-3 SEC) after fending off three match points.
With the season’s premature conclusion, the team has begun to look forward to this fall.
“We’ve had such great leaders in the past few years I’ve been on the team, and filling those shoes is going to be a pretty hard task,” Shi said. “I feel like our class especially is stepping into that role of leading the team, and I think we’re going to do a good job of it.”
Shi’s class will hopefully get the chance to play its new leadership role for the next batch of recruits in the fall.
“We’ve got three great guys coming in — I know each of them pretty well — and they all have good games and work really hard,” Jachuck said optimistically.
At the crux of Harvard tennis’ success this year seems to be a rejuvenation of talent headed by Jachuck, Shi, and von der Schulenberg among the skilled freshman and sophomore classes. Although the Crimson’s upward trajectory was cut short by the coronavirus, with the addition of the class of 2024’s recruits, the team will have the chance to accomplish much more in the years to come.
“It's really nothing to be upset about that our season ended early because it gives us so much more hope for the future. Our team is so young, and we have so many great recruits coming in also that I’m sure we’re going to do just as well next year — if not even better,” Shi said.
