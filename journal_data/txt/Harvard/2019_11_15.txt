After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second week of November, Lowell House will be hosting two award winning filmmakers. On Nov. 14, Waad al-Kateab will host a screening of her latest film, “For Sama,” which won the Best Documentary award in the Cannes Film Festival this year. The following day, award winning screenwriter and director Graham A. Sack ’03 will showcase some of his experimental work in virtual reality film to help expose students to this new frontier in media.
“For Sama” guides us through the five-year period in which the Syrian journalist and documentarist spent with her husband in Aleppo during the ongoing Syrian Crisis in which she also gave birth to her daughter, Sama. The film has won no less than 20 different awards across many film festivals around the world. A question and answer session with students will follow the screening of the film.
The second event will be a presentation of Sack’s work. Sack has directed “Lincoln in the Bardo,” which was commissioned by the New York Times for their VR App and shortlisted for an Emmy Innovation in Interactive Programming Award. Lowell will provide attendants with virtual reality equipment so that the alumnus is able to show students the full immersive experience of his work.
“At previous events that he has hosted they hadn’t been able to do that,” Andrew Castillo from the Lowell Programming Committee said. “He’s coming here to expose students to the new frontier filmmaking.”
This event in Lowell House arose from a series of fortunate coincidences. After renovations were unveiled at the end of August, the house programming committee had a brand-new screening room in the house basement to host events that were not possible in the past.
“Now we’re talking about creating dialogues with people on different sides,” Nina Zipser, faculty dean of Lowell House, said. “We think that is very important: as we go out into the world, not just to have an agenda, but also to be able to look at intellectual ideas from different perspectives.”
After some brainstorming, Shadi Kourosh, resident scholar and assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, brought up the idea of screening the Syrian documentary, “For Sama.” Shadi had coincidentally met the director of the film, Waad al-Kateab, on the plane returning from the Cannes Film Festival.
“Her art and her personal story were an inspiring example that I thought would be great for our students to be exposed to” Kourosh said. “As a mentor, I see my role first to listen to [student’s] interests and see how I can pull from the resources and the connections that I have to bring that to life.”
“The fact that there is a resident scholar also is due to renewal. Shadi is here because there’s a space that was included in renewal for resident scholars, and then she brings all these ideas and energy to the house,” David Laibson, faculty dean of Lowell House, said. “It’s a great renewal story.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Plenty of lesser-known films contain prolonged shots of the countryside, portrayed in silence until the next scene filled with people appears. “Mickey and the Bear,” 26-year-old Annabelle Attanasio’s directorial debut, certainly seems to be one of those, yet none of these extended moments feel gratuitous. Instead, they portray the uncanny feeling of being trapped beneath an expansive sky that should otherwise represent endless possibilities. Attanasio’s first film is an absolute success in its depiction of the myth — for many — of American upward mobility and its accompanying suffocation.
Mickey (Camila Morrone) — short for Michaela, which is only said once throughout the entire film — lives with her single father, Hank (James Badge Dale), in Anaconda, Montana. There’s no need for Attanasio to show us through grand gestures that Mickey loves him. Hank is an alcoholic addicted to Oxycontin, which often forces Mickey to get more pills for him. Her boyfriend, Aron (Ben Rosenfield), loves her but is immature, and she is uncertain about going to college. That is, whether she’ll get in, go, or be able to afford it.
Much of the movie is spent in silence. Mickey bikes across town,works in the taxidermy shop, sits alone bathed in purple light, eats at the outskirts of Anaconda. It’s in these moments that the film builds its tension: Inevitably, Hank will explode at her for asking questions about Vanessa, her mother who has long since passed away, or Aron will yell after her in the distance for being angry when forced to give him a blow job. In all of these encounters, Mickey holds her own, protecting herself above all.
Even Mickey’s relationship with the visiting student from England, Wyatt (Calvin Demba), is spent quietly. He speaks in a lower tone than the other men in her life, a strong contrast to the physical and emotional struggle that is parenting a man who cannot parent her. He is the only person who truly sees her, but even he cannot stick around when the reality of her situation truly hits him.
The film’s turning point comes when Wyatt walks away from her. His UK accent metaphorically speaks to a world outside, the smallest hints of which have permeated her world and made her think about what could lie beyond caring for Hank indefinitely. This low point in Mickey’s life is also when Mickey sees how difficult it is to endure the unyielding feeling of suffocation in a place that promises her no fulfilling future.
Some aspects of the film are a tad cliché: High school kids listen to music in the back of the room and walk outside alone for miles to escape; a clingy boyfriend can never understand her deeper desires. Yet, perhaps these clichés exist for a reason, and they do not diminish the silent solemnity of Morrone’s performance in the titular role.
The film’s score is as powerful as the acting, especially in the final scene that speeds up with the increasing pace of Morrone’s own movement. Though spare, it is powerful, conveying the words that neither Hank, nor Wyatt, nor Aron can utter themselves.
“Mickey and the Bear” acts as a snapshot of rural American life, a part of America that urban elites would sometimes like to pretend to forget. But Mickey’s struggle to leave, to cobble together $164 for a plane ticket to San Diego is told without commentary or judgement. She doesn’t get emotional, because she cannot. No one in her life is constant, and, watching, the viewer will forget that she’s only 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All things come in wrappers. At first, because the world is new and unknown, one does not notice the wrappers but only the thing that lies beneath, set alight by the flame of curiosity. Rain turns the dry earth to mud, but the mud is not simply wet dirt or filth; it is the squelch of boots, a brother’s cry of surprise as he is pushed into it, the flight of a ball as it interrupts raindrops on their way down, down. Sadness, anger, love, hate — each is the same. Each begins definitively in passion and ends definitively in passion too; nothing hesitates or lingers. The world is weightless; the wrappers are thin peels that impede nothing. All motion is ceaselessly forward.
And then, at some later time, things are abruptly obscured by their wrappers. The flame of curiosity is dampened by habit and hesitation. The thin peels quickly thicken and hide what lies beneath and all that one sees is the wrapper. A tree’s life, its heart — what makes the tree a tree — is lost beneath the bark. There are those who are content with only the wrappers, a life in the shallows; but for the rest, the challenge of life, insurmountable, is to claw back beneath the surface to that world where mud is more than dirt and emotion is more than thought, where all things are pure instinct, all action, and the wrappers are so thin they may as well be invisible.
K and the man are standing in a thick current of traffic. The stream of traffic is composed of lithe bodies that crash forward, one after another like waves into a still coastline, stumbling drunkenly through cobbled streets. It leans against the walls of pubs and spills through the doors of cafés and pushes down the ground and up against the low, squat sky.
From within the stream, K can sense the full weight of the world outside — its voices, its words and meanings — but only in the way that a child can feel the future beyond, certain yet so distant it feels like fiction. The stream parts around her and the man as if they are a boulder. His lips are on hers, her body leaning into his. Each is pushing their weight on the other. K feels none of the excitement that she remembers from her first kiss, which she had imagined she might if she ever kissed someone else.
She had forgotten that smell was a part of this: the smell of another person on their breath, their skin, imprinted on the kiss itself. He smells, in a moment of realization, like the inside of her car: worn leather, an amalgam of the various crumbs in the creases of the seats. Beneath that first car-smell, she detects another: It is a dampness, as if the man is rain. The dampness is familiar; it lingers in, and has undone K’s bedroom wallpaper, which now hangs in thin, peeled ribbons; it fills the pockets in her clothes and weighs her down. The dampness is in her; it follows like a thundercloud, putting out fires wherever they might manage to burn.
And suddenly she can’t keep her eyes shut anymore, and suddenly she can’t leave her lips on his or his body on hers, and suddenly she pushes him away and says, I need to leave. The wrapper is too thick, too heavy to lift, and the thing that lies beneath, though desirable and familiar once, is now too alien. The man is confused — to him, she smells like himself, like the kiss, the promise of the night — and though he is upset, he gathers himself and apologizes if he has upset her. He asks if she wants to get coffee instead. No, but thank you, K says. I’m sorry, and she recedes into that stream of effervescent wings as they beat and beat.
K pushes her way through the stream of tourists. All the voices that clamor for the surface appear only a string of hollow sounds that float lightly to the top, like bubbles in a flute of champagne, and sit there for a moment before each pops with a gentle explosion. The stream grows thicker and narrower, butterflies pile one upon the other. Soon, the struggle of wings forces K to the edge of the stream, and she falls out.
From the outside, she can’t tell one body from the other, one voice from another, and though she knows it is only a large crowd of butterflies, she can no longer see into the river of traffic. The stream is shrouded in an unnatural mist of sorts, a low fog that has settled around all the bobbing heads and wings and which obscures them from onlookers. The moonlight glints off the surface and is returned to itself. She turns to look at the stretch of shops behind her, beside the foggy stream. The first one sells hats, the second prints photographs, the third sells jewelry, and the fourth is a pet store.
K is looking into the pet store, closed now, through the shop’s front window, through the dim reflection of her own body — a whisper of wings, vacant eyes, a peel of herself. She sees the pets: puppies and kittens, snakes, cages of canaries and doves, all asleep. The store’s lights are on. One of the kittens is awake. She is laying on her belly, with her head rested on the curves of her paws. Her unblinking eyes are fixed on K. The other kittens are asleep, laying one on top of another, all wrinkled like old laundry. She lifts her head up and, though K does not hear it through the glass, the kitten purrs, sweet like a cloud of perfume and as desperate too. She swipes a paw at the cage and sets the metal frame aquiver. The other kittens give her a sidelong glance of distaste and return to sleep. Now a canary is awake. She blinks rapidly. She moves sideways along her perch and pecks at her feet. She begins flapping her wings, fluttering violently. The cage sways from side to side, like a ship caught in a tempest. She cries. At first, the other animals do nothing. Those that have sat in the cages for many months do not flinch. The rest fall, one by one, into a shattering symphony. The snakes slither from side to side slamming the walls of their cages. The dogs howl. The kittens shriek.
As the symphony rises, K sees the reflection of a butterfly some distance behind her. The butterfly flutters up from the pulsating, foggy stream, rising through the mist like a hand from a grave. The butterfly is delicate. Her wings are deep blue, the color of the bottom-most leagues of the sea. K can only tell her apart from the night by the glimmerings of the moon, which fall on her back and embolden the outlines of her body. The butterfly flies higher and higher up, toward the moon, that battered hole which sits above the world and lets out into the heavens. She struggles, pushing against the weight of the open sky, upwards. Each desperate flap of her wings is like the kicking legs of a child who learned to swim by being thrown into the deep end of the pool. The moon eclipses all other sight. It is all her eyes can see, that torturous hole. K, with her ears still fixed on the still-rising crescendo of the animals, sees the butterfly crumple like a simple autumn leaf and fall to the earth, swaying side to side along the furrows in the sky.
K pries loose a cobblestone from the street and hurls it through the storefront. An alarm goes off. The animals rattle the cages louder, howl louder. K floats up through the hole in the window and begins unlocking each cage. Doves fling themselves outside their cages and take wildly to the sky. Dogs leap out, lick K, wag their tails, and sprint into the night. The kittens melt into the shadows. K stands there for a moment, in the store with all those empty, unlocked cages, and feels a lightness, the hot pulse of action, inside her. Then, she dissolves back into the rhythm of the street and returns to the hotel room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though 98 percent of Harvard students live on campus, few of us pay attention to our mandatory unlimited meal plans. Many students were rightly upset when the student activities fee, an optional fee to fund student life and activities, increased from $75 to $200 last year, yet the exorbitant $6,755 cost of dining that the College imposes on virtually all students is discussed far less frequently. This fee is fundamentally unfair and ought to become optional.
First of all, many students frequently eat meals outside of the dining hall or skip breakfast and thus eat far fewer than 21 meals in the dining halls each week. The fact that students who live on campus are forced to pay for potentially hundreds of unused meal swipes is exploitative. Students deserve the right to spend their money how they wish and, especially with tuition costs increasing rapidly, all nonessential costs ought to be made optional.
Given the option, I believe many students would opt for plans that are far more limited. Currently the cost of the unlimited meal plan is roughly $32 per day. If every student were given $32 each day for food, I highly doubt that most students would spend the entirety of it in Harvard’s dining halls. Ask yourself: if you had $14 for dinner and you could choose between eating in the square and the House, how many nights a week would you eat in the dining halls?
Students who live off campus are allowed to choose between a variable meal plan with 5, 10, or 21 meals, or they can opt out of a dining plan entirely. By providing this option for students who live off campus, Harvard has demonstrated that it has the capacity to allow students to purchase partial meal plans. It also provides an incentive to move off campus for those who find the cost of board to be onerous, and many students I know who have moved off campus have cited dining costs as one of the primary reasons for their move.
There are legitimate reasons why Harvard requires students to have an unlimited meal plan. On its website, HUDS states that it helps create “many life-changing moments and memorable conversations” and to “foster life-long friendship networks and engender the intimate feeling of family and community.” By mandating that all students on campus have unlimited dining options, HUDS ensures that “you are able to eat all meals and participate in dining hall activities with your peers in every House.” Yet, Harvard could still require that all students have at least some meal swipes without requiring an unlimited amount. And Harvard could easily make all dining halls accessible to students who do not swipe in, as several Houses already do. Regardless, the argument that requiring students to pay such a high cost for meals that they do not fully use is necessary in order to build strong communities does not outweigh the exploitative and burdensome nature of the $6,755 fee.
Moreover, Harvard’s dining halls stack up very poorly against other schools. According to Niche’s ranking of best college food — which takes into account cost, quality, health, and variety of food — Harvard is 317th in the nation and seventh among Ivy League schools. For a school that seeks excellence in all fields, this is embarrassingly low. Allowing students to opt out of unlimited dining would provide a method of holding HUDS accountable and incentivizing it to improve the quality of the food, increase options for vegans or students who observe religious dietary restrictions, and remain open for longer.
It is important for Harvard to foster a sense of community on campus and within the Houses. The dining halls certainly play a key role in this effort, however, granting students the option to choose a variable dining plan rather than an unlimited one would not seriously hurt the sense of community. Abandoning the requirement for all on-campus students to have unlimited meal plans would go a long way in lightening the financial burden that many students carry and in increasing the ability of students to control their diets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a man running for president who speaks seven languages, including Norwegian, Italian, and French. He was the valedictorian of his high school class before graduating from Harvard College magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in History and Literature. He then won a Rhodes Scholarship and received first class honors in philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford University. He was a McKinsey consultant for three years before transitioning to public service and politics.
Pete P.M. Buttigieg ’04 might be the most relatable candidate for president!
Obviously, none of these accomplishments are a bad thing. However, considering 75 percent of Americans only know one language and the average American is expected to have only 13 years of schooling, he is not exactly relatable. There is a reason he chooses to go by “Mayor Pete” and emphasize his Midwestern background as opposed to his elite education.
Buttigieg, though, is dangerously effective at making the American public fall in love with him. We hear him speak Norwegian and we swoon a little. He makes a joke about how tasty Chick-fil-A is and we want to be the ones laughing with him. He responds to a question with a perfectly crafted yet improvised comment and our eyes become hearts.
We seem to have forgotten that he is only 37 years old. That he is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city with a population of 100,000 — making it smaller than the extremely famous city of Evansville, Indiana and only a few thousand people larger than Carmel, Indiana. This is obviously the experience we should seek in our presidential candidate!
Let’s just take a look at all of the people of color and women who have similar levels of experience and serious presidential runs! There seems to be more than a grain of truth to Senator Amy Klobuchar’s claims that if there were other small-town mayoral candidates of different demographic backgrounds, they would not necessarily attain the same level of praise.
Because we Americans are afraid in some ways. We followed up President Barack Obama with President Donald Trump, who beat out Hillary Clinton. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people responded by saying that it had been too soon for a black president and that the country was not ready for a female president either.
Regardless of the truth of either statement, can we at least acknowledge that this does not mean that Democrats should run into the arms of our white male candidates, such as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, so that the party can seem palatable and accessible to average Americans? We are a majority female country and are projected to become a majority-minority country in the next 20 to 30 years. Do these two facts alone not imply that we should run away from the past instead of towards it?
And it is clear that Pete Buttigieg is not the candidate for people of color. He has basically nonexistent support from black voters. And it is extremely unlikely that this is due to homophobia on the part of black voters, as some articles have recently suggested.
Of course it seems pretty shocking that a white, male, Midwestern candidate might struggle with issues relating to people of color! It’s not as though people of color could dislike Buttigieg because his track record on civil rights is poor and because he doesn’t have strong stances and clear plans related to the issues that affect them most.
Yet somehow, we have to acknowledge that maybe Buttigieg is not the best candidate for everyone?! He is the mayor of a city that is 40 percent Black and Latinx, yet his police force is 90 percent white. One of the first things he did while in office was to fire South Bend’s first black police chief. His own constituents have been unsatisfied with his responses to issues of police misconduct in South Bend. The leadership for his presidential campaign team is known for being undiverse. And the wonderful list of reasons why people of color are falling over themselves to support Mayor Pete go on and on.
He says he supports ideas raised by people of color. His new Douglass Plan, which calls for increased funding for historically black universities (something Kamala Harris, the only candidate who graduated from an HBCU, has already supported), and reducing mass incarceration (something Cory Booker has been championing for years), is clearly drawing on original thoughts and personal experience rather than echoing the ideas of the other candidates who actually know these struggles. Why would one want to vote for an actual person of color when instead one can vote for an eloquent white man who repackages their ideas?
With his charisma, it’s clear that he would be the president who will end the black school-to-prison pipeline. The one who will help stop gun violence. The one who will end police brutality. Does it really matter who came up with the ideas as long as he’s the one who says them eloquently?
Well, even if Mayor Pete won’t be able to effectively convince voters of color that he will improve their lives, at least he will be able to explain in Norwegian.

Last week, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services announced that it will launch a pilot program in which it will offer a limited amount of same-day appointments for non-urgent cases. Beginning at 8:30 a.m. on weekdays, students who are not already regularly seeing a CAMHS counselor can now call to book 30-minute appointments on a first-come, first-served basis.
We welcome this announcement, and believe that this new service offered by CAMHS will provide much-needed help to students facing unanticipated challenges. It can be hard to foresee mental health issues and episodes. Allowing students to set up a same-day appointment is an important development in improving the quality of mental health care at Harvard for individuals with unique and rapidly evolving needs.
But we find ourselves wondering whether this new pilot program isn’t just a band-aid for the proverbial wound.
Mental health on campus is in a dire state. According to the mental health survey the University conducted in 2017 and 2018, Harvard students experience depression and anxiety at rates significantly higher than the national average reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outgoing Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira has said that in addition to clinical symptoms, many students regularly face acute feelings of loneliness, feeling like an imposter, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
Despite recent hires, CAMHS is seriously understaffed, which results in students often waiting several weeks for an appointment and turning to student peer-counseling groups for help. Especially with the closing of the Bureau of Study Counsel and its replacement by the Academic Resource Center, many students have legitimate concerns both about their own mental health care and the University’s commitment to providing robust and comprehensive mental health services.
We encourage Harvard to increase accessibility to mental health services by hiring more CAMHS counselors and making mental health a priority in the same way physical health care is. In that vein, we believe that ideally each College student should be assigned a mental health care professional, just as we are assigned a physician or an academic adviser. This would serve as a critical step in destigmatizing mental health issues, ensure that all students are equipped with the knowledge of where to turn in case of a mental health crisis, and provide the infrastructure for them to do so.
Yet, it is not enough to merely focus on how to deal with mental health issues after they arise. The University should recognize that it is partially responsible for these widespread mental health issues and focus on instituting more preventative measures. One way in which the school could do this work would be to train all faculty on what healthy academic environments look like, how struggling students can be assisted in the context of their academic work, where courses can be tailored and reinforced to accommodate students who are dealing with mental health problems.
The creation of same-day appointments is certainly a positive measure in providing stronger mental health care. But to tackle the mental health crisis, a much larger and more ambitious approach is needed.

When Alexa C. Jordan ’22 bit into a Clif Bar in November of her freshman year, she didn’t realize how much that bite would cost.
Jordan has an allergy to nuts, and the cashews in the bar soon sent her into anaphylactic shock. She called for an ambulance and was transported to the hospital around 11 a.m., returning to campus around 6 p.m. after being treated. The ambulance bill was $1,300, and she says she is still “dealing with” that expense nearly a year later.
At 2 a.m. the following night, Jordan woke up “not able to breathe,” and called Harvard University Health Services for assistance. She was diverted from Urgent Care and directed to the hospital instead, with instructions to call an ambulance for transport.
In order to avoid another significant bill, Jordan opted to Uber off-campus to Mount Auburn Hospital, accompanied by her roommate. She received a taxi voucher from UHS for her trip back to campus, but when it failed to summon a taxi for “three to four hours,” she ended up returning to campus around 7 a.m. with HUPD.
So the total cost of that bite? In addition to $1,300 in ambulance fees, it cost several hours of waiting and a “traumatic, horrible” experience that follows Jordan to this day.
***
After June 17, 2019, HUHS Urgent Care stopped admitting patients between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., instead providing an urgent care line that connects to a tele-nurse for over-the-phone counseling. If students require immediate care within those ten hours, they must seek out a local hospital instead. This has exacerbated issues with transportation costs to off-campus medical facilities that students like Jordan had experienced even before the switch.
In an April Crimson article, Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi said the change was made to help streamline the emergency care process, eliminating the interim period of waiting between arriving at Urgent Care and being transported to the hospital. Figures from February 2019 show that the number of students who make use of the overnight urgent care system is low: Of the 227 calls to overnight urgent care that month, only 15 people arrived at HUHS in person, and six of those were transported to the hospital.
In an emailed statement, Michael Perry, a spokesperson for HUHS, wrote, “Callers to the nurse advice line between 10pm and 8am receive the highest level of care and medical advice in an easily accessible way. Many callers save time by preventing the unnecessary step of visiting in-person urgent care only to be transferred to an emergency room.”
The changes, however, have still been met with backlash from students.
“I think the general tone of conversation is that students feel like some avenue in which they can seek healthcare has been restricted or taken away completely,” says Jenny Y. Gan ’22, an Undergraduate Council representative. Jordan, who is also a UC representative, has heard similar concerns from other students.
“I sent out a survey to the Adams House mailing list to try [to] get general feedback at the beginning of the school year, and [policy change] was actually one of the main complaints,” Jordan says.
Although Jordan had the option to seek UHS assistance last year when she woke up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe, there would be no hope for such assistance now. Her options would have been another ambulance charge upwards of $1,000, or the alternative she decided to take — seeking help on her own.
In light of her own experience and those of fellow students, Jordan — along with UC representative M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 — has sponsored a new UC bill that funds “non-emergency medical transportation” for students who use Uber, Lyft, or other ride-sharing services to receive off-campus medical care.
Ethan M. Schultz ’21 was one of the first students to directly benefit from this new policy. Three weeks ago, he sprained his ankle while running near the law school campus around 10 p.m. and was faced with two options: pay thousands of dollars for an ambulance ride, or hop on one foot to Mt. Auburn. “It was after hours, so there were less options available,” Schultz says, “so I just called an Uber.”
This third method of transportation has become increasingly popular among students seeking care after HUHS closes its doors. Schultz claims some of his friends have been in similar situations, and admits that while Ubering to the hospital feels “kind of pathetic… it’s just what you have to do.”
Schultz recalls the story of a friend who “was in severe danger and needed to be taken care of.” Although she could barely speak, she managed to voice her inability to pay for an ambulance bill. “It was kind of heartbreaking,” Schultz says, adding, “When you’re in severe danger you shouldn’t need to think about paying for your ride to the hospital.”
Following his own late-night Uber ride to Mt. Auburn, Schultz provided Larson with his transportation receipts and some basic information, and he was reimbursed in full. “It was the easiest thing,” he says.
The UC bill will also help students who aren’t seeking after-hours care: Students can be reimbursed for visits to off-campus mental health appointments, physical therapy, and other forms of care. This is especially important, Jordan says, because “CAMHS is lacking right now in staffing, so they’re having to send students out into the community.” These journeys can prove time-consuming and costly, and the possibility of reimbursement alleviates some of the financial burden placed on students unable to receive on-campus counseling.
Sending students into the community for counseling, however, is standard practice due to the nature of CAMHS. According to Dr. Barbara Lewis, Chief of CAMHS, “While CAMHS is designed to provide students with short-term therapy, there are students who are seen for a longer period of time. For those students who seek regular, long-term therapy, CAMHS maintains strong relationships with providers in the community, and through our Community Referral Coordinator (CRC), we will assist students to find an outside provider that best fits their needs.”
As for this new system’s adequacy in addressing concerns raised by the lack of overnight care, Jordan maintains that the UC is doing all they can to “ensure that there’s a minimal detriment placed on students.” Gan hopes the new transportation reimbursement program will help illuminate other areas of campus medical care that can be improved. A survey enabling students to apply for the program appeared in the Nov. 6 UC Weekly newsletter, which contains a section for feedback, allowing students to “leave any comments or personal stories.” She hopes to use this feedback in presentations to HUHS administrators, “who can hopefully take that into consideration when they're thinking about the future of emergency care.”

Harvard astrophysicists are among researchers from 13 countries who have designed the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, a telescope that will soon map the locations of galaxies across the universe and explore dark energy.
DESI is a scientific device with 5000 fiber-optic “eyes” that work to estimate and project the distance between Earth and millions of galaxies as well as other remote celestial objects across the universe, according to a press release from the Harvard Center for Astrophysics. The tool also studies dark energy, an unknown force that comprises approximately 68 percent of the universe and increasingly expands it.
Each sensor on DESI is approximately the width of a human hair, according to the release. It is intended that DESI will be able to conduct measurements involving 5000 galaxies every 20 minutes with each sensor being able to track a new galaxy every two seconds.
Harvard Astronomy professor Daniel J. Eisenstein, a spokesperson for the initiative, estimated that DESI will begin operating in 2020. It is currently housed at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Ariz.
“The installation began about 18 months ago,” Eisenstein said. “The project started in 2012 or 2013, and that was the first approval sequence. The project was really several years in design and then several years in active construction, and now will be about a year-and-half in installation.”
DESI will improve upon technology from similar devices used in the past to measure light in space, according to Eistenstein.
“The technological capability of DESI is to be able to measure those spectra at a much faster rate than what was done in the past, something like 20 times faster than the previous survey instrument,” Eisenstein said.
Eisenstein noted that DESI will enable researchers to study the history and composition of the universe in more detail because of the new maps it can create.
“It’s not just mapping out the universe as it is now, it’s actually making a map of what the fluctuations must have been in the first million years after the Big Bang or even the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang,” Eisenstein said.
“There’s an empirical aspect of DESI, which is to measure velocities and make maps from those velocities,” he added. “But then there’s the application side of DESI, which is studying dark energy and general cosmological clustering by understanding the patterns in those maps and using those patterns to infer things about the expansion history.”
Eisenstein said it was a “very exciting time” for the project that brought together researchers across the globe. Harvard astrophysicists are among the 500 researchers at 75 international institutions who contributed to designing DESI.
“We have been working on it for a long time, and we are now starting to see this very capable and compelling new instrument come into life,” Eisenstein said. “It is an ongoing process but it is a really fun process to be able to collaborate with so many talented people from around the world and a wide range of skill sets that come together to make something like this happen.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced Thursday the composition of a University-wide committee to find a replacement for longtime Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
Former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will chair the six-person committee, according to Gay’s emailed announcement, which she sent to Harvard Athletics affiliates. The other members are former Athletics Director John “Jack” P. Reardon ‘60, Dean of Students Katherine O’Dair, Cabot House Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Khurana, Professor of African and African American Studies and Philosophy Tommie Shelby, and former Vice Chair of the Board of Overseers Gwill E. York ’79.
Jed Hughes and Tierney Remick of outside consulting group Korn Ferry International will aid the search. Hughes has spent 20 years coaching football at the professional and intercollegiate level and is Korn Ferry’s Global Head of Sports Practice. Remick currently serves on the Leadership Board of Harvard Kennedy School’s Women and Public Policy Program.
Scalise, who has served as Athletics Director for the past 18 years, announced in October that he would retire in June. He wrote in an email to the Athletics Department last month that he will continue to serve as an adviser for Gay on athletics throughout the 2020-2021 academic year.
Gay wrote Thursday that the search committee will direct “extensive consultation” of members of Harvard Athletics. Throughout the search process, the committee will post information about consultation events to a website, and they will solicit feedback via a publicly available email address.
The consultation meetings will give affiliates of Harvard Athletics a chance to offer their input on the “qualities, experiences, capacities, and vision” that they hope to see in the new director and to share the issues they believe the new director should prioritize, according to the website.
The search for Scalise’s successor comes during a time of nationwide turbulence surrounding college athletics.
In March, the United States Department of Justice charged more than 50 individuals for partaking in a nationwide admissions scandal to win the children of wealthy parents admission to elite universities. As part of the scheme, some varsity coaches received bribes to falsely classify applicants as prospective varsity athletes, vastly increasing their chances of admission.
Coaches at multiple universities — including Yale and Stanford — were implicated. Though Harvard itself was not involved in the scandal, six Harvard alumni were charged for participating in the illegal scheme.
A month later, Harvard grappled with a scandal of its own that resulted in the firing of head fencing coach Peter Brand after he violated the University’s conflict of interest policy. Brand had sold his home for more than $300,000 above its market valuation to the family of a prospective fencer, the Boston Globe reported in April.
Last month, the NCAA announced that student-athletes could profit from their names, images, and likenesses, a decision that could impact thousands of student-athletes at Harvard and across the nation. Scalise has said in the past that he believes student-athletes should not be compensated in any way for their athletic abilities, past those expenses that playing their sport incurs.
Contemporaneously to the search for a new Athletics director, outside consulting firm Mercer is conducting a review of the Athletics Department. Scalise said in October that the study will primarily focus on the “structure” and "culture” of the department.
Membership of the committee conducting the review has not been announced publicly.

UPDATED: Nov. 15 at 2:10 a.m.
James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 will lead the next session of the Undergraduate Council as president and vice president, respectively, despite not receiving the most first-choice votes, the UC Election Commission announced Thursday night.
Mathew and White-Thorpe ran on a campaign to foster inclusion and improve student wellness and safety under the slogan “Harvard Can’t Wait.” Mathew is a Mather House resident who serves as one of two chiefs of inclusion and belonging on current UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa’s Executive Cabinet. White-Thorpe, a  Leverett House resident, has served on three UC committees and is currently the UC’s head of communications and chair of its Black Caucus. They will take office in December.
The duo won the election despite the fact that they did not receive the most first-choice votes under the Borda voting system the Council adopted last year. Voters ranked all five candidates, and each ticket received a quantity of points corresponding to its ranking on the ballot — first-choice tickets received one point, second-choice tickets received 0.5 points, third-choice received 0.33, fourth-choice received 0.25, and fifth-choice received 0.2.
Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21 — a Crimson business associate — received the most first-choice votes, with 1,063 students ranking the ticket as their top choice. Mathew and White-Thorpe followed with 1,025 first-choice votes, and Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 and Rushi A. Patel ’21 came in third with 965 first-choice votes.
Under the Borda voting system, Mathew and White-Thorpe won with 1,938.0 points. Dhar and Liang came in second with 1,865.8 points, followed by Mahajan and Patel with 1,846.3, Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 and Michael O. Raji ’22 with 1,436.3, and M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 and Case McKinley ’21 with 1,298.0.
Student turnout for UC presidential elections has increased significantly over the past few years. A total of 3,672 students voted in this year’s election, a 31 percent increase from the 2,797 students who voted last year.
Mathew and White-Thorpe’s platform lays out three main goals: advocate for inclusion and belonging on campus; innovate solutions to problems; and foster a “community-oriented” student experience, according to their campaign website. The duo also proposed creating a “Unity Caucus,” a group of UC members and other students that collaborates on legislation and other projects.
Mathew and White-Thorpe declined to comment for this story.
Several students said they are excited for Mathew and White-Thorpe’s term on the council.
“I’m very happy that James and Ify won,” Aman Panjwani ’20 said. “I think James especially was a great person to bring the campus together and embrace the diversity that we need on this campus.”
Panjwani added that he hopes Mathew and White-Thorpe will embrace some parts of the other tickets’ platforms as well.
Ava M. Hampton ’21 said she thinks the duo’s campaign was well-planned.
“I think their campaign was really well-integrated,” Hampton said. “It makes sense that they won, and I’m excited to see what they do with their term.”
The UC Election Commission also announced the results of the referenda on the ballot. The Council voted last week to split the three referenda that gained enough signatures to appear on the ballot into seven separate statements.
The statement asking whether the University should commit to divesting its endowment from the fossil fuel industry by Earth Day 2020 earned support from 69.3 percent of student voters, slightly down from the 71.5 percent of voters who supported fossil fuel divestment last year.
Meanwhile, 72.5 percent of voters agreed that the University should adopt the reinvestment principles of Fossil Free 350 — a reference to the organization 350.org, which urges institutions to make investments that promote social equality and ecological well-being. Roughly 82.2 percent voted in favor of the University publicly disclosing its investments in the fossil fuel industry.
University administrators have long contended that the University’s endowment should not be used as a tool to enact social change. Instead, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has argued Harvard must work with industry players to combat climate change.
The referendum to merge BoardPlus and Crimson Cash into a single system won overwhelming support from students with 91.2 percent voting in favor. Currently, as a part of the undergraduate meal plan, students receive $65 of BoardPlus per semester to spend at Harvard University Dining Services cafes and House grilles. Crimson Cash may be used for laundry, printing, and at various restaurants and stores both on and off campus. The proposed single system would allow students to choose to spend combine their BoardPlus and Crimson Cash for any of these purposes.
The third referendum regarding mealtimes also gained wide support. The proposal to extend breakfast closing times in all Dining Halls to 10:45 a.m. won support from 76.3 percent of voters, and the proposal to extend dinner closing times to 7:45 p.m. won support from 85.2 percent of voters. Meanwhile, 89.4 percent of voters agreed that HUDS workers’ pay should be increased accordingly should mealtimes be extended.

The longtime college admissions practice of purchasing student names and information from the College Board — in which Harvard has long participated — has come under scrutiny from experts who say the program commodifies admissions and violates student privacy.
The College Board’s Student Search Program licenses lists of high school students’ names and approximate PSAT or SAT scores, in addition to a limited amount of other demographic information like ethnicity.
Combinations from up to 2.5 million names are distributed to 1,900 accredited colleges and universities, scholarship organizations, and non-profit programs. The dissemination of this information is intended to help students “start important conversations with colleges and scholarship organizations and explore their options,” per College Board spokesperson Zachary Goldberg.
In a typical year, more than 60 percent of the students who end up attending the College were among the names the College purchased from Student Search, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. The percentage is even higher — over 80 percent — for minority students at the College.
While the search is free for students, colleges and universities must pay 47 cents per name to license a student’s information.
Anthony P. Carnevale — the director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce — said that he finds the practice of selling the names “questionable.”
“The students are being treated as a commodity,” Carnevale said. “The College Board is getting every last nickel that it can out of anybody who touches them.”
Goldberg wrote in an email that the College Board “re-invest[s] the funds” into programs like fee waivers and opens up the door for more students to enroll in colleges and universities.
Students who participate in the search are 12 percent more likely to enroll at a 4-year college, Goldberg said, referencing a College Board research study.
Experts questioned the intent of colleges that purchase prospective students’ names from the College Board.
Zak Harris, a former admissions officer at Johns Hopkins University and Bowdoin University who works at InGenius Prep, said he thinks purchasing names is useful because it helps tailor marketing materials to certain demographics.
“When you're buying search names, part of what you're able to do is to customize where they're coming from,” Harris said. “Colleges are buying names as a way to get into territories or get into markets where maybe they're not very popular.”
Carnevale said colleges may purchase these names to boost the number of applicants each year and lower their acceptance rate.
“There are two ways the names seem to have value for institutions. You get more people to turn down, which improves your standing, or you find people who you can accept that you're having difficulty finding,” Carnevale said.
Other experts have concerns about student privacy.
Leonie Haimson ‘76, co-chair of Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, said the current standard for student consent in the Student Search is troubling.
“One of the issues we have is that there is no parental consent required for this,” she said, calling the instructions to students “extremely confusing and often deceptive.”
Students must actively choose to opt-in and can opt-out of the Student Search at any time, Goldberg said.
Harris said more critical attention to admissions programs like the Student Search is needed, given increased scrutiny to college admissions in the wake of recent scandals.
In an investigation dubbed “Varsity Blues” that made headlines in March, federal authorities uncovered a nationwide scheme in which parents bribed coaches at elite universities like Yale and Stanford to designate their children as athletics recruits to increase their chances of admission. In April, the Boston Globe uncovered real estate transactions between the Harvard fencing coach and a parent of a recruited athlete.
“As we've seen with all of the admissions stuff happening over the past year to year and a half, I think it's fair to say that all of our kind of standard practices deserve some other level of scrutiny, to see if they can be better, and see if it's something that can be changed or edited in a way that is more inclusive or that is more fair,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 15, 2019 at 10:29 p.m.
The Climate Protection Action Committee unanimously supported recommendations to the City Manager’s Office that aim to combat climate change in Cambridge in a meeting Thursday night.
The recommendations came as part of the committee’s Net Zero Action Plan, a strategy to promote eliminating all production of carbon emissions in buildings and infrastructure throughout the city. The committee presented the recommendations in an Net Zero Action Plan Progress Report to ensure the city implements its previously stated goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Cambridge produced 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2012, according to a recent report conducted by the City’s Community Development Department.
Three committee members who spoke at the meeting said they found it urgent to make actionable recommendations to the City Manager’s office to institute certain suggestions from the Net Zero Action Plan. Though they agreed Cambridge is on track to meet their broader goals, they said they believe the city is behind schedule in adopting their recommendations.
Cambridge Net Zero Energy Planner Seth Federspiel led the discussion to vote on the progress report, which the committee will send to the City Manager at the end of the year.
“We support being aggressive in this. It was supposed to be adopted in fiscal year 2019 and it hasn’t been adopted yet,” Federspiel said. “Our goal is to get to net zero emissions by 2050. They should move forward in adopting it.”
Cambridge spokesperson Lee Gianetti wrote in an email statement that officials always anticipated efforts to put the plan into action might “encounter barriers” during the process.
“As we have dived into implementation, this has, indeed, been true,” Gianetti wrote. “As a result, some actions are on time, some are behind schedule and others are ahead of schedule.”
“All the City’s new construction in the last few has been net-zero ready, ahead of the municipal net zero commitment, which will be triggered in 2020,” Gianetti added.
He also wrote the first year of implementation included more delays, but that progress has sped up since then. The city is also about to undertake a five-year review of the plan.
Cambridge’s commitment to decreasing emissions has inspired community members to join the Climate Protection Action Committee to further promote the cause.
John Bolduc, an environmental planner and committee member, facilitated the latter part of the meeting, outlining Cambridge’s carbon consumption and its greenhouse gas emissions. He focused on a partnership between the committee and the Recycling Advisory Committee to develop feasible strategies to address climate change issues, referencing a mission statement drafted by the committee.
“The idea would be a possible scope for a joint subcommittee between CPAC and the RAC to work on this issue of greenhouse gas emissions and consumption,” Bolduc said.
The committee also voted unanimously to approve the mission statement and prepared plans to send it to the Recycling Advisory Committee by Jan. 2020.
Bernardo García, an exchange student from Monterrey, Mexico studying at UMass Boston, was one of several students from the Boston area studying climate change who attended the meeting. García said he appreciated that Cambridge residents came together to take decisive action on climate change — something he has not noticed in his own hometown.
“I just wanted to come in here and take a look at how these types of meetings go,” he said. “Not being from here, it’s nice to see that people are actually getting together and trying to solve these climate issues.”

A large enough majority of Cambridge City Councilors elected Nov. 5 support the city’s proposed affordable housing overlay in its current form that the council may now be able to pass the long-debated legislation into law.
The overlay — which became a central issue over the course of the campaign — is a zoning reform proposal to streamline affordable housing permit approval processes and reduce costs, thereby incentivizing developers to build affordable units in Cambridge. Municipal zoning laws require a minimum of six votes to pass the council, and during the current session overlay proponents were unable to garner sufficient support. The measure was tabled in September ahead of the biannual election.
After the November election, however, six of nine incoming councilors back the proposal as it stands, according to interviews and Crimson survey sent to candidates.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, who has been a strong proponent of the overlay, said in an interview that he is hopeful for the legislation’s passage in the coming term. He added that it is critical to address Cambridge’s “extremely difficult” affordable housing situation.
“If we do not deal with that, and we leave it up to market forces, then the only development we're going to see is high end developments,” he said.
McGovern, along with incumbent councilors E. Denise Simmons, Sumbul Siddiqui, Alanna M. Mallon, and Timothy J. Toomey Jr. have previously supported the overlay and indicated their intention to vote in its favor. These five incumbents are joined in their support of the overlay by newly elected challenger Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler.
McGovern added that much of the disagreement came from the “nitty gritty,” and said he believes the councilors should be willing to compromise in order to address the housing crisis.
“No one’s ever gonna get 100 percent of what they want,” he said. “I'm not getting 100 percent of what I want. But, you know, at the end of the day, are we going to stand by our commitment to build more affordable housing or are we going to find excuses not to?”
In order for the proposal to be considered in the coming term, it will need to be reintroduced and go through the typical legislative channels before a vote can take place. This process involves being considered during at least one Ordinance Committee hearing.
Newly elected councilor Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 — who opposed the current version of the overlay during the campaign — said she would like to see “some version” of the overlay passed by the next council. She added, however, that aspects of the proposal would have to be changed in order to gain her support including permit applicants' right to appeal zoning decisions.
“I expect an overlay come to before us, but I hope that it doesn't pass as written, because I think we can do better,” she said. “I think there's overlays that would produce less time delay and less restrictions and less problems for developers who want to do 100 percent affordable housing and probably produce more units.”
Both McGovern and Nolan said they would like to see a compromise where councilors could come to a unanimous — or nearly unanimous — consensus.
David E. Sullivan, a former city councilor, said he believes the council will pass some form of the overlay in the next term, describing the election itself as a “referendum” of sorts on the proposal.
“I think the voters spoke clearly,” he said.
Nolan disputed the idea of the election as a referendum, saying she found many residents remained “concerned” with the proposal as it stands.
“The election results did not show that people supported the overlay,” she said. “There was actually a lot of concern. As I was door knocking, even from people who supported, people who were in front of the overlay, they still were concerned about the overlay as written.”

Two Harvard peer counseling groups — Response and Eating and Concerns Hotline and Outreach — recently returned to a newly renovated Lowell House, according to the organizations’ websites.
Indigo Counseling has moved to Thayer basement, where Response used to reside.
Response, which focuses on relationship issues, and ECHO, which addresses body image issues and eating disorders, both relocated their services during the renovation of Lowell in 2017. Response temporarily moved to Thayer and ECHO transferred to Eliot. Now, the peer counseling groups have reclaimed their original spots in Lowell basement.
Indigo, previously operating out of the Adams H Entryway, provides counseling related to issues of race, class and first-generation status. After its inception in spring 2016, Indigo experienced a staff shortage that prompted a year-long hiatus, but reopened in Sept. 2017.
Lowell House Administrator Elizabeth B. Terry praised Response’s move back to the river.
“The peer counseling that Response offers is very important, especially in light of the results of the recent Harvard AAU Survey,” she wrote in an email. Last month’s Association of American Universities survey reported that the prevalence of sexual assault and harrassment at Harvard has remained unchanged since 2015.
“I'm glad that Lowell House has been able to retain space for this group for so many years, even into the renewed House,” Terry wrote. “I hope that it will be useful and comforting to the River area students to have the RESPONSE office nearby.”
Darius Atefat-Peckham ’23 said that more students may seek help now that Indigo has relocated to the Yard.
“I know as a Harvard student, I’m just working all the time, so something that’s like a big time commitment and [which] I have to walk far for won’t happen generally, even if I need it on a lesser scale, like a haircut,” he said. “So I think it’s definitely beneficial to have things nearby.”
Benjamin J. Dreier ’22 also said he thinks that freshmen can benefit from counseling centers near their dorms.
“I guess in general I support those things being closer to the Yard, because freshmen in general are more likely to use the services,” Dreier said.
Indigo declined to comment on the move. Response and Harvard University Health Services did not provide comment in time for publication. ECHO did not respond to a request for comment.
Indigo joins two other peer counseling groups who will stay on in Thayer basement — Room 13, which provides general peer counseling, and Contact, which supports LGBTQ mental health.
Indigo has drop-in hours every night in Thayer B-01, and Response and ECHO have drop-in hours every night from Sunday through Wednesday.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Tuesday that it is “unclear” how quickly higher education legislation will make it through Congress given the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
“At the moment, given the fact that Congress is tied up with other issues — which are in the press daily — it's unclear what legislation is going to move forward,” Bacow said.
His comments come weeks after Democrats in the United States House of Representatives introduced the College Affordability Act — a bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965 — and legislation to repeal a tax on university endowments, all amid the impeachment inquiry.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) initiated the impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 following revelations that Trump allegedly asked the Ukranian government to investigate former Vice President and current presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
Bacow has supported both pieces of legislation, personally meeting with legislators in both houses about these issues and lobbying them to enact proposals in favor of institutions of higher education.
Bacow said Tuesday that the University is trying to “mitigate” the impact of any delay in passing this legislation, especially efforts to repeal the endowment tax. The tax on universities’ endowment returns was originally signed into law in December 2017, and since its passage, Rep. Brendan F. Boyle (D-Pa.) introduced a bill to repeal the tax.
“It's unclear what legislation is going to move forward, given the fact that Washington is consumed at this point by the impeachment inquiry, what may turn out to be a trial. We'll see how that works out,” Bacow said. “But that's what we can do, is to try and mitigate the impact of that.”
Last month, Harvard and 30 other colleges and universities jointly submitted their opposition to the United States Treasury’s proposed rules for levying the endowment tax.
Boston College political science professor David A. Hopkins ’99 said though the impeachment inquiry will take up some time in Congress, there were already questions as to whether the College Affordability Act would progress through Congress even under normal circumstances.
“Even before impeachment, there was already a pretty complicated set of negotiations going on between the House and the Senate,” Hopkins said.
He added timing issues could be compounded if the House voted for impeachment and the Senate became tied up in a trial.
“We could see months or more of the Senate calendar being mostly taken up by an impeachment trial,” Hopkins said. “And that would, at that point, I think, present a possible obstacle to other legislative business getting done.”
M. Matthew Owens, the executive vice president for federal relations at the Association of American Universities said, however, that the political system is equipped to handle both impeachment proceedings and other legislative matters.
“There's a larger legislative and political environment that is already challenging here in Washington and as such, the impeachment inquiry is yet another factor in all of that,” Owens said.
Bacow noted Tuesday that the impeachment inquiry appears to be on the top of legislators’ agenda in Washington.
“I think anybody who watches what goes on in D.C. recognizes that there are a whole series of pressing issues in which there are legislative proposals pending, of which this is just one,” Bacow said. “And it seems like, and I say this just as an observer, lots of things seem to be grinding to a halt at the moment.”

Journalist Tatiana C. K. Schlossberg discussed the environmental impact of everyday consumption at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday night.
Speaking alongside president of The Atlantic and Institute of Politics resident fellow Bob Cohn, Schlossberg — who authored the book “Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don’t Know You Have” — examined the environmental implications of different consumer behaviors regarding fashion, internet usage, food, and fuel.
The event began with a discussion of Schlossberg’s recently published book. Schlossberg said she wrote the book after becoming anxious about climate change, and beginning to report on the subject for the New York Times.
She added that she decided to write “Inconspicuous Consumption” to make the issue more accessible for readers who may not have an extensive science background.
“It is almost impossible to make sustainable choices given the system that we live in,” she said. “And that’s a problem, but we can’t solve that problem unless we understand it.”
Schlossberg and Cohn also discussed the fashion’s industry impact on the environment. Schlossberg spoke about her work to explore fast fashion companies creating a “disposable culture” and its significance on the environment.
Additionally, she examined the topic of technology through the lens of environmentalism, speaking about Internet usage and the impact data centers fueled by diesel had on the environment.
Schlossberg said companies like Amazon and Microsoft have such a big impact on the environment because of the scale of their operations, and that these companies should be leading the way in terms of environmentalism efforts.
“There has been too much emphasis on the consumer to make the right choice and that narrative of personal responsibility has been destructive in a lot of ways because it has taken the attention away from those who are actually responsible,” she said.
Schlossberg added that she thinks voting is the most effective response to the environmental concerns she studies.
“I think the most important individual action is to vote and to get involved in the political process and to put pressure on companies or not support companies that aren’t at the very least transparent,” she said.
Audience members echoed Schlossberg’s focus on political action. Toward the end, IOP President Anna L. Duffy ’21 asked Schlossberg how she thinks voters can make climate change more important in political debates.
Several attendees said they found the event informative.
Attendee Abigail M. Fennelly ’23 said she was struck by the high amounts of waste produced by the fast fashion industry.
“H&M and other fast fashion brands, especially Forever 21, is designed to fall apart, so you have to shop again,” Fennelly said.
Daniel Bicknell ’13 said that he enjoyed the event and appreciated the chance to learn about environmentalism.
“The forum generally has a lack of climate and environment events, so I was thrilled to see one dedicated to everyday environmentalism,” he said. “I’m proud to support more events like this in the future at the forum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has selected three development teams — Alexandria Real Estate Equities and National Development, the HYM Investment Group, and Breakthrough Properties — as finalists for a bid to develop the University’s new Enterprise Research Campus in Allston.
The Enterprise Research Campus is a project intended to promote collaboration between commercial and research-focused tenants of Harvard’s Allston campus and University-affiliated research groups. The research campus will extend along an approximately 14 acre stretch of land near the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The Boston Planning and Development Agency Board approved Harvard’s Planned Development Area Master Plan for the Enterprise Research Campus in March 2018. The master plan included a proposal for 900,000 square feet of new development for a “variety of uses,” including offices, labs, a hotel and conference space, and housing, according to BPDA spokesperson Molly McGlynn.
The Harvard Allston Land Company released a request for proposals for the project in June 2019 and received 18 submissions by the end of July, according to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
In August, the land company pared the list of contenders to 10; the list then narrowed to nine after two development teams merged their proposals. The land company selected the final three in early November, according to O’Rourke.
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which has headquarters in Pasadena, Calif., maintains several property holdings in the Greater Boston area dedicated to biotechnology and life science, including Alexandria Center at One Kendall Square and multiple locations on Binney Street.
Based in Boston, the HYM Investment Group is a real estate company with a focus on mixed use developments that seek to bring together residential, retail, and commercial elements in its projects, according to its website. The group redeveloped the Bulfinch Crossing in downtown Boston and served as the development advisor for Waterside Place, a luxury apartment complex in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood.
Breakthrough Properties is a joint venture of Tishman Speyer and Bellco Capital founded this year, according to a press release distributed at the time. The company is located in Los Angeles and works to facilitate collaborations in the life sciences through real estate development.
Representatives from Alexandria Real Estate Equities and National Development, the HYM Investment Group, and Breakthrough Properties declined to comment.
Harvard Allston Land Company CEO Thomas P. Glynn III wrote in an emailed statement that the land company kept a set of “core principles” in mind while considering development team candidates.
“Throughout the partner selection process HALC has used a guiding rubric of principles and goals it wanted developers to respond to including proposals that showed a commitment to a vibrant, sustainable public realm, a thoughtful approach to the inclusion of affordable housing, a focus on sustainability and resiliency, a plan to include space for various start-ups, and a diverse development team,” Glynn wrote.
The land company plans to remain involved in the selection process and hopes to arrive at a final decision before the year ends, according to Glynn.
“HALC was incredibly pleased with the responses from all of the finalists and is excited to move forward to the final round with three development teams,” Glynn wrote.
McGlynn wrote that the BPDA will continue to be engaged in the development of the Enterprise Research Campus after a developer has been selected.
“There will be a continued public process once a developer has been chosen, and we look forward to re-engaging the community to work together on the future of this site," McGlynn wrote in an emailed statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council plans to launch a mental health screening in partnership with Counseling and Mental Health Services, according to UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20.
The platform, which includes a brief questionnaire aimed at identifying students’ mental health concerns, will be both free and confidential, according to Palaniappan.
“I think the idea behind creating something as such, was that a lot of students sometimes feel as if they're struggling but don't quite know whether or not they should contact a mental health professional,” she said.
Palaniappan added that the UC designed the questionnaire to be brief and easy to complete, clocking in at fewer than five minutes for students who fill it out. Universities including Wellesley College and the University of California, Berkeley currently offer similar online mental health screening services.
After completing the screening, the questionnaire will provide feedback regarding whether students are experiencing something “temporary” or if they should seek out more formal help.
“Whatever the results spit out, basically, what it will also give you is relevant information about what you are experiencing whether that’s anxiety or depression or an eating disorder, bipolar disorder,” Palaniappan said. “[It will] also tell you kind of what type of support would be best and show you the types of relevant resources that exist.”
Software company MindWise Innovations will run the questionnaire. The company’s offerings include online mental health tools to provide guidance to patients, according to its website.
Though Palaniappan and UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 started working on the initiative last March, Palaniappan said they had to go through administrative formalities before implementing the screening — including vetting questions and making them Harvard-specific.
In addition to customizing the questions to be specific to Harvard students, Palaniappan said her group also had to ensure the survey wouldn’t present legal problems.
“We also had to go through the process to get approval from the Office of General Counsel, so ensuring that we’re not going to run into any legal troubles,” Palaniappan said. “That kind of took up the summer.”
Beginning next week, the UC will make the questionnaire available to Harvard-affiliates. Palaniappan said that she and Huesa will send out an email to undergraduates once the questionnaire goes live.
“I think it is important to note this is also a University-wide resource,” Palaniappan said. “It is not something specific to the College — but if you are a graduate student or a staff or a faculty member — this applies to all of Harvard’s 22,000 members.”
Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis will meet with Harvard University Information Technology on Tuesday to launch the screening tool, according to Palaniappan. Harvard University Health Services did not respond to a request for comment on the partnership.
Palaniappan said she does not view the questionnaire as a replacement for mental health resources, but that she hopes it will fill a “gap” on campus for students seeking mental health resources by providing immediate feedback and encouraging students to seek help.
“I’m hoping that this system in particular will help with that early level detection,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 20 of the Crimson’s players, the four-year stint of contests in the historic Harvard Stadium comes to a close this Saturday as the Crimson challenges Penn (4-4, 2-3 Ivy) in its last home game of the season. The senior class, which has 14 victories in its tenure of 20 home games, will be honored prior to play against the division rival.
“This senior class is very typical of the senior classes who have come before them in the best possible context,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “By that, I mean they’re tough, high character guys who will go out into this world and will accomplish some really great things.”
The Quakers and the Crimson (4-4, 2-3) enter the contest on nearly equal footing. In this, the 90th meeting between the teams, both have the same season record, the only difference being that Penn lost to Yale and Harvard dropped one to Princeton.
Notwithstanding the singular difference of divisional opponents, the Quakers and the Crimson are on opposite trajectories at the moment. Penn has won its last two contests, dismissing Cornell and Brown in consecutive matchups by a total of three points. Harvard, on the other hand, is in the midst of a three-game losing streak, having dropped each of the most recent three contests by within the margin of a single score. The most recent heartbreak came in overtime to Columbia last weekend.
“That game we never dreamed of losing,” junior quarterback Jake Smith said. “It just goes to show you that you’ve got to take every opponent in the Ivy League seriously. I think everybody in the locker room is pretty pissed off about the way that we’ve been playing because we know that we can do so much better. We really want to get this one.”
When one compares the nature of these victories and defeats, the implications for this week’s contest become clear. The Crimson, over the course of the season, has won three of its four home games. The only loss came at the hands of Dartmouth and its last-second prayer of a throw that was tipped into a Big Green receiver's hands as time expired.
The Quakers, on the other hand, has proved the inverse when competing outside the walls of Franklin Field. The squad has managed only one victory in four contests when on the road. That singular win came in the form of a four-point triumph over Lafayette in week two.
On the ground, senior running back Karekin Brooks leads the visitors. Over the course of the season, the veteran has logged 806 total yards, averaging 115.14 per game. Brooks will be lining up against the nation’s best first-down defense and the league's best rushing defense in Harvard.
“They run the football very well,” Murphy said. “They’re one of the top rushing teams in the Ivy League. They stay on the field a lot and with few exceptions, they score a fair amount of points.”
The quarterback situation for Penn remains more volatile than its nearly one-man backfield. Quarterback Nick Robinson has traditionally been the man to take first snaps behind the center. He’s been solid on the season, completing 154 passes, for an average of 221.75 yards per game, throwing three touchdowns, and surrendering four interceptions. In the Quaker’s homecoming contest with Cornell last weekend, Robinson was limping around the field and eventually pulled by Coach Ray Priore.
Enter junior quarterback Ryan Glover. It took Glover one drive to throw a 40-yard touchdown pass to tie the contest. With less experience this season, Glover has completed only six passes but for 79 yards and a touchdown. His running stats are similar stinted. He’s carried the ball five times for 68 yards.
The third-year was only one of three Penn quarterbacks to throw a touchdown in the Cornell contest. Robinson tossed a strike in the second quarter and so too did sophomore Owen Goldsberry in the fourth. The sophomore’s went 80 yards to Eric Markes.
Hauling in the majority of the trio’s passes are sophomore wide outs Ryan Cragun and Rory Starkey. Cragun leads the team, averaging 108 yards per contest with 756 total yards. The second favorite target is Starkey, who has 498 yards and four touchdowns to his name.
“I think this is one of the less explosive offenses we’ve faced,” captain Wes Ogsbury said. “They have some good skill players but from what I've seen, not the explosiveness, not the complicated play calling from some other offenses particularly like Dartmouth and Princeton. But that doesn’t change anything for us. We’re going to prepare the right way and try to hold them to as little points as possible.”
Against this offense, the Crimson will field a defense that leads the nation in team sacks with 4.63 per game and in fumbles recovered with eight. Senior Brogan McParland boasts a league-leading seven sacks while teammate junior defensive lineman Nasir Darnell has forced three fumbles. Both Darnell and junior linebacker Jordan Hill are tied at the top of the Ancient Eight with two fumble recoveries.
“This week is just like every other week,” Ogsbury said. “We’re trying to minimize big plays, stop the run, and let everything else fall into place.”
Leading the Harvard offensive front is junior quarterback Jake Smith, junior running back Devin Darrington, freshman back Aidan Borguet, senior receiver Cody Chrest, and senior receiver Jack Cook.
“The flat out honest reality is we need to score more points,” Murphy said. “You might have to go back 20-something years to see a Harvard team score one touchdown in eight quarters.”
The squad will face off against a hot Quaker defense. Last week, defensive lineman Emili Prince earned 10 tackles and 2.5 sacks. Over the course of the season, the defender has dropped teams a total of 45 yards with his 11.5 tackles for loss and 52 overall tackles. Senior linebacker Zach Evans leads the team in tackles with 69 and one interception.
On special teams, the Crimson holds the strong advantage. Between two kickers, Penn has made only two field goals on the season in six attempts. Meanwhile, Harvard leads the nation in blocked kicks and blocked punts. With three of his own, sophomore safety James Herring leads the country in blocked punts.
“James Herring is a tremendous football player,” Murphy said. “He has great instincts and he’s applied those instincts to being able to block punts. He’s just got a great knack for it.”
While the Ivy League title is likely secured for Dartmouth, if the Crimson wins out, it has an opportunity to tie Yale for the league’s third place position. This one contest is the sole hurdle Harvard must clear before next weekend’s rendition of The Game.
“The only way you can really focus is by focusing on the task at hand,” Murphy said. “Every game is a new week. Our mantra is ‘our next game is our biggest game.’ So, our biggest game is Penn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tightly-contested finish that was decided by a missed three-pointer, the Crimson edged out a narrow victory over Siena despite being without Noah Kirkwood, Bryce Aiken, and Seth Towns.
The Crimson (3-1) looked to build off of a comfortable win against Maine on Sunday with a victory over Siena (2-2), led by sophomore guard Jalen Pickett — the preseason MAAC player of the year returning to play for the Saints after declaring for the 2019 NBA draft following his freshman campaign. Generating notable interest from NBA teams, Pickett attracted several NBA scouts to Lavietes to watch Thursday’s contest.
The trend of slow offensive starts for the Crimson continued tonight, as Harvard found itself down 15-7 early against a Siena team led by sophomore Donald Carey, who started the game perfect from the field scoring eight points in the first six minutes. Pickett, on the other hand, struggled in the opening minutes, going 0-3 from the field while facing tough defenders in junior Rio Haskett and senior Justin Bassey. After picking up two quick fouls, he found himself a place on the bench for the remainder of the half.
Looking for an offensive spark, coach Tommy Amaker went to his bench early, playing a total of 10 players in the first 10 minutes of the half. Immediately, he found one in freshman Chris Ledlum, who came in sinking triples in three consecutive possessions after not hitting a single one in his first three collegiate appearances.
The freshman continued his hot start throughout the first half, scoring a career high 14 points in only eleven minutes on the floor. With 52 seconds to go in the first, however, Ledlum came down grabbing his ankle in transition. Although he came back after halftime, he played limited minutes in the second half and did not add to his point total.
“We don’t win tonight if he doesn’t have that kind of first half and give us confidence,” Amaker said. “We got down early and he was able to come help dig us out.”
The frequent substitutions allowed multiple players to contribute offensively, leading the Crimson to pick up the scoring towards the end of the half. Contributions from freshmen Idan Tretout and Luka Sakota and junior Danilo Djuricic off the bench added to the three point shooting by Haskett and Bassey. Harvard finally began to find its groove, ending the half on a 13-4 run to go up 37-30.
 The Crimson’s hot end to the first didn’t carry over into the second, however. Sparked by its riveting crowd, Siena began to nag Harvard defensively and generate points off of turnovers. To deal with yet another slow start to a half, Amaker stuck with his original plan, rotating players often to create points. Among these substitutions was captain Henry Welsh, seeing his first action of the season. Playing four minutes in his first game back, Welsh scored in the paint on his only attempt of the night.
Pickett’s woes continued into the second half, as he continued to struggle shooting from the floor. His first points came in the paint with five minutes to go in the game, which he followed up on the next possession with another bucket to keep Siena in the game. The Rochester, N.Y. native finished the game with four points, shooting 20 percent from the field.
The Siena fan section erupted in response to Pickett’s first points, changing the atmosphere in Lavietes to what felt like a road-game atmosphere for the Crimson. Feeding off its crowd, the Saints quickly worked their way back from a seven-point deficit, scoring six straight points including a layup by senior forward Sammy Friday with 46 seconds to go to cut the lead down to one.
After senior Chris Lewis was called for a travel in the paint, Siena found itself with a chance to take the lead. With the shot clock turned off and everyone on their feet, the ball found itself in Carey’s hot hand.
Guarding him was Haskett, who was looking to get one more stop after a game of intense defensive pressure on the Saints’ top scorers. Haskett stayed in front of Carey diligently, forcing the Siena guard to put up an off-balance three with time winding down that missed the mark.
Senior guard Christian Juzang’s two made free throws iced the game for Harvard, which extended its home game win streak to three as the contest ended with a score of 59-56. Although it wasn’t pretty, the close finish was certainly a crucial learning experience for a team loaded with young talent.
“Being in a game where you have to grind it out...that’s huge, especially for our younger guys who haven’t been in those situations,” said Bassey. “Those sorts of moments are really helpful to get in early and have an opportunity to learn to be able to handle those situations when they come down to the Ivy League tournament.”
Ahead for the Crimson is a trip up north to play in Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, where it will face off against Buffalo in the James Naismith Classic on Saturday.

Most Harvard students can boast an intimate relationship with either the Science Center or Sanders Theater. Long lectures with nothing else to do (besides take notes) leave students to find plenty of ways to keep themselves entertained. Here’s a breakdown of people you’ll find if you actually show up to class.
The Frequent Flier
This kid is the epitome of “Section Kid,” with scarily toned triceps from always having their hand raised and a voice that projects to the very last seat in Science Center B. The professors, the TFs, people who show up to lecture (and people who don’t) all know this student’s name. After a giddy jump after they’ve been called on for the third time that day, they’ll spit out a paragraph-long answer. It’s hard not to wonder why they do it — it’s not like most lectures have participation points anyway.
The Ath-Late
The student athlete has it hard. From juggling early morning workouts to scootering across the river to get to lecture, we honestly don’t know how they do it — we can barely manage just going to class. They deserve a break when they roll into lecture late. After all, their scooters can only go so fast.
The Plastic Fanatic
You just woke up after a refreshing five minute lecture nap and you’re attempting to copy your friend’s notes on their laptop, only to see four Urban Outfitters tabs instead of the notes document you were hoping for. This lecture kid has already bought four pairs of jeans and has their credit card propped on their screen, ready to buy another color of their favorite chenille sweater.
The Pro-Procrastinator
This student is always furiously scribbling in their notebook, doing so much work that it’s impressive — but not for this class. No, this student is finishing their GenEd essay or math homework which is due right after this lecture, something that they’ll never stop reminding you about. Nevertheless, they manage to get it done. The speediness of this procrastinator is unparalleled — can you imagine what they’d get done if they worked like this all day?
The Silent Snoozer
You have never seen this kid awake. What color are their eyes? You’ll never know because they’re always asleep. From the moment you set your coat down to the moment you’re stuffing your laptop back into your bag, this kid is knocked out. Their jacket is being used as a blanket and their hat is pulled subtly over their eyes. You don’t know why they’re here, but you secretly wish you were more like them.
Lecture can be exciting with the right lecturer, but sometimes you just have to devote your attention elsewhere, whether it be online shopping or your next class. Maybe next time, just skip lecture and get those extra zzz’s instead.
