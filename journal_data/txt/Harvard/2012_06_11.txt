It is April 12, 2012, a month before the President’s declaration in favor of same-sex marriage, and a group of students are gathering at the Harvard College Woman’s Center to read poetry. They pass around pillows and hunks of bread as they take turns reading aloud from glossy books. They are here to commemorate Adrienne C. Rich ’51, whose death on March 27 marked the passing of one of the twentieth century’s most compelling and controversial poetic voices.
“Her life follows the trajectory of important thought and social moments, it’s amazing,” said Cassandra Euphrat Weston ’14, who co-organized the event along with Jia H. Lee ’12. “It’s a testament to her, not to coincidence, but to her that she was in the forefront personally and politically.” Largely informed by her own feminist and lesbian identity, Rich’s work—both poetic and political—paralleled much of the feminist and gay rights movements of the past fifty years. Yet Rich’s personal trajectory is itself notable.
You can find Rich’s archives at Schlesinger library, in the same Yard where she attended class. Her many papers and diaries, ink-smudged, doodled-on, and worn, reveal a personal evolution as radical as that of her poetics. Born in 1929 to a well-educated Baltimore family, Rich had a strong inclination and talent for writing from an early age. “I have to write of the things within me,” she noted in a diary when she was seventeen. “I could not exist without such an outlet. To put all things into words is the occupation for which my inclinations best suit me.” This inclination showed itself strongly at Radcliffe, where her work received a number of heavy-hitting commendations.
Yet even during her time at Radcliffe, Rich’s political philosophy differed vastly from the ideals she would later adopt—and fight for. “The women who demand ‘equality’ of the sexes, that is to say identity of function in the world, are an unhappy lot, I should think,” Rich wrote in her diaries when she was nineteen. “What a woman most deeply wants is simply to subordinate herself to some man.”
By the seventies, Rich was divorced and out as a lesbian. A feminist and activist for gay and civil rights, she was writing radically personal and political volumes of poetry to great, if often controversial, acclaim.
It is these attributes that make her writing so deeply appealing to many. “I think it was in sophomore year in high school [that] my English teacher gave me her poem ‘Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law,’” said Weston, herself a writer interested in feminism and LGBTQ issues. “At sixteen, I was like—I didn’t know you could write like this, I didn’t know you could do this in poems—that you could make it so big but also so beautiful.” Weston also cited Rich’s groundbreaking use of deeply personal and political themes. “There’s a common conception that for a poem to be political, or for a poem to be personal, the art is going to suffer for that, but Rich is the ultimate proof that it’s not true,” said Weston.
Rich’s political evolution was matched by her evolution of poetic style, a trajectory that has helped to break a less formal, more intimate poetics for contemporary writers. Harvard College Professor of English Stephen L. Burt ’94, who has reviewed Rich’s work, pointed to her unique merits in matching political fervor with poetic strength. “Her early poetry often sounds like Frost or else like Auden,” Burt wrote to The Crimson in an email. “Her late 1960s poetry sounds like nobody else. Its attacks on institutions, traditions, inherited hierarchies and habits, in general, have proven very influential.”
Lloyd Schwartz, Frederick S. Troy Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, also identified her poetry’s contribution to LGBTQ rights. An acquaintance of Rich, he recalls meeting Rich over a dinner party and being impressed both by her charm and commitment to her cause. In the 1950s, Schwartz said, “[Gay] people lost their jobs, people committed suicide, people’s lives were ruined because they were exposed.” Schwartz cited one of Rich’s overtly lesbian works, “Twenty-One Love Poems,” as “a really huge milestone—and it both represented a kind of change in attitude but it was also forcing a change in attitude…and it really made a difference.”
It is an attitude change that, for Rich’s poetry as well as LGBTQ rights at large, comes slowly. At the commemorative gathering, one student told a story about her sister’s high school English class. “She asked her teacher, ‘Why don’t we read any more Adrienne Rich?’” the student recalled. “And he said ‘Oh, we don’t have time to worry about lesbians in this class.’”
Yet it is precisely Rich’s ability to embody a historically marginalized female and lesbian voice that appeals to many of her readers—and it is this voice that Rich endeavored to represent. “To know we are not alone, that our identity is not random but has a history and a meaning shared with others—that our existence has its own special kind of beauty—this is the great force of art to people moving against alienation,” Rich jotted on her program at the ceremony where she was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 1986.
To those inspired by Rich’s work—including the students gathered to read it—this is the great force of her art. “We’re in a country that has no language, no laws,” Rich wrote of lesbian consciousness in “Poem XIII” of “Twenty-One Love Poems.” Rich’s work speaks to the truth of this, to the kinds of experience not captured in the traditional English-class curriculum, to the voices that the cannon has missed. Her poetry invents that missing language; it is an art, which, as it envisions it, invents progress. It is a language, which, if used in all its power, can help change laws.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A freezer malfunction at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center damaged 150 brain samples, including 54 specimens that constituted a third of the largest collection of autism-affected brain tissue in the world before the accidental defrosting.
In a public statement, McLean Hospital Public Affairs and Communications Director Adriana Bobinchock explained that two alarm systems had failed, leaving employees of the hospital where the brains are stored unaware that the freezer was not working.
“A full investigation has been launched to determine what caused the freezer, as well as two alarm systems that should have been triggered by the rising temperature, to fail,” Bobinchock wrote.
Geraldine Dawson, the chief science officer for Autism Speaks, said in a statement that that organization will also conduct an investigation.
“Although this event will affect the availability of tissue for future research, we cannot yet determine the level of impact, but we are confident that we can maintain the momentum of scientific studies based on brain tissue,” Dawson wrote.
Bobinchock noted that the accidentally thawed brain samples may still contain valuable DNA information.
“However, it is unclear whether the samples will be compatible with the full-range of the needs of neuroscientists,” Bobinchock wrote.
HBTRC Director Francine M. Benes could not be reached for comment, but she told the Boston Globe that the collection's worth could not be estimated.
Etty P. Cortes, assistant director at the New York Brain Bank at Columbia University, said that it can be very difficult to estimate how quickly a brain collection can be rebuilt.
She said that the New York Brain Bank lost 4,000 samples to a similar malfunction in 2004 and is still recovering from the accident.
“[Situations like these] are not frequent, but you have to have very good equipment that is working all the time,” Cortes said. “We check the freezers every day to avoid this kind of situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The jockeying over where and when U. S. Senate candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren will face off in a series of debates grew a little more complicated Friday as the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 invited the opponents to a high-profile televised debate in September hosted by Tom Brokaw.
The invitation from Victoria R. Kennedy proposed that the two candidates for the seat that her husband held for more than 40 years face off at a debate at the University of Massachusetts Boston on Sept. 26. The event would be co-sponsored by the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate and the UMass Boston and would be moderated by Brokaw, longtime NBC news anchor.
Warren accepted Kennedy’s invitation on Monday in a press release. Citing the legacy of the late senator, Warren's campaign manager Mindy Myers said the debate was an important part of the Senate race.
“Since this contest is for the office Senator Kennedy held for close to half a century, it is appropriate the candidates honor his memory and many accomplishments by debating the real issues facing working men and women in Massachusetts,” Myers said. “Elizabeth hopes that Scott Brown also accepts this important debate.”
Brown, who currently holds the seat, had yet to accept the invitation at press time. In 2009, Brown beat Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley in a special election following Kennedy’s death.
“Everything is under consideration,” Brown spokesman Colin Reed wrote in an email. “Scott Brown has already committed to four debates, including two radio forums that Elizabeth Warren has refused to accept.”
The debate over debates has been in and out of the news since Warren, a Harvard Law School professor, earned the near-unanimous endorsement of the Democratic Party at its state convention June 2, setting up her contest with Brown. The back-and-forth has provided an opportunity for the dueling camps to trade barbs without having to address major campaign issues in recent weeks.
Both candidates have agreed to two yet-to-be-scheduled televised debates: one hosted by WBZ-TV of Boston and one by a consortium of out-of-state media outlets.
Warren has committed to an additional televised debate and Brown to two radio debates.
Both campaigns have said in the past that they hope to participate in about four debates. The EMK Institute-UMass Boston debate would likely be the most visible, since Kennedy proposed airing it nationally on MSNBC.
In a letter to the candidates on Friday, Kennedy, who chairs the EMK Institute, wrote that the two institutions are “in a unique and ideal position” to host such a debate. “The EMK Institute is non-partisan and committed to educating our public about our government—especially the United States Senate—with an eye toward invigorating public discourse,” she wrote. “UMass Boston, the only public university in the city, is dedicated to opening the doors of educational opportunity.”

"The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess," a production created and produced at Harvard's American Repertory Theater, won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical on Sunday night.
The show, which was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, opened at the ART in August and is currently running on Broadway.
Producer Jeffrey Richards mentioned Harvard in his acceptance speech and said that Diane Paulus, the show's director and a theater professor at Harvard, "gave us a great home to incubate this show at the American Repertory Theater."
Audra McDonald took home the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role of a Musical—her fifth Tony—for her portrayal of Bess.
In an emotional acceptance speech, McDonald described the impact that theater had on her when she was nine years old.
"I was a little girl with a pot belly and Afro puffs, hyperactive and overdramatic, and I found the theater and I found my home, and I found a place to express myself...and to think that the theater was so good to me is mind-blowing," she said.
The musical "Once," which won eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical, also spent its workshop period at the ART.
