After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One might not expect to hear covers of Pink Floyd and Metallica interspersed with popular Pakistani music and classical piano. But this was exactly the setlist at the Harvard College Pakistani Students Association’s concert on Friday, frontlined by rock musician Todd Shea. The concert, which took place at the SOCH, was in support of the Comprehensive Disaster Response Service and celebrated Pakistani culture and friendly U.S.-Pakistani relations. Shea, who performed alongside his son Timothy Jacob Shea (known as TJ), shared the stage with celebrated Pakistani musician and global TED fellow Usman Riaz.
The concert followed a discussion with Shea about rural healthcare in Pakistan, which was moderated by Aun Rahman, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and a founding director of Acumen Fund Pakistan. Shea’s CDRS team has been working in Pakistan since the devastating earthquake in 2005, providing medical assistance and support. The proceeds from Friday’s concert went to support this humanitarian work. After the event, Shea and others spoke with The Crimson.
"We worry about everything, whether it be their bathrooms and their food, to their comfort and their fuel, to their medicine, supplies, and tools, to their transportation—whatever it may be, we deal with that," Shea says of his work. He expressed frustration with the current portrayal of Pakistanis in the American media. "There are 180 million people in Pakistan and in America, the media only tells 2% of the truth 100% of the time," he says. "Pakistan is suffering from that—the militants and the extremists, which are a small percentage of the people in the country...their voices are drowning out the voices of millions of innocent children that just want to do something with their life."
One of these young people is Riaz, a self-taught musician, composer, and filmmaker who performed on Friday. Shea invited Riaz to perform in order to highlight the incredible talent in Pakistan. "[There are] young people who are brilliant like Riaz, extraordinarily brilliant kids who aren’t getting a chance," Shea says.
Riaz, who performed several unusual original compositions. "I hope that [the audience] can feel the things I try to portray through the music because I love telling stories through my work," he says. One of the songs he performed, "Waves," is a musical meditation on the ocean.
TJ Shea says that he hopes his father’s unique position will help him be a successful ambassador for Pakistani culture in America and visa versa. "Because of his unique view, and because he’s an American, maybe more other Americans will listen to him," he says.
In addition to performing in America, Todd Shea collaborates with several notable musicians both in America and abroad to create a cultural exchange through an organization called Sonic Peacemakers. "I’m trying, as a human being who’s from America and loves his country and wants to show the best of America to Pakistan and also bring that story of the best of Pakistan to Americans so that we can come together and do some constructive things together," he says.
The mission of cross cultural communication is one that resonates deeply with TJ Shea. "The reason to bring [these musicians] together is not just to make great music [but also] to show the other side because they don’t get the whole picture of the other side," he says. "We’re all just people. Most of us try to live peacefully and thats what we need to focus on."
Leena Raza ’16, a member of the Harvard College Pakistan Student Association and an organizer of the event, says the group selected Shea in part because of his healthcare in rural Pakistani villages, including in the home town of Malala Yousafzai. "We wanted to support him and give him a space to talk about what really is happening in the area because a lot of the time, even as Pakistanis and Pakistani Americans, we don’t really know what’s going on," Raza says. "Even though he doesn’t speak the language, he’s able to really communicate with these people to the point where they’re so willing to accept him…. I think it’s also a testament to Pakistanis."
TJ Shea says he hopes the impact of the event will go beyond supporting the CDRS fund. "We’re trying to use music to build cultural bridges between different peoples and our first view is the US and Pakistan," he says.

The term "household name" has a literal meaning for jazz musician Eddie Henderson, who grew up with jazz legends such as Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, and John Coltrane coming in and out of his family home. Henderson’s parents were jazz performers and introduced him to many successful artists, and Henderson took up the trumpet at a young age and went on to make a name for himself. He toured with Herbie Hancock at the start of the 1970s and by the end of the decade, he had released seven albums and claimed the No. 44 position on the UK Singles Chart with the single "Prance On." After years of performing concerts nationally and internationally, he has been a faculty member of the Juilliard School since 2007 and continues to perform. Henderson will be appearing at Harvard on Thursday, where he will be discussing his career.
The Harvard Crimson:
 
You grew up surrounded by such legendary jazz musicians. When did you realize the significance of these talents?
Eddie Henderson:
Both of my parents were in show business…. My mother was a dancer in the original Cotton Club, the famous Cotton Club, and my father was a singer in show business—a group called the Charioteers in the heyday of the Harlem Renaissance. And by virtue of my mother being a dancer in the original Cotton Club…her best friends were like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong—Billie Holliday was her roommate—and I could go on and on. So when I was nine years old, she took me to the Apollo Theater just to see Louis Armstrong, and she took me backstage. And that was my first trumpet lesson on his own trumpet—the great Louis Armstrong. But of course, I was just nine years old, so I had no idea of the stature that he held.

THC: How did you get involved in playing music yourself?

THC: How did you get involved in playing music yourself?
THC: How did you get involved in playing music yourself?
EH: After I met Louis Armstrong…I took private lessons—classical music—from nine until 14, and I could play technically very [well]…. Then my father died. My mother married a doctor in San Francisco, and he was the doctor to famous people like John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Duke Ellington. When I came out, I [mostly played] trumpet and classical music, but then…Miles Davis was staying at our house to perform in San Francisco…and he took me to hear him play one night. And when I heard that, that’s when the light went on, and I said to myself, "that’s what I want to do for the rest of my life." You know? I really didn’t realize it was going to turn into the rest of my life.
But this is when I was in high school, so I was playing music at the conservatory, and I was also a competitive figure skater—the first black figure skater on this planet to ever compete in competitions. I won the National Championship, so my disciplines were studying music, getting good grades in school, and figure skating, because I was fanatical about that—on the ice about 5:30 every morning.
THC: How did you balance those roles as a figure skater, jazz musician, and student?
EH: You have to be really disciplined and concentrate on what you’re doing in the moment. Some people practice and look out the window at a pretty girl or whatever instead of listening to how they sound on the instrument…. You have to have solitude and be serious. Same thing for learning to figure skating. So once you learn discipline at an early age, you can do any number of professions.
THC: You are a musician but also went to medical school and spent several years as a practicing psychiatrist. Why did you choose a career in medicine?
EH: My stepfather, who was a doctor…didn’t like me and I didn’t like him, so I remember when I was 15, he challenged me and said I [would] never be a doctor as high-level as he—I’m just gonna be a bum. He challenged the wrong person, so I said, "watch this," and that’s why I became a doctor. You know, it all worked out in the end. I graduated medical school from Howard University in Washington, D.C., playing music all the time, but then I moved back to San Francisco to do my internship and residency in psychiatry…. Then at the end of the residency I got a chance to go play with Herbie Hancock—the great Herbie Hancock…. I said, "anybody can be a doctor, but I’m not going to give up this opportunity of a lifetime," because that’s what I really wanted to do: to play music. And that’s when it became the rest of my life.
THC: Improvisation is what makes jazz so special, but it can also be very intimidating. How do you help people get comfortable with improvisation?
EH: I say, "music is a language, right?" and everybody in the world improvises every day of their life in the language that they speak…. You improvise because you know the language. In order to improve in the language of music, you have to know—like when you learn a word in English, you learn how to pronounce the word, you know how to make a sentence, then you can converse and have a discussion. Well, that’s all improvising is. You learn your basics, which is a scale and the different keys and how to technically or mechanically play your instrument, and you’re on your way. But everybody can improvise. They do it every day in the language that they know best, but you have to study the instrument in order to speak eloquently through it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m pretty good at farting.
That may seem repulsively immodest, but it needed to be said. My farts leave my body so swiftly and so silently, that they often go unappreciated. That is, until smelled. But at that point, the only experience is pain—leaving no recognition for the great control exercised by the man who dealt. It’s really unfair, and it has left to me to toot…my own horn.
Yet there is one place in the world where my skills are rendered completely worthless: Winthrop House’s library. Every time I study there, in between the stacks of old stuffy books and underneath the portraits of old stuffy white people, I can’t help but make a very distinct farting noise whenever I pass gas.
After some experimentation with positioning (standing up), I’ve found that the secret is in the chairs. Each seat is one of those wooden, black Harvard chairs with the brown arms and gold seals. These are crafted in a specific way to suddenly turn hot air into a powerful vibrato. And it’s not only me—I’ve seen it happen to others when I’m there, resulting in a shameful retreat from muffled laughter into the cold, Cambridge night.
After years of honing the mature skill of the silent fart, everything comes undone in just a few seconds of butt-cheek buffering. Middle school embarrassment and awkwardness returns. And at the very root of it lies Harvard’s oldness and prestige in the form of its chairs.
This Harvard-induced regression got me thinking about how far I’ve come and not come since middle school. Like middle school, a lot of social interactions at Harvard are awkward. Many chalk this up to differences in backgrounds between students. But I also think there is another source to it—the variety of ages we portray.
According to the American Psychological Association, our generation is hitting puberty at younger ages than ever before, but we are also becoming socially defined adults at older ages. Thus the “in-between” zone of adolescence has grown. This brings us to the great collegiate paradox: College is a socially sanctioned time to make your last mistakes before adulthood, but it’s also the time to start growing up. And I think among the Harvard adolescent population, there is more “adult” than average, which brings out a lot of the awkwardness lurking in the paradox.
Let’s start with speech. Most of my friends from home don’t know “adult talk,” and I still struggle with it too. Growing up, talking to adults is boring, confusing, or painful. Talking to kids about kids things is much better. At times, it is similar here, as I talk to my friends about the finer points of masturbation or Dragon Ball Z. But then those friends go off and interview Bill Gates for a publication, work together with Harvard professors on research, schmooze a guy at a big law firm, and so on. And then later we may even talk among ourselves over dinner on “adult” topics like gun control, philosophy, hipster culture, masturbation, and so on again. The result is that on an email list, at a meeting, or at dinner, there are times when you want to joke around in a childish way, but it’s hard to tell when it’s offensive to do so or simply the wrong time.
Another adult aspect is self-driven hard work. Whether it is to do well in school, make a lot of money, make change in the world, or make a lot of money, we work hard at it. Normally you push a kid to study, but kids here are not content to be pushed. Whether for inner or outer incentives, Harvard students push themselves and work hard to the point where mental health becomes an issue. And when norms come up like complaining about work, we can interpret them as childish, veiled brags or a masked way of “reaching out” that can have serious, adult consequences. Distinctions become confused. Things get uncomfortable.
This strange dichotomy between adult and kid also seems to manifest itself in Harvard’s age and prestige. The irony of young people “innovating” at a place known for being old has its consequences, especially in the oldest student groups. The main humor organization on campus—the would-be center of the school’s immaturity—is also known for its past and pre-professionalism. Harvard frats-that-go-by-another-name serve as centers for parties and fun, but are also known for their histories of well known, respectable men. And at a certain old newspaper, a columnist even writes like a kid but resorts to using “adult,” pretentious terms like “vibratos” for farts.
All these examples show that we are growing up, and quickly at that. At a place known for its great age, Harvard students grow older not only while at their school, but also because of it. Still, I don’t think any of us consider ourselves completely mature adults—not yet. So there is a strange lag that persists. That’s probably not a bad thing, though. There’s bound to be some discomfort in transition.
But as I write from Winthrop Library, on a full stomach, I encourage people to appreciate that fleeting child inside for as long as it stays. Because it too shall pass, and we’ll be left wondering where it came from and where it went. For now, I just hope me, and the people immediately around me, enjoy it while it’s still here.

In mid-October, the City of Boston approved Harvard University’s multi-million dollar expansion into Allston. The nine-building, 1.4 million square foot set of projects will be the university’s largest development in decades. These projects have the potential to bring about a transformation of an underdeveloped section of the city, creating a “new Allston” similar to the Kendall Square rise in the ’80s and’90s and the more recent dramatic growth of the South Boston “Innovation District.”
For many residents of this working-class Boston neighborhood, Harvard’s expansion represents an opportunity to be something more than a forgotten annex or a cut-through for surburbanites.A new science center, modern apartment buildings and upscale restaurants promise to make the community a destination—not just a parking lot or commuting thoroughfare.
For longtime residents, who grew up in the shadow of one of the greatest academic institutions in the world, the development means that the goodwill and successes that Harvard brought to Cambridge may finally flow across the Charles River to benefit the Allston community.
The project promised to be a transformation—or so neighbors thought.
During years of planning and hundreds of community meetings, Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority encouraged local residents to think outside the box in new ideas for their community. Mayor Thomas Menino, in his introductory comments for the North Allston Strategic Framework planning process, noted the “the wide range of issues and concerns—ranging from housing and transportation to open space and cultural activities—shared by members of this diverse community.”
He described the result of this planning as “a set of ideas and goals that will shape North Allston’s future as a strong residential neighborhood, a vibrant area of economic activity, and an exciting hub of intellectual teaching and research.”
According to regulation, accompanying any large-scale development project is a set of community benefits meant to alleviate the impacts of years of construction and traffic, changes in character to the neighborhood and added housing and commercial space that may stress existing resources. In deciding on a community benefits package for Allston, Harvard committed not only to fund ideas related to housing, education and public realm but also toestablish a “transformative project.”
Sadly, the package of “benefits” presented at a community meeting November 4barely scratches the surface at transforming anything. Harvard may benefit greatly from new Executive Education facilities, renovated dormitories, and more, but life for the residents of Allston will for the most part go on as it has, with years of disruption from Harvard’s construction.
Instead of matching or exceeding the precedents set by colleges and universities across the country, of how privileged, wealthy,and forward-thinking institutions can make a difference in community development, Harvard’s offer is miserly in comparison. For instance, while Yale University hascommitted a total investment of $25 million in incentives for employees to become homeowners in New Haven over the last two decades, Harvard’s “generous” offer of $3 million over the next 10 years doesn’t come close. Similarly, Harvard’s proposal to support $500,000 of capital improvements at the K-8 Gardner Pilot Academy over the next 10 years ismuch appreciated, but Harvard doesn’t hold a candle to the University of Pennsylvania, which is providinga contribution of $1,330 per student to a public school in Philadelphia and will invest $7 million in the same timeframe.
Many of the projects proposed as part of Harvard’s package—pedestrian crossings at Soldiers Field Road and improvements to streetscapes—are as much of a benefit to Harvard athletes and Harvard’s tenantsas they are to residents here. The University’s failure to include dedicated funds for the upgrade of the abutting public park, Smith Field, or new security equipment for the Boston police will not mitigate the impact of new housing units coming online due to Harvard’s construction projects.
The $8.25 million “transformative project,” which is included in part of Harvard’s community benefits package, is nothing more than extension of its current Ed Portal. To truly make a transformation, the University should commit to outcome measures such as helping Allston/Brighton students move into the top tier of MCAS scores, fostering economic development to reduce the unemployment rate to point that it matchesthat of Cambridge,and increasing homeownership to a healthy 30 percent.
If Harvard wants to be a paragon for universities worldwide, there’s much more it can do.

Last Tuesday, Boston voters elected Marty Walsh as mayor—the city’s first new mayor in 20 years. Or did they? While most would assume the people were the ones determining who would fill Mayor Menino’s shoes, this election reflects a wider crisis in campaign finance reform, or lack thereof, that defines contemporary politics. Regardless of one’s opinion about whether Walsh was the better candidate, we must ask the question: How much does the common individual’s vote matter in a political environment in which, last year, 0.40 percent of the national population provided 63.5 percent of all individual campaign contributions?
After the Citizens United v. FEC and Speechnow.org v. FEC decisions in 2010, the Supreme Court opened the floodgates for corporations and unions alike to make unlimited political expenditures through new political action committees called SuperPACs. As a result, money has become even more essential to winning elections. In 2008, 94 percent of Congressional candidates who won their elections raised more money than their opponents.
Throughout Boston’s mayoral campaign, money poured into the city at disturbingly high levels. Paul McMarrow of CommonWealth Magazine calculated that on a per capita basis, “SuperPACs and unions have poured four times more money into Boston than they’ve put into New York, and have spent 13 percent more than the completed contest in Los Angeles.’” According to McMarrow, in Seattle, a city of comparable size to Boston, outside groups spent less than one-fifth of Boston’s total. Professor Robert G. Boatright of Clark University explained one of the reasons these groups invested so heavily in this election: “You can put a lot of money in a local election really fast,” and “score an easy victory really quickly.”
Labor unions, both inside and outside Massachusetts, played an indisputable role in financing Walsh’s campaign. According to a Boston Globe article, “organized labor and other groups have spent $2.5 million on television ads, paid canvassers, mailings, and more.” Failed Boston Mayoral candidate John Connolly, on the other hand, received only $792,000 from outside donations. By August 1, pro-Walsh unions and SuperPACs were outspending every candidate in the field.
We did not write this article to attack Walsh or labor unions, but instead to ask a bigger question about why this country finds this election system acceptable. As the American political process limps along, we cannot let this trend of legally sanctioned corruption to continue. Elections should not be bought and sold. Rather, they should be accessible to candidates from a variety of backgrounds and focused on the constituents’ needs.
Fortunately, we already know how to make that happen. Public financing systems, which exist in 10 states around the country, allow candidates to rely exclusively on small individual donations through matching public funds. In fact, Massachusetts voters opted for such a system by a two to one margin in 1998. In 2003, however, the legislature repealed the law. As members of Harvard College Democracy Matters, a nonpartisan student group committed to combatting the corrupting influence of money in politics, we ask that the Massachusetts legislature reinstate a robust public financing system. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be a priority for the state legislature, where S.323, a public finance bill proposed by State Senator James Eldridge, is languishing in committee.
At the same time, we ask that you stay informed about a Supreme Court case that may have even wider implications for campaign finance reform, McCutcheon v. FEC.  If the Court rules in favor of the plaintiff, certain limits on individual federal campaign donations could disappear entirely, giving wealthy donors unlimited, direct influence over political candidates.
Our broken system, wherein certain people can buy—and are already buying—significant shares in political decision making, stands in opposition to the ideals of democratic equality at the heart of our national identity. It’s time we take back the vote and hold our politicians accountable to governing for all people, not just those with the most money.

If there is any regional conference at Harvard that has achieved its goal of on-campus exposure, it is Harvard Arab Weekend, a three-and-a-half-day long conference of keynote addresses, panels, and networking sessions that concluded just this past Sunday. As the seventh iteration of North America’s largest pan-Arab conference, Harvard Arab Weekend, organized by the Harvard Arab Alumni Association and a large team of student volunteers, has set the bar for regional and national conferences at Harvard, which tend to operate more as boutique events than must-attend annual gatherings.
We admire the broad scope of Harvard Arab Weekend, which included keynote addresses from such leaders as Queen Rania of Jordan and such academic luminaries as Roger Owen, as well as a start-up competition, and panel discussions about education, water scarcity, Syrian refugees, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also provided opportunities for students to mingle with opinion leaders and potential employers. The conference’s 2013 motto, “Cherish—Challenge—Change,” represented a healthy spirit of reverence for the Arab world’s cultural legacy, desire to power through its obstacles, and objection to the narrow paradigms through which the Middle East is seen internationally at this tumultuous point in history.
The Arab experience is not, Harvard Arab Weekend reminds us, all sectarian conflict and political deadlock. It is filled with entrepreneurial promise and human developmental challenges as well, and Western audiences ought to be reminded of this from time to time.
We are concerned that Harvard Arab Week has strong ties to a well-heeled Gulf political elite. Among the platinum sponsors of the conference is Saudi Aramco, the state oil and gas company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—valued at $10 trillion and a critical asset of the Saudi state. One of the conference’s two media sponsors is Al-Arabiya, a regional news network owned by members of the Saudi royal family and organized in direct competition with Qatar’s Al-Jazeera. Keynote speakers, who spoke pleasant words about reform, hailed from the royal families of Morocco, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, authoritarian cliques, which have preached reform in the Levant and Egypt, but prefer tightlycontrolled stability at home.
Harvard Arab Weekend’s ties to conservative, oil-producing regimes under the tutelage of a stability-concerned American hegemon raise questions about its efficacy as a platform for new understandings of the Middle East. “Change” is a fine slogan, but it is meant by the Saudi regime—a supporter of Harvard Arab Weekend, Harvard University, and the United States government—in the sense of “for thee, not for me.”
However, it is to the credit of Harvard Arab Weekend’s big profile and engaging topics that we are having this conversation at all. Would-be reformers from Africa, South Asia, and East Asia would do well to follow suit, minus the autocratic sponsors.

Recent government-proposed action to ban trans fats has highlighted over a decade of work by the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard University Dining Services, and the City of Cambridge to promote community well-being through early elimination of the ingredient.
The Food and Drug Administration announced a policy change last Thursday that would require all American food makers to eliminate artificial trans fats from their products.This policy, if approved after a 60-day period of comment, would bring an end to the use of partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of artificial trans fats in American diets.
Such fats, commonly found in popcorn, crackers, cookies, and other snacks, have long been known to cause heart disease and premature death. The FDA estimates that the ban could save 7,000 lives a year while preventing 20,000 heart attacks, according to its official statement.
“More attention in this direction brings more recognition to the Department of Nutrition as being a leader in this area—of trying to make changes for the better,” said Guy A. Crosby of the School of Public Health, who teaches Nutrition 209: “Food Science and Technology.”
According to Crosby, Harvard has been a long-time leader in advocating for healthier foods. Crosby attributed some of the research advances in the food science arena to Walter C. Willett, the chair of the School of Public Health’s Department of Nutrition.
Crosby pointed to Willett as one of the leaders of the campaign to disclose the safety issues of using trans fats in various foods.
Over the last decade, many food makers have begun to phase out trans fats from their products. Cities including New York, San Francisco, and Boston banned trans fats from restaurants, and Cambridge followed suit in 2006.
HUDS worked with the School of Public Health to begin understanding and removing trans fats from their menus in the early 2000s, said Crista Martin, HUDS Director of Marketing and Communications.
“The School of Public Health has this phenomenal Department of Nutrition, and we use their healthy eating plate, their healthy eating pyramid, and their overall recommendations to help guide our menu planning,” Martin said.
In 2003, the FDA issued a final ruling requiring that Nutrition Facts labels contain trans fats listings on food products. The policy took effect in 2006, but many consumers had already changed their dietary preferences, according to the official statement.
“In 2006, there was a lot of resistance saying that the industry didn’t have alternatives, food prices would become more expensive and saturated fat intake would go up,” said Dariush Mozaffarian, associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology.
As a vehicle for promoting public health, the FDA’s decisions reflect scientific discoveries and trends in the American diet. FDA determinations often affect entire industries, from large foodstuff corporations to the dining halls at Harvard.
“Ultimately, you as the person who’s eating has to decide what you put in your mouth and should have that choice from us in terms of a range of options,” Martin said. “With trans fats, it’s not a question of preference. For us, it was a no brainer to take it out.”

As Harvard students with families in southeast Asia sought assurance of their relatives’ safety this weekend, students groups on campus began mobilizing relief efforts to support victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which made landfall in the Philippines at the end of last week.
“I didn’t think much of Haiyan because we were so used to typhoons,”  Lance B. Katigbak ’16 said. “Over 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year.”
Katigbak , a member of the Harvard Philippine Forum, was born and raised in Muntinlupa City of Metro Manila and lived in the Philippines his entire life, until transferring from the University of Philippines to Harvard last semester.
On Friday, the storm swept across central Philippines, ravaging the country and later making landfall in Vietnam, Taiwan, and China.  With wind speeds up to 195 miles per hour and at least 10,000 reported casualties so far, meteorologists have labeled Haiyan as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded.
“Once all the news articles started coming out about the magnitude of the typhoon, I began to feel worried,” Katigbak said. “This typhoon was so devastating not only because it was incredibly strong, but also because the area it hit was very weak.”
For those Harvard students with families currently living in the Philippines, news of the typhoon caused immediate concern for the safety of their relatives.
Michelle D.L. Ferreol ’15,  Co-President of HPF and a Crimson news editor, said that initial calls after the storm to her family in Manila went unanswered. Eventually, she was able to make contact with relatives and confirm their safety.
“My family had gotten the lighter end of it, so I was really grateful for that,” Ferreol said.
Other students with relatives in the Philippines, however, said that they are still anxious to hear updates on their family members’ status.
“Some of our HPF members are still waiting to hear back from relatives in affected areas,” HPF Co-President Shannen D. Kim ’15 said.
Relief efforts at Harvard are underway, including an HPF-planned benefit concert called “Singing in the Rain” on Friday at 8 p.m. in Quincy Dining Hall. The group hopes to raise money and awareness of the disaster and those affected—goals they pursued with a similar event in 2009 following Typhoon Ketsana.
“Filipino students from many graduate schools at Harvard have reached out to us and are helping us organize this event,” Kim said. “Many students from schools in the greater Boston…will be in attendance and be performing in the show.”
Ferreol added that the University agreed to waive venue fees and provide security guards for the event.
She also said that HPF is planning long-term relief efforts, such as film screenings and dinners, in conjunction with the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, which sponsored relief events after the 2011 earthquake in Japan.
Viet D. Tran ‘16, the Vice President of the Harvard Vietnamese Association said that the HVA would love to get involved in relief efforts, but mobilizing contacts on the ground in Vietnam has been more difficult than usual, since Typhoon Haiyan hit Vietnam more recently than the Philippines. Still, Tran said that he was optimistic.
“They are very resilient people,” he said of the region’s inhabitants. “It’ll be difficult, but they will be able to get through it. They will definitely need help, though.”

Avraham Burg, an author and former chairman of the Jewish Agency of Israel, offered a new model for approaching Israeli-Palestinian relations at a talk sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University.
Burg spoke Tuesday evening in Tsai Auditorium as part of a series on the Samuel L. and Elizabeth Jodidi Lectures, which are meant to promote global tolerance and world peace.
Burg argued that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not about real estate, but about cyclic politics and history. He stated that behind the conflict rests a deeply rooted psycho-political tension, in which two national traumas compete with one another.
Both Israel and Palestine have generated national identities that are contingent upon there being an external enemy, Burg claimed. On the one hand is an Israeli national identity born out of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, and on the other, a Palestinian identity centered largely upon the ‘Nakba,’ the widespread displacement of Palestinians from their national homeland. According to Burg, if peace is to be achieved, both nations need to move beyond their respective traumas.
“If we want peace, both sides need to engage with the question of what the prices of integration are,” he said.
Burg also spoke about the current political environment in the Middle East, one that he believes is undergoing a rapid process of national and regimental restructuring. These circumstances, Burg asserted, provide an opportune breeding ground for a mutual reconsideration of the status-quo with internal reflection among all parties.
Burg presented a three-pronged proposal to confront the reality facing Israelis and Palestinians today. First, he reccomended an inclusive discourse about fundamental civic rights to all those affected in Israel and Palestine, second, a practical approach to a two-state solution founded upon a mutually recognized moral-legal system, and third, a seamless cooperation between both nations that seeks to bolster their respective goals.
The audience, comprised of faculty, students, and members of the community, expressed conflicting reactions to Burg’s arguments.
“I think his ideas are important in moving beyond the current reality and politics,” said Salma Abu Ayyash, a Palestinian national and local resident of Cambridge. “I’m still disappointed that he would not confront this idea of colonialism. He is minimizing the whole idea of territory.”
An Israeli student in Winthrop House, Moriya Blumenfeld ’16, took a different stance.
“We won’t find a common ground unless we expose ourselves to all the opinions and try to reach somewhere in the middle,” Blumenfeld said. “He is thinking outside the box, and at this point, we need someone who thinks outside of the box.”

Although most individuals consume cereals and breads without giving much thought to the ingredients in the food, according to a panel that met Tuesday evening at the Geological Lecture Hall, modern citizens must begin to consider the larger implications that their food may have. 
 At an event sponsored by the Peabody Museum, panelists met to discuss the history of different varieties of wheat and the condition of modern wheat in light of environmental pressures such as increasing temperature and varying water levels. 
 According to Jade D’alpoim Guedes, a former Radcliffe Institute Graduate Student Fellow and long time archeological researcher, while there are 19,000 different varieties of wheat, “most farmers only use three.” Despite the seemingly vast amount of new grocery products each year, “ there is not much in our diet that is changing,” D’alpoim Guedes said. 
 Faced with such homogeny, D’alpoim Guedes fears the impact that the changing population and climate could have on our food sources. From the history of plants and diseases, D’alpoim Guedes believes that it has been shown that a lack of diversity can make a food supply vulnerable in the face of new diseases and conditions. 
“When you are only growing one variety of plant, such as a potato, when you have disease known as a blight, it can cause massive devastation,” D’alpoim Guedes said. 
Eli Rogosa, Director of the Heritage Grain Conservancy, offered tangible evidence on the benefits of diversity and less conventional wheat planting and harvesting practices. 
“When a crop loses its biodiversity, it loses the capacity to adapt to evolving diseases, pests, and weather extremes,” said Rogosa.
Since modern wheat lacks variability, Rogosa, who farms 12 acres of wheat in Western Massachusetts, turns to a little known ancient wheat type known as landrace, or a local and long term domesticated variety of a crop. Explaining the appeal of landrace wheats, Rogosa explained that  they are safer for those with gluten allergies and have significantly higher nutritional values.
 In addition, Rogosa addressed the evident concern over yield for landrace wheats. After half a decade of researching and recording, Rogosa said that “landraces actually yield higher than the modern wheats.”
 As the current market for wheat stands, according to both D’alpoim Guedes and Rogosa, landrace wheats are largely unknown and subsequently ignored. But D’alpoim Guedes believes that as the populace becomes more educated about such varieties, landrace wheats may gain a larger appeal.

Gore Vidal’s lifelong complicated relationship with Harvard has taken a new turn from beyond the grave. 
After the late literary icon changed his will in the final year of his life to bequeath the entirety of his multimillion-dollar fortune to the University, Vidal’s half-sister Nina Straight is now challenging the will on the grounds that Vidal was not mentally sound when he disinherited members of his family in favor of the University. A court hearing regarding the case is scheduled for Nov. 22 in Los Angeles County.
Citing Straight, the New York Times reported on Friday that Vidal’s assets are valued at $37 million, though this number was not confirmed by representatives of the estate. While a donation of this size might be small change for a University that is conducting a $6.5 billion capital campaign, the dispute between Straight and the estate has attracted national attention in recent days.
Thus far, Harvard has remained on the sidelines of the ongoing quarrel. “The University has been provided with notice of an interest under Mr. Vidal’s testamentary plan and is aware that there are pending court proceedings related to it. Harvard is not involved in those proceedings and awaits resolution of all issues,” Colin Manning, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said in a statement.
The executor of Vidal’s estate, Andrew S. Auchincloss, did not respond to an emailed request for comment on this article on Monday, though Adam Streisand, Auchincloss’s lawyer, told the New York Times in a statement that he believes Straight’s claims have “no merit.”
Though he left his fortune to Harvard, Vidal, who died in 2012 at the age of 86, was never formally affiliated with the University.
In a 2007 interview, he told journalist Jon Wiener that he had aspired to attend Harvard as a young man. But after graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, Vidal eschewed college to enlist in the Navy. By the time he completed his military service, he had already written his 1946 novel “Williwaw” and had changed his mind about Harvard.
Reflecting on his mindset at the time, he told Wiener, “My first book was already being published. I said, ‘I'm going to be told how to write by somebody at Harvard.’ I said, 'This is too great a risk.'"
Despite his reluctance, Vidal did lecture at Harvard from time to time as he gained prominence as a writer. He recalled that in one lecture early in his career, “There was a big audience, and many of them were my classmates from Exeter, who were overage juniors and seniors in what looked to be their mid-forties. I came out cheerily, as is my wont, and I've never felt such hatred radiating. They’d all predicted my total failure, because I was not to go to Harvard and meet a publisher or an agent—which is, I think, why they went."
More recently, Vidal delivered the 1992 William E. Massey Sr. Lectures at Harvard, a series of talks that he entited “Screening History.” In 2002, he transferred his papers from the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research at the University of Wisconsin to Harvard’s Houghton Library.
Vidal was known to be insecure about his lack of a college degree, and he sustained a complicated relationship with academia throughout his adult life. Middlebury College professor Jay Parini, a novelist and close friend of Vidal’s who is penning his biography, wrote in an email on Tuesday that Vidal would denounce of the “hicks and hacks of academe” while speaking admiringly of professors and colleges.
Parini wrote that Vidal thought of Harvard as “the Platonic ideal of a university,” adding that Vidal “often spoke in warm terms of Harvard, and he was happy about the way the Houghton Library had treated him and his papers. He believed his legacy would be secure there.”
Parini recalled several instances in which he dined with Vidal in the Harvard Faculty Club, where Vidal was “in his element.”
 Parini continued, “John Kenneth Galbraith and others had lunch with us one day, and Gore later said to me: ‘That's what conversation must sound like on Mount Olympus.’”

When Twitter made its debut on the public market this past Thursday, its initial price pop generated significant enthusiasm among investors. But despite this hype, several Harvard professors interviewed this week suggested that the social media giant’s stock might not be worthy of your investment.
Though the stock closed at $44.90 per share at the end of the first day of trading, about 73 percent above its initial public offering price of $26 set the day before, the future prospects of those who bought in remain unclear. While Twitter’s current business model derives some revenue from advertisers, it does not currently earn enough to turn a profit.
Jesse M. Fried ’86, a Harvard Law School professor who focuses on securities regulation and other corporate issues, pointed out that Twitter’s initial investors likely included those who were most confident about the company’s prospects.
“If Twitter were to auction off one share, it would go to the most optimistic person about Twitter,” Fried said. “The price that that person would pay for that share is not necessarily what a hundred people are going to pay for Twitter’s shares when all of the shares get released.”
Stock prices in the week since the company went public appear to align with Fried’s theory. Twitter’s stock closed at $41.90 on Tuesday, about 7 percent less than Thursday’s closing price.
Though it is too early to predict whether or not investors looking to sell in six to 12 months will benefit from the tech startup, Harvard Business School associate professor Lauren H. Cohen said that most IPOs end up underperforming.
“IPOs tend to be overvalued and have low returns in the first year,” Cohen said. “I wouldn’t invest in an IPO unless it were a small part of a diversified portfolio.”
Cohen pointed to a 1991 study conducted by University of Florida finance professor Jay R. Ritter, which concluded that IPOs are statistically likely to underperform similar firms over a period of three years.
Twitter’s public offering raises questions about how the company’s business model might change to begin earning profit for investors, according to Fried.
“They don’t just have to succeed,” Fried said. “They have to succeed in a big enough way to generate enough profits to generate the market capitalization that they have.”
Jonathan L. Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, expressed optimism in an email on Tuesday that Twitter might be able to achieve the necessary changes.
“Twitter's real power is that it's a platform,” wrote Zittrain, who also holds appointments at the Law School, the Kennedy School, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “If you're ‘microblogging,’ chances are good you're using Twitter to do it, and the company controls the APIs in and out, so third party apps are dependent on Twitter's goodwill.”
Adding that this control will be the factor that establishes Twitter’s value, Zittrain said it will “push the company to have to reconcile stockholders' clamor for its hegemony with its embrace of free speech and open standards.”

American politics today suffers from too much emphasis on partisanship, but eliminating the party system would probably not be effective, said Alan K. Simpson in a lecture at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics Tuesday night.
“In this country today, there is much hatred. And it is a very corrosive force,” said Simpson, who is co-chairman of the United States National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and a former director of the IOP. He added that he sees a lack of trust in Congress, where simple actions, like shaking hands, are largely lost.
Still, Simpson expressed doubt that eliminating parties altogether was a good solution. “You’d find there a loss of freedom of speech; a loss of freedom of self,” he said of countries without partisanship.
Simpson did not hesitate to share his own viewpoints—some more reflective of his political affiliation than others.
“It doesn’t matter by what name you call it,” Simpson said of the Affordable Care Act, for example. “It won’t work.” Specifically, he expressed skepticism of the health care plan’s affordability given pre-existing health issues including smoking, drinking, diabetes, and the aging U.S. population.
Simpson also had harsh words for Tea Party politicians. “The [Tea Party] doesn’t deserve the title of party,” he said, calling instead for a return to what he deemed the traditional philosophies of the Republican party—limited government and personal privacy.
Simpson’s perspective on abortion was more measured. While he stated that he found abortion morally problematic, he added that it was a “deeply intimate decision” and that “legislators should not vote on it.”
Simpson’s talk, the 2013 Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics, was sponsored by The Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. The event began with the presentation of the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism to Leonard Pitts, Jr. a columnist for the Miami Herald and winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary.
Auden S. Laurence ’16, a member of the JFK Forum Committee, said she looks forward to these yearly lectures. “I can’t say that I agree with everything that [Simpson] said from a political standpoint, but one thing I can certainly say is that I respect his emphasis on compromise,” she said.
 
Carrie Devine, director of the JFK Forum, called Simpson’s talk “refreshing” and praised him for being “inclusive.” 
“He might be controversial to some, but he helps set an example of how to reach across the aisle and I think that’s right up the alley of the forum,” said Devine.

UPDATED: November 13, 2013, at 11:30 p.m.
Sandra F. Naddaff ’75, a senior lecturer on literature and comparative literature and former Mather House Master, will serve as the next Dean of the Harvard Summer School, Harvard announced on Wednesday.
Naddaff, whose appointment is effective immediately, fills a position that has been vacant since July, when former Summer School Dean Donald H. Pfister was appointed as interim Dean of the College in the wake of Evelynn M. Hammonds' resignation from the College deanship.
“I am delighted to be joining the Harvard Summer School and am especially excited by the opportunity to work with such a broad range of programs and students, both here on our Cambridge campus and abroad,” Naddaff said in the press release announcing her appointment.
Naddaff’s roots at Harvard run deep. After attending the College, she went on to secure a Masters degree and Ph.D. in comparative literature from Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1978 and 1983, respectively. She began teaching in the Comparative Literature Department soon after, and served as one of Mather's House Masters from 1993-2010 alongside her husband, Leigh G. Hafrey ’73. Today, in addition to her lecturing duties, she serves as director of studies for Harvard’s Literature Department and as director of the Freshman Seminar program.
In her new role as Summer School Dean, Naddaff will have the responsibility of overseeing 6,000 students in over 300 courses both at Harvard and around the world.
“Our goal every day is to extend the high quality Harvard is known for to students from around the world,” Dean of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert said in the press release. “Having Sandra lead the Summer School and our existing amazing team assures that we will achieve those goals for the students who come here to live the Harvard experience in the summer months."
Colleagues praised the choice of Naddaff as Summer School Dean, pointing to her experience as a former House Master and head of the Freshman Seminar program as factors that make her well-suited for the job.
“As Director of Studies in the Literature Program, Director of the Freshman Seminar Program, and former House Master at Mather House, she brings deep knowledge of the College to this position,” wrote Christie McDonald, professor of French language and literature and of comparative literature, in an email. “The Summer School will have a sure hand to guide it and a wonderful person at the helm."
Literature professor William M. Todd echoed McDonald’s sentiment. “She has been a wise adviser in our literature concentration, an inspired teacher, and an effective leader,” he wrote in an email. “I’m sure she will do a wonderful job as Dean of the Summer School. Her experience as a House Co-Master, together with her experience as a director of studies makes her the perfect candidate for this deanship.”

A recent scientific expedition to the Cape Melville rainforest in Australia, led in part by a Harvard researcher, resulted in the discovery of three new vertebrate species. The scientists identified a golden colored skink, a leaf-tailed gecko, and a boulder-dwelling frog—all of which have been isolated in their environment for millions of years.
Tropical biologist Conrad Hoskin of James Cook University and Timothy G. Laman, a researcher at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology and a National Geographic photographer, headed the team that made the discovery. 
The rainforest, which is approximately nine miles long, is surrounded by large granite boulders and isolated from the rest of the Cape. Early on, Hoskin said he recognized the scientific potential of an area of such seclusion. 
“The rainforest on top is very isolated from other rainforest areas and, if it had been persistent over millions of years, I believed it would surely have unknown species,” Hoskin said. “I decided that one day I must explore it.”
Hoskin’s opportunity arose earlier this year when he partnered with Laman and received funding from the National Geographic Expeditions Council. However, getting to the rainforest proved harder than expected. The crew had to be helicoptered in and had to land on treacherous granite boulders. 
Once in the rainforest, though, the team was quick to make discoveries. The first was a Cape Melville Shade skink (Saproscincus saltus), a lizard-like reptile with long limbs. 
“The skink lizard is unique in being golden and having long legs. Long legs are for moving around in this rocky environment, big eyes probably for seeing in the dimly lit boulder-field,” Hoskin said.
The next discovery was the Blotched Boulder-frog (Cophixalus petrophilus), which was unique because of its exclusive residence on the rocks of Cape Melville. Appropriately, its species name means “rock-loving.” Additionally, the newfound frog differs from other frogs in that it lays its eggs in the damp cracks of the boulder, instead of in water; the tadpole develops completely within the egg and hatches as a fully-matured frog.
The final discovery was the Cape Melville Leaf-tailed Gecko (Saltuarius Eximus), which Hoskin noted was distinct because of its “extremely long legs and huge eyes.”
These three species are only found in Cape Melville, according to Hoskin, indicating the uniqueness of ecological communities.
“These species and other low dispersal rainforest species up there have been isolated in this tiny area for millions of years,” Hoskin said. “These species have all evolved and adapted to their uniquely rocky environment in various ways—e.g. long legs, big eyes.”
The researchers were also surprised by the fact that such distinct creatures could still be found in Australia, a place whose flora and fauna had been considered mostly explored.  Hoskin says that he is planning to return to Cape Melville.
“I'm going back for another expedition mid-December and will be surveying a variety of things, including insects, snails, spiders, et cetera. I'll also survey the mammals and birds up there.”

Researchers from Harvard Medical School have predicted that many more tumor suppressor and oncogenes have a combined effect on the development of disease than originally thought, concluding that cancer is even more complex than imagined.
 
In a paper published last month in the journal Cell, the team—led by Medical School professor of genetics Stephen J. Elledge—addressed the impact of aneuploidy, an extra or missing chromosome in an individual’s cells, on cancer development.
 
While aneuploidy is a very common abnormality, most aneuploidies are lethal.
 
 Aneuploidy has been observed in cancer patients for a while, but Elledge said that “aneuploidy was the elephant in the room.” He explained that the oncogene revolution brought point mutations to the attention of scientists and research has been focused on simpler targets in the last several decades.
 
Using a computational method that they devised, Elledge’s team analyzed mutations in tumors for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes to identify mutation patterns that give rise to an oncogenic state.
 
The paper, titled “Cumulative Haploinsufficiency and Triplosensitivity Drive Aneuploidy Patterns and Shape the Cancer Genome,” reported that many more factors can drive the development of cancer, such as avoiding apoptosis, or programmed cell death, escaping immune response, avoiding differentiation, and sustaining proliferation.
 
In addition, the researchers found that contribution of weak drivers can sum up to correspond to the effect of a more potent driver.
 
“People always knew cancer chromosomes were a big mess, but they didn't know how much of this mess was important,” Elledge said.
 
The findings also suggest that the “Two-Hit” hypothesis, a central view on tumor suppression proposed by the geneticist Alfred G. Knudson, might have been generalized to make sporadic cancers appear simpler than they actually are.
 
According to the “Two-Hit” model, the first hit is not enough to contribute to the formation of a tumor in familial cancers, but mutations to the second copy of the same chromosome were thought to provide the second hit that drives the development of tumors.
 
In the study, scientists suggest that most tumor suppressor genes may be haploinsufficient  in sporadic cancers, meaning that one copy of the gene is not fully functional anyway. If that is the case, the second hit might not be necessary to cause tumor development.
 Elledge added that the next step is to engineer deletion and amplifications to recreate the events that occur in cancer cells.

Using troves of data to allow patients to know whether they are at risk for strep throat, Harvard Medical School researchers hope to lessen the number of unnecessary visits Americans make to their doctors for strep tests.
Kenneth D. Mandl and Andrew M. Fine ’91 of the Medical School and of Boston Children’s Hospital and Victor Nizet of the School of Pharmacy at the University of California, San Diego have created a “strep scorecard” for patients to use at home before going to the doctor for a test.
Developed to be an application on a phone or computer, the strep scorecard would ask two questions: whether the patient has a fever, which correlates with strep, and a cough, which correlates with a viral infection that does not require medical attention.
“To date, big data are not used to inform clinical decision-making, and relying on patients to accurately report information is only an emerging science,” Mandl said.
The scorecard would supply the patient with their risk of strep throat based on their two reported symptoms and the data on strep throat cases in clinics in the patient’s region. It then recommends that the patient go to the doctor or instead wait a few days.
Fine clarified that the algorithm in the scorecard does not diagnose strep, but only determines the patient’s risk for strep.
“Since most throat infections are viral and go away within a few days, the scorecard allows patients to avoid an immediate visit to the doctor,” Fine said.
The researchers found 8,500 patients each year would receive antibiotics but not be treated properly. Fine noted that current strep tests are not perfect anyway and that doctors already do not do a strep test on a patient with a low risk for the disease.
In their initial work on the project, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine earlier this month, Fine and Mandl used the medical records of 71,776 patients who received strep tests at CVS MinuteClinics from 2006 to 2008. They used the scorecard method from the patients’ records and compared it to the strep test results.
The researchers concluded that the likelihood of strep throat was less than 10 percent among the patients, who were each 15 years of age or older. They estimated that if patients managed their symptoms with this application, 230,000 visits in the United States could be avoided each year.
“The momentum in healthcare today is to save the cost of the total patient and minimize unnecessary visits and procedures to keep populations healthy and costs low,” Mandl said.
Both the cost of making laboratory data on strep throat cases publically available and creating an application are inexpensive approaches to keep unnecessary visits to a minimum, increasing the efficiency of cash-strapped clinics.
 “The scorecard brings two innovative approaches together to enable something unique in modern medicine,” Mandl said.

Harvard researchers have used Zebrafish, a tropical freshwater fish, to develop a way to turn human stem cells into muscle tissue.
Led by Leonard I. Zon, a senior investigator and professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, the study developed a technique to screen for chemicals in the Zebrafish that could make tissues grow better in a dish. The researchers focused on muscle tissue, showing that certain chemicals can expand muscle cells in a dish.
“We were able to show that one of those chemicals would stimulate mouse adult muscle cells to divide, and that is very helpful for doing transplants,” Zon said. “And we were also able to find that in human muscle, we were able to take a human iPS cell, which is a stem cell line, and turn it into muscle with three other chemicals that we found in our Zebrafish screen.”
Co-author Amy Wagers, also a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, said that one of the goals of the research is to work towards treating muscular disorders.
“The bottom line really is that we have new ways of boosting regenerative cells for muscles—of growing new cells in a culture dish so that we can study muscle disease and hopefully sometime soon use them to support muscle generation in patients who need support for muscle repair,” Wagers said.
Research fellow and co-author Salvatore Iovino said that the use of the Zebrafish was crucial in the experiment.
“Zebrafish is an amazing organism suitable to study development processes and perform drug screenings,” Iovino said. “This is mainly due to the fact that these fishes are very easy to keep and breed [and] they lay [approximately] 200 eggs every week, making them a very useful model for the study of the embryo development.”
Zon explained that the research is paving the way to create cells of any tissue in the body.
“We’re starting, with our Zebrafish system, to take apart every single type of tissue and develop a map of different chemicals that we can use to dial up a certain kind of tissue,” Zon said.
As for future studies, Wagers said that the lab is collaborating with other researchers “to use these new cells that we can isolate and do additional drug screening using diseased cells to see if we can get around the impairments in the cells that cause muscle disease.”

As the shot clock wound down early in the first half, senior forward Kyle Casey shook his defender in the paint and looked for a pass from sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers. Casey was in the air as the ball left Chambers’ hands and slammed the ball home, coming down with a bang that silenced any questions fans at Lavietes Pavilion might have had.
No doubt about it, Kyle Casey was back.
“We were running a late-clock play and he came off the screen,” Casey said. “My guy turned and was kind of high, and I was in the corner so I knew I could get behind it. I cut and he threw it, and I just had to make a good play and catch it and finish it.”
The Harvard men’s basketball team’s home opener against MIT on Tuesday night marked Casey’s homecoming after he took a yearlong leave of absence last fall. The senior dominated in the paint in the Crimson’s 79-37 blowout, chipping in 11 points and a team-high seven rebounds.
Casey’s performance was a turnaround from his first game back in Harvard uniform. On Sunday, he fouled out with only four points early in the second half in a win over Holy Cross. At the Coaches vs. Cancer Tripleheader at TD Garden, Casey—a Boston area native—got his first taste of playing in front of his home crowd in a year. But returning to Lavietes was a different story.
“Coming back here, playing in Lavietes, back out here with the guys in our home court, there’s a sense of pride,” Casey said. “It was a great feeling to finally get back out here, play a game, win a game, and keep the season going.”
SPREADING THE WEALTH
When freshman Matt Fraschilla hit an open three from the right side with five minutes to play, his teammates leapt to their feet and gave the point guard a standing ovation. Less than 30 seconds later, Fraschilla had hit another, finishing his intercollegiate basketball debut with 6 points on 2-3 shooting from deep.
Fraschilla was the third point guard rotated in on Tuesday, one of 13 total players Amaker used as the margin of victory widened. Twelve players scored for the Crimson, and one bench player—freshman forward Zena Edosomwan—contributed double-digit scoring with 13 points. Amaker set a fairly typical starting lineup, but it only lasted for seven minutes. Up eight early in the first half, Amaker looked to his deep bench to spell starters playing on only one day of rest.
“We were planning on playing a lot of players, but you never know how a game is going to go,” Amaker said. “I thought the preparation, the habits, the discipline, our defense in the first half allowed us to have a sizable margin there that allowed us to rotate fresh bodies through. The kind of pressure that we were trying to play with, and doing that without fouling, allowed us to go deep into our bench.”
Senior guard Dee Giger entered the game and played a team-high 24 minutes. Though failure to connect on open shots held Giger to only six points, he showed versatile ball handling and passing, creating space on the perimeter and taking four of his ten shots from beyond the arc.
“I’m one of his best friends, and it’s great for me to see him out there,” Casey said. “It’s great for him to be playing well, he just brings us great energy off the bench. He brings it every day in practice, he pushes us, pushes the starters, pushes all his teammates, so I think he has earned it and deserved it, and it’s great to see him out there. I love it.”
MISSING PIECES
Omitted from the lineup was senior guard Brandyn Curry, who—like Casey—returned from a yearlong leave of absence this fall. Curry did not suit up and joined sophomore forwards Mike Hall and Patrick Steeves, junior forward Kenyatta Smith, and senior forward Tom Hamel on the bench. Though this year’s roster is significantly longer than last year’s, the team has already been plagued by early injuries.
Curry played almost a complete game at TD Garden on Sunday and contributed 14 points. On Tuesday night, he was sidelined with a foot injury stemming from that performance. Amaker said the injury was being treated day-to-day and that there is a possibility that Curry would return for Friday’s game against Howard.
“Yesterday he was hobbling so we weren’t thinking today would be an opportunity for him to play,” Amaker said. “Honestly he was walking a lot better today than he was yesterday. One of the good signs was that our medical staff didn’t have to put him in a boot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year’s game against Boston University is not a memory that members of the Harvard women’s basketball team would like to be reminded of. Heading into the game with a 7-2 record, the second best through nine games in program history, and a four-game winning streak, the Crimson committed 22 costly turnovers and suffered from a lack of sustained offensive momentum.
A pair of baseline drives from then-sophomore guard Temi Fagbenle opened up the game, but every time Harvard gained a slight lead, the Terriers immediately responded to eliminate it. Heading into overtime with the score tied at 57, the Crimson once again managed to pull ahead 61-57 in the first 1:15 of the extra period, but it was held scoreless for the remainder of the game. Boston University scored 11 unanswered points to clinch the victory, 68-61.
“I think the girls have last year’s game in mind,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “But we have changed a lot since then …. We are a better team this year, and so I think the outcome will be different this time.”
Heading into Wednesday’s return matchup against its crosstown foe, the 29th meeting of its longest-running non-conference series, Harvard is ready to continue on with the rivalry, hoping to produce a different outcome this time around.
“We have played [BU] every year I have been here,” Delaney-Smith said. “So both teams are quite familiar with each other. [The Harvard-BU game] definitely has a ‘Best of Boston’ kind of feel to it.”
Harvard (1-1) welcomes BU (0-1) to Lavietes Pavilion for its home opener fresh off of a weekend competing in the DePaul Maggie Dixon Classic.
“That was an interesting opening weekend since we played two extremely athletic teams,” Delaney-Smith said. “Now we will go back to the drawing board and see what we can improve upon. We had way too many turnovers in both games, and we could use a little more depth on the offensive end.”
Harvard dropped a 99-75 decision to the host, DePaul University, before collecting an 83-76 victory against California Polytechnic University. Delaney-Smith tested the same starting lineup in both games, comprised of Fagbenle, co-captain Christine Clark, junior point guard Ali Curtis, senior shooting guard Melissa Mullins, and junior forward Erin McDonnell. While the Crimson shot over 45% in both games, costly turnovers—49 between the two games—made the weekend especially tough for the team.
Boston University will be making the mile-long trip to take on the Crimson just five days after its own home opener, a 73-62 loss against Northeastern. Despite 27 points from senior guard Danielle Callahan, inaccurate shooting plagued the Terriers, as they stumbled to make just 30% on the night.
“We need to make sure that we know how to capitalize on their weaknesses and our own strengths,” Clark said. “The key will be to execute the game plan. We are looking to have a strong defense against … BU, [which] graduated a lot of their top players from last year.”
The most prominent of BU’s departures is that of guard Chantell Alford, the first three-time America East Player of the Year selection in conference history,.
Harvard has been undefeated over fourteen games at Lavietes Pavilion since its loss to Princeton on February 11, 2012, and it posted a perfect 11-0 record at home in the 2012-13 season. Delaney-Smith hopes that the extra year under the team’s belt will lead to smarter basketball.
“We have changed so much since [last year’s Harvard-BU game],” Delaney-Smith said. “From the leadership right on down, we are just a different, better, team now. We’ve changed the system, and certain players that are key for us are a year older and better. Ali Curtis, our starting point guard, now has a full year under her belt, and the same goes for Temi [Fagbenle] and Erin [McDonnell]. ”
The Crimson is looking forward to not only avenging last year’s loss, but also welcoming fans to Lavietes for the first time this year.
“We are looking pretty good at this point,” Clark said. “Playing at home always brings the comfort level up a bit, and we should be very good [on] Wednesday night. The team chemistry is awesome, and everyone is on the same page as to what we should execute during the game.”

It’s Wednesday afternoon and you want a break from studying for your Ec 10 midterm. What if you just want to sit back, relax, and watch a little TV as the plot unfolds before your eyes? That, my friend, is where a certain genre takes the spotlight. “TV so bad it’s good”, as it’s affectionately dubbed, is the category of all these shows that just let you get swept away in scripted love triangles, endearingly unrealistic plot twists, and most importantly, hot bad boy lead characters.
Here are a few suggestions:
"Reign"Royalty. Intrigue. Hot Princes. Mary, Queen of Scots. What more do I have to say before you are watching the pilot on Hulu? If you like Renaissance drama and fabulous costumes with a little magic thrown in, highly consider taking the plunge. This is the coming of age story of Mary, Queen of Scots in that classic CW-style.*
*CW-style: Plot lines you can see from a mile away. Actually, make that five miles.
"The Vampire Diaries"Vampires. Werewolves. Hybrids. Witches. Doppelgangers.
Whether you’ve been following along for five seasons or not, turn on any episode and let yourself be whisked away into the magical world of Mystic Falls. For our second CW drama (noticing a trend here?) we add in a lot of supernatural creatures and many flashbacks to 500 or so years ago. If you are looking for a juicy love triangle then stop right here; you've found it.
"Pretty Little Liars"And now we switch over to ABC Family, home of many gloriously drama-filled soaps. We start with "Pretty Little Liars," which is about four teenage girls and the mysteries surrounding their dead best friend. (Disclaimer: I find this show too scary so I have only seen a few episodes, but those were enough to convince me to put this show on the list.)
"Switched at Birth"Now we’re really getting into it. Two girls discover they were switched as newborns. They were raised in very different families and never really fit in but they finally meet when the hospital realizes the mistake. Oh, you better believe it’s some worlds colliding. Tune in to watch drama unfold.
"The Originals"My dream come true Part 2. A spinoff of the Vampire Diaries starring everyone’s favorite diabolical family. This one takes place in New Orleans and swirls around Klaus, Rebekah, and Elijah as they take on mysterious forces plotting against them. Literally everything you could ever want in a show.
Disclaimer: Watch out, and make sure you don’t spend the next 10 hours catching up on the whole season. You’ve got Ec 10 to study for!

3. TransLoc
Oh. My. Goodness. Is this real life or is it just fantasy? An app for the Harvard shuttle that’s actually accurate? Thank heaven!
4. Evernote
Evernote is the ultimate notetaker. It lets you keep all your written, audio, picture, or voice memos in one place, within easy reach of the search function, and makes it accessible everywhere (thank you, cloud technology).
 5. Adblock Plus
Goodbye to being tracked by Google Analytics and the NSA, and helloooo ad-free browsing! Never again will an ad pop up before a YouTube video, or distract you with Zappos shoe sales. With both mobile and desktop versions, this free app is a must.
 6. Stayfocusd
Stop stalking that cute guy three floors up and start doing work. This free app will help limit the amount of time you spend on time-wasting websites to increase your productivity. Go finish that p-set!

12. Tip Calculator
On the off-chance that you break the Harvard Bubble (let’s be honest, it’s probably not going to happen), you’ll need to leave a tip at whatever snazzy restaurant you find yourself at. This free app is blissfully simple. No more tricky division; but it’s not like you can't handle it, you're in Math 25.
13. MyFitnessPal
If you’re unathletic, but still looking to stay in shape, this free app helps you keep track of all the pizza and candy you consume. It might be slightly depressing, but it gets the job done.

It’s already the middle of November and even the students who spend their whole lives staring at CS50 problem sets know that Harvard-Yale is around the corner (November 23 to be exact). Heck, people that don’t even go here know that it’s coming. To help all you procrastinators out there who haven’t sorted out your game plan for the Game, Flyby has rounded up some of your options:
Are You Going to The Game?
a) No: You can save money and study for that SLS 20 midterm on Monday. Really, whose bright idea was it to have midterms after H-Y? (Note: Flyby is not liable for your regretting not going the week after.)
b) Yes: Get a ticket and go experience the biggest Harvard athletic (read: social) event of the year. As Nike says, just do it.
Buying Tickets
Because a Harvard ID just won’t cut it this time.
a) Buy from Harvard: Pretty simple. Tickets are available at the Harvard Athletics Ticket Office in the Murr Center all the way across the river for $20. Also available from the gocrimson.com website.
b) Buy from Yale: If you can live with giving money to the enemy, this might be your best option. General admission tickets are available on the Yale athletics website for $11 each. You don’t even have to move from your bed. Still too expensive? Yale students can buy four additional guest tickets for $5 each, so if you have any friends there (a strange concept), they may be able to help you out. Just keep in mind this means that you would have to mingle with Yalies prior to the game, so we recommend splurging on the $11 ticket and printing at home.
c) Buy from Stubhub: Don’t do it! Although those $6 tickets look tempting, there are some hefty delivery fees and service charges that you want to avoid.
Getting There
Just in case you didn’t know, you’re not gonna be able to stumble over to Soldiers Field this year after waking up five minutes before the game.
a) Round trip Harvard shuttle: Runs from Lowell House directly to Yale Stadium and back on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sold at the Harvard Box Office in the Holyoke Center. It costs $40 if you only spend Saturday in New Haven, but you will be charged an additional $5 for every other day (up to $50). Don’t forget that the bus tickets are SEF-eligible, so act quickly, and you might be able to earn yourself a cheaper ride!
b) Student organizations: Many rent buses for members; costs may vary. Contact organization reps.
c) Drive: If you happen to have friends who are carpooling there, this is probably your best bet. 
d) Hitchhike: You could ask that sketchy friend of a friend of an acquaintance for a middle seat in the over-capacity Zipcar. Success rate: slim to none.
Staying There
Probably not a good idea to stay out past 1 a.m. in New Haven... or to stay there at all, for that matter. If you insist, here are your options:
a) Stay with a friend at Yale: Should be easy... provided your friend doesn’t have too much school pride and lock you out if (when) Harvard wins.
b) Stay with a friend of a friend at Yale: See above.
c) Floor of common room at Yale: One big sleepover, co-sponsored by the Harvard House Committees. Upperclassmen will be grouped with their houses, with freshmen spread between houses. Exact info to be announced over House lists soon.
d) Lodging through student organizations: Accommodations vary, depending on the group. 
Getting to the Stadium
Got to get there in time for the 9 a.m. tailgate! 
a) Free shuttle: Runs directly from Yale campus to the Yale Bowl.
b) Walk... two miles. Probably not your best bet.
Food and Drink
The most important part!
a) From the Harvard tailgate: Located on the tennis courts beside the Yale Bowl.
b) From the Yale tailgate next door: Props if you get in. You didn’t hear it from us if you don’t.
c) Friday night or post-game noms: Blue State Coffee, Ivy Noodle (late-night Asian food à la the Kong), Bar (mashed potato pizza?), and Tijuana Taco Cart (Yale vernacular is “the burrito cart”).
Getting Home
We at Flyby hope you have the foresight to buy that round trip ticket or it’s gonna be a long walk. And besides, who wants to stay in New Haven any longer than they need to?! Shuttles leave at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Saturday, and if you decide to spend the night, there are two more leaving at 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. on Sunday.
Returning to Everyday Life on Monday While Yalies Begin Their Thanksgiving Break 
We can’t help you there! Life's not fair.
Be safe, have fun, go Crimson!

It’s hard to be snarky about a Yale video that earnestly tells Yalies to be themselves, and nevertheless, Flyby can’t resist the urge to try. The Bullblog (the blog of The Yale Herald) wrote about the video, “This will be the fuzziest you’ve felt on the inside since ‘That’s Why I Chose Yale.’” Which translates to: this will be the funniest thing Harvard students have seen since OHT’s “Why Did I Choose Yale?” parody video. So these are the qualities that apparently make Yalies brave:
The ability to go to the grocery store
A girl is seen dancing down the aisles. Go her! This confirms that Yalies do in fact understand that food is essential for life.
 
The ability to pick up a book
We weren’t sure that Yalies knew how to read, and this video didn’t dispel our concerns. All it proves they are capable of doing with a book is dancing around with it on a table.
 
The ability to start a dance party in a library 
We’ve heard a lot about the famed “Yale party scene,” but until now we didn’t realize it mainly took place in libraries. No wonder they’re ranked below us: they don’t posses the sheer strength it takes to resist breaking out in dance in Lamont. “That time I started a dance party” might be a perfectly good way to start an application to Yale, but it sure won’t get you into Harvard.
 
The ability to cross the street
But seriously, can they stop dancing already? If there’s a traffic jam on the way to the Yale Bowl next weekend, you know who to blame. Unfortunately, it seems the dancing Yalies can’t stop.
 
The ability to interact with members of the opposite sex
Okay, we can’t be the only ones who thought the entire campus was celibate. I mean, why would even a Yalie want to date another Yalie? They should just wait for the one weekend per year when a beautiful Harvard student can show them why exactly Harvard students don’t need bravery (good looks, smooth moves, and last but not least, the ability to read should suffice).
