After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After victories at home, American LGBTQ-rights groups are increasingly turning to advocacy abroad. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, is portrayed as a region in desperate need of Western intervention. But in most cases, the West’s interference on LGBTQ+ issues is hegemonic, dangerous to Africans, and decidedly anti-queer in its narrow conception of gender and sexuality.
Queer African leaders say the best way to advance LGBTQ+ equality in their countries is through the hard, slow, and quiet process of education. They explain that heated controversy makes it harder to tackle the lack of popular support for queer people. And policy changes, they add, aren’t enough to meaningfully improve queer peoples’ lives if social attitudes go unaddressed; lesbians in South Africa’s townships are regularly subjected to “corrective rape” even though same-sex marriage has been legal in the country since 2006.
But it’s not clear that the West’s LGBTQ+ establishment cares what African leaders think. The debate over sexual and gender diversity in Africa is increasingly a proxy war between Western gay rights groups and the American right. Conservative Evangelicals have worked hard to defend and toughen anti-sodomy laws that were themselves imposed by European colonizers. They’ve focused unprecedented funding on this perverse pet project.
In response, however, Western LGBTQ+ groups get involved loudly and unilaterally, with a white supremacist confidence that they know what’s best. They ignore the queer African activists and scholars who must be respected. And ultimately, these leaders say, Western involvement sets back their efforts, attracts unwanted attention, validates the damaging lie that homosexuality is a foreign lifestyle, and puts people in danger.
In Nigeria, for example, backlash from heavy-handed and imperialist Western interference is blamed for the passage of an oppressive 2014 law that had little support until countries like the U.S. came out against it. This past July, gay men in Côte d’Ivoire were attacked and driven from their homes after the U.S. Embassy outed them in pictures of a pro-LGBTQ+ ceremony. Hegemonic Western intervention—especially when it’s a matter of mere symbolism, like an official statement or speech—almost always makes things worse, not better. It’s how, in the words of the Zambian Rev. Dr. Kapya Kaoma, “homophobia [in Africa becomes] as much an expression of resistance to the West as a statement about human sexuality.”
(It’s also an open question how much the West’s LGBTQ+ establishment cares about Africans in the first place. International programs at the Human Rights Campaign, the American gay rights behemoth, are funded in large part by Paul Singer. Singer is a billionaire hedge fund manager and international debt speculator. He buys up distressed sovereign debt, almost always at pennies on the dollar, while debtor nations are mired in conflict. Vulture funds like his wait out these debtor nations, and then, when they’re rebuilding after ruin, sue for the full amount, plus interest and penalties. In the Republic of Congo, for example, Singer’s hedge fund bought up $30 million of defaulted debt for just $1.8 million – and then sued the country for $120 million in repayments and interest. It should come as no surprise that Africans distrust foreign LGBTQ+ groups when they’re working with people like Singer.)
Western intervention also imposes foreign norms of gender and sexuality. The work of Western LGBTQ+ groups is grounded in political ideologies about human rights rather than appreciation for the unique ways that queerness has long played a part in indigenous practices and lifestyles. Western groups are capable of imagining a just society only in Western terms. As a result, our impositions exclude and delegitimize the many sexual practices and gender paradigms that are queer (that is, outside the norm) both to the sociocultural contexts in which they exist and to the dominant queerness of the West.
For example, members of Northeastern Tanzania’s Kurya ethnic group recognize nyumba ntobhu, a practice whereby women choose to marry one another and build families led by two matriarchs without necessarily consummating the marriage. Western LGBTQ+ advocacy is predicated on conceptions of gender and sexuality that are particular to the West, so its effect is to endanger queer Africans and foreclose possibilities for different ways of queer living. As such, it’s decidedly anti-queer—anti-difference—in its violent insistence on a singular and narrow understanding of gender and sexuality.
If we genuinely want to support the liberation of queer Africans, we have to decenter ourselves from their struggle. We’ve got to respect their leadership—and reject the racist hubris that insists we know more about their own lives than they do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Images of a quarterback taking a knee or sitting on bench at a football game rarely lead to outrage or comment from public figures, but San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to take both actions during pregame renditions of the Star-Spangled Banner has inspired just such reactions. Kaepernerick has explained his protest as an attempt to draw attention to police brutality and other forms of oppression faced predominantly by people of color. Critics have called his dissent unpatriotic, uninformed, and disrespectful to veterans and those who have died in service to the United States. Ultimately, while Kaepernick’s choice of venue will undoubtedly remain controversial, dwelling on his manner of protest risks ignoring the pressing issues he has raised by re-litigating timeworn issues of free expression.
The idea of sitting during a ritual when we honor the sacrifices of veterans and the values for which they fought is understandably jarring for many Americans, as President Obama remarked in his comments on Kaepernick’s protest. Other high-profile supporters of Kaepernick like Jim Brown have noted that they might have picked a different venue in which to air similar views. But unlike the President of the Santa Clara Police Officers’ Association—who menacingly urged the 49ers’ “to deal with” Kaepernick—neither Obama nor Brown questioned Kaepernick’s undeniable right to decline to stand for the anthem, understanding that disagreements over means do not negate the substance of his protest.
Following the lead of Obama and Brown, Americans should look beyond how Kaepernick chose to protest and focus on why he did so. As Harvard’s Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Jonathan L. Walton argued last Sunday, patriotism is not merely about going through the motions of singing anthems and honoring flags. Rather, patriotism is about leaving the country better for coming generations, which means facing current problems, including discomfiting ones like racism and police brutality. Even though reasonable people disagree about how Kaepernick chose to highlight these issues, they cannot deny that such ills are among the most significant injustices in the United States.
Ironically, the negative reactions towards Kaepernick’s protest provided some of the best evidence that the concerns he raised are indeed pressing. One news outlet had trouble finding anti-Kaepernick tweets that did not include derogatory language, and a viral denunciation of Kaepernick managed to imply that he was a hypocritical black nationalist who blamed all white people for all social ills, and who only resorted to political statements for personal attention. In addition to making a mockery of Kaepernick’s actual views, this particular commentary also conveniently disregarded the $1 million that Kaepernick has pledged to donate to community organizations working to combat the problems he has highlighted.
If Kaepernick intends to raise awareness of issues of racism that are deeply ingrained in American life, we should expend less energy debating whether or not his mode of peaceful protest was appropriate, and more on solving the problems he has rightfully brought to the fore. Issues of police brutality, systemic racism, and oppression towards people of color are sadly not new, but so long as they persist they deserve continued attention. And if the reaction to Kaepernick’s decision not to stand is any indication, persist they do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Harvard,
Hey, it’s me. One of your statistics.
Call me what you want: sexual assault victim, rape survivor, a report of “nonconsensual sexual penetration through the use of force.” It doesn’t really matter, because no matter what happens or has happened, I am simply, completely, and totally me. And I have something to tell you.
It happened last fall. An upperclassman I’d known since Visitas had invited me to his dorm to study for our coming Science of Cooking midterm and watch movies with some of his frat brothers. Of course, I had gone.
But he hadn’t let me leave.
Harvard could not have saved me from that man, and I know that. How could they possibly know that one of their own was a predator masquerading as a student? Prevention is extremely difficult in cases of sexual assault, and, honestly, the best we can do is try to change rape culture and raise children who understand consent and respect.
But Harvard could have helped me afterwards, and they didn’t.
Harvard, I understand that your move against the final clubs was well-meaning. But as someone who has experienced first-hand the sexual violence that occurs on this campus, please listen to me when I say many of your policies and programs are failing us.
The morning after my attack, I woke in the room of a close friend shaken and hollow. I refused to change or shower, because I knew a rape kit was not only imminent but necessary. After trudging back to my dorm, I immediately went to my proctor, and he called health services. The news was shocking.
Harvard University Health Services didn’t provide rape kits.
It didn’t fully hit me then—I was far too numb. But later, after having to get an Uber to a hospital in the city and waiting three hours for the specialized nurse to arrive, the anger came. College campuses are notorious for their high instances of rape and sexual assault. Yet my university, the greatest and wealthiest in the world, could not even provide me a rape kit. I could not go to the health center that I was comfortable with. I was referred to an enormous, foreign hospital across the city feeling even more scared and vulnerable than I had before. It still shocks me.
But it didn't end there.
A few days later, I was shepherded into the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response where I was to meet a representative and the Title IX coordinator. The meeting was long, a barrage of information and emails and programs that I can’t even begin to reiterate. However, I do remember the moment I realized the University would not be able to help me.
They told me that unless I went through the trial process, Harvard was unable to intervene in any meaningful way.
Now, every survivor is different. Some need to seek justice and fire back. But for me? The idea of my attacker seeking retribution was a crippling fear that made me pale at the thought of going through with the grueling trial process. But this ultimatum put me at war with myself.
Unless I subjugated myself to a long trial, Harvard would do nothing to keep him away from me. That’s right. Nothing. Even though my rape kit had come back positive, that was not enough.
This meant that I would still have to go to class with him. Every Tuesday and Thursday.
Dread flooded me as the Title IX coordinator wrapped up and left me alone with the OSAPR representative.
Fear plain on my face, I asked her how long the trial would be realistically. Looking at me sadly, she answered back that the fastest trial she’d overseen had taken six months, but some could stretch to over a year—especially if the accused was able to afford good lawyers who delayed the process.
I could only cry.
Already halfway through the semester, six months would mean that even if I did agree to a trial, he would not only still be in my class, but know that I was pressing charges. Over a year? He was a senior and would be long gone from campus by the time justice was served.
So, I did what I thought was the best choice in a horrible situation: I stayed silent. Harvard added his name to a list of accused. If another girl was attacked, they would prosecute him independently on our behalf. Thankfully, his name has not come up again, and that gives me some amount of peace.
But I still remember the trauma of seeing him two times a week for the rest of the year. I’m just thankful that my class was a large one, and he could be avoided. Still, the occasional eye contact and smug smiles I received from him were enough to exile me after class, shaking and sobbing, to the Science Center bathrooms.
The first semester passed quickly, a whir of friendships and new opportunities. I even had a few months of peace. I started therapy, rarely saw him, and was truly finding my place in the Harvard community. Then, the sexual assault report came out and single-sex organizations were put under siege.
It had been almost six months, but I can’t describe to you how it felt to see those glass boxes in the middle of Tercentenary Theatre last semester. Most of the words paired with Harvard’s sexual assault statistics in the art installation were well meaning. Yet, walking past them every day was a reminder of how my university had failed me when I needed it most, and now insisted on making a victory parade out of what felt like a sham.
Instead of taking steps to help survivors, Harvard started a witch hunt against single-gender organizations under the guise of protecting us.
Shutting down the final clubs, sororities, and fraternities on our campus will do almost nothing to help prevent sexual assault. In fact, more than 80 percent of sexual assault happens within Harvard’s own dorms, and yet no steps have been taken to secure those places.
Though my attacker was a member of a fraternity, I have no ill will towards the final clubs or other single-sex organizations on campus. In fact, I continued to visit those spaces almost every weekend. I saw my friends light up as they joined the ranks of their sororities or finished punching for their club. You have taken away an integral part of the student experience at Harvard.
But above their functions as social clubs, you also robbed many students of the very safe spaces you claim to be creating. Though I am not a member of a sorority, I know many fellow survivors who are. They’ve found a community of strong, vibrant women with whom they can enjoy the delights of youth without fear. And this does not only apply to women on campus. The boys I’ve seen join fraternities and final clubs have truly grown into men. They have found friendship and spaces of camaraderie.
The fact is: I do not want to be shuffled away into the likes of Pusey Library or another deemed “safe space” every weekend. I do not want to hide from other students on this campus. I want to be safe. But more than that, I want to be protected when that safety has been breached.
It’s true: rapists and sexual predators exist within the single-sex organizations. And yes, members should start holding one another accountable for what happens within their social space. But shutting them down completely not only kills potential spaces for growth, but breeds animosity. Instead, clubs should be rewarded by the University for becoming coed or taking part in consent education programs. Still, I believe such changes are their choices to make.
Harvard, I understand that you are trying to help your students. But instead of putting students at war with the very institution we expect to support and protect us, let’s start out with some basics: providing rape kits at University Health Services, shortening the length of trial, allowing students to go to class without having to face their attacker, and making dorms more secure.
It may not fix everything, but it’s a start.
Sincerely,
A strong, vibrant woman who will always be more than a statistic on piece of paper or a ripped skirt in a police storage room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2016, at 11:44 p.m.
Harvard University Dining Services workers will hold a vote Sept. 15 on whether to strike—a move that would cap off months of prolonged negotiations that have left the workers demanding higher wages and improved health benefits.
Representatives from UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents HUDS, announced the date of the vote at a rally in First Parish Church Wednesday afternoon that attracted activists and students from across the University and culminated in a march through Harvard Square.

“We want to be crystal clear about one thing: the Local 26 members who cook, serve the food, and take care of the students are deadly serious when they say we’re getting ready to strike,” Local 26 president Brian Lang said at the rally, which about 200 people attended.
If a majority of union members vote “yes” next Thursday, Local 26 can commence a strike after the Sept. 17 expiration of their current contract with the University, HUDS worker and union organizer Laquiesha N. Rainey said in an interview before the rally. Their current contract with Harvard, extended from June, includes a customary “no-strike” clause. Before the vote, the union and Harvard administrators will continue to meet for negotiations.
Supporters, carrying posters affixed with around 600 photos dining hall workers backing the strike, streamed outside the church chanting “We’re gonna strike.”
“We’re not just sabre-rattling. There will be a strike on this campus, if need be,” Lang said.
Students from several University activist groups came to the rally, including undergraduates in the Student Labor Action Movement and the Harvard Islamic Society, Medical School students in the Racial Justice Coalition and Ph.D. students in the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga refuted several of the allegations the union and SLAM made before and during the rally. She specifically addressed a claims made in a widely-circulated email in support of HUDS that Harvard is “trying to make detrimental changes to workers’ health care.”
“The University has put forth a number of proposals to address Local 26’s concerns regarding health care costs,” deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard’s health care plans have long included provisions to protect workers, union and non-union, who earn less through the implementation of progressive tiered premiums, and reimbursement plans that reduce out of pocket costs to as little as $800 a year.”
Dining hall workers said they did not expect such an outpouring of support and were excited to see a crowd attend the rally.
“I was very surprised—especially with the medical students coming in today. We were not expecting this and I’m just so thankful,” Cabot and Pforzheimer dining hall worker Anabela A. Pappas said.
Tiffany Ten Eyck, spokesperson for Local 26, said next Thursday’s vote will be held from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. at First Parish church.
“It’s not an easy decision. Our people with families have to make a decision,” Edward B. Childs, a dining hall worker in Adams, said.
Rainey said a strike would be a “complicated thing.”
“It’s one of those where you’re expecting everybody to just walk out and not come into work, and picket and make a lot of noise about what we’re fighting for, and make sure we’re being heard,” Rainey said. “You can’t strike and not have any action behind it.”
SLAM members advertised ahead of the rally, postering kiosks and individual dormitories in the Yard and Houses. Last night around 9 p.m., the group disseminated a petition over email lists in support of the workers’ intent to strike. According to SLAM member Samuel R. Heller ’18, as of Wednesday night, the petition garnered more than 1,600 signatures since it was launched, with signatories hailing from across the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Orientation is an experience typically reserved for freshmen, but an increasing number of upperclassman Houses are welcoming back sophomores early for their own version of the transition process.
Capitalizing on the success of an orientation for sophomores that Mather House piloted last year, Leverett, Cabot, and Pforzheimer Houses joined Mather last month to welcome members of the Class of 2019 back to campus early for a round of activities intended to ease the transition into House life.
While the various sophomore orientations were limited in length, lasting between just one to two days, House Faculty Deans said they hoped the new programming would give students a chance to get better acquainted with their House and fellow sophomores before classes got underway.
Sophomores in Leverett House returned a day earlier than the official College move-in date and were greeted by a reception at the Faculty Deans’ residence, followed by a dinner. The day also included group discussions, advising activities, and a scavenger hunt to orient them to the House.
Leverett co-Faculty Dean Howard Georgi ’67 said the event had “many successes.”
“Most of the sophomores know how terrific our special dinners are, they know our tutors and their classmates better,” Georgi wrote in an email. “Many of them made a real effort to explore the House.”
Stephanie R. Khurana, co-Faculty Dean of Cabot House, said Cabot had previously held events to welcome sophomores, but this year instituted a more structured program after receiving suggestions from students last year.
“They wanted an opportunity to get more grounded in adjusting to house life, Quad life, making choices on classes and extracurriculars, as well as an opportunity to expand their friend groups,” Khurana wrote in an email.
In Mather, House administrators built off of last year’s program by instituting an “advising circle” that paired sophomores with older students to discuss their similar academic interests. The older students were part of a new program of House-level advising peers that was also instituted in Leverett.
Stephen J.  Dayneka ’19, a Mather resident, said he found the peer advising helpful for his own academic planning.
“I was able to talk to them, kind of figure out what classes I wanted to take, and hear what interests and experiences they already had, and I was able to make some decisions around my actual concentration, which was big, especially around the start of sophomore year,” Dayneka said.
Thomas Damiano ’19, another Mather resident, also praised the advising events during the orientation as helpful in the absence of the extensive academic advising students receive when they first enter the College.
The idea for sophomore orientations as a means of transitioning second-year into their new House for the next several years dates back to a working group convened by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in 2014 to discuss the freshman to sophomore transition, according to Gene A. Corbin, chair of that working group and assistant dean of the college for public service.
“Nationwide, sophomore year can feel like a time of anxiety. It’s a time of having to start making difficult decisions. We wanted to make sure students feel a sense of a welcoming inclusive community in which to make these difficult decisions,” Corbin said.
While the orientations received positive reviews, their future and potential further expansion remains uncertain. The orientation in Leverett was an “expensive” endeavor, Georgi said, but added the House would consider repeating it next year.
“If Dean [Rakesh] Khurana can find the resources to do it again next year, I think we will be very pleased to take part,” Georgi wrote. “Of course, there are a few things we would do slightly differently, and we would ask for ideas from this year’s sophomores and the Leverett Advising Peers, but I don’t think we would make huge changes.”

The Graduate Student Council voted to modify the council’s constitution to create a new at-large representative position for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in its first meeting of the year Wednesday.
Aside from handling logistical issues, such as filling appointed positions and committees, the meeting was largely geared toward new student involvement in the council. At the end of the meeting, Natural Sciences at-large representative Jack M. Nicoludis, who is also an organizer for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, invited students to an information session that union organizers are hosting next week.
The Council voted last November to support students involved in the union movement and voted in April to condemn the University’s joint filing of an amicus brief against graduate student unionization. The National Labor Relations Board decided on Aug. 23 to recognize undergraduate and graduate student research and teaching assistants at private universities as employees with collective bargaining rights.
The ruling came right at the start of the term as new Ph.D. students were arriving to Harvard. Nicoludis said the information session next week is open to all graduate students, but specifically mentioned the influx of new students.
“There’s a lot more visibility of the campaign this semester, so if anybody has any questions we want to be able to answer them in an open format,” Nicoludis said.
Nicoludis said a meeting between union organizers, administrators, and University labor representatives will take place this Friday.

Ruth Hubbard ’45, the first woman to receive tenure as a biology professor at Harvard, passed away last Thursday at age 92 after a recent decline in her health.
Born in Vienna, Austria as Ruth Hoffmann on March 3, 1924, Hubbard and her family fled from the Nazi regime to the U.S. in 1938, settling in Brookline, Mass. Dr. Hubbard remained in the Cambridge area, with her professional career focused at Harvard, for the rest of her life.
Hubbard, who received tenure in 1973, rose to the forefront of her field in an era when women faced obstacles in academic science. She made important discoveries about the biochemistry and photochemistry of vision in the 1940s through 1960s in the laboratory of Nobel-prize winning biologist George Wald, who was also Hubbard’s second husband.
Molecular and Cellular Biology professor John E. Dowling  worked with Hubbard as a student researcher in the Wald lab. He wrote about her contributions to the field and personal qualities in a statement emailed to the MCB department this week.
“Ruth Hubbard was a superb scientist who contributed substantially to our understanding of photoreceptors and their light-sensitive visual pigment molecules,” Dowling wrote. “She was a wonderful mentor and colleague.”
Hubbard was also known for her political activism and her feminist critique of academic science that she began to develop in the early 1970s.
Nancy Krieger, a professor of Social Epidemiology at the School of Public Health, first met Hubbard in 1977 as a student at Radcliffe in Hubbard’s class on biology and women’s issues.
“What Ruth did was she taught me both to think critically about science and also to do science critically, and always to challenge whenever biology was used for an excuse for injustice,” Krieger said.
Hubbard’s children noted her dedication to mentoring students.
“She truly was a mentor to a generation of progressives, feminists, and LGBT students at Harvard, and that meant a lot to her,” Deborah H. Wald, Hubbard’s daughter, said.
Hubbard’s son, Elijah Wald, a Grammy Award-winning folk blues guitarist and music historian, said his mother was passionate about teaching.
“She was very much a teacher, not just in the classroom. She liked counseling people, she liked giving advice,” he said. “ She was genuinely interested in people. She was somebody who people who knew her would tend to come to with their problems.”
Hubbard is survived by her foster brother, Benjamin Goldstein; her son, Elijah Wald; her daughter, Deborah H. Wald; and her two grandsons, Ezekiel and Oliver.
A memorial celebration will be held in the spring, according to Hubbard’s family.

After a year that saw Harvard Law School embroiled in debates over race and diversity, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow has launched a new lecture series entitled “Diversity and U.S. Legal History.”
The 10-week series, which kicked off Wednesday, is a joint effort on the part of the Dean’s office and Law School professor Mark Tushnet’s reading group, which bears the same title as the series. Minow took suggestions from faculty and students on potential speakers.
The lecturers—who include Law School professors Randall L. Kennedy, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Annette Gordon-Reed, Michael Klarman, and Kenneth W. Mack, Divinity School professor Diana L. Eck—will discuss topics ranging from race in American history, to challenges facing Latinos, the originalist case for reparations, and religious pluralism.
While Minow’s own scholarship has dealt with racial and religious minorities and conflict resolution, she will not lecture as part of the series.
Law School professor Joseph William Singer delivered the first talk—“567 Nations: The History of Federal Indian Law”—to a crowded room Wednesday in the school’s student center. Singer recounted the development of colonial and United States law regarding Native Americans from the 18th century to the present, arguing that certain judicial rulings or government actions were unconstitutional.
The first presentation took place just down the hall from the student lounge that was the epicenter of intense activism, including an occupation, last year. The topic of diversity dominated campus conversation last academic year, which was marked by a wave of student activism and several race-related incidents that shook the Law School. Activists with the group Reclaim Harvard Law issued a set of demands to Minow last December, which included calling on the school to create a critical race theory program.
In February, activists began occupying the school’s student lounge, and Minow announced several initiatives that month—including hiring a Director for Community Engagement and Equity, administering a campus-wide climate survey, and establishing a mentoring program. And in March, the Harvard Corporation approved a Law School committee’s recommendation to remove the school’s controversial seal, which displayed the crest of a prominent slave-owning family.
Minow insists the new lecture series is not a response to recent activism, but rather a means of highlighting the work on diversity issues faculty members have undertaken for years. In previous years, the Dean’s Office has sponsored special lecture series that align with the reading group.
“The Law School’s commitment to and interest in diversity–in our community, in the profession, and in society–is longstanding, and the series offers a chance to explore diversity, anti-discrimination, and justice in the profession and in law,” she wrote in a statement provided to The Crimson via Law School spokesperson Michelle Deakin.
First-year Law student Niku Jafarnia, who closely followed activism and race issues last year at the Law School before arriving on its campus, said she is glad Minow created the series and hopes it will advance ongoing discussions about diversity in law and legal education.
“I think it’s a small step, but they’re working on it and that’s important,” Safarnia said. “Hopefully people will be more willing to have conversations about things like this this year than they were in the past.”

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a Harvard-inspired bill to preserve rights of sexual assault victims, bringing the legislation one step closer to law.
The legislation, called the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act, compiles individual states’ best practices for responding to cases of alleged sexual assault to create federal standards. Specifically, the legislation would give victims further rights regarding rape kits, including ensuring a kits’ security and preservation before the “ the expiration of the maximum applicable statute of limitations.”
The bill was in part drafted and sponsored by Rise, an anti-sexual advocacy group whose founder, Harvard alumnae  Amanda N. Nguyen ’13, decided to look into discrepancies in states’ procedure when handling sexual assault. Nguyen founded Rise in 2014 after becoming frustrated with how Massachusetts’s sexual assault procedures affected her own individual case. Nguyen emphasized that in order to keep her rape kit from being destroyed, she had to call a forensic lab every six months—per state regulations.
The federal bill comes after Harvard students helped draft Massachusetts-specific legislation last winter. Rise’s Massachusetts director Fran F. Swanson ’17 said last January that students sought help from  scholars at Harvard Law School, the Kennedy School of Government, and Institute of Politics for research behind the bill, which is now currently pending in the Massachusetts legislature.
Nguyen said she was pleased that the bill has made it this far.
“It is so possible to change your community, your state, your country,” Nguyen said. “It is so possible to enact change.”
The bill must now be signed by President Barack Obama in order to become law.
Both the state and federal bills come as Harvard grapples with policy and procedure around sexual assault. The government is currently investigating the College’s compliance with anti-federal sex discrimination law Title IX it, and in 2014, the government found the Law School’s sexual assault response procedures in violation of the law.
In March, a University task force released a report with recommendations to all Harvard schools to help prevent sexual assault. The University will likely accept some of the report’s suggestions this academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in its history, the traditionally all-male Krokodiloes—the University’s oldest a capella group—gave a callback audition to a woman, though ultimately the group did not accept her, according to general manager Michael A. Paladino ’17.
Nora A. Sagal ’18, a self-described jazz singer with a low voice, received a callback from the Kroks on Tuesday evening after auditioning for both the Kroks and another all-male a capella group, the Din and Tonics. She did not receive another callback following her second audition with the Kroks, however.
“I thought it was unfair that I couldn’t try out for a group that I’ve always thought to be the best on campus just because I’m a woman,” Sagal said, referencing the Kroks. “My feeling on the entire matter is not that single-sex a capella shouldn’t exist, but that people with lower voices who want to be a part of groups like the Kroks or the Dins, with the proper ability and range, should be able to try out.”
Sagal said she was inspired, in part, to audition because of conversations within the campus drag group Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which last fall considered adding women to its all-male cast for the first time in its history before ultimately demurring.
Paladino said he and the other members of the Kroks were surprised that Sagal auditioned, but that she “has definitely sparked a serious conversation within the group.”
He said they chose not to give Sagal another audition because the sound of her voice does not match what the group was looking for. Paladino declined to comment further when asked if the Kroks would have admitted her should her voice have met their qualifications.
According to the a capella group’s constitution, membership “shall be open to all students in good standing currently enrolled in Harvard College, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or physical disability.”
Single-gender organizations at the College have come under scrutiny over the past year, particularly unrecognized groups such as final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. In May, Harvard announced a new policy that will, starting with the Class of 2021, bar members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from being leaders of recognized clubs or receiving College endorsement for fellowships such as the Fulbright or Rhodes.
Paladino acknowledged that the Kroks had considered the College’s stance towards single-gender social organizations.
“We realize we are an all male institution at the College, and that there are cultural shifts occurring on campus,” Paladino said. “That is definitely factoring into our conversations, which have only just begun.”
Sagal did not receive a callback from the Dins. According to president Jacques Berguig ’18, the group’s constitution does not allow for women to join. Berguig said she “delivered a phenomenal audition” but that the group could not let her join.
“We thought it was a totally unfair call to call Nora back knowing it’d be impossible for her to become a member of the group at the end of the process,” Berguig said.
He added that the group had previously discussed letting female students into the Dins with its alumni council.
“We did not think it would happen as soon as this year, and so we were unprepared to react adequately,” Berguig said. “This is a conversation that is very much on the table, and the thing with the issue is that it’s more delicate than it seems, because all-male a capella, as well as all-female a capella, are separate genres, styles, and sounds of their own.”
Sagal is currently a member of the Opportunes, a co-ed a capella group.
In 2013, two women auditioned for Yale’s all-male all-senior Whiffenpoofs, an a capella group, for the first time since 1987, according to the Yale Daily News. They were not admitted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, defining moments in a season come at unexpected times. They could come at the end of the season, when a team attempts to clinch a playoff berth, or in the tournament as a team competes to bring home hardware.
For the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-0-1), one of these moments could happen this weekend, as it looks to remain undefeated before it goes on the road for the next few weeks.
“A lot of what we’ve done has been recovery and then just working on the technical part of the game and getting ourselves ready for this weekend,” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “We’ve been going over a lot of film of ourselves to correct what we need to do to get ready for the next two games...to have the best outcome.”
After a win against Villanova and an overtime tie against Hofstra, the Crimson is about to face a string of top competitors. In its final two games at Jordan Field before taking a road trip to face Stanford and Cal, the team will have the chance to continue the momentum started by a solid opening weekend performance.
“Whether it’s home or away, momentum is a very important thing in all sports,” co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “So to feel good about yourself in terms of your performance and to feel good about your team’s performance, to remain confident about your ability as a team on the field...is extremely important. So whether the game is home or away wouldn’t really make a difference.”
Similar to last week’s games, the Crimson will be playing two teams against which it has only faced once before, and will be looking for its first win against both.
The Crimson will first host Seattle (1-2-0) at Jordan Field on Thursday. In the inaugural matchup between the teams last season, Harvard was shut out, 2-0, despite late-game charges led by seniors Daniel Smith and Jake Freeman. Two players who made an impact in last season’s contest, Seattle sophomores Sergio Rivas and Julio Rubio, are back and will be players to watch, as will junior midfielder Alex Roldan, who currently leads the team in goals and points.
Seattle has had a relatively slow start to its season, having lost its last two games against No. 10 Akron and Ohio. Harvard will hope to extend the Redhawks’ losing streak and continue building confidence as it goes into Sunday’s game against Washington (2-1-0, 1-0 Pac-12).
The Huskies are out to a strong start this season. After suffering a close loss to No. 12 Utah Valley, Washington picked up victories over St. Mary’s and Oral Roberts. The Crimson may have a difficult time finding the back of the net on Sunday, facing a Huskies back line that allowed just 13 goals last season. Washington also features forward Mason Robertson, who missed last season with an injury and is now the team’s top scorer, and junior Henry Wingo, who was ranked No. 57 on Top Drawer Soccer’s Top 100 players.
“We’ve pointed out their players that can be dangerous to us but really it’s just about looking at what they do well on the team and talk about what we can do as a team to nullify it,” Freeman said. “So...making it difficult for them to play through us as a team, and really just bringing our energy and our fight.”
Though Seattle and Washington are strong competitors and bring highly skilled players to the pitch, Harvard has played some of its best soccer in recent years at Jordan Field. The team boasts a 14-4-2 record at home since the 2013-2014 season. The Crimson also boasts both seasoned and breakout stars, including Wheeler, Freeman, sophomore forward Cesar Farias, and freshman midfielder Matthew Glass, who was last week’s Ivy League Rookie of the Week.
Harvard will not be at home again until Sept. 27, so the Crimson will try to make the most of the opportunity for six points this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday night, the Harvard women’s soccer team made a short trip to Newton Campus Field to take on undefeated Boston College in another matchup designed to test the Crimson’s fortitude.
The Eagles exploded for 21 shots, however, and soundly thwarted any chance for Harvard’s first upset win with a 3-0 victory over the visitors. BC (6-0-1) remains undefeated, while the Crimson (2-3) slips back under .500 just past the halfway mark in non-conference play.
“[Boston College] was better than us today, no doubt about it,” coach Chris Hamblin said. “They edged us tonight, but there were definitely positives to take out.”
Sophomore Danielle Etzel made her fourth career start in between the pipes, stopping two shots, while freshman Kat Hess came on during the second half for her first minutes of the season, tallying four saves.
The two were tasked with slowing down an Eagles offense that, including Wednesday night, has now scored 20 goals over its six wins.
“Both goalkeepers did a good job for us tonight,” Hamblin said. “[BC] is a very dynamic attacking team that we knew had a lot of success coming into tonight. They did catch us in behind our back line, and you get punished at this level.”
The solid showing on the defensive end translated into a bevy of opportunities on the other end of the field. The issue for Harvard on Wednesday was simply getting the ball past BC goalkeeper Alexis Bryant.
“We played well collectively,”junior defender Candy Janachowski said. We played hard as a team and put in a lot of effort out there. A lot of times, we struggled, making pretty simple mistakes and us improving that will just come with time and a little bit of practice. There are a lot of new pieces in play.”
Bryant managed to keep Harvard off the scoreboard, which Hamblin said was a product of a lack of offensive finishing inside the penalty box, effective BC defense, and excellent saves.
“When you look at the flow of the game, it was about the difference inside the 18-yard boxes,” Hamblin said. “We created a lot of good opportunities, but we were probably a little out-of-sync in the final third.”
The Crimson had chances in the 24th, 39th, and 72nd minutes, involving senior forwards Midge Purce and Karly Zlatic inside the penalty box, but Bryant was able to extinguish all three threats.
Bryant, a redshirt sophomore, is now 5-0-1 as a starter, sporting a 0.34 goals-against average on the season. To lead the Eagles offense on Wednesday night, BC redshirt junior midfielder Lauren Berman tallied a goal and an assist.
“They were able to connect a lot of balls and are really dangerous at the flank,” Janachowski said. “Playing top-tier teams prepares us for faster play and exposes a lot of things we need to work on.”
Harvard, in preparation for Ivy League play, which starts in about two weeks, has loaded its nonconference schedule with quality opposition and is seeing its tough stretch through. Although each game’s score lines have not been inspiring, Hamblin says there have been positives to take out of each match.
“I’m really proud of the effort the team put in,” Hamblin said. “We never quit—we continued until the last whistle. Now we just have to turn our opportunities into goals, and that’s something we’ll work towards this week.”
The Crimson is now 0-3, with a minus-seven goal differential, against teams that are now a combined 16-2-2. Against teams that are a combined 0-0-12, Harvard is 2-0, with a plus-four goal differential.
“We’re getting a lot of exposure on our weaknesses that we wouldn’t get playing easier teams, and BC is a very strong team,” Janachowski said.
