After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team, the season’s first weekend brought a loss to Cornell. And as it turns out, the last did as well.
The Crimson (20-8-5) suffered its worst loss of the season Friday night at Bright Hockey Center, falling behind early and dropping a 6-2 contest to the No. 5 Big Red (20-8-6) in the NCAA quarterfinals.
The loss ended Harvard’s season, while Cornell continues onto the Frozen Four in Minneapolis.
“I thought Harvard played really well,” said Big Red coach Doug Derraugh. “They were quick, they controlled a lot of the game…We got that 2-0 lead, once we got that I thought we started getting our feet and started playing better all over the ice and got a couple more.”
Despite holding a 36-18 shot advantage for the game, the Crimson could not capitalize on its many opportunities and allowed the Big Red to take the momentum through several key breakaway shots in the first period.
“They were in our zone a lot,” Derraugh said, “they were getting lots of shots. All the sudden we just put pucks in behind their defense and got lots of speed, and we got some really good opportunities, and we buried them.”
ECAC Player of the Year Catherine White opened scoring just 2:34 into the contest, taking a pass from Amanda Young and beating freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy.
Cornell doubled its lead four minutes later while shorthanded, as Big Red forward Karlee Overguard stole the puck and again caught Bellamy in an unprotected situation.
And Cornell used its two-score lead in the first to generate the necessary momentum to put the game away in the second.
Laura Fortino opened the floodgates on an odd-man rush at 6:42, putting a pass from Chelsea Karpenko past Bellamy. A pair of goals from Melanie Jue and Karpenko gave the Big Red three goals in three minutes—ending both Bellamy’s night and her team’s chance at a trip to Minneapolis.
Bellamy made six saves and allowed five goals in her 29:45 of play, the worst outing of the freshman’s career.
Though its five-goal deficit proved to be insurmountable, the Crimson kept at it. At 13:47 of the second, Harvard senior Randi Griffin received a pass from junior Kate Buesser right in front of the net on a power play and one-timed it home for the Crimson’s first goal of the night.
“We were trying to step up our game when we’re on the power play,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “[To] capitalize on that chance definitely picks up your spirits a little bit. I thought we played really hard, and we took a lot of great shots. To be rewarded for that felt awesome.”
But even the score could not spark a Harvard comeback, for in the 15th minute of the second period, the Big Red’s Kendice Ogilvie scored off a pretty feed from the corner from Karpenko—besting junior backup netminder Kylie Stephens and taking away any momentum the Crimson had regained.
It was the first time since February 2006 that Harvard had allowed six goals in a game.
“It got to a point where it was all about our effort and our execution and try to stay together and try to keep going as a team under some pretty adverse circumstances,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.
Stone’s team played hard in the final period, outshooting the Big Red, 13-5, and controlling the puck for most of the frame. Harvard got one goal closer with seven minutes to play, as junior Leanna Coskren took a pass from co-captain Cori Bassett at the top of the zone and put a high shot into the back of the net.
But Cornell’s swarming defense and tough goaltender shut out the Crimson for the rest of the period, and the 6-2 lead was just too large to overcome.
“We are disappointed with the end result of tonight’s game, but certainly not disappointed with the effort of our players,” Stone said. “We got ourselves in a little bit of a hole and tried to dig ourselves out. It was one of the hardest fought, from start to finish, games that we’ve played all season.”
Though Harvard did not earn its sixth Frozen Four berth, the ECAC will still be represented in the national semifinals by the Big Red—a squad making its first-ever tournament appearance. Cornell will face No. 1 Mercyhurst on Friday in Minneapolis.
“Anytime an Ivy League team can go to the Frozen Four, it’s a great thing,” Stone said. “The ECAC is very strong, the Ivy League is very strong. Anytime you can keep putting great teams in the NCAA tournament, you’re doing the right thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite what the scoreboard might suggest, the Harvard women’s hockey didn’t play any differently than it usually does Friday night. It didn’t start the game half asleep, and it didn’t struggle to control the puck. Rather, the Crimson ran into a Cornell squad that was able to use the team’s usual offensive strengths against it.
One thing Harvard has been known for is its aggressive forechecking attack, which has allowed it to outshoot most of its opponents and dominate the puck—both of which it did against the Big Red.
“They forechecked hard,” Cornell coach Doug Derraugh said. “They kept us in our end a lot,”
But forechecking can leave gaping holes at the other end of the ice, and the Big Red was able to find them.
“Sometimes if you can get pucks in behind them and get speed through the neutral zone, you can get some really good opportunities,” Derraugh said.
That Cornell did, as it took advantage of a failed rush to put the Crimson down by a goal two and a half minutes into the game. Once the Big Red got the puck, sophomore Catherine White was find open ice on Harvard’s end and teammate Amanda Young hit her with the puck for an easy goal against Crimson freshman Laura Bellamy. Four minutes later, a different Cornell skater, Karlee Overguard, found the back of the net on an unassisted tally to put the Crimson down by two early in the game.
It seemed that any time Harvard’s skaters took a risk, Cornell punished them for it.
“We really liked how we forechecked tonight,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “It was a couple bounces here and a few misreads in plays.”
GOING BACK FOR SECONDS
The slaughter didn’t stop when the first period closed. After controlling the puck and shutting the Big Red down for the final 13 minutes of the first half, it seemed like the Crimson was starting to regain control of the game. But the onslaught was only beginning, as three goals in three minutes dashed any hope Harvard might have had for a Frozen Four berth.
The first of these looked similar to the first two goals of the game, in that Cornell caused a turnover behind its blue line and found the back of the net shortly after—but this time it was two skaters closing in on Bellamy. Laura Fortino dished the puck to Chelsea Karpenko for a give-and-go. Karpenko put Bellamy off balance before sending the puck back to Fortino, who scored on an open net.
Shortly after, the Big Red proved that it didn’t need a fast break to score, as Melanie Jue capitalized on chaos around the crease, squeezing her stick around Crimson freshman Kaitlin Spurling for a fourth goal that looked almost like an accident.
Less than two minutes later, Cornell struck again, giving it a five-goal lead before half the game had elapsed.
“I’m very proud of our players,” Stone said. “We could have wilted away early in the second period, and we didn’t. There’s a lot to be proud of and a lot to build on.”
BRICK HOUSE
At some points during the night, Harvard had to have been wondering whether it was really shooting against a human goaltender or a backboard.
For the majority of the night, the Big Red’s Amanda Mazzotta seemed impenetrable, allowing Cornell to head to the Twin Cities off a four-goal victory despite registering only 18 shots, half of the Crimson’s 36.
“Our attitude throughout the game was just to keep playing, keep putting shots on net, keep trying to get chances,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “I thought we played really hard, and we took a lot of great shots.”
But Mazzotta was unfazed. Perhaps because she’d seen them twice before, the sophomore goaltender turned back shots from most of the Crimson’s usual suspects, including juniors Kate Buesser and Liza Ryabkina and freshman Jillian Dempsey.
Perhaps it was not surprising, then, that the two skaters who stumped Mazzotta and the Big Red defense were senior Randi Griffin and junior Leanna Coskren. Despite ranking fourth and fifth among Harvard’s scoring leaders, respectively, neither had scored on Mazzotta in the two earlier matchups between the teams.
“When we put a lot of pressure on their goaltender, she did a really good job,” Stone said. She put the rebounds into the corners. When she left something there, they did a good job of keeping us from getting in.”

UPDATE: Mar. 14, 2010, 4:18 p.m. FAS IT reports that all systems and services are back to normal.
If you're still on campus, and you woke up this morning to find your  wireless Internet connection a little sub-par, don't fret: you weren't  the only one.
FAS-IT has noted the problem as a "Campus-wide  Partial Network Interruption" as of 8 a.m. (meaning that lots of  other people all over campus can't connect to the Internet either), and  their staff are "actively investigating the problem."
In the meantime, there's always the computer lab (if you're reading this, you're probably already there). Or, perhaps, take  this time to cuddle up with a good book, catch up on "Lost," or sing in  the rain.
