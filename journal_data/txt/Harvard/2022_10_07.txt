The first episode of “How I Met Your Mother” aired 17 years ago, so now it's officially okay to leave it in the past.
The TV show, for those who somehow managed to avoid coming across it at the dentist’s office or when flipping through channels 10 years ago, hits the same rhythm as any other wide-reaching sitcom from the early 2000s: A group of five friends face New York City together, each living in an apartment that seems entirely too expensive given how little they actually work, with practically every episode exploring the beginning or end of a romantic connection. The main characters, Lily, Marshall, Ted, Robin, and Barney, make up an un-diverse cast of incredibly attractive people. And, like every other show of its nature, the scenes normally either take place in a spacious apartment or the gang’s “hang-out spot,” a cozy booth at MacLaren’s Pub.
But despite its lack of originality, I must begrudgingly admit that I smile every time I watch “How I Met Your Mother.” The characters are idiotic in the best way, and though their banter is often out-of-touch, the practiced and witty comments are enough to keep viewers entertained — and are even funny enough to warrant the occasional chuckle. Maybe it is only because the show has been around for almost twenty years, long enough so that we have all, to some extent, grown up with it, but rewatching “How I Met Your Mother” feels comfortable. Viewers know they can always rely on Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) to volley between being fiercely smitten and dejectedly heartbroken. They expect Barney Stinson’s (Neil Patrick Harris) horrifically objectifying antics. And they know the group will always come back together in the end, despite arguments or love affairs, to toast their drinks at the same booth at MacLaren’s.
The forte of the show is how familiar it is — similar to “Friends” or “The Big Bang Theory” — but the comfort and warmth of “How I Met Your Mother” fades in its ninth and final season. Up until this point, viewers have become accustomed to the characters falling into the same kind of problems and grappling with similar love-life complications. In Season Nine, however, the writers seemingly attempt to shake things up with new sets and locations that feel forced, ultimately straying too far from what many viewers liked and expected from the show. The final season is a whirlwind of everything going wrong, and, in a “Game of Thrones”-like ending, everything is resolved entirely too quickly.
While Tracy (Cristin Milioti) and Ted’s long-awaited get together is satisfying (a good thing, too, considering it constitutes the actual meeting-the-mother in “How I Met Your Mother”), the same can’t be said for the relationships between the rest of the characters, especially between Robin (Cobie Smulders) and Barney. The two seem to doubt their marriage too much for them to plausibly go through with their wedding, and, after they marry, their divorce happens so quickly it feels like whiplash. The whole ordeal and its aftermath seems to erase the bonds writers spent eight seasons cementing. Finally, in a single episode, viewers were expected to believe that the womanizer-extraordinaire, Barney Stinson, could flip a switch and begin respecting women after the birth of his daughter.
Though, true to “How I Met Your Mother” form, while the last season could’ve been done better, it still made more than a few viewers (including myself) tear up and go “aww.” And, while I’m not sure I agree with how we got there, Robin and Ted’s final scene with the blue french horn seemed like the perfect way to conclude the series.
If we, as a human race, ever go back to watching cable, “How I Met Your Mother” is a perfectly acceptable show to land on when nothing else is on — but, given that that is unlikely, it’s not a show that warrants the Hulu subscription. To those who will defend “How I Met Your Mother” to the death as their favorite comfort show, I won’t begrudge you that. If you need to feel like you’re ten years old again eating cereal on your parents’ couch, it might just be the best show for the job. But, while the show might have been great 17 years ago, the same can’t be said of it today. It’s time for us to collectively put the show to rest and move on to bigger and better things.

Arizona singer-songwriter Alec Benjamin's songs always tell the remarkably relatable story of growing up: moving out, losing friends, flying across the country. Though on Sept. 24 at Boston’s MGM Music Hall, with his own parents and sister in the crowd, Benjamin’s incredible performance felt a lot like returning home.
After opening with Claire Rosinkranz singing her hit song “Backyard Boy,” Boston welcomed Benjamin with roaring applause. The concert, meant to feature his new “(Un)Commentary” album, opened with one of the album’s hit singles, “Devil Doesn’t Bargain.” The crowd seemed to grow more excited as Benjamin moved to some of his most popular songs, however: “Boy In The Bubble,” “Jesus in LA,” “Change My Clothes,” and “Shadow of Mine” received the loudest applause. However, with simple stage lighting and only four band members, Benjamin’s voice remained the focus of the entire performance.
In a world constantly supplementing music with autotune and blaring light displays, it was refreshing to listen to Benjamin simply sing to the accompaniment of his guitar and piano. And while his voice matched listeners' favorite recordings perfectly, his performance offered an experience that no streaming service could replicate. To the pleasant surprise of listeners, Benjamin stitched together his set with anecdotes from his life and a relatable, random flow of conscious thoughts.
“I was thinking when I sat down,” the singer said. “Well I should say something funny, and then I thought well I don’t have anything funny to say but I thought it would come to me, but it hasn’t yet, so I’m gonna play a song.”
In the entertainment industry, there can be an unnatural focus on perfection: perfect stage setup, perfect costumes, perfect performance. But Benjamin’s performance felt perfectly imperfect, as if he were genuinely performing for some of his closest friends with no need to impress.
Though the concert became truly memorable when Benjamin mentioned this idea of a homecoming, underscoring the fact that Boston was an essential city in his early singing career. Reminiscing on his earlier life, Benjamin shared that Boston was one of the very first places that he performed.
“I started out, I remember, I played in a hotel ballroom here a couple of times,” Benjamin said. “And it's crazy that I’m here right now with you guys.”
It was the song that Benjamin played next that truly hushed the crowd with both awe and nostalgia. As he switched from guitary to the piano, Benjamin told the story of the first song that he ever wrote, which he performed right here in Boston back in 2016:
“One of the first times that I ever got to play this song in front of people who didn’t know me was actually here in Boston, and I wrote this song when I was 17. And it was the first song that I ever released, but then it got taken down, so maybe I’ll…maybe I’ll put it back up.”
The song “Paper Crowns” was taken down from streaming services such as Spotify and iTunes, making this performance of his first song even more memorable. And if Benjamin’s intimate concert wasn’t already wholesome enough, the singer ended his concert with a sincere thank you. After thanking his parents, MGM Music Hall, and his band members, he graciously thanked the crowd.
“And most importantly we have you guys, the most important part of the equation.”
An overall compassionate person and singer wholly appreciative of his audience, his concert left his fans with a feeling of hopefulness. Alec Benjamin’s voice alone would exceed the expectation of any regular listener, but his honest anecdotes and gracious personality were the cherry on top of an outstanding performance.

Steeped in summer vibes, and following a successful string of concerts from their ongoing world tour, The Driver Era has returned with their third studio album, “Summer Mixtape.” Brothers and former R5 bandmates Ross and Rocky Lynch debuted their pop-funk duo in 2018, finding their niche in flirty lyrics and instrumentation that skirts the border between pop and alternative rock. However, their new album, released on Sept. 16, makes one fact abundantly clear: Summer is over. Uncomfortably contrived in its effort to revive carefree, beachy vibes, and to reproduce fresh derivations of their previous lyrics, this album falls flat — far short of the electric charm captured by prior fan favorite songs.
Released first as a single on July 28, “Malibu” is meant to be the unifying track on the album. While its celebration of days spent in paradise resonates with the summer vibe the duo is striving for, the song simply feels like a futile return to familiar territory. Replete with dreamy verses about starry summer nights, and driven by Ross’s chorus, “Wish I could stay with you / Stay here in Malibu,” the song is tangibly reminiscent of the band’s top two tracks on Spotify, “A Kiss” and “Afterglow,” which also feature anthemic, dance-able choruses and coy lyrics.
Undeniably, Ross’s charm is The Driver Era’s bread and butter. With over 2.1 billion views on “Ross Lynch” tagged TikTok videos, fans are evidently obsessed with the former Disney Channel heartthrob’s charismatic concert footage, whether he’s busting out in a dance move or flashing a sly smile. However, perhaps it is long-time fans’ surprise at seeing Ross Lynch command a concert crowd as a singer, rather than as a teen star dancing atop neon surf boards in the 2013 “Teen Beach Movie” that accounts for the band’s social media impact thus far. Relying heavily on the sensual energy of these concert performances, “Malibu” is not the only song that feels derivative of previous work. New tracks such as “Fantasy,” and “Bronco,” also prompt the same question of whether there is more than this single dimension to The Driver Era’s lyrics and style.
After listening to the entire album, the answer remains unclear. What is apparent, however, is that the Lynch brothers have been asking themselves the same question. Various songs on the album demonstrate an intentional and dramatic divergence in style, and even the album title — as a “mixtape” — is a signal that the band is actively seeking ways to expand the musical niche they have carved.
For example, “The Money” and “Keep Moving Forward” hit rather clumsily on the electronic dance vibe, with thrumming bass, heavy beats, and repetitive lyrics. On the other hand, more mellow, indie-rock reminiscent songs like “I got you, you got me,” and “Turn the music up,” appear to be differentiated from the rest of the album with both lower-case song titles and lead vocal performances by Rocky Lynch. “Back to You,” as an electric guitar driven ballad, is effectively slower and more overwrought than previous singles, except now resting on such cliché sentiments as looking for “love in all the wrong places.”
Standing out from the rest of the album,“Like a King” is the one song that shows hope of success in the band’s apparent musical exploration. On this track, the brothers combine cute lyrics and an extended metaphor about royalty with an experimental rhythmic change midway through the song. “So why don’t we find a place by the sea?” Lynch asks of his “queen” as the lead melody diverges from the syncopated drum beat. Adding a clipped chuckle between verses, his voice wafts off in an echo effect before crisply snapping back into the foreground. “Like a King” feels like a song to blast on the radio with the windows down, even though the beachy vibes it exudes would have resonated far better if the album had been released a few months earlier, in the true heat of the summer.
Ultimately, “Summer Mixtape” suffers from its post-summer September release date and demonstrates the shortcomings of staying too close to the successful trends of prior albums. Unfortunately, their experimental styles veer off course unsuccessfully as well, but the album still presents the potential for new directions in future work. While their popularity on social media and live stage-presence is undeniable, the band’s next choices will be essential in determining whether The Driver Era will remain entrenched in their current musical niche or will fade like those sun soaked days of a summer past.

On Sept. 27, South Korean singer-songwriter BIBI released her latest single “Animal Farm” in anticipation of her debut studio album “Noir: The Lowlife Princess” scheduled to drop in November. The release, which landed on her 24th birthday, was accompanied by a bloody film noir music video featuring a decadent masked party.
In the music video, BIBI plays Oh Geum-ji, a character inspired by Lee Geum-ja from the 2005 thriller classic “Lady Vengeance.” Set in crime-ravaged 2044, the upcoming album chronicles the life of Oh Geum-ji as a female leader of the underworld that exists beneath the Han River. “Animal Farm” is the first installment of the story and foreshadows more to come, including a companion webtoon.
The song’s music video opens with the introduction of Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in G minor, Op. 23 No. 55, to which pig-nosed and masked men prepare to feast on BIBI, who is perched on the table in the form of a roast pig. Following a dissonant slaughterhouse scream, BIBI appears in a white dress, walking to a waltz toward her perpetrators. Their impending slaughter is prefaced by their gorging on wine and bread, soon to be their final supper.
“It might be pretty / It might be beautiful / It might be grand,” she sings as she ascends to the table. Katana in hand, the singer charges straight at the pig-headed head of the table and beheads him. “Die,” the chorus begins. Imbrued in blood, BIBI cannibalizes her victimizers-to-victims and even taunts as she beheads them: “Hang my pretty head in your room.” The scene then escalates to an intense no-holds-barred action sequence. BIBI’s characteristic falsettos cut through, the shrill and feline tone helping portray her as a predator and subvert the initial power dynamic.
Transgressive and cinematic, the music video visually cites Tarantino’s Kill Bill: one-woman army, fountains of blood, flying limbs galore. After she beheads her enemies, she is left wondering, “What have we lost?” Drenched in blood, BIBI begins humming ethereally, capturing the emptiness that follows a pyrrhic victory. The piece ends with a cathartic guitar outro.
"I have a new song out. But it's fine if you don't watch the MV. It's pretty bloody," BIBI told her festival audience two days after the release. But beyond the gore, the music video for “Animal Farm” is akin to a short film with action-packed scenes and over two minutes in ending credits. It’s a thrilling peek into BIBI’s upcoming artistic repertoire, including her acting role in an upcoming noir film “Hwaran.”“Animal Farm” is a testament to not only BIBI’s musical prowess but also her knack for storytelling.

Most people hadn’t heard of Memphis rapper Glorilla (and many still haven’t) until her song “F.N.F” suddenly went viral last summer. The song didn’t become popular because it is particularly well-composed or insightful (in any sense of the word), though: It became popular because it’s fun.
And, frankly, after two summers ruled by various pandemic restrictions, Glorilla served as the perfect usher to welcome the return of the “Hot Girl Summer.”
Gloria Woods, affectionately known as Glorilla, was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and originally dreamed of being a singer, but switched to rap when she lost her voice. The 23-year-old rapper released her first song in 2019 and received generally little attention outside of Memphis. She’s released a handful of singles in the last few years but didn’t catch large scale attention until “F.N.F.” went viral last summer. Glorilla recently signed to Yo Gotti’s label CMG., joining a roster of heavy hitters such as Moneybagg Yo, Est Gee, Mozzy and 42 Dugg. “F.N.F” being such a success helped her land the deal.
Released on Sept. 9, “F.N.F (Let’s Go) [Remix]” begins with an already strong beat as Hitkidd’s trademark opening runs and Latto and JT announce their presence on the track. When the beat drops, Glorilla goes in hard on her first verse: her words are clear, her voice is deep, and her Southern accent is strong. The chorus is, admittedly, simple, and closes with her and a group of female friends repeating “Let’s go!” several times, but the message is clear: Glorilla raps for independent and assertive groups of women.
Though the beat is undoubtedly fun, the verse is not good. Yes, the energy is high, but there is no narrative or substantial message, and though everyone needs a hype song, four minutes is a long time for pure, elementary braggadocio.
After the first verse repeats, about halfway through the song, the listener hears JT’s distinctive voice break through. Because the beat is so simple, it’s hard for JT to catch a flow that is particularly impressive, but she does switch up her rhythm halfway through her verse, making the song somewhat more dynamic.
Atlanta-based superstar, Latto, gives the last new verse. While her rhythm is also underdone, her verse is a little sharper and a little smarter than the others’ and she gives Glorilla slightly more credibility just by association.
The content and quality of the featured artists verses aside, the featured artists themselves are more notable.
After Latto’s most recent album “777,” her politically pointed and well-crafted single “PUSSY,” and her winning Best New Artist at the BET awards in June, she has risen to the top of the rap/hip hop totem pole very quickly. And while JT and Yung Miami haven’t released an album in a couple years, part of that is because they don’t need to. City Girls successfully marked their territory in 2020 with their recognizable style and nearly unreplicable voices.
With so much weight behind these features, this remix acts as more of a rap culture political message than simply a song. Latto and JT are willing to endorse and actively support Glorilla as the face of a new generation of Black female rappers from the south.
But while a strong beat and getting hype with your friends is fun, being positioned as a budding leader in Black female rap takes more than sub-par lyrics and using that heavy Memphis accent as a party trick. So now the question becomes: did BET’s Best New Artist and the queen of Miami choose right?

The climate crisis creates a unique sense of dread. It feels like you’re doing nothing to help, and everything to make things worse without even knowing. Environmental destruction is so ingrained in our way of life — driving to work, going shopping — that it feels impossible to do anything right. For example, if you’ve purchased fast fashion in the past, you might want to donate it to a charity or thrift store and replace it with a more ethically-made garment. But even in donating this fast fashion piece, it’s still likely to end up in a landfill.
There seems to be no room for error on the tightrope of sustainability, and when you slip up, your attempts to course correct only make things worse. This, in addition to the urgent messaging about natural disasters and other existential threats that are as real as they are terrifying, generates an underlying (occasionally overlying) current of panic without direction.
Despite how little we discuss the climate — compared to, say, comping clubs, tight deadlines, internship applications, lack of sleep — in our day-to-day lives on campus, the majority of young people struggle with some form of eco-anxiety, distress related to climate change and its effects.
I first heard of eco-anxiety at an event at the Peabody Essex Museum. Kelsey Hudson, a climate psychologist at Boston University, flipped through a presentation about mental health and climate change. In many ways, I related to it. I was worried about the future that felt completely out of my hands. I felt guilty, overwhelmed, powerless, and stressed.
None of these feelings are new to Harvard students, but the climate crisis takes a different kind of emotional toll on a person. Completing assignments, comping clubs, and applying to internships are at least partially within our control. We can’t determine the deadlines, but we can decide when we work and for how long, for example. And aside from group projects, we mostly have to rely on ourselves. As students, we’ve become masters of self-sufficiency. For better or worse, pressure breeds isolation and independence. Whether we sink or swim becomes entirely dependent on how hard we kick (no floaties to be found).
Conditioned into self-reliance, we struggle to see change as a communal effort where commitment is required by all. Instead, it’s an individual offense. Everyone is carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders individually. The feelings caused by this are felt by all but acknowledged by no one, leaving young people at school and in the world to paddle frantically underwater as they seemingly coast with ease.
In addition to the constant, underlying worries that young people struggle with, there’s the added element of the lingering effects of climate-induced disasters. Hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and other events take a toll on anyone’s mental wellness, leading to trauma, shock, depression, and more.
But there is hope.
Although a little late, youth mental health is finally being discussed on a national level. President Joe Biden has committed millions of dollars to address the mental health crisis, encouraging schools to increase access to services in schools.
Even if many of us (myself included) haven’t had the best experience with Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services, something is better than nothing. Speaking to a therapist, counselor, or even a trusted friend about your concerns with the climate crisis is a good start. What’s even more effective is doing something to regain the agency that climate change takes away. Make lifestyle changes that empower you to make a difference, creating a happier mind and planet.
Whether you’re a seasoned organizer or an everyday environmentalist, the threat climate change poses to our mental health is real and true. I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to completely shake the feeling of dread and uncertainty — it’s natural in response to an actual threat — but it’s important to use these emotions as motivation.
We’re not alone in these feelings, but we’re not alone in creating solutions either.

Just last week, a University report called on Harvard to expand its climate change offerings by hiring new faculty and staff in the field and establishing a standing committee to direct the school’s efforts. This framing is apt, correctly recognizing Harvard’s unique place as an institution empowered with both teaching future leaders and setting national precedent for how other academic institutions should prepare their students for a rapidly warming world.
Yet, to truly make a difference, the quality of the University’s climate pedagogy must match the ambition of its investments.
This past June, Harvard announced its plans to use a recent $200 million donation to establish the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. The magnitude of the investment, then, is there. But is the direction?
There are two dominant approaches to tackling climate change. The first strategy, mitigation, focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions today to minimize the adverse effects of global warming tomorrow. This approach is necessary. It is also privileged, favoring those communities that have already benefited from dirty development enough that they may shift their gaze from growth in the present to preservation for the future.
Conversely, the other approach — adaptation — shifts the focus to preparing countries for the current and future effects of climate change through preventative steps such as reducing disaster risk, ensuring access to freshwater supplies, and adjusting agriculture to include more drought-tolerant seeds. This is the most urgent task for the developing world: To find ways to cope with increasingly severe climate impacts that will hit them disproportionately hard.
In the fight against climate change at Harvard and beyond, however, there is a tendency to take “sustainability” to mean mitigation while losing track of the necessity for adaptation. This is a problem. According to the United Nations, striving for sustainability requires that we “meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” When it comes to saving the world, mitigation and adaptation both play important roles. Yet, when it comes to Harvard’s climate offerings, the former clearly takes center stage.
Harvard currently offers a broad range of science and policy courses focused on mitigation from the perspectives of biological and physical science, Government, and Economics, among others. By contrast,  just three Environment Science and Public Policy courses offered this year address the importance of adapting to the unique environmental challenges that climate change poses for the developing world. One, a junior seminar on “Addressing the Global Climate Crisis: Challenges for Both Developed and Developing Economies,” currently only includes 14 students. The other two, titled “Water Resources in Developing Countries” and “Solid Waste in Developing Countries,” respectively, seek to address narrow — albeit important — topics. This limited coverage cannot by itself provide students with a holistic, comprehensive picture of the many challenges climate change will pose to the developing world.
Adaptation, specifically focused on applications for the developing world, deserves a bigger slice of Harvard’s pedagogical pie. The cruel irony of the climate crisis — that developing countries have historically contributed the least to global warming but will suffer the most from its effects — makes this change a moral imperative.
Rich countries have built a hill atop colonialism, natural resource extraction, and environmental degradation. Now, we sit on it and look out at the horizon, watching the world below us burn. Learning about the ways that real human needs — from all corners of the globe — are harmed by a degrading environment is a fundamental precursor to building a more sustainable world. If Harvard truly wants to respond to offer a more comprehensive climate education, this is the philosophy that must pave the way.
Other universities are starting to step up to the plate. Yale, for instance, offers focus fields within an Environmental Studies major that allows students to explicitly study sustainable development or environmental justice. As more institutions of higher learning follow suit, Harvard’s choice to disregard these emerging fields will turn from oversight to negligence.
The recently-published University report is right: Harvard needs to expand its climate-related offerings. That involves vision as much as it involves resources. Hopefully, the new Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability will be a bold first step towards a sustainable world rather than just a sustainable Boston.
Climate change is a shared problem. Its solutions must be shared too.

The transition to college isn’t easy. How should you make friends, and who should you avoid? What concentration should you choose? And what on earth is sociology, anyway?
Advising is Harvard’s very limited bulwark against this confusion, and it has some room for improvement. Harvard has assembled an intricate web of advisors to meet students’ needs. First-years are assigned a residential proctor, an academic advisor (sometimes the same person), and a peer advising fellow — an older student assigned to provide social support. As students move into their residential houses in sophomore year, they are assigned a tutor and later a concentration advisor.
Often, the fit between a student’s interests and their advisors’ expertise is imperfect at best. Achieving a better fit requires students to actively seek out graduate students and professors who better align, a burden that may feel light to many but falls most heavily on those who are least familiar with the modes and conventions of academia.
While the advising system seems broadly effective in its social advising and we commend our PAFs for their excellent work, academic advising leaves much to be desired. Harvard prides itself for its rich pool of resources yet many students describe struggling to find them. A restructuring of the advising system can lead to better-actualized graduates by making it easier for students to sift through the vast arsenal of opportunity Harvard provides.
Social advising is strong, but it can be improved. Just as first-year students are connected with PAFs, sophomores and juniors would benefit from similar relationships with older peer advisors. The transition toward equipping PAFs to provide academic advice also strengthens their role by recognizing that social and academic success are often intimately entwined (although we wish that new responsibilities would come with additional pay). Similarly, upperclassmen can still benefit tremendously from discussing course choices with peers who have sat in those same classes. Older PAF analogues could perhaps be integrated into the house system, providing the mix of academic and social support we prize.
Logistical and career advising would benefit from more substantial overhaul. Many students have expressed dissatisfaction with the sometimes cursory nature of advising on Harvard’s myriad requirements. Harvard should make sure that academic advisors have the familiarity with the undergraduate course catalog necessary to offer valuable advice on course selection.
Making greater efforts to match first-year advisors with the admittedly fluid academic interests of first-years will help. Recognizing the diversity of non-academic factors the influence advising needs is also key: advisors should be trained, for example, to understand the different advising needs of First Generation-Low Income students.
The College should also make career advising a mandatory part of the advising curriculum. Currently, the Office of Career Servies presents a valuable tool for students. However, making some student interaction with OCS mandatory will provide students with a helpful nudge in the right direction and overcome some of the friction of the current system.
The final goal of the advising system, perhaps hardest to quantify, should be supporting intellectual curiosity. The existing system goes some way toward this goal, with an understandable focus on course selection. However, it’s important to remember that the vast sea of Harvard’s resources extends from research programs to extraordinarily well-funded extracurriculars to many and varied travel fellowships.
Harvard needs  “intellectual curiosity” advisors whose role is to demystify this tangled web and offer advice tailored to each student’s academic interests. The Economics department offers a list of professors and their areas of expertise to students looking for thesis advisors. The College should take inspiration: Give undergraduates a list of potential advisors and their respective academic interests. This would give students the opportunity to receive valuable academic advice from aligned sources.
So much of what sets Harvard apart is the scale and diversity of its non-curricular resources. A student who goes through their four years without proper advising loses access to much of what makes Harvard special. That means be proactive, of course. Don’t wait for a sometimes lumbering advising system to point you in the right direction.
But it also means that the investments in better advising will yield large dividends. The College is complex — good. Help us manage that complexity

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between classes, during lunch breaks, and while completing assignments, hundreds of Harvard Law School students participated in a day-long sit-in on Tuesday to demand that the school’s administration increase educational opportunities related to reproductive rights.
Members of the Harvard Law School Alliance for Reproductive Justice organized the protest, encouraging passersby from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to sit on the floor of Wasserstein Hall’s lobby and sign on to a letter the student organization will present to HLS leadership on November 1.
The letter — which had more than 800 signatories as of Thursday evening — outlines three main demands for HLS: the establishment of a reproductive rights clinic, the hiring of at least one full-time reproductive rights professor, and the creation of a reproductive justice curriculum.
ARJ co-president and third-year HLS student Vandana Apte said the Supreme Court’s June decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ending federal protections for abortion has fueled student advocacy for reproductive rights.
“Especially in light of Dobbs and the momentum that a lot of students have had since then, we decided that this was a great opportunity to have a sit-in,” she said.
The sit-in’s date — October 6 — coincided with the “Day of Student Action for Reproductive Justice” organized by the Graduate Student Action Network and the Young Democratic Socialists of America. As part of the nationwide day of action, students at more than 50 schools and universities staged reproductive justice protests and hosted informational events.
ARJ plans to solicit more signatures from HLS faculty and alumni, host speaker events, and run a pro bono reproductive rights hackathon throughout the rest of the month, according to the organization’s leaders.
Second-year HLS student Morgan B. Carmen, co-vice president of ARJ, said the sit-in was “just the very, very beginning” of the organization’s efforts.
“On day one, the fact that we’ve around 807 signatures I think is very telling for what we’re going to see for the rest of the month,” she said.
Samantha J. Nagler, a third-year student at HLS and co-policy chair of ARJ, said she believes protesting via a sit-in is important because it ensures a “physical presence on campus,” noting that Wasserstein Hall was an ideal choice because it holds the most law school classes on campus.
“We definitely have admin’s attention now in a way that we probably wouldn’t have if we had pursued other forms of advocacy,” Apte added.
In response to the protest, Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that HLS has “always welcomed input” from students, and that multiple law school offerings “touch on these topics.”
“We have also hosted a visiting professor specializing in reproductive rights and justice in each of the last several years, including one this spring,” he wrote.
Apte said she believed the protest gave people “an outlet” to express frustration they have “kept pent up for many months” after Dobbs v. Jackson.
“A lot of that energy really came out today, and so it felt like it was a very powerful thing that we did,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council elected nine students from across the University’s 12 graduate schools to fill executive board positions this week.
Some of the positions were left open from the Council’s spring elections, in which several roles were left unfilled despite multiple candidates running. Five board members were elected on Monday night and the remaining four positions were filled during a subsequent meeting on Thursday.
At Monday’s meeting, Harvard Graduate School of Education student Ulziijargal Sukhbaatar was elected chair of operations, a role responsible for an array of administrative and logistical tasks. Sukhbaatar said in her candidate speech she is eager to learn “other leadership skills and become a successful chair of operation.”
Sukhbaatar will be the first HGSE student to serve as operations chair in at least a decade, she said.
Azwa Nayeem, another HGSE student, was elected chair of governance, which interprets the provisions of the GSE constitution and bylaws. The body’s current president, Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, previously held the role.
Running uncontested, Gabriel O. Pagan, a student at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School, was elected chair of information. Pagan will be responsible for overseeing the design and maintenance of the HGC’s website and archives.
Shreya Verma, an HGSE student, was elected co-chair of programming. She will work to organize social events alongside Prabhroop K. Chawla, a Harvard Divinity School student who was elected in the spring. Seven students ran for the programming co-chair position, but only three were present to deliver candidate speeches on Monday.
“I just love organizing events because the energy and the vibe around that is very exciting,” Verma said on Monday.
In the final round of Monday night elections, Harvard Graduate School of Design student Cayden Z. A. Arja was elected chair of marketing, a role responsible for bolstering the council’s visibility across the University.
On Thursday, the Council elected its chairs of academic affairs, student well-being, diversity and inclusion, and student advocacy and engagement.
Medical School student Arya S. Rao ran uncontested for academic affairs chair, a new role. Annie E. Kim, a dual-degree student at the Harvard Extension School and HGSE, was elected co-chair of student well-being. She will work alongside Extension School student Ambria K. Jones, who was elected in the spring.
HGSE student Shabeha Haque was elected as the chair of diversity and inclusion after a seven-way race.
Haque said in her candidate speech that she hopes to increase transparency and support for international students, who she said are sometimes disconnected from campus happenings.
“During my term, I hope to solve these problems by creating more transparency about events happening on campus, also creating D&I office hours to invite students of the general grad school body to discuss ideas and programming, and also create educational events regarding international school students,” she said.
In the final election on Thursday, GSAS student Janan Iranbomy was elected chair of student advocacy and engagement after a runoff.
Sierra, the council’s president, wrote in an emailed statement that he, alongside other graduate students, is “eager to reignite the campus.”
“Now with a complete board, HGC can be a stronger vehicle to improve graduate student life at Harvard,” he wrote.
The board members will serve in their respective positions into the spring semester, when another round of elections will be held.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a sold-out Sanders Theater, Harvard awarded seven individuals — including actress Laverne Cox and basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal, the University’s highest honor in African American Studies, on Thursday.
The five other honorees included author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, philanthropist Agnes Gund, Citigroup executive Raymond J. McGuire ’79, former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and artist Betye Saar. The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research hosted the ceremony, which took place for the first time since 2019.
The Du Bois Medal honors its namesake, the African American scholar and civil rights activist, who graduated from Harvard College in 1890.
In an interview, University Professor and Hutchins Center Director Henry Louis Gates Jr. said the awards “honor outstanding achievement in or contributions to African American, African, and Afro-Latin American culture.”
The ceremony was open and free to the public. More than 300 seats were reserved for local high school students to attend.
“You are our future,” Gates said during the event, addressing the high schoolers.
Professor of American History Robin Bernstein introduced Cox, describing her achievement of “so many firsts,” including her receipt of the medal.
“She is the first openly transgender actress to be nominated for a primetime acting Emmy, the first trans woman of color to have a leading role on a mainstream, scripted television series,” Bernstein said. “She is the first openly trans person to appear on the covers of TIME Magazine, British Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Essence Magazine.”
“When we stand for justice, sometimes we have to let go of people, places, things in our lives that do not serve us standing in solidarity with each other,” Cox said in her acceptance speech.
Professor Suzanne P. Blier, a historian of African art and architecture, introduced Saar and described her art as “championing the sculptural idiom of assemblage to address core issues of racial prejudice, caricature, and injustice.”
“[Art] can take you all kinds of places, and the kind of art I do comes from all kinds of places,” Saar said in her remarks.
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf introduced Patrick, detailing his distinguished career, which has included positions in the U.S. Justice Department, the NAACP, and now HKS.
In his acceptance address, Patrick described Du Bois as “a towering, prophetic leader who had the bravery and integrity to see things as they are and still imagine what America could be, and to reach for it.”
“That, to me, is both the genius and the frustration of America — that we can reinvent, refound ourselves from time to time,” Patrick said. “That we have to may be the frustration, but we can do it, and we must.”
Gund was introduced by African and African American Studies and History of Art and Architecture associate professor Sarah E. Lewis ’01, who lauded Gund’s decision to allocate $165 million toward criminal justice reform from the sale of a Roy F. Lichtenstein painting in her collection.
Gund called receiving the medal “among the great joys of my life.”
Hutchins Center Chair Glenn H. Hutchins ’77 introduced McGuire as a “titan of Wall Street” and lauded his support of De La Salle Academy, “the only private school in New York City for academically talented, less advantaged children.”
“This medal is not about me. It is about the hope and promise that it represents, it is about the kindergarten to 12th grade Black and brown boys and girls across the country,” McGuire said.
English professor Tracy K. Smith ’94 introduced Adichie as someone “consecrated to the work of the word.”
“I’m so grateful for this award because, again, it just makes me think that what I’m doing matters,” Adichie said in her acceptance speech.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow introduced Abdul-Jabbar, who used his address to draw attention to inequality in the United States.
“It’s important that we keep alive the spirit of Dr. Du Bois, not just by honoring his name, but by continuing his fight for equality for all people,” Abdul-Jabbar said.

Diego A. Garcia Blum was only weeks into his first semester as a master’s of public policy student at the Harvard Kennedy School when he found himself unexpectedly taking on the role of a teacher.
One of Garcia Blum’s classes, a course required for all first-year MPP students in fall 2019, launched a debate on the relationship between public officials and law enforcement. The discussion focused on a 2018 decision by a California mayor to warn her city about an upcoming raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But many students were unfamiliar with United States immigration policy and made insensitive remarks on the topic, said Garcia Blum, who immigrated to the United States from Colombia at a young age.
“A lot of things were said that were very triggering to students of those backgrounds,” he said. “The students of color had to become the teachers in the class to ground the arguments in the history of public policy being used against our communities.”
But HKS classes should not count on students with lived experience to educate their peers in order to “have a good policy conversation,” Garcia Blum argued.
Garcia Blum said his first semester experience convinced him the Kennedy School needed to create a course to provide students a shared understanding of how race and racism impact public policy.
Following the police murder of George Floyd in May, the Kennedy School introduced such a course in fall 2020 in the form of a required two-week intensive “Race and Racism” class for first-year MPP students. It was then expanded into a semester-long course for the fall 2021 semester.
“In order for us to have real conversations about the policy, everyone needed to be up to date with this,” Garcia Blum said. “That was why the class was so important.”
All first-year MPP students were required to take “The Responsibilities of Public Action” during their first semester — the class where Garcia Blum and his classmates were asked to debate immigration policy. And Garcia Blum was not the only student who noticed the course’s shortcomings.
Later in the semester, the course held an activity called the “Bell Harbor” simulation, which was “the spark that set everything off,” Garcia Blum said.
Nneka O. Onwuzurike, who was assigned to participate in the simulation, said the exercise asked students to role-play a discussion of a fictitious police murder of a Black 17-year-old boy. Some students were tasked with playing characters who would make racist and homophobic comments.
“They were asking Black and brown students, immigrants and children of immigrants, to take on a character that is in many ways anti their humanity,” Onwuzurike said.
Members of the HKS Equity Coalition, a student group advocating for justice and equitable change at the school, met in the aftermath of the Bell Harbor simulation to discuss what improvements were needed to prevent a similar situation from occurring.
During the meeting, students agreed that creating a better classroom environment would require all HKS students to receive a “grounding of knowledge in race and racism,” according to Garcia Blum, who served as the Kennedy School’s vice president of diversity at the time.
Students in the equity coalition believed that an elective class taught by HKS professor Khalil G. Muhammad, could serve as a model for a mandatory, school-wide course on the effects of race and racism on public policy.
“If we are having conversations on Black Lives Matter that see almost Fox News talking points thrown back, then we are not having real conversations,” Garcia Blum said.
The coalition subsequently staged a full-day protest outside the Kennedy School’s cafeteria — the first of many actions by the group to push HKS to “adopt an anti-racist, anti-colonial culture and curriculum” after the Bell Harbor simulation.
“We kept organizing, disrupting various town halls that the University would try to have, emailing everyone and their mother — from the dean to all of the different professors,” said Onwuzurike, a member of the coalition.
In February 2020, the coalition sent an open letter signed by 375 Kennedy School affiliates to HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf. The letter included a demand for a mandatory course on “global racism, colonialism, and public policy.”
Elmendorf responded that though the Kennedy School was “committed” to adding material on race and inequality, he was “not convinced (at least yet) that a required, standalone course is the best approach to doing so.”
Equity coalition members were left unsatisfied by Elmendorf’s response to the open letter, but shortly afterward, they were driven off campus by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
If there was any chance of the pandemic overshadowing the equity coalition’s calls for a mandatory course on race and racism, the police murder of George Floyd in May 2020 brought the conversation back to the center of attention.
Mike Yepes, an HKS alum and member of the equity coalition, said Floyd’s murder was the tipping point for the Kennedy School, resulting in a renewed focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
“The sad reality is that while we did play a big role, once the conversation got focused on DEI, it took a series of external tragedies to make HKS reactive enough to be willing to listen to our perspectives,” Yepes said.
On June 8, 2020, two weeks after the murder of George Floyd, Elmendorf announced in a school-wide communication that faculty were working on a “new, required, immersive course on race and public policy for all incoming MPP1 students for the fall.”
“That was the first win we had,” Garcia Blum said.
HKS professor Cornell William Brooks emphasized the “essential, foundational role” that student activism played in pressuring the Kennedy School administration to form the course.
“Our students have done what we admitted them to do,” Brooks said. “We admit them to lead, they insist upon leading — that’s not always easy, but they’ve done it.”
Muhammad, the HKS professor, said he received an email from then-academic dean Iris Bohnet on June 3, 2020, requesting a meeting to discuss “various events and resources on racial justice at HKS, including fall courses.”
Muhammad said the vision for the course “expanded in the wake of George Floyd.”
Muhammad said that during the first three to four years he taught at HKS, he felt that Elmendorf “was not an advocate of making the issue of race and racism as important to the Kennedy School experience for students” as today.
“Unpacking how he got to where he is now is hard for me to do,” Muhammad said. “But from my perspective, the killing of George Floyd and the messages coming from Larry Bacow and senior administrators about Harvard’s commitment to acknowledging systemic racism and white supremacy fundamentally reflected a change of tone that was mirrored in Doug’s own communications to the school community.”
In an interview Thursday, Elmendorf said two things have changed during the nearly seven years he has served as dean of the Kennedy School.
“One is the attention in this country — and some others, but especially in this country — to issues of race,” Elmendorf said. “That has increased, or broadened, the interest among our students in understanding the role of race in public policy.”
Elmendorf said the Kennedy School has also “deliberately strengthened” its faculty with expertise in racial justice.
“We don’t teach courses that we don’t have faculty strength to teach,” Elmendorf said. “To do what we are doing now required the last five years of focused recruiting effort and was not something that could just have been turned on with a switch.”
Muhammad and fellow HKS professor Sandra S. Smith spent the summer of 2020 putting together a syllabus for the first iteration of the mandatory “Race and Racism” course, which launched that fall.
After “Race and Racism” appeared on the MPP core curriculum as a required two-week intensive in the fall of 2021, students continued lobbying the administration to turn the course into a semester-long offering. Garcia Blum, who was elected Kennedy School student body president that fall, promised he would work to expand the course during his campaign.
According to Muhammad, school administrators were already discussing how the course would be offered the next fall and whether it would remain as a two-week intensive or take on a longer form.
“The initial conversation after the fall of 2020 when the course finished with myself, Professor Smith and the administration was, ‘What was our sense of what makes the most sense going forward. Do the two-week again, do a module version of it, or do a full semester course?’ Muhammad said.
He and Smith ultimately settled on a module format for the course, he said, which would split the content taught by each professor into two half-semester classes. First-year MPP students are now required to complete both sessions.
Brooks emphasized the importance of offering the Race and Racism course, saying the Kennedy School cannot “ignore race and do the job it aspires to do.”
“To not teach race or address racism and colonialism is a form of professional malpractice,” he said. “We simply have to do it.”
In the years since the class was added to the MPP core curriculum, other schools of public policy have seemed to agree.
Muhammad said he has spoken about the course with people at public policy schools at the University of California Berkeley, Columbia University, and Princeton University. The fall 2022 course catalog of Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy includes for the first time a class on race and public policy for its MPP students.
“People are paying attention,” Muhammad said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team hosted a competitive double-header as it continued Ivy League play in front of students, alumni, parents, and fans this past weekend. The hosts showed their resilience, bouncing back from the previous weekend’s loss to Dartmouth and topping Penn in a tight five-setter for its second win of the season on Friday. The next day, however, the Crimson, despite respectable performances from its players, came up short against a strong Princeton offense. Saturday’s matchup was a headline of the Title IX Celebration Weekend, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of women’s athletics at the College.
Harvard (2-9, 1-2 Ivy League) got out to a slow start in each set against the Tigers. The first, for instance, was agonizing for Crimson fans. Princeton (11-2, 3-0 Ivy League) capitalized on aces and kills to take an early 8-1 lead, which it would then translate to 10-3. Princeton’s senior outside hitter Avery Luoma dominated the net, contributing four kills in this 13-point span and 18 on the night. The hosts finally managed to find their footing after this initial slide, however. They brought themselves within two after a quick five-point run and even leveled the score at 14-14, setting the Malkin Athletic Center (MAC) aroar.
This comeback, an example of Harvard’s strong efforts this weekend and throughout the season as a whole, came in part off the arm of junior outside hitter Katie Vorhies. Vorhies posted 18 kills on the night and has led the team in kills in each Ivy League match this season, tallying 130.5 points over 39 sets played.
The rest of the first set was a game of catchup for the Crimson, as kills were traded between Luoma and junior middle blocker Ava Rauser and sophomore outside hitter Corinne Furey. Furey and Rauser had the second- and third-most kills for the team in the match respectively, and the latter also contributed four blocks. Nevertheless, Princeton’s offense, aided by Harvard errors, claimed the first set, 25-22, for the visitors.
Injuries have plagued the Crimson this season, forcing the Cantabrigians to play without key offensive components such as junior setter/hitter Ashley Wang and senior right side attacker Jaimie Rao. One player who has stood out in offsetting these losses is senior captain Bella Almanza, who posted seven kills, a team-high five blocks, and nine digs on the night.
A shining moment of Almanza’s leadership came in the third set when Harvard went on a four-point run that consisted of an Almanza kill, block (with help from junior middle blocker Ariana White), Vorhies slam that occurred because of an Almanza save, and another Almanza/White block. This series propelled the Crimson to a 16-14 lead in a set that began with a 7-2 Princeton advantage. Harvard then closed out the set, 25-20, courtesy of a kill from junior middle hitter Olivia Cooper.
This third set victory marked a reversal from the previous one’s 25-18 gap that went in favor of the Tigers. The New Jerseyans once again had a strong start, going up 5-2 before the Crimson leveled the score at five apiece. There was a deadlock from then until the halfway point of the set. The teams traded two- or three-point runs, and the score tied four times at 7-7, 10-10, 12-12, and 14-14. In the end, Princeton demonstrated its resilience by pulling ahead 22-18 before closing it out with a kill, ace, and block.
The applause was still reverberating throughout the MAC as the two teams took the court for the fourth set. The Tigers put a quick end to this celebration, however, as they took a quick 4-0 lead, which they translated into a 11-4 edge. From there, Harvard managed to find its footing, as Vorhies kills and three errors from Princeton’s senior outside hitter Melina Mahood closed Princeton’s lead to 12-11. No team could secure more than two points in a row for the next 19 rallies, and the score settled at 21-21. With the end in sight, the Tigers made one final push, combining two Luoma kills with two Crimson errors to seal the set, 25-22, and with it the match.
This disappointing loss followed a closely-contested victory over Penn (1-12, 0-3 Ivy League). Vorhies, Almanza, White, and Cooper once again dominated the offensive game, contributing to the 21-25, 25-22, 25-16, 23-25, 15-7 win. The Crimson will stay at home for one more weekend in a double-header against Yale and Brown, the latter of which will conclude the Title IX celebrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (5-4-1, 0-1) dropped a close contest to the Cornell Big Red in its Ivy League opener, but bounced back quickly a few days later by shutting out its crosstown rival, the Boston University Terriers. Although the loss was undeniably a disappointing start to its Ivy League campaign, the Crimson was undeterred and performed well against the Terriers.
The Crimson rallied after the weekend loss to face the Terriers on their home field in its final non-conference road game of the season. In a low-scoring game, the Harvard defense did its job, holding BU to no shots on net for the entire 90 minutes. Junior forward Ale Gutierrez netted the game-winner in the 25th minute, which was all the Crimson needed to emerge victorious.
Gutierrez’s goal was a team effort. Junior defender James Fahmy played a give-and-go back to junior midfielder Kaoru Fujiwara, who passed the ball to a waiting Gutierrez. From 18 yards out, Gutierrez drove it home in the bottom left corner to give Harvard the lead.
Tuesday night was a game of firsts for the Crimson, with first-year goalkeeper Cullen MacNeil notching the first collegiate shutout of his career, and giving Fujiwara the first point of his college career. Other Harvard players were also able to add to their stats, with Fahmy earning his third assist and Gutierrez his third goal.
This game moved the Crimson to 28-16-8 all-time against the Terriers.
Crimson sophomores Sam Bjarnson and Alessandro Arlotti put on a show in Ithaca this past Saturday, but ultimately it was not enough to overcome an early deficit against the Big Red.
It was a record day for Bjarnson, who netted his first career goal, which came off of sophomore Marko Isakovic’s third assist of the season. Arlotti continued his strong start, as it was the second straight game he had scored a goal and he now has 10 points on the year. Junior Willem Ebbinge assisted Arlotti’s goal, bringing his tally up to a team-high five assists on the season.
The Big Red took an early lead, with Cornell fifth-year Emeka Eneli scoring first in the 34th minute. Harvard equalized in the 44th, as Isakovic drove a free kick into the box, where Bjarnson headed it into the net.
The game continued scoreless for almost 30 minutes until Big Red senior Brandon Morales put Cornell up 2-1 in the 70th. This would not be the last time Morales struck against the Crimson, as in the 79th minute, Big Red freshman Ben Goulding finished a ball Morales drove into the penalty area, putting the pressure on Harvard to come up with answers. True to form, Arlotti found one, cutting the margin to one in the 81st minute off an Ebbinge corner. However, it was not enough for the win, and the Crimson ultimately fell 3-2 to the Big Red.
Despite the loss, many players still impressed. After his performance at Cornell, Ebbinge leads the team with 11 points, and has recorded a point in seven of the team’s games this season. Arlotti follows close behind, with his goal this weekend marking his 10th point of the season. Junior defender Nik White and sophomore defender Jan Riecke both played all 90 minutes for Harvard, building on their stability and success from the previous season.
Harvard is looking to improve on its 2021 season, which was their strongest in years with an overall record of 8-5-3, and 3-2-2 in conference. To continue building on its success, the Crimson will need to rely on last year’s leaders: Ebbinge, Arlotti, and senior forward Martin Vician.
Arlotti led the team in 2021 with 25 points, with Vician and Ebbinge following close behind with 19 and 14 points, respectively. For his efforts last season, Arlotti earned the Ivy League Rookie of the Year title and First Team All-Ivy accolades. Arlotti was joined on the first team by Ebbinge, with Vician earning second team honors, and Riecke receiving an honorable mention nod.
However, it is not only Harvard’s goal-scorers that the Crimson will need to make an impact for the team this year. White and Riecke regularly play the entire game, and Riecke has played all 900 minutes this year. Both defenders are coming off of strong 2021 campaigns and are looking to build on that success through the rest of this season.
The Crimson will return to action in its second Ivy League matchup against Columbia on Saturday, Oct. 8 at home.

First-years: it’s been over a month since you first met the perfect stranger(s) Harvard promised you’d get along with. Maybe you immediately clicked, or maybe their ability to live in filth and inability to replace the toilet paper in your in-suite bathroom have pushed you to consider transferring to Yale. Either way, it’s important to check in on how your roomie connection is doing. Here’s a list of questions you can ask to test how well you know each other. It’s like 36 Questions That Lead to Love, except the goal doesn’t have to be love, just mutual tolerance. So grab some popcorn and promise me that you’ll still “live well together” no matter how badly this goes.
1. What classes are they taking this semester?

If you know the answers to at least eight of these, you’re basically soulmates. You’ve clearly had the late-night roommate talk and are totally qualified to respond to their texts for them.
If you got at least five, you guys probably spend a good amount of time hanging out. Try to get in some wholesome roomie bonding this long weekend, and you might learn some new things about your roommate that you wouldn’t expect.
If you got less than five, maybe the fact that you wake up when your roommate stumbles home from Lamont every morning has really gotten in the way of your bonding time. Or maybe between their Math 55 psets and facetime convos with their dog, you just haven’t had the chance to show them your favorite TikTok. You’re both busy, but it’s not too late! Your roommate is (literally) your closest friend on campus, so coordinate your dhall takeout and talk about yourselves. Or your psets. Just as long as you’re talking to each other.
