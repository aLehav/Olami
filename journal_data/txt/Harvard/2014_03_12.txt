After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Violinist Max Tan ’15 made his Symphony Hall debut on March 7, playing Samuel Barber’s Violin Concerto along with the Benjamin Zander-directed Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. The Crimson caught up with Tan before his performance to chat about music, school, and striking the precarious balance between the two.
 
The Harvard Crimson: Have you always known music would be such a big part of your life?
 
Max Tan: I don’t think so. I think I knew that music was something I was very attached to, but I didn’t really quite understand why or how until I was 15 or 16. That’s a long time to be in music—I started piano when I was four—and not know exactly why. Music was something I really liked, and it was another avenue of expressing myself, and I was good at it, so I stuck with it. But I don’t think until my teenage years I quite understood what it meant to emote something through music.
 
THC: Why have you chosen to stay involved with BPYO as opposed to HRO or one of the other Harvard music ensembles?
 
MT: I don’t think it’s necessarily a decision to stay with one group over the other. I think one of the things that’s difficult about Harvard is that there are so many wonderful groups on campus, and you just want to do everything. I remember my freshman year I was in HRO, I was in...Dunster House Opera, I was in Brattle [Street Chamber Players], I did [the Harvard Pops Orchestra] for a semester, and on the side I did private lessons, and I was also doing chamber music—and so I died. That’s a huge understatement…. Sometimes people do groups because they want to do it for their friends, and they want to do it for the organization, and they want to do it for the tradition—and then there’s the other route, which is: if I do want music to be part of my life, which one will cultivate [in me] something I think is lacking?
 
THC: How do you balance schoolwork and music? Do you find it challenging?
 
MT: It’s definitely challenging. Before coming here, it would be a struggle to maybe get two, three hours of practicing in a day—but I’d still get two, three hours of practicing in a day. Here, it’s a struggle to get…an hour. But that doesn’t mean I’m practicing less. That means I’m spending time with my instrument less. I do a lot of mental practicing: I practice things through in my head as if I were playing, but I’m not doing physical practice.
 
THC: You recently returned from two weeks at the Menuhin Competition [a prestigious international competition for young violinists]—had you participated in a competition of that scale before?
 
MT: Not at all. It was not something that I was experienced with, going to competitions. One reason I decided to do Menuhin was that the age limit is 21. I just turned 21, and I figured, “Why not try and send in an application and see what might happen?” When I got the email that I was selected to go, it was also very shocking because the decision to do the competition was sort of last-minute, and I didn’t really expect anything to come out of it. Going there, the level of musicianship was incredibly high…. Everyone else has such a unique voice, they have such interesting ideas, they’re practicing so much, and a lot of them already have a lot of performing experience. It sort of re-inspired me and made me discover that there’s so much to work at, and there’s so much to benefit from, and so much to enjoy from the work.
 
THC: Any musical role models?
 
MT: So many. I think one of the most influential violin figures is Itzhak Perlman. I actually say that one because he used to be my teacher. I studied with him when I was in high school—I was in his studio at Juilliard Pre-College…. He was just an amazing teacher, a really funny guy, and also as a recording artist and a performing artist: he’s just so phenomenal. He really takes the idea of speaking the music to something no one ever does…. I think one of the things I learned from Mr. Perlman is this idea of how to empathize. How do you develop emotional expression in music, but also how do you apply all of that that you learn in music to how you live and the person you want to be?
 
THC: Realistically, then, if there was one thing you wanted to do in music—a musical bucket list—what would it be?
 
MT: I would love to travel. I would love to go to different places in Europe and Asia, Africa, South America—classical music is huge in South America. Playing concerts with friends, with other musicians—I would be totally satisfied and very happy just to collaborate with other musicians and play a lot of music. In terms of a bucket list, I don’t have anything specific, but I would love to do these things. And if I can enjoy my life and whatever I’m doing from these things, then I’m a happy person.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Beyoncé and Jay-Z are having a pretty spectacular year. Dropping her self-titled fifth album seemingly out of nowhere, Beyoncé attempted—and likely succeeded—to revolutionize the pop music industry. More importantly, she inspired several Housing Day videos, including Winthrop’s incredible “Love on Throp” and Kirkland’s slightly less astounding, though certainly interesting in its own regard, “Flawless.” 
Jay-Z did not do too badly either. After signing a promotional deal with Samsung, Jay-Z released his 12th studio album, “Magna Carta…Holy Grail,” with much mainstream success; the album went platinum in its first week. He also hopped on some of the hottest tracks of the year, including Justin Timberlake’s “Suit & Tie,” Drake’s “Pound Cake,” and his wife’s “Drunk in Love.” Most importantly, though, he is still married to Beyoncé, which is an accomplishment in itself.
But how the heck are they married? I don’t mean from a pure looks perspective—there are very few men good-looking enough to date Beyoncé—but from a music perspective. Though both artists released albums within the past year, their approach to their respective albums, both musically and commercially, could not have been more different.
Jay-Z’s “Magna Carta…Holy Grail,” released on July 4, was the epitome of a commercial album. Backed by a $5 million Samsung deal and a massive TV campaign, Jay-Z’s album was mass-marketed and featured a commercial with Rick Rubin, Timbaland, and Pharrell, among others. Ultimately, though, the hype leading up to the project’s release came across as a promotional stunt. To many, the album’s gaudy partnership with a corporation was surprisingly uncool for the cigar-smoking rap god Jay-Z.
The release of Beyoncé’s most recent album was entirely different. Without any warning, Queen Bey dropped her self-titled fifth album. Popping up as an iTunes exclusive album around midnight on Dec. 13, the album quickly gained steam on social media and news outlets. Critics praised Beyoncé’s groundbreaking, hyper-minimalist publicity strategy, which not only included her uncovetional album drop but also correspondingly simple album art. Beyoncé took an enormous leap of faith, and it paid off with one of the most exciting album releases in recent memory.
The power couple’s publicity strategies were not, however, the only area in which the artists took drastically different approaches; the quality of music on Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s respective albums also greatly varied. Beyoncé’s album was one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed of 2013, selling over 3 million copies around the globe and receiving top-notch reviews from Pitchfork, Spin, and the New York Times.  Beyoncé’s newfound and innovative minimalist approach to production didn’t hinder the album from having radio hits, including the infectiously catchy “Drunk in Love,” “Partition,” and “XO.” After a few listens, Beyoncé’s self-titled album is not only her most refreshing and innovative; it is also perhaps the best album of her career.
Jay-Z’s album, on the other hand, was remarkably lacking in originality. Despite featuring an incredibly talented cast of producers and a few memorable guest features, “Magna Carta…Holy Grail” was ultimately forgettable save for a few songs (particularly “Holy Grail” featuring Justin Timberlake, which plays in the Winthrop dining hall every day at lunch. Every. Single. Day.). While it’s not quite as bad as some of his other recent albums, “Magna Carta…Holy Grail” sounds somewhat like an album thrown together at the last minute to earn a major corporate sponsorship.
Indeed, it’s painfully unfortunate that Jay-Z has let his business aspirations seep into his artistic career. Of course, Jay-Z’s deep interest in business does not come as much of a shock; back in 2005, Jay-Z rapped, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man. Let me handle my business, damn.” But Jay Z’s turn to corporate-backed music is precisely what diminished the quality of his music. 
Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s separate careers reveal that music is much more inspiring and natural when it’s largely removed from the influence of the business world. By separating herself more from outside corporate influence, Beyoncé afforded herself both the luxury of time and artistic freedom. Not only did she gain credibility by dropping an album with virtually no outside corporate hype, but her album was likely better because of that independence. 
Of course, corporate publicity is not necessarily a bad thing. But when Jay-Z partnered up with Samsung specifically for an album release, he quite possibly reduced his own artistic freedom. Furthermore, the business-savvy Jay-Z had much less financial drive to create an album that could sell well. Of course, it’s hard to blame him. Who would turn down $5 million to make an album?
Yet Jay-Z’s songs and albums—with lyrics about the hardships of fame and wealth—lose some bite and profound meaning when they are sponsored by enormous corporate deals. Despite Jay-Z’s suave presence in pop culture, Beyoncé is the cooler and more musically interesting, innovative, and creative artist. But with the two of them raking in so much money and so many Grammy Awards, maybe I should just let Jay-Z handle his business, damn.

When Beyoncé’s newest album came out and took everyone by surprise, I remember scrolling through the BuzzFeed rehash and marveling at how relentlessly perfect each GIF looked. If the article was a bit hyperbolic—“41 Most Unbelievably Flawless and Life-Changing Moments from Beyoncé’s New Album”—it also was not alone in its conviction that the American pop icon is a true goddess. She somehow transcends the edgy sexuality of Rihanna, the scary theatricality of Lady Gaga, and the shameless appropriations of Miley Cyrus. Perfection, above all, is a branding strategy, and it seems that Beyoncé has perfected her own cult of personality.
As an entertainer, Beyoncé is on par with Michael Jackson and Madonna, but as a pop phenomenon, we may just as easily compare her to icons like Andy Warhol and Banksy. Both of these artists are celebrated as social movements unto themselves, important more for their innovations in style than artistic technique. Silk-screening was invented around a thousand years ago, after all, and street art is at least as old as the modern city. Warhol, for example, started a movement that embraced pop culture with uncritical arms. From its humble beginnings in  the iconic Campbell’s soup can, pop art celebrated the crassest corners of American life, and along with it, all the workings of consumer capitalism.
Banksy also recycles pop culture, but his art consistently breaches boundaries, both physical and political. His art unveils what consumerism really does to us, and the worst irony is that his own popularity is undermining that agenda. As his New York artist’s residency has shown, what used to be guerrilla artfare has turned into a citywide scavenger hunt that culminated in three fans’ attempts to cut down his final piece and keep it for themselves. In the craze for Banksy originals, his work has lost its renegade appeal and transformed him into a pop culture icon. He now belongs in the art collector’s gallery and the Instagram feeds of his fans. Much of Warhol’s work may never have tried to be anything more than just a celebration of capitalism, but against his will, Banksy’s movement has been domesticated.
What does all of this have to do with Beyoncé? In a way, she has picked the best of both worlds. Like Andy Warhol and Banksy, she isn’t giving us anything particularly new. Not only do some of her inspirations border on cultural appropriation, but she has also been accused of outright plagiarizing artists like South African photographer Pieter Hugo and Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker. Beyoncé buys into the glam of consumer culture as much as Warhol does. She exudes the carefree charisma of an artist who just knows how to have fun. She enjoys being at the center of her own cult of personality, and she won’t apologize for it.
But she won’t stop there: unlike Warhol, Beyoncé is not content with just celebrating American life by showing us what it looks like on the outside. She also projects the sense of purpose that makes us attracted to renegade artists like Banksy. We credit her for opening new dialogues about feminism, race, and politics. In her recent music video for “Superpower,” she pairs a niqab with kohl eyeliner, races against a wall of riot police, and chants, “Nothing I know can break us down / They can’t break us down.” The imagery is just specific enough to make us recall Tahrir Square and Taksim Gezi Park, but just vague enough to avoid making a controversial political statement. One reviewer at The Verge even labeled some numbers “boring opulence porn.” But the superficial gleam of “Superpower” is entirely different from that of Warhol’s “Death and Disaster” series, for example, which also recycles images from news media to provocative effect. However, while Warhol simply gives us images to digest for ourselves, Beyoncé goes a step further, translating the images for her audience and morphing modern history into a marketable combination of aural and visual opulence.
For all its provocative imagery, “Superpower” is just one number in a relentless succession of meticulously produced videos. On “Beyoncé,” she is alternately a beauty pageant contestant, a mother, an activist, a lover. In this way, she does to herself what Banksy’s fans did to Banksy. She domesticates political revolt just as she renders innocuous race, class, and sexuality. With Beyoncé, everything is provocative, but not too provocative. Safe, but not too safe. Always sensuous, always smooth, her sexuality is never frightening like Lady Gaga’s, and her cultural appropriations never tasteless like Miley Cyrus’s. She could not be so perfect without being so self-aware. The cult of Beyoncé works like a well-oiled machine, with the open sores of race, feminism, and politics always safely contained within the cogs of production, distribution, and marketing. She is a flawless entertainer not because she is a queen, a diva, or a goddess, but because she is a system that knows its audience. And in that sense, she is truly perfect.

Michael R. Bloomberg will deliver the keynote speech at Harvard’s 363rd Commencement Exercises this May. Breaking the news last week, University President Drew Faust was effusive in her praise of the former New York City mayor, celebrating his commitment to activism, philanthropy, and public service. Yet Faust’s enthusiasm is not shared by many members of the Harvard community, who say Bloomberg’s selection is an insult to students of color. In large measure, we agree with them. We believe that the purpose of Commencement is to recognize the graduating class, and that any speaker who alienates vast portions of the student body undermines that goal.  
Under the Bloomberg administration, “stop-and-frisk” became common practice at the New York Police Department. The policy, which allows officers to stop, question, and search pedestrians if there is “reasonable” suspicion that a crime is being committed, took on a distinctly racial hue: In a city of eight million people, the practice was employed 685,724 times in 2011, and almost 90 percent of those detained were black or Hispanic. Bloomberg and Ray W. Kelly, New York’s ex-police commissioner, claim stop-and-frisk reduces crime, but the evidence is sparse. In 2011, 88 percent of stops yielded neither a ticket nor an arrest. Even as the number of stops ballooned by 600 percent from 2001 to 2011, the number of shooting incidents remained constant. Indeed, a mere 0.2 percent of stops turned up firearms. There is no justification—moral or pragmatic—for such a policy.  
 Admittedly, Harvard has invited controversial figures to address graduates in the past. Last year’s pick, Oprah Winfrey, raised hackles from community members for her promotion of pseudoscience and pop medicine. But Bloomberg presents an entirely different dilemma: While she may have stretched the facts, Winfrey never presided over a policing regime that humiliated tens of thousands of people. Bloomberg is a complex figure, with a checkered history on issues of race and minority outreach, but the negative reaction to his selection has, understandably, been intensely personal.  
Muslim students have protested the decision, citing the NYPD’s intrusive surveillance of mosques, ostensibly done as part of its counter-terrorism strategy. Many black and Latino students have also objected, saying the choice trivializes their encounters with racial discrimination and oppression. For some, the Bloomberg announcement exacerbates the sense of social exclusion expressed by the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign. This alienation alone is reason enough to regret the choice. The University’s defenders may argue that this is a case of hypersensitivity. But our lived experiences inform our emotions. No one has the right to tell someone else whether to be offended or not.  
 Had Bloomberg been asked to the Institute of Politics, we would have urged our classmates to engage in a respectful dialogue with the former mayor, and to challenge him on his record. But Commencement is not a night at the JFK Jr. Forum—every graduate should feel celebrated and included. We realize that no speaker will be acceptable to every single graduate, but to extend an invitation to someone who alienates entire segments of the student body is ill-advised and worthy of condemnation. This May, the Class of 2014 will gather to mark four years of growth and accomplishment. We only wish the choice of commencement speaker had reflected such unity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Eight frantic freshmen stand in a room, huddled together, running occasionally to the window to stare at the writhing mass of upperclassmen mobbing in front of John Harvard. These Housing Day veterans scream indecipherable slogans and look about as close to football hooligans as Harvard students ever do. They’re scared—you’re scared!—and someone says, decisively, “Anything but…”
Housing Day can often seem so incredibly gargantuan as an event that it’s easy to forget all of the amazing, important things you’ve already done. You’ve taken your first college finals. You’ve navigated the social minefield of Annenberg in September and shivered in the cold of New Haven to watch your football team win for the seventh time in a row (which just so happens to be the second-longest winning streak ever). You’ve laughed, you’ve cried, and you’ve found a small group of people to join you on this seemingly terrifying journey to House life.
But we’re not here to talk about how amazing you are (which is pretty amazing). We’re here to talk about how much we love our Houses. We want you to be excited—not scared—come tomorrow. As much as you’ve found your blocking group to accompany you into upperclassmen life, you’re about to be welcomed into a blocking group of around 300, and they’re all thrilled to meet you.
 
People have been telling you lots of things about the Houses, and it’s hard to know whom to trust. For most of your freshman year, you’ll have heard getting quadded is roughly equivalent to getting sent to Siberia, and you’re starting to believe it. But then again, some kid in your Ec 10 section told you that most people on the River have, like, four people in one bedroom and all their stuff gets stolen by giant mutant rats, so: Who’s right?
 
Despite all those rumors, we hope you’ll listen to us, because we’ve all been in your shoes. We’ve had those frantic conversations over dinner in Annenberg, endured the relentless drama of blocking, and panicked that this single, merciless algorithm would determine the next three years of our lives. And not only did we make it through to the other side unscathed, but we also made it there triumphant, and so excited to wake up at 7 a.m. to show you guys just how much we love our Houses.
 
We all have different reasons, too.
 
For example, when it’s snowing or raining, simply hop on your personal shuttle service—the Mather Express. It’ll get you home to your single in less than 10 minutes. Enjoy a meal with fellow Matherites while gazing out floor-to-ceiling windows in the dining hall made famous by the house’s annual foam party, Mather Lather.
 
To relax after a long and tiring week, Lowell Tea is the perfect place to enjoy freshly baked treats with your friends and the rest of the Lowell community.
 
Currier’s central dining hall and entrance means having a friend in the d-hall at all times of day and night, most likely in their pajamas.
 
In Leverett, you’ll be in the biggest house with the best views in th newest rooms on campus. Also, monkey bread.
 
On top of three formals and back-gate access to the Charles River, every Eliotite graduates with a diploma frame made in the wood shop, keeping a piece of Eliot with them as they move on to the next chapter in their lives.
 
Winthrop’s amazing tutors and vibrant d-hall culture make walking in the House at the end of the long day feel like coming home.
 
Kirkland celebrates the holiday season in epic fashion with its infamous “Secret Santa” week, hosts some incredible artists for Cultural Rhythms in its stunning JCR, stands as current defender of the Straus Cup, and can claim Mark Zuckerberg as a former resident.
 
Whether it’s in the gorgeous dining hall, the basement grill, or Masters’ open houses, the mouthwatering food at Dunster brings together all Dunsterites to form a spirited and inseparable community. Plus, the rooms are sweet.
 
Find bliss at all times in Quincy: find it in your friends from other houses during dinner, in your CS50 study group during brain break, and in your golden, gooey, Quincy Grille mozzarella sticks at 2 a.m.
 
In Adams House, students look forward to a chance to Carpe every Noctem, to schmooze it up with all of their housemates at Drag Nights, Winter Feasts, and renowned in-house Formals, and—most importantly of all—to fall in love with the community that thrives within Adams’s historic golden walls.
 
Sometime between kicking off your weekend at Pfoho Pfridays, hanging with pfriends in the two-level d-hall, and getting pfancy for Croquet or Pformal, you’ll realize that Pforzheimer is more than a house: It’s a home.
 
Cabot’s inclusive and entrepreneurial spirit creates an atmosphere where you can share your thoughts, hopes, and dreams at weekly Cabot Sharing, and start your own business (see: Cabot Café), arts space, or classical music group. Cabotians write their own stories.
 
But any House, no matter the facilities or the location or anything else, is made incredibly special by the people in it. That sounds clichéd, but we promise that it’s true. You (yes, you!) have a chance to make your Harvard experience something special, and your House is here to help you do it. No matter how you feel when those upperclassmen barge into your room, you’ll probably be right beside them next year, covered in face paint or wearing a silly outfit, ready to tell next year’s freshmen that your House is by far the best one on campus.
We can’t wait to meet you!

 
To Siberia, mutant rats, and living eight-to-a-room,
 
Your House Committee Chairs
 
 
Mathilde A. Montpetit ‘15, a social studies concentrator, is co-chair of the Winthrop House Committee. This piece is a collaboration between the House Committee co-chairs of the 12 undergraduate Houses who sit on the House Committee Council. Each of the 12 Houses participated in the piece’s creation and formation.

 Last week, Edward Snowden released documents revealing that the NSA has mathematically demonstrated that Pfoho is the best house. I wish I had known earlier about the conspiracy to keep the Quad exclusive by spreading false rumors of discontent. Sometimes, I even wonder what life would be like if I didn’t live in this paradise of a gated community. 
In order to get some perspective, I turned to my friend, Joe, whom I met while working to improve his housing situation, and whose name has been changed to protect his privacy. I think we get along so well because we’re so similar. Joe, at 22 years old, is close to my age. While I earn $12 an hour while sitting in front of a computer in an air-conditioned environment, Joe makes about $10 an hour mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms, unloading delivery trucks, and keeping a smile on for the customers at an area movie theater.
 We’re both hungry at odd times. When the last of the peanut butter at brain break is scraped away around midnight, I’m forced to raid the dining hall’s off-brand cereal stash. When Joe finishes working the night shift, he has to choose between sneaking out a few stale snacks from underneath his manager’s watchful gaze, or skipping a meal the next day. 
 Living in the Quad, I occasionally sleep at a friend’s place on the river, especially when work on a problem set runs late. Joe crashes on couches too, but that’s because he’s homeless. He’s exhausted the goodwill of friends and co-workers, many of whom are in precarious circumstances themselves. So he pays acquaintances and strangers $30 to $50 a night, just to avoid the frigid New England weather and have a place to rest after a 10-hour workday.
 Joe grew up in a troubled home, and his grandmother took custody of him when he was 10. After she passed a few years later, Joe became a ward of the state, bouncing around in the foster-care system until he hit 18. Unsurprisingly, the instability prevented Joe from getting a high school diploma.
 Since the best job he can find is the night shift at the theater, he often can’t find a bed at area homeless shelters; most enforce a strict curfew for guests. 
 Joe has two jobs, and makes enough money to get a place of his own. However, he has no credit history. Worse, he lives paycheck to paycheck, which prevents him from saving enough cash to put down a security deposit. 
 Joe is homeless because there is nowhere for him to get a few hundred dollars to act as collateral on his lease. Previously, a government-funded program called HomeBase was available to people like him, helping clients move into permanent housing by providing information, counseling, and, if appropriate, one-time grants, to cover start-up costs like security deposits and moving fees.
 HomeBase was remarkably successful, until the state legislature limited access last year. Many of those who would be in permanent housing—self-financed and supported by small amounts of assistance from programs like HomeBase—are on the streets or in emergency shelter, options that cost much more than HomeBase’s long-term solutions ever did. Massachusetts pays motels $80 a night to house people in need of emergency shelter, and the average stay can stretch out to seven months. For anyone counting, that’s roughly how much Joe makes in a year.
 The legislature’s shortsightedness in curbing HomeBase and similar programs is costing taxpayers millions of dollars. According to a Boston Globe audit of state records, spending on emergency shelter in motels has risen from $1 million annually to more than $45 million, in just the past six years. Some of this new spending is a result of the weak economy, but much of it is due to poor policy. 
 On campus, staffers at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter are working to open a new facility, specifically targeting youths such as Joe. But stopgap efforts of this nature are no substitute for state funding for structural solutions for homeless individuals.
 From Boston to Utah, “Housing First” models have been proven to decrease chronic homelessness and slash long-term program costs. This model provides homeless families with permanent shelter first, giving them a safe place from which to tackle the other issues in their lives, such as unemployment, medical expenses, and more. 
 The Massachusetts legislature must not take the easy approach to this social ill by letting families languish in crowded shelters or on the streets. Empowering constituents is the best solution, and party leaders should fund HomeBase, housing-first programs, and similar approaches. But for now, Joe is still homeless, and there are thousands just like him in our city.
Happy Housing Day, Harvard. And don’t worry too much about what House you get. After all, it could always be worse.

Within minutes of the University’s announcement that former mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg would deliver Harvard’s commencement address for the class of 2014, expressions of disquiet emerged from the student body. The objections center on controversial security measures such as the “stop-and-frisk” policy and the surveillance of Muslim groups during Bloomberg’s time as mayor of New York City. Some contend that his defense of those policies makes the successful, philanthropic entrepreneur-turned-politician unfit to serve as Commencement Day speaker. As policy questions, these concerns are important, calling for careful discussions. As objections to a Commencement speaker, they are misplaced. We support the choice of Mayor Bloomberg as someone with valuable insight and experience to share with Harvard’s graduates.
 
There is no question that some of Bloomberg’s policies during his mayoral terms were and are controversial, even mistaken. Their burdens appear to fall too disproportionately on minorities to make the desired ends justifiable. However, those policies do not invalidate Michael Bloomberg and his credentials as a prospective speaker. Bloomberg has not only made large philanthropic donations over his lifetime, but also actively supported health initiatives, environmental programs, and public education. In a time of perpetual budget deficits, Bloomberg left New York City with a $2.4 billion surplus. University President Drew G. Faust rightly acknowledged those contributions in her praise of the speaker.
 
With controversy, too, comes experience. Michael Bloomberg is not a dull choice, and that reality is part of what makes him somebody worth listening to. Whether or not his policies were mistaken or even offensive to some of the student body, he can and will deliver a thought-provoking commencement address. It would be far more troubling if the University chose someone who would deliver a milquetoast speech, devoid of both substance and controversy. It would have been bizarre to exclude Oprah Winfrey as the Commencement speaker last year because some objected to her support for “pseudoscience.” Alan Greenspan’s selection was not about his monetary policy; opting for Clinton White House officials was not about NAFTA, welfare reform, or DOMA.  It would be wrong to disinvite Bloomberg on the basis of one part of his career.
 
In choosing a former politician, the University almost by default alienates a portion of the graduating class. Those who disagree with or face adverse effects from the politician’s positions may naturally object or feel excluded by the choice. This type of reaction is unavoidable and understandable, yet it cannot be used to justify the exclusion of speakers who have political affiliations, lest we miss an important range of experiences.
 
With a large portion of the graduating class interested in public health, philanthropy, and politics, Bloomberg has the potential to deliver a meaningful speech on issues that the audience cares about. The man is not solely defined by his controversial policies. Rather than focusing on a handful of programs, students ought to focus on the value of Michael Bloomberg as Commencement speaker—the capacity in which the University has chosen him. He is a contentious political figure, but he certainly can enlighten and challenge the Class of 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Wednesday at 3 p.m, Obiajulu C. Agha, Jr. ’14 would rush across the Charles River from his sophomore tutorial to the soccer field, 30 minutes late for practice. Other nights, after three hours of training, Agha would sprint back to campus, barely on time for his five-hour organic chemistry lab.
“It could get a little hectic at times,” Agha, a forward on the men’s soccer team and a human and evolutionary biology concentrator, laughed.


While packed schedules are nothing new for most Harvard students, athletes face a particularly difficult predicament. According to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Handbook, no courses beginning before 1 p.m. Monday through Thursday are permitted to run longer than an hour and a half in duration. As a result of this regulation, concentration requirements like tutorials and seminars, which are generally two to three hours long, are scheduled for the afternoon and evening, often conflicting with sports practices.
In order to fulfill their concentration requirements, many students must miss either an entire practice per week or portions of practice throughout the week.
Additionally, Agha noted, even if athletes do find seminars or tutorials that fit around their practice schedules, course options are often limited.
“For me, there were always classes that didn’t conflict too much [with practice],” Agha said. “But they weren’t usually the ones I was interested in, so your options are dwindled significantly because of practice time.”
According to Associate Director of Athletics Nathan T. Fry, coaches and students alike agree that academics should be students’ top priority at the College.
Still, athletics are no minor concern. According to Fry, 1,039 student-athletes performing on Harvard’s 42 varsity teams—the nation’s largest Division I athletic program—constitute around 16 percent of the College’s student body, with each team presenting different demands to its members.
Many of these student-athletes have expressed desire to transition to more accommodating class times. And with a new task force currently working to re-evaluate the College’s schedule—in light of the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s projected move to Allston—athletes’ concerns about their limited course options may influence policy change.
THE BALANCING ACT
While in recent years Harvard has gained national recognition for its athletic programs, like basketball and football, coaches have continued pledging to prioritize school over sports.
“Our coaches are prepped to have conversations with student-athletes where we will make whatever arrangements we need to to help set them up for success academically,” Fry said.
Because in-season athletic practices typically run anywhere from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., athletes often find that concentration requirements, like tutorials or seminars, cause conflicts. According to Fry, coaches must allow their students to miss practice for these classes, but at a cost to the entire team.
“Any day in which the whole team isn’t there and isn’t contributing to you being better is a day that you are losing something,” Agha said.
Given the difficult decision between registering for a certain required class and attending daily sports practice, many teams choose to train during the mornings in the off-season, so students may take required afternoon classes.
 
Pascal Mensah ’14 took the required Government 94 seminar in the spring semester of his junior year when his soccer team only had morning practices.
“I have wanted to take some seminars in the fall that I haven’t been able to take, because all of them are in the 1 [p.m.] to 7 [p.m.]  region,” Mensah said. “It’s kind of limited me in the classes I’ve wanted to take, but I have found alternatives.”
This type of sacrifice is not uncommon.
“I think a lot of people here really love what they do athletically and academically and it is hard to make a real sacrifice when you love both,” said John G. Slattery ’15, a varsity sailor and active Crimson editor, who missed one day of practice each week for a year in order to attend his social studies tutorial.
 
Not all student-athletes are willing to forgo practice to attend classes, and some take extra care to ensure courses do not interfere with training.
 
Kyle A. Criscuolo ’16, a forward on the hockey team, said that he, like many student-athletes, molds his class schedule around his team’s practices.
 
“I wouldn’t skip practice for class,” Criscuolo, a psychology concentrator, said. He added that although he wants to focus on social psychology, many courses offered in that track conflict with his practices.
 
A SHIFT IN TIME
 
Student-athletes must often choose between missing class and attending practice because of an archaic regulation, which mandates that courses longer than an hour and a half cannot be held before 1 p.m. on most weekdays.
 
According to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, the current schedule has not been updated in more than 70 years, when both the size of the undergraduate population and the number of course offerings were considerably smaller than they are today.
 
Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Government Department Cheryl B. Welch said that in  large departments like Government, which currently has 484 concentrators, student demand necessitates a greater number of course offerings and time slots.
 
Welch, whose department  began requiring students from the Class of 2015 onward to take at least one two-hour Government 94 seminar as a result of a comprehensive departmental review, approached Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris two years ago with a proposal to offer “non-compliant” seminars in the morning. The decision was, in part, to assuage athletes’ constrained time schedules.
“Scheduling all seminars in the popular 2-4 [p.m.] or 4-6 [p.m.] time slots may pose a hardship for some students,” Welch wrote in an email. “We hope to be able to continue to spread seminars out in a more expansive grid that includes some morning and evening choices.”
Consequently, Welch said, Harris allowed the department to “experiment” with seminar times, which led to the offering of two morning seminars last fall and three this semester.
According to Harris, he approved of the proposal due to the department’s large number of concentrators. To his knowledge,  no other department offers required seminars at “non-compliant times.”
While athletes concentrating in government have expressed gratitude for this bending of the rules, those in other concentrations wish more exceptions would be allowed for their departments.
Mensah said when he and some teammates were considering Social Studies, they realized the concentration’s mandatory tutorial times conflicted with their practice schedule in the fall. Ultimately, none of them chose to pursue social studies.
“You’ve sort of eliminated a whole sport in terms of a concentration,” Mensah said. “That’s definitely an area that could use some work.”
Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Economics Department Jeffrey A.  Miron said that the College’s current schedule is “sort of a mess.”
“I do have the impression that the current Harvard scheduling rules have made life kind of difficult,” he said, noting that like Government, the Economics Department tries to offer as many course options as possible to accommodate students.
“NO EASY SOLUTIONS”
As classes at the College shift toward the afternoon hours, a need to address scheduling conflicts has become paramount, athletic and academic administrators said.
David R. Fish ’72, a former student-athlete at the College who has coached the men’s varsity tennis team for 38 years, said he has noticed that the academic day seems to be shifting later into the early afternoon and evening, resulting in increased conflict with athletic practices.
“We’re watching students sleep later and later, and the demands on their body are greater than they’ve ever been,” Fish said.
Fry also noted that Harvard used to offer a wider range of classes at 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
“Now those classes have moved back to 11 a.m., 1 p.m.,” Fry said. “The day gets a little bit later and later. We’re practicing again in that 3-7 p.m. window, so you’re seeing a little bit more conflict arise with practice time and...class offerings.”
To prevent overlap between class and practice, Princeton has a unique policy that designates a certain time period for extracurricular activities.
According to Anthony J. Archbald, executive associate director of athletics at Princeton, classes cannot meet during a dedicated extracurricular activities block from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Fry said implementing a similar activities window lacks support at Harvard because three hours is an insufficient period of time for multiple athletic teams to share venues.
“There are no easy solutions to carving out enough time for students to pursue the full breadth of academic and extracurricular opportunities on any campus,” Fry wrote in an email.
Yet, a change in Harvard’s current academic and athletic structure may be on the horizon.
Last year, Harris and Deputy Provost Margaret E. Newell were asked to co-chair a committee to look at reconsidering the FAS class schedule following the University’s decision to move SEAS to Allston. According to Burke, the committee has begun to meet with different organizations on campus to get feedback about changing the current schedule.
“In the process of developing options for a new schedule, the task force has consulted with faculty, students, the Athletics Department, and others to accommodate the myriad activities competing for student and faculty time,” Burke wrote in an email. “It is impossible to meet every need, but we have been, and will continue, consulting widely.”

Happy Wednesday! Not only is half of the week over, but Housing Day festivities and spring break are right around the corner! As you power through the last of your midterms, here are some guilty pleasure songs to add to your study playlist:
"Let It Go" - Idina Menzel: If you’re feeling hopeless about your upcoming midterm, there’s no one stopping you from reinterpreting an animated Disney movie’s soundtrack as a personal message to you that you can indeed “let it go.” Don’t stress out too much, just walk into your test unfazed. I mean, you’ve totally been keeping up with your readings and going to lecture all semester, right?
"Timber" - Pitbull ft. Ke$ha: Seeing as Ke$ha and Pitbull are constantly reminding you that “it’s going down,” you’re excited to start partying as soon as you walk out of your midterm. Whether that means having a day rager with your friends or taking a nap that lasts until dinner, you know that it’s a perfect start to spring break.
"#SELFIE" - The Chainsmokers: This is a song for those of us who don’t stop barraging our friends with Snapchat selfies while at Lamont with sarcastic captions like “#party” or “#raging.” You know who you are.
"Turn Down For What" - DJ Snake & Lil Jon: You’re excited to party pre-Housing Day and Thirsty Thursday, but incase the name of the song is an earnest question, you should probably turn down for that midterm you actually have scheduled on Housing Day or that Friday morning flight back home you have to catch.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREFor those of you crossing your fingers that yesterday’s weather will stay, looks like you’re in bad luck. While the temperature is still pretty warm with a high of 48 degrees, it’ll be rainy all day today and it’ll snow at night (perfect for River Run!).

River Run. It’s a tradition as old as Harvard itself (give or take 360 years) where freshmen take shots at every upperclassmen house the Housing Day eve. Other than ritual slaughter, it is the only way to appease the Housing Gods and guarantee good housing and a plentiful harvest in the Lowell Community Garden.
However, much like ritual slaughter, this tradition is under threat. The administration has cracked down on our right to underage drink with an increased police presence. But we shouldn’t let the police get into the way of our cardio.
Run During the Day.It’s safer; you can see where you are running so you will be less likely to trip in the dark. I recommend the MIT 5 mile river loop.
Brain Break RunBinge eat in every House’s break the night before housing. Not only are stale muffins better for your liver, but also The Freshmen 15 is an even older tradition than River Run.
Weld 22 RunYou can’t run around outside all night drinking wildly? Joke's on the administration, because you can take 12 shots and puke in your roommates laundry hamper without even leaving your room.
Disguised RunDress up as a cop so that no one will know that you are a student. Then, when you get arrested for impersonating a police officer, take shots in jail! Middlesex County Cambridge Jail beats the quad, plus if you manage to get solidary confinement you are guaranteed a single.

Welcome back to “Listen Up!” Flyby’s advice column written by two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting sophomores from various places in and around 14 Plympton Street.
 
When Abigail K. Fiedler ’15 and Lynn Miao ’16, our wonderful Flyby Blog Editors, approached us about writing a special Housing Day-themed column, we were absolutely excited about the opportunity. After all, writing about Housing Day (or at least inserting the phrase “Housing Day” as many times as you can in an article) seems to be the perfect way to really boost your readership.
So in honor of Housing Day, we humbly present the Housing Day edition of Listen Up! in which we address all of your housing-related questions and concerns. As always, don’t forget to submit your questions here. We’re waiting (in Adams House, inarguably the best house on campus).
 *Note: Just as with last week’s post, each of these questions is very real, as troubling as that may be.
Should I hook up with my roommate? My mom says no, but I'm not so sure.First of all, we envy your ability to be that open with your mother. If either of us asked our respective moms about advice on hooking up with people, our credit cards would be revoked and we would be forced on the first flight back home.
In our opinion, a better way to phrase your question is: “should I ruin my college life forever by giving into my carnal urges?”
Based on extensive evidence from our real life experience—by which we mean the “real life experience” of binge viewing episodes of Friends and How I Met Your Mother—this proposition will just work out badly for all involved. Do you really want to be distracted by an awkward rooming situation going into finals week?
Oh sure, you say there’s a certain level of convenience that comes with this territory, but seriously? You’re so lazy that you can’t venture outside your own room to satisfy your “needs”? Please, we can’t even believe you had the willpower to click on the link and type out a coherent question.
Don’t be lazy. Listen to your mother. She’s always right.
Hey, don't qriticize Quincy House ever again. I know your Adams arrogance knows no bounds, but a little restraint would be appropriate... - A Qoncerned QidOh, how Qute, you replaced all the hard “c” sounds with the letter Q.
No. Just no. We’re sorry, Pfhorseimer(sp???) House is the only House allowed to House-ify words. Pforce Pfield. Skypfall. Pfalapfel. Let’s try that with Quincy. Qomputer. Qrepes. Qitty Qat. Nope, not the same. It’s unfortunate that penguins are attempting to copy the methods of their North Pole counterparts, the polar bears. It’s just bad form.
Your question gets us a little riled up, so we’re going to end by answering another question: do we want to live in Quincy?
Nope. Not after you soured our opinion of that House. Thanks a lot.
Plus, it’s a really long walk.
Hi guys, I have a girlfriend who's a freshman. If she gets Quadded on housing day I'm going to break up with her. Can I get some good excuses to tell her? I don't want to come off as shallow.Just a bit of a clarification before we start. If this question is serious, then break up with her now, because you’re a jerk and she deserves way better. You can start to redeem yourself by setting her up with Steven, who would never do anything like this (plus he has a rockin’ bod.)
Now if you insist on invoking your inner Voldemort, no matter what you say, you’ll come off as shallow. We absolutely do not endorse you breaking up with your girlfriend because of a simple change in location.
(Freshman girls with significant others, stay on alert. If you get Quadded and your significant other starts exercising the “summer option,” slap them once for being a jerk and slap them one more time for us. Then call Steven.)
How can I spice up my love life with the girlfriend? A dorm room can be pretty unromantic!If your dorm room is not heating things up in the right way, we suggest taking some cues from our own roommates who have decked out our penthouse in Adams with what can only be described as a “country wedding” theme. The key to our magnificent home decor: glassware. And you know our room is nice because it’s featured in a premiere, up-and-coming, web series.
But if you don’t have time to spruce up your room, here’s our suggestion to spice up your love life.
Start the night with a nice dinner in Spice. The premier Boston-area Thai restaurant, is an absolutely delightful destination for anyone wanting to take their relationship to the next level. Spice always delivers. In fact, they deliver and cater throughout the Cambridge area.
Then go to the special space on Harvard campus where apparently everyone gets it on: the Widener stacks. We haven’t actually been there because we spend all our time answering advice questions, but what could be sexier than making love where others make tears crying over their unfinished papers.
Threesome?“Threesome?” is not a fully-formed question. Thus, we will interpret this question liberally and assume you’re asking if platonically joining together with three people as a blocking group is a good idea.
It’s an extremely good question to ask, the idea of forming a blocking group with another person can only be raised once you have reached a stage in your relationship such that you truly feel comfortable with each other in the most intimate setting. Blocking groups with two people are the simplest. It’s clear where everyone goes and what everyone does, and nobody feels left out. Now you do get those freshmen who are willing to experiment with eight. We won’t go into the logistics of how that even works but we suppose you can work out those “kinks” later.
That’s not to say that we discourage eightsomes; Listen Up! is welcoming of all blocking lifestyles and preferences.
Just be careful that everyone will be okay with this three-person arrangement for the next three years. If the junior year housing lottery rolls around and your two blockmates want to go room off on their own, you’ll be left...shall we say, unsatisfied?
I have been lost in the bowels of Widener stacks for three days. Please send help.While every house has its merits, at Listen Up! we generally advocate against living in Widener. It’s even worse than the Yard (though there is the benefit of more sex.)*
In all seriousness, freshmen, don’t worry about which House will knock on your door on Thursday. You’ll love it wherever you get placed. Will you be “Happy” in Cabot? Yes. Will you want to live in Quincy? Absolutely. Can living in the House of Eliot be as awesome as an episode of Netflix’s “House of Cards”? Probably not, but it’ll come very close. And while we’re still not quite sure what the moose says, you’ll have the time of your life living in Dunster (or, alternatively, spread across various locations in Harvard Square). So be safe tomorrow, rest up, and get ready to experience one of the most exciting mornings in your Harvard career on Thursday. And if you are lucky enough to get Adams, we look forward to congratulating you in person.
Hoping this will be the post that beats Fifteen Hottest Freshmen in readership,Steven and DevAdams House 4 Life
 *Note: When we took over this blog from its previous authors, we were frequently asked one question: will you write about sex in the stacks just like Julia and Sarah? Our answer has always been that we cannot be expected to match their level of discussion about this particular Harvard phenomenon. Certainly we expected some mentions of sex in the Widener stacks, but only some. Hopefully this post fulfills that requirement.

This week, the student-produced television show “Ivy” released its first episode. A ruminative and extremely hip examination of the tangled and existentially tumultuous lives of five Harvard sophomores, the series is heavy on noteworthy tropes and funny little morsels. We've assigned points to both the revelatory and ridiculous moments in this week’s message from the existentially grappling youths of “Ivy.”
+4 for prolonged blank stares
+2 for Audi insignias on t-shirts
+1 for mid-fellatio Tempest orations
+2 for real cashier at University Market
+3 for Blodgett Pool scene straight out of “The Paper Chase”
+1 for cool looking, flare-lit smoking
+200 “heteronormative free market economy”
+5 shoutout to The Crimson
+18 for Mad Men devolution into surreal brown-out
Total: 235 Positive Elements
0 for early morning self-aggrandizing PBR sip (bad habit, you've got to start the morning with something classier)
0 for playing with flares-4 for a TF being that distressed by a student’s lack of preparation
-3 for excessive self-conscious arm movements towards mouth
-2 for beckoning women exclusively through snaps
-100 for “End of Episode Friendship Revelation” edging the discourse ever-closer to Girls
-2 for “not knowing what’s going on, man”
-5 for several too many minutes of frosting-licking
-3 for slightly delayed “Wait!”
-3 for a burned cake being a metaphor for anything, if that line is meant seriously
Total: 122 Negative Elements
 A net positive of +113! The episode sometimes sinks into self-indulgence and familiar millenial angst, but captures the Harvardian aesthetic, vocabulary, and inherent existentialism with much verve. A promising start to a potentially campus-consuming new media force!

Housing Day is nigh upon us. We bet that all you freshmen are thrilled that you, your blockmates, and your linkmates are going to find out where you’ll be spending the next three years. But not so fast, killer.
The next day or so promise to be fun and exciting, but they're also a dangerous time. You don’t want to sully your relationship with the people you'll be living with (or those you'll be living a close but comfortable ditance from) because of some stupid Housing Day Eve or Housing Day misstep. Here a few recommendations (some serious, some not so serious) to ensure your social standing makes it through tomorrow unscathed.
 
1. When you find which House you'll be calling home for the next three years, do NOT text your linkmates which House you'll be living in. Sure, a vague “we know what house we’re in. u?” is totally fine, but don’t ruin the surprise. If you tell them you got placed in Pfoho, they know they are in either Cabot or Currier. Do you really want to drop that shocker?
 
2. Once blockmates and linkmates (and anyone else you want to remain friends with, for that matter) finds out their living situation, don’t disparage their House. Don’t get us wrong, you should obstinately maintain that your house (that you have yet to have a meal in, live in, study in, or socialize in) is the best, but don’t try to make them feel like they got the short end of the housing stick (your enthusiasm should do that).
 
3. If you’re sacrificing someone to Poseidon (chief among the famed Housing Gods—trust me, I’ve taken half of Culture and Belief 35: Classical Mythology) to avoid getting Quadded, avoid offering up blockmates and linkmates. Also, try to complete all sacrifices during the witching hour; it’s more effective that way.
 
4. Don’t pressure your block/linkmates. However you want to spend Housing Day Eve and Housing Day is fine, but don’t demand that anyone partake in any sort of activity that they don’t want to. It doesn’t bode well for you being a good roommate in future years.
 
5. Obviously (and I cannot stress this enough: obbbbbbbbbviously) get a sleeveless shirt/bro tank for your House if at all possible. For everyone in your group. It’s science: sleeves are objectively less classy than a lack of sleeves.
 That’s all. Have fun. Be safe. Hopefully Poseidon puts you in the House of your dreams.
One hundred and eleven institutions of higher learning, including Harvard, have made changes to their financial aid instructions after the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform alleged they were potentially misleading financial aid applicants.
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan '86 in early February, Maryland Congressman Elijah E. Cumming expressed concern that many universities were not making it clear to applicants that the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is used only for purposes of institutional aid, while the FAFSA is used only for determining federal aid.
The Committee’s investigation indicated that Harvard’s financial aid instructions informed applicants to fill out the FAFSA and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE “without any explanation of use or purpose.”
Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid made changes to its online instructions approximately a week after being identified in the report to clarify the purpose of each form.
In another letter to Duncan on Monday, Cummings wrote that he was pleased that all universities cited in the initial letter clarified their aid instructions.
“The changes made by these institutions demonstrate a commitment to ensuring that students receive appropriate instructions when applying for financial aid,” Cummings wrote.
