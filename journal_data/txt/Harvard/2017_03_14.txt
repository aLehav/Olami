After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A member of the committee reevaluating the College's policy penalizing members of single-gender socials groups filed a motion in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Friday strongly criticizing a key element of the policy's proposed enforcement.
Biology professor David A. Haig, who is a member of the faculty committee deciding whether the policy should be "revised or replaced," filed the motion, which opposes a proposed requirement that students sign a document affirming they do not belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization before applying for leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, or fellowships.
The suggestion Haig objects to is one of many recommendations included in a 46-page report released March 6 by a committee tasked with advising how to enforce the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted nearly all the recommendations formulated by the implementation committee—the group that wrote the report—last week.
Haig announced his motion Sunday in a guest post on the personal blog of former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, himself an intensely vocal critic of the the policy.
“This faculty does not approve of Harvard College requiring a student to make an oath, pledge or affirmation about whether the student belongs to a particular organization or category of organizations,” the motion reads.
Under the implementation committee’s recommendations, students—starting with the class of 2021—who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships will have to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to “nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of ‘intrinsic identity,’ including gender.” The document requires that students affirm they do not currently belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization, did not belong to one in the past year, and will not belong to one the year after their tenure in a leadership position or athletic captaincy ends.
Last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith selected Haig to serve on the faculty review committee and announced that Khurana will co-chair it.
Haig’s motion marks the second time a faculty member has chosen to file Faculty legislation in opposition to the sanctions. Shortly after Khurana announced the policy in May 2016, Lewis  filed a motion stating that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” Unlike Lewis’s motion, which he believed would necessarily overturn the sanctions if passed, Haig’s motion is explicitly worded to avoid a binding result.
“I did not want the motion to be complicated by the disputed question of whether the faculty or the administration has ultimate jurisdiction in this matter,” Haig wrote in his blog post, adding that his motion aims to provide a “sense of the faculty” on the issue.
Haig wrote in an email Monday, however, that he hopes his motion causes “the College to decide that the policy is unwise.”
Haig and psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, a signatory of Lewis’s original motion opposing the single-gender social policy, are the only two current members of the faculty committee who have publicly opposed the College’s social group policy. In an interview with The Crimson last week, Smith said the size of the faculty committee could grow.
Haig wrote in an email that the motion could provide the committee with input from the entire Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“The committee is not a representative body of the faculty and would benefit from knowing the [Faculty’s] opinions on this matter,” Haig wrote.
Khurana wrote in an emailed statement Monday that he looks forward to “working with Professor Haig as he is a member of the review committee.”
Lewis, who withdrew his own motion opposing the single-gender social policy after Khurana announced the creation of the faculty committee, wrote in an email that he supports Haig’s motion. Lewis declined to comment further, though he did criticize the implementation committee’s final report on the social group policy in a post on his blog last week.
Haig wrote in an email that his motion will be discussed at the next meeting of the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—on March 22.
“I note that the policy of the Implementation Committee has been accepted,” Haig wrote. “Therefore I thought it was time that the faculty had their say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2017 at 5:45 p.m.
Facing a forecasted 12 to 18 inches of snow, Harvard has closed both the University and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for the duration of the day Tuesday.
The closure comes during the College’s spring break, when no College classes meet and many undergraduates are away from campus.
In an email sent to College students Monday afternoon, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced the shutdown and urged those still in Cambridge to prepare for the “substantial” storm.
“We recommend purchasing and storing water and food that you can consume in your rooms, and want to remind you that each House is equipped with a kitchen for your use,” O’Dair wrote.
She added that while some restaurants and markets in Harvard Square may remain open, their hours are “hard to predict.” All of Harvard’s dining halls will remain shuttered during spring break this year, though certain students on high financial aid staying on campus over break received Crimson Cash stipends from the College.
“All students who received the College’s Spring Break Grants can use them at CVS, H-Mart, and Broadway Marketplace—all of which have groceries,” O’Dair wrote.
Harvard has cancelled classes due to snow just four times since 1978. Three days of class were cancelled after historic snowfall hit the Boston area in 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Ivy League team play wrapped up for the academic year, the Crimson men and women’s fencing squads made their way to New Haven, Conn. to face some of the best competitors from the Northeast at the regional qualifier for the NCAA championships.
The men’s side sported a top-three finisher in each of the weapons, and women’s co-captain Adrienne Jarocki began her quest for her third saber individual championship crown with a second-place finish.
MEN’S FENCING
Despite coasting his way to the top seed out of the first set of pool play bouts, sophomore saber fencer Eli Dershwitz was not content with his initial performance.
“I started a little bit slow with two close bouts, so I just tried to stay focused throughout the day and make sure I was putting on my best performance [and] cheering on my teammates,” Dershwitz said.
By the end of the evening, Dershwitz had left little doubt as to why he had qualified for the United States Olympic team last year and is among the best saber fencers in the country. The sophomore thoroughly picked apart most of his opponents. His lone defeat came against second-place finisher and Columbia fencer Michael Costin in a 5-4 tally
Dershwitz finished with a 10-1 mark in the final pool, a plus-21 touch indicator, and the top spot.
Looking ahead, Dershwitz will aim both to repeat his appearance in the NCAA championship’s final four and improve upon his tied-for-third result his freshman campaign.
“I think I have to stay focused this time. My final bout my freshman year, I lost my focus a little bit and let my emotions get the better of me,” Dershwitz said. “I’ll try to stay strong throughout the entire [championship] tournament and see how it goes.”
Freshman foil fencers also burst onto the national stage for Harvard at the Northeast qualifier, with Matthew Branman and George Haglund nabbing second and third place, respectively, and Duncan Rheigans-Yoo taking fifth among 33 fencers. Branman rode a plus-18 indicator and eight bout wins to earn the stellar result, while Haglund was close behind with a 7-3 bout record in the final set of pool play bouts.
Co-captain Stephen Mageras finished eighth with a 4-6 record in the final pool play bouts to round out the Crimson foil fencers.
In epee, sophomore Albert Chien finished third out of 37 fencers and easily qualified for the NCAA championships. The vast improvement came just a year removed from a 10-13 record and an 11th-place result his freshman campaign at the same qualifying event.
WOMEN’S FENCING
As a team, the women’s side qualified 11 fencers for the NCAA championships, which topped last season’s mark. With the final NCAA championship team result reliant on the entire body of results for each squad, the double-digit competitors fencing for the Crimson in two weeks will be advantageous.
“Qualifying 11 puts us in a really good spot for NCAAs,” co-captain and foil fencer Liana Yamin said. “We showed a lot of endurance today—by the end of the day, when you’ve fenced 20 bouts, it’s tough to keep moving as fast as you’ve started, but we showed a lot of tenacity.”
Unsurprisingly, co-captain Adrienne Jarocki was at the front of the pack of Harvard fencers, finishing with a second-place mark thanks to a 9-2 final pool play record. St. Johns fencer Karolina Cieslar snagged the top spot after defeating Jarocki, 5-2, in a direct elimination bout after both fencers finished with nine wins in the final pool.
Sophomore Gabby Tartakovsky improved upon a 10th-place finish at last year’s regionals by fencing her way to the seventh spot, while freshman Marta Lasota finished 10th.
On the foil side, senior Hali Nelson turned in her best NCAA regional performance yet, winning eight bouts in the final pool play round to earn fourth place in the event. Junior Mackenzie Lawrence was not far behind with a sixth-place finish.
The two Crimson epee fencers—sophomores Sharon Ra and Shawn Wallace—finished ninth and 15th, respectively.
With the NCAA championships in South Bend, Ind., home of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the ninth-ranked Crimson team has its work cut out if it hopes to dethrone any of the nation’s best for the national team title.
“It’s helpful to remember that each bout counts for the team,” Yamin said. “It’s so many bouts against the best fencers in the country, one right after the other. No matter what happens in each one, you have to drop it and prepare for the next one.”
