After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “Africa in Motion” symposium, which took place last Thursday and Friday in the basement of the Northwest Labs, was at once a celebration of Harvard’s recent top-notch scholarship and a sobering reminder of the work that needs to be done to solve the continent’s problems. Seeing that these range from huge social inequality to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it’s logical that the symposium was interdisciplinary in nature. However many might be surprised to hear that the event emphasized the role of the arts in addressing and solving these problems.
“The arts are integral to thinking about social and political issues,” says Professor Caroline M. Elkins, a History professor and interim chair of the Committee for African Studies. “They illuminate a whole world that the social sciences don’t address.” The importance of art colored the whole symposium. For example, Professor Ingrid Monson, an ethnomusicologist, was on the panel that discussed health issues on the African continent.
According to Elkins, the arts are vitally important to spreading information and combating preconceived notions both in Africa and globally.  They are especially important when disseminating information that affects people’s everyday lives. “The arts are integral in combating the stigma of using anti-virals and other medications,” Elkins says.
The symposium also focused on African and African-related art outside of the continent. The reception featured performances by the Kuumba Singers as well as a drum and dance piece by PADAME, the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble led by Malinese drum virtuoso Joh Camara.
Notably, the “Africa in Motion” symposium included a student art competition, with a $500 prize for first place, open to undergraduate and graduate students. “Primarily we were looking for artistry. We would ask our selves ‘How does this fit into our theme of Africa in motion?’” says Professor Deborah Foster, Senior Lecturer on Folklore and Mythology and one of the judging panel. “We were trying to find a piece that captured what was going on both in Africa and in the Diaspora.”
The competition attracted submissions from all over the campus, and the three finalists drew artistic inspiration from a whole range of topics. Grete Viddal, a PhD student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, submitted photos of Afro-Caribbean dance traditions taken during her fieldwork in Eastern Cuba. Doctorate student in Visual Anthropology Phillip A. Cartelli entered a short film about the mining town of Kédougou in Senegal.
Oludamini D. Ogunnaike ’07, a PhD student in African Studies and Religion and a resident tutor in Lowell House, was another of the finalists. His song entitled “Africa in Motion” is a piece for guitar, bass, conga drums, and cowbell. A white board was mounted on the wall next to the station where the song was presented to allow listeners to write down how the song made them think, move, and feel.
“I spent a year in Mali after I graduated in ’07. I was inspired by the music I was listening to at the time,” Ogunnaike says about his piece. Although purely instrumental, the way that the various musical lines meld together is a deliberate invocation of both African musical traditions as well as Africa’s collective history. “I wanted it to be rhythmic, but also repetitive because African history is cyclical,” he says. Ogunnaike is also convinced of the importance of the arts as a means for social changes. For him, the arts is one of the most effective ways of communicating ideas about social issues to a wide audience. “If you want to get a health message across, you put it in a song,” he says.
For scholars of Africa, this idea sums up the importance of art in their studies. Artists react to the world around them, and comment on the things that are important in their lives. This leads to a whole body of art that deals with a diverse range of social and political issues. As Ogunnaike succinctly puts it, “If you want to learn about Africa, listen to African music.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The case of Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser’s alleged fabrication of research has only gotten more convoluted. Previously, a Harvard investigation led by the Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith found Hauser responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct, and Hauser is currently on book leave for the year—a decision that was made after the allegations surfaced. Just as all the noise about the situation calmed down, Gerry Altmann, the editor of the psychology journal where Professor Hauser published the work that is being debated and Hauser’s principal accuser, suggested that there was a possible alternative explanation for the data that Hauser published, but that he still concluded that the data was more likely fabricated, given the evidence he had been presented. Still, Altmann asked that people “allow the process to conclude.”
Even with Altmann’s assertions, we still strongly believe that the situation has not shifted dramatically. Although many people have been sympathetic to Professor Hauser, including two former colleagues who vigorously defended Hauser as “the consummate scientist—the most disinterested, most rational, the most ethical,” neither the Harvard community nor the larger public should immediately jump to conclusions about Hauser’s innocence. Hauser has already been found guilty as part of a three-year long Harvard internal investigation which resulted in the current controversy and forced him to make corrections to a 2007 study he published in a scientific journal. Given these extensive findings, the innocent until proven guilty maxim can no longer be fully applied in this situation: Indeed, Hauser has been proven guilty of some charges by Harvard even if the federal investigation does not come to the same conclusion.
Professor Hauser is set to return to campus next year after his leave is over. However, we believe that the University should implement some sort of consequence when he returns—a penalty that is on par with the severity of his actions. Although it would be helpful if Harvard would release more information on the eight counts of misconduct that it uncovered, it is likely prohibited from doing so by the regulations surrounding ongoing legal proceedings. If such information can be released, however, we hope that Harvard will share it with the public. Likewise, we would like to hear from Hauser a solid explanation of the events that transpired in his lab—as much of a defense as he can offer without going against any rules that prevent him from disclosing certain information while under federal investigation.
The situation with Hauser is regrettable for all parties involved. Yet, until the federal investigations conclude, we must stick to the facts that are currently clear. Ultimately, new comments by Dr. Altmann do not shift the core facts of the situation: Hauser continues to be under federal investigation for a good reason, and he is guilty in the eight cases Harvard discovered. The University would do well to proceed as such for the near future.
CORRECTION: November 2, 2010 
 
An earlier version of the Oct. 28 editorial "Hauser in the News—Again" stated that Gerry Altmann had retracted his accusations about Hauser's data. In fact, Altmann had suggested that there was a possible alternative explanation for the data that Hauser published, but that he still concluded that the data was more likely fabricated, given the evidence he had been presented. The Crimson regrets the error.

“Voting is your civic duty.” Most students have heard some version of this pithy cliché before, but few stop to consider the tremendous history behind it. It seems that with each passing election cycle, voters, especially the youth, increasingly see voting as an annoyance or banal triviality that can be shrugged off. The trend is shockingly disturbing on a number of levels, but most importantly: A democracy simply cannot function properly without active citizenship.
The fact is the story of American society and the history of voting rights in this country are inseparable. School children are taught about the Boston Tea Party and the Stamp Act Revolt, rebellions against British taxation without American colonial representation in Parliament. And when a motley band of patriots first opened fire on the British Empire in 1776, they were shots fired in the name of the right to vote.
Still, for much of this country’s early history, one had to be white, male, and land-owning to have any claim on the ballot box. It would take more than a century, with mass marches, hunger strikes, and protests for American women to receive similar rights. And while the Civil War, and the over 600,000 Americans killed, resulted in Constitutional guarantees of voting rights to non-whites too, they did not become a reality until the late 1960s. Much of the early Civil Rights movement was devoted to registering African Americans to vote. The infamous “Bloody Sunday” march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge was in the name of the right to vote—Congressman John Lewis of Georgia still bears the marks of being brutally beaten by Alabama state troopers that day.
Imagine: Less than 50 years ago, for an African American to attempt to vote in the American South was an offense punishable by vigilante murder, and today Americans of all races may choose to let Election Day slip by unnoticed and unattended to.
A turn to recent statistics portrays an even more dramatic and upsetting apathy toward voting. In the 2008 presidential election, by all accounts a once-in-a-lifetime election in terms of energy and voter excitement, less than half of Americans 18 to 24 years old chose to cast a ballot. The apathy is frankly an embarrassment, as people from Zimbabwe to Venezuela to Russia dream of the right to cast their votes free and without intimidation.
If anything, the tired excuse of “my vote doesn’t count” has becoming more and more irrelevant in the face of a string of incredibly close, high-profile elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won the state of Florida and the presidency with 537 votes. The 2004 Washington gubernatorial race was decided by 133 votes. And the 2008 Minnesota Senate race was won a margin by 312 votes.
Of the majority of young American citizens who did not vote in 2008, the top two excuses they gave were that they were “too busy,” or they were “not interested.” Thank goodness that American men and women, from Susan B. Anthony to Martin Luther King Jr., were not too busy or disinterested to march, bleed, and, in some cases die, for the right to vote for every American citizen. When we choose not to vote, we do a grave dishonor to their legacy.
The message is simple. Honor our history, support our democracy, and make your voice heard. So please, go out and vote, in person or absentee. It is, after all, your civic duty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been nearly a year since the earthquake that left Haiti—already the poorest country in the Western hemisphere—in shambles.  With 1.3 million people displaced by the earthquake living in squalid conditions outside Port-au-Prince, 284 confirmed deaths in a recent cholera outbreak, and 19 candidates in the upcoming presidential elections, it seems as if international help and continued support would be welcome now more than ever.  However, although there are nearly 14,000 NGOs and relief agencies operating in Haiti currently, their fragmented and isolated approach to work in Haiti has also indirectly caused long-term harm. Now that the “rescue” part of the “rescue, recovery, and reconstruction” plan is complete, it is time for the people, the government, and the foreign influence in Haiti to develop comprehensive and communicative plans that will allow Haitians a larger role in their country’s recovery.
After gaining independence from France in a slave revolt in 1804, Haiti had a hard time gaining recognition in the international arena, and soon fell into debt as it had to pay reparations to France’s slaveholders, setting a precursor to its poor and troubled economy. The response of NGOs and other nations after the Haitian earthquake was certainly necessary—and still is. But even before the earthquake, Haiti had gained a reputation as “A Republic of NGOs,” which has consequently somewhat delegitimized and crippled its economy.  The lack of coordination between NGOs and the government will only continue to amount to  “short-term solutions” to long-term problems.
In Dambisa Moyo’s book “Dead Aid,” she argues that aid has been hurting Africa because it leads to corruption in government, foreign interests that aren’t in the country’s best interests, but mostly “band-aids” that only barely scrape the surface of solving immediate problems rather than building an educated workforce that can govern and provide for themselves.  These effects have been seen in Haiti as well with the import of foreign food to feed Haitians, instead of, as President Rene Preval complains, providing money to restart Haiti’s agricultural-based economy.  Many Haitians have been migrating to Port-au-Prince for work, and many homeless after the earthquake have been living in camp dwellings on the periphery of the city. If NGOs and foreign aid focused on developing Haiti’s agricultural industry, they would encourage Haitians to disperse from the city and give them the tools to feed themselves and generate their own income. USAID has recently jumped on board to this idea and is pledging $126 million over the next five years to support Haitians living in rural areas, and is providing two grants for Haitians to buy local.
Though some well-meaning NGOs and aid may provide temporary relief, there are a few organizations that should set an example for the framework between immediate care and lasting development and integration into the country. Partners in Health, co-founded by Harvard’s own Paul Farmer, has been providing healthcare and training Haitians to deliver healthcare since 1987.  After the earthquake, PIH treated over 10,000 patients a week in the capital city. And although it continues to provide healthcare in eight cities, it is also in the midst of constructing a $15 million teaching hospital in Haiti that will work to equip even more Haitians with the resources and knowledge they need to stand on their own.
Former Prime Minister of Haiti Michele Pierre-Louis, is currently a fellow at the Institute of Politics and leads a study group every week on how to govern a “fragile state.” She embodies the missing link needed in effective reconstruction work in Haiti because in addition to her efforts to better Haiti during her time as Prime Minister, she also heads up a Haitian-run NGO, FOKAL, that works on providing educational support and libraries to the country’s youth in addition to using innovative approaches to provide clean water to Haitians (only 21 percent of the population has access to running water). “We are very grateful to all the countries and organizations which responded spontaneously to the disaster. But now is the time to plan the reconstruction,” Pierre-Louis said in response to foreign presence in Haiti. “And this is the difficult part. We need to provide decent housing to a million and a half people who are homeless today. We need to create jobs. But most and foremost, we need to plan, urban and city planning, construction codes, land tenure. And of course education, at all levels particularly higher education. These are the issues today so that we can ‘build back better.’”
Increased dialogue between different NGOs and the government will hopefully lead to collaboration on programs and policies that will foster economic opportunity for Haitians (someone is going to have to re-build, so it would be more effective to pay Haitians for doing these tasks, rather than bringing in outside forces) and education for the next generation. We should support organizations like PIH and FOKAL that help Haitians help themselves long after the recovery from the earthquake is complete.

Back in August, Zipcar made the decision to give 18-year-olds in Cambridge the privilege of using their cars. They justified this decision by saying that even “at 18, young adults have adult commuting needs.” While this is only a pilot program for the car rental company, this should become a permanent fixture across the country. Eighteen-year-olds, as adult members of society, should be able to rent cars.
My friend and his girlfriend, both 20, went on a vacation to Cape Cod this summer. They were not allowed to rent a car, so when they landed in Boston, they were forced to rely on buses to get them where they needed to go. Their plane arrived late, too late for their bus transfer, and they only reached their destination by accepting a ride from a kind stranger. Later on the trip, they traveled from one end of the cape to the other via public transportation. The ride, an hour by car on the highway, took five hours instead due to bus switches and traffic jams on local roads. While they made the most of their vacation, renting a car would have helped them avoid these stressful situations.
Rental car companies practice some of the most extreme forms of age discrimination in the country. Aside from most companies refusing service to 18-year-olds, some companies even slap 25-five-year-olds with a surcharge. At 25, many Americans have serious needs for a rental car: jobs, families, etc. Most Americans start driving when they are 16. What more is a young driver expected to learn that will make him a safer driver, when he or she has already been driving for nearly a decade?
Young people with clean driving records have to pay more because they have been labeled as part of a “risky” age group. It is unfair to fault all young people for the faults of some inexperienced drivers. While there is an alarming number of teenage car accidents, by 18, drivers are far more competent on the roads than they were two years ago. An 18-year-old is half as likely to get in a car crash as a 16-year-old.
At 18, young people drive on the same roads and are subject to the same driving laws as older adults. In Massachusetts, as in most states, young adults face no driving restrictions when they turn 18. The Commonwealth has made the rational decision that 18-year-olds ought to be granted the same rights to the road as other citizens. Current policies of car rental giants like Budget, Enterprise, and Hertz stand in opposition.
Young people are given a bad rap about their driving ability. There is plenty of truth in the statement that there is an alarming number of accidents involving young people, but it is unfair to characterize all of us that way. In many ways, young people may be more aware of the rules of the road than older drivers. Most states require that young drivers complete a driver’s education program in order to get a license. Youth who are fresh out of driving school may lack the experience of older drivers, but learning how to drive with a professional driving instructor allows young people to be safe and confident drivers from day one. By the time we become young adults, we not only have driver’s education under our belts but also significant time behind the wheel.
Rental car companies need to catch up with the times. They are missing out on an entire market of young adults who want their services. Instead of refusing service to all youth, they should treat them as adults and allow good drivers to rent the cars that they need and deserve. This Zipcar experiment will prove that “young” is not synonymous with “irresponsible.” Other companies would do well to judge young adults based on their record rather than their reputation.

Incorporating foods with omega-3 fatty acids into your diet may help prevent gum disease, according to a recent study conducted by Harvard researchers.
Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers from Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health were able to link the intake of two specific omega-3 fatty acids—DHA and EPA—with lower levels of the gum disease periodontitis in participants. This infectious, chronic disease causes gum tissue to separate from the teeth, leading to the accumulation of bacteria. In severe cases, it can eventually cause bone and tooth loss.
“This is significant because [omega-3 fatty acids] are a commonly taken supplement in the U.S., and yet we haven’t had very many side effects reported,” said Asghar Z. Naqvi, an instructor in medicine at the Medical School and the lead author of the study.  “However, I don’t think that the average reader should start taking omega-3’s to prevent gum disease,” he added.
Medical School Associate Professor Kenneth J. Mukamal, who is also a senior author of the study, agreed with Naqvi’s conclusion, but added that a change in diet would not hurt.
“While a single cross-sectional study isn’t enough to make people change their diet, it is already recommended by the American Heart Association to eat at least two fatty fish meals a week,” Mukamal said. “This would fit well within the range of intake in which we saw lower levels of periodontitis.”
Slated to be published in the November issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, the study marks the beginning of a more intense exploration of the subject.
Naqvi is currently following up on the study with a randomized test trial to see if the findings can be replicated in a more “rigorous” experiment. Naqvi said that if these follow-up trials confirm that omega-3 fatty acids actually reduce the risk of periodontitis, the benefits would span beyond only decreasing the disease’s prevalence.
“Because some of the complications of periodontitis are cardiovascular, further confirmation of these findings will have added significance, because cardiovascular diseases are pretty much the number-one cause of mortality worldwide,” Naqvi said.
Naqvi added that increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids would also be relatively inexpensive compared with the usual treatment for periodontits, which often consists of surgeries.
“I think that the potential implications of this study should be taken quite seriously,” Naqvi said, adding that he is “eager” to continue his research.

The worst wind storm since 1978 tore through the Midwestern and Southern United States over the past two days, but students from the region said that their families were only minimally affected.
Winds—which reached up to 81 miles per hour—severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes were among the natural disasters that ripped through the region, leading to power outages and flight cancellations.
According to Indiana resident Daniel E. Golliher ’14, thousands in his home state lost power, “but losing power is common,” he said.
Lynelle T. Chen ’14, who spoke to her sister about the storm, said that “in Indianapolis, it wasn’t that bad. There were warnings, and there was some flooding, but it wasn’t that bad.”
Although tornadoes frequently occur in the southern Plains and have earned the region the title of “Tornado Alley,” yesterday’s tornadoes hit further north than they usually do.
Meteorology Professor Brian F. Farrell said that the storm was a “rare combination of upper and lower atmosphere disturbances [that] combined much like the famous ‘Perfect Storm.’”
Wind storms are caused by an area of warm, moist air that moves over a cold front; the difference in the low air pressure and high air pressure creates strong winds and leads to the formation of storm clouds.
The air pressure reading taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was among the lowest ever for a non-tropical storm in the 48 states.
Farrell said that the barometer, an instrument that measures air pressure, read 28.2 inches of mercury, making the storm equivalent to a category 3 hurricane.
But the winds in yesterday’s storm were weaker than those of a hurricane, which can reach up to 130 miles per hour.
Though the wind storm did not lead to any recorded deaths, it will go down in the record books as “one of the most intense ever recorded” in the history of mainland United States, Farrell said.

After arguing the reasons for and against maintaining the current university tenure system, participants in the “Resolved: Abolish Tenure” debate hosted by the Harvard Law School Federalist Society last night voted six to five in favor of keeping tenure in place.
The Federalist Society, a group of conservative, moderate, and libertarian law students, moderated a discussion on university tenure, in which professors are guaranteed lifetime positions and cannot lose their jobs without just cause. During the debate, which was held in Pound Hall, participants alternated between affirmative and negative speeches on the issue, allowing for questions in between.
First year Law School student J. Joel Alicea, who spoke against abolishing tenure, said that the debate boils down to a disagreement over the purpose of a university.
“If you view [a university] as consequentialist...or, like I do, as knowledge for its own sake, then that would affect your view of tenure,” Alicea said.
Although proponents of tenure often argue that the system protects academic freedom, third year Law School student Jay R. Schweikert, the moderator of the debate and the chair of the Federalist Society’s colloquial committee, said that tenure actually inhibits intellectual creativity.
“It puts so much pressure on that initial hiring position that it basically screens out people with unfavorable viewpoints and sort of forces them into hiding,” said Schweikert, who instead proposed a contractual system of offering professors 10-year contracts with guarantees of job preservation without just causes of termination.
Third year Law School student William O. Scharf, the president of the Federalist Society, said that the issue is relevant to the experience of Harvard students, who attend an academic institution with a comprehensive tenure system.
“For the most part, tenure affects the way [universities] go about their business,” Scharf said. “As members of this academic and intellectual community, I think the principal fact that the hierarchy is one of a tenure system is significant to us.”

Robert Scheer, author, journalist, and editor of the online political magazine Truthdig, challenged his audience to understand the financial sector in a talk entitled “The Pornography of Power: Lies, Injustice, and the American Way,” at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday.
Moderated by Timothy P. McCarthy—director of the Carr Center’s Human Rights and Social Movements Program and a History and Literature lecturer—the talk centered on a critique of modern American politics and emphasized the disastrous side effects of political bipartisanship.
In his opening remarks, Sheer made jabs at the Bush administration, criticized the Clinton administration, and expressed hope that President Barack H. Obama would outperform his predecessors.
Bringing his audience through a narrative about the United States’ current financial situation, Scheer highlighted the importance of figures like former President Ronald Reagan, former Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin ’60, and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who Scheer referred to as “our local hero.” Summers will return to campus at the close of 2010 after serving as head of the National Economic Council under Obama.
The talk reflected the contents of Scheer’s most recent book, “The Great American Stick Up: How Reagan Republicans and Clinton Democrats Enriched Wall Street While Mugging Main Street.”
Scheer drew an analogy between someone who drives a car over a cliff with those who steered America into the financial crisis.
“A deal with the devil was made,” Scheer said.
McCarthy also said these various actors could be characterized as “supervillains and slightly less super villains.”
The parallels that Scheer drew between members of the American political leadership and the mafia resonated with his audience. But one comment from an audience member drew ire from another audience member, who walked out in the middle of the question and answer session, which followed the initial talk.
In response to the speedy exit, Scheer asked, “Is that what happens at the Tea Party meetings?”
Despite the interruption, the dialogue continued, and when time became short at the end, the question and answer session moved to a rapid-fire format, with audience members directing questions to Scheer, who made an effort to respond to the question in a short burst.
When time was up, Scheer could not help but share one last story and comment with the group.
“There are many things I want to talk about,” Scheer said, “many of which I know very little about.”

A male graduate student was robbed at knifepoint Tuesday night while walking on Broadway past Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, according to a community advisory released by the Harvard University Police Department yesterday.
Two males approached the victim—who was uninjured—near Dana Street and displayed a knife before demanding “all of his property,” the report said. The victim handed over his property and the perpetrators then fled the scene.
The HUPD advisory provided no description of the suspects beyond their gender, and details from the police report were not available after business hours yesterday, according to Cambridge Police spokesman Daniel M. Riviello.
Yesterday’s robbery lead HUPD to release its third community advisory of this academic year. On Sept. 6, a male graduate student was robbed on Memorial Drive. HUPD also sent an alert after a man fatally shot himself on the steps of Memorial Church on Sept. 18.
In addition, in September a male undergraduate reported being the victim of a hate crime in which his wallet and cell phone were taken but subsequently recovered. That incident was not the subject of a community advisory.
Despite several incidents involving University affiliates, overall crime in Cambridge reached a 40-year low in 2009, according to data released last month.
Still, larcenies and bicycle thefts increased notably a year ago, particularly in Harvard Square, a pattern that Cambridge Police Lieutenant Daniel Wagner described as “seasonal.”

Harvard Medical School announced today the launch of a new Center for Primary Care, funded by a $30 million anonymous gift, that will serve as the focal point of the Medical School’s campaign to devote attention to primary care.
“Harvard Medical School’s commitment to leadership in all aspects of academic medicine led to serious, action-oriented discussions about the future of primary care, and this gift is a direct result of those conversations,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “I applaud Dean Flier for his bold and inclusive approach to forging primary care’s next frontier.”
The primary care initiative began in response to reports suggesting that primary care physicians are typically overworked and underpaid in comparison to colleagues who specialize in other disciplines. This trend has dissuaded medical students nationwide from primary care and has prompted some current practitioners to consider changing specialties later in their careers.
Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said that while this initiative cannot eliminate all concerns about the profession, he hopes that the University devoting attention to primary care will encourage more Medical School graduates to consider the field.
“The Center will create an organization at HMS that will both bring together the very large and diverse community interested in primary care, from students to trainees and faculty, and enhance that community by investing a lot of new resources,” he said.
Another aim of the new Center is to promote increased investment of both time and resources in primary care innovation. The anonymous gift will help to fund primary care scholarships, with a particular focus on issues related to health care policy.
The Center is the culmination of a year-long effort, led by the Primary Care Advisory Group, to rethink the Medical School’s approach to primary care. Comprising a diverse group of medical students, residents, faculty, and administrators assembled by the dean’s office, PCAG also solicited input from the Medical School community to include the perspectives of all affiliates.
“Harvard is a place that trains future leaders,” said Russell S. Phillips, professor of medicine and co-chair of the Primary Care Advisory Group. “My hope is that the Center will encourage students to come to HMS who hope to be future leaders in primary care.”
Flier said he hopes that the Medical School’s efforts will help spark increased innovation in the field of primary care on the national level.
“We have the most amazing student body and faculty and trainees who are potentially able to change the field of primary care medicine when given the proper resources and encouragements,” he said. “I would like to see, in the next five to 10 years, that through specific initiatives there will be major changes both locally and, ideally, nationally in how primary care is organized and carried out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard received an overall grade of “A-” in the annual College Sustainability Report Card, which was released yesterday by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.
“It’s both encouraging and a sign that we can do better,” said Robert M. Gogan, associate manager for recycling and waste for Facilities Maintenance Operations.
The College Sustainability Report Card assessed the 300 colleges and universities with the largest endowments in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 22 other institutions that applied for inclusion. The Report Card was designed to identify schools that are leading by example in sustainability.
More than half of the schools earned an overall grade of “B” or better, with 16 percent of schools earning an “A” or “A-.” Seven schools received a grade of “A,” including Brown and Yale.
Citing the rise in recycling rate and the installment of more efficient heating and cooling systems, Gogan said the University has increased its sustainability efforts. For example, Harvard installed more than 3,200 square feet of solar panels on top of Canaday Hall over the summer, Gogan added.
The report included nine categories, ranging from food and recycling to energy-efficient buildings to transportation. According to the report, Harvard has invested more than $15 million in energy efficiency and conservation projects, has cut greenhouse gas emissions by seven percent since 2006, and aims to achieve a 30 percent reduction by 2016.
While Gogan said he believes students are becoming more conscientious about promoting “greenness” on campus, he said there are still habits students “have got to break,” including loading up plates in the dining hall, throwing away newspapers, bottles, and cans that can be recycled, and leaving room lights on when no one’s there.
“Do your reading and studying by daylight,” Gogan said, “and party after dark.”
Student groups at Harvard, including the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program, have sponsored sustainability efforts targeting student life.
Isabella A. Wechsler ’13, the eco-REP for Cabot House, said that REP informs students about how much water they’re using and the amount of food they waste.
The organization also hosted an eco-friendly Brain Break at Annenberg last September, in which students received reusable mugs and learned about environmental groups on campus.
“We want to generate enthusiasm about the issue and educate people,” Wechsler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A body was discovered yesterday morning in Arnold Arboretum, a research and educational institution administered by Harvard University located several miles southwest of downtown Boston.
The body was discovered 8:47 a.m., said Boston Police Department spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll in an interview with the Boston Globe.
According to the Boston police, the incident may have been a suicide. The police declined to release other information, including the victim’s identity.
William “Ned” Friedman, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Colorado who will fill the vacancy of directorship for the Arboretum on Jan. 1, did not return request for comment on the issue, and Julie A. Warsowe, the Arboretum’s manager of visitor education, referred all media inquiries to the Boston police.
Billed as one of the world’s leading centers for the study of plants, the Arnold Arboretum is the oldest public arboretum in North America, having been founded in 1872, according to its website. It occupies 265 acres of land and houses nearly 15,000 plants.
Open to the general public, the Arboretum is part of the Emerald Necklace, a 7-mile-long network of park systems along Boston’s western edge.
The Office of the Provost oversees the Arboretum, and the City of Boston owns the land. In 1882, Boston agreed to lease the land to Harvard for 1,000 years.
“Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 111: Plants and Environmental Sensing,” expected to be offered next fall, will include field trips to the Arboretum.

Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates will soon be able to enjoy translations of classical Indian literature, a new executive education building at Harvard Business School, and an expanded Humanities Center—projects to be funded by recent gifts from three Indian businessmen.
Despite nationwide decreases in philanthropic giving due to economic weakness in the past few years, Harvard has received over $65 million from three Indian donors—Tata Trusts and Companies, N. R. Narayana Murty, and Anand G. Mahindra ’77—in 2010.
Professors view these donations as yet another iteration in the trend toward globalization—both in terms of Harvard’s outlook as well as India’s presence on the world stage.
Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez notes that these three donations—which include a $50 million gift to the Business School, the single largest donation from an international donor in the school’s history—are indicative of an overall upward tick in international donations.
“This is more a pattern of Harvard alumni in different parts of the world who are beginning to behave like U.S. alumni have for a long time,” Dominguez says. “It’s more a part of a general pattern—whether they’re from India, or from London, or Germany, or Hong Kong.”
Other faculty members say that sourcing gifts from international alumni and donors reflects the University’s increasingly global perspective.
“We are entering what is likely to be a truly global century, and thus having the Tata name on a building here at HBS is a wonderful reflection of this new global reality and our belief that innovation and great ideas increasingly will be found all over the world,” wrote Business School Dean Nitin Nohria in an e-mail.
Business School Professor Sunil Gupta says that these donations come at a time of tremendous growth in the Indian economy, meaning that Indian corporations, which are emerging onto the global scene, now have the funds to make donations.
“Tata Groups now own hotels in America,” Gupta says. “This donation shows their global strength.”
Professors note that these donations reflect India’s cultural traditions stressing the importance of education and represent a longtime interest in Western educational institutions.
“I think it’s important to realize that there has always been elite Indian interest in Harvard,” says English Professor Homi K. Bhaba, director of the Humanities Center at Harvard. “One of the things that has to be mentioned is the respect that is invested in education in India. Educational institutions are highly regarded in India; they are part of the Indian tradition of learning.”
Murty, Tata, and Mahindra also have personal connections to the University, and these connections likely played a role in their donations, according to several Business School professors. Murty’s son Rohan is a GSAS doctorate student; Mahindra, who graduated from Harvard College in 1977, also attended the Business School; and Tata attended the Business School’s Advanced Management Program in 1975.
In April, Murty—chairman and founder of Infosys Technologies, an information technology services company—gifted the University $5.2 million for a new publication series, The Murty Classical Library of India. The bilingual series will make numerous classic works of Indian literature available in English.
On Oct. 4, Mahindra, vice chairman and managing director of industrial giant Mahindra & Mahindra, donated $10 million to support the Humanities Center. This is the largest gift directed solely toward the humanities in Harvard’s history.
Most recently, a donation from Tata Trusts and Companies—the philanthropic arm of the Tata Group, a conglomerate with a market value of $80 billion—bestowed $50 million to the Business School. The gift will help finance the construction of the Business School’s new executive education building and the Harvard Innovation Lab in Allston.
And Business School Professor Tarun Khanna says these donations may have a broader global impact.
“In addition to being used well by the Harvard University Press, the Business School, and the Humanities Center, these donations may trigger a wave of consciousness in India and South Asia in general that will encourage fortunate people to support good institutions,” Khanna says.
“International philanthropy like this—with money flowing from a relatively undeveloped country to a more developed one—will help break down cultural stereotypes,” he adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He is the most generous overseas donor to Harvard Business School to date, not to mention the chairman of the largest Indian conglomerate company, but Ratan N. Tata remains an understated man.
According to both American and Indian intellectuals, humility and integrity are the two distinctive traits of a man considered nearly as powerful as the greatest political leaders in India.
For instance, the Tata Group billionaire refuses to let others carry his bag for him, according to Harvard Business School Professor Krishna G. Palepu, who has worked with Tata personally.
“We’re talking about a businessman who the current Indian prime minister publicly praises—and the leader of a company that commands the respect of the country,” Harvard Business School Professor Karthik Ramanna says.
In his nearly 20 years as chairman of Tata Group—India’s largest conglomerate that boasts holdings of over 200 companies—Tata has expanded the industrial empire’s international and domestic reach without “playing the bribery game,” according to Fareed Zakaria, editor-at-large of TIME Magazine.
Zakaria, who has spoken extensively with Tata, says that the $50 million donation to the Business School is part of Tata’s general efforts at expanding the international scope of his conglomerate.
“Tata is ultimately a worldwide company, so the Harvard Business School is a natural place to make an impact,” Zakaria says. “There are lots of things that they do in India, but this was an unusual opportunity; this was a way to establish the Tata name in a global context.”
SIZEABLE SUM FROM AN ALUM
Tata’s $50 million donation to the Business School will be used to develop a new building called Tata Hall. The structure will house classrooms and residential space for the school’s executive education program, which trains professionals in an accelerated management program and is currently housed in MacArthur and Baker Halls.
Because of the global reach of the executive education program, from which Tata graduated in 1975, the benefits of his donation “extend far beyond HBS,” Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria says.
“Executives come to our programs here in Allston,” Nohria writes in a statement. “They learn from our faculty and one another, and then they return to their companies with new and improved skills.”
“Since this process will be repeated year after year, over time the benefits from the ripple effect will be enormous,” Nohria adds.
Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Lakshmi Ramarajan says she believes that Tata’s gift not only reflects the businessman’s relationship with the program as an alum, but also his role as a global leader and citizen.
“His gift has tremendous importance in understanding how he sees himself a global citizen,” Ramarajan says. “Charitable giving and many of these kinds of acts of generosity often have to do with how we see ourselves.”
MORE THAN A LEADER
Tata has gained more global recognition for his contributions to the Tata Group. During his tenure as chairman, he increased the corporation’s market share in respective industry markets and its market capitalization to a combined $80 billion.
Tata Group is “pretty much in every industry,” says Rohit Deshpande, a professor of marketing at the Business School.
Tata Group, considered a crucial part of the development of the entire country, is the leading presence in various industries, such as steel, automobile, information technology, and hotels, according to Deshpande.
“It’s almost impossible to overestimate the economic footprint of the Tata companies in India,” Deshpande says, calling the Group “a huge global player.”
The Group is comprised of more than 100 companies, one of the oldest of which is Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, which recently bought the Ritz-Carlton Boston in 2006 and renamed it as the Taj Boston. Industrial giant Tata Motors recently bought Jaguar Land Rover in 2008, and multinational Tata Steel purchased the large Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus in 2007.
“[Tata] was able to transform all these companies into becoming much larger institutions,” Zakaria says. “All these companies [within Tata Group] are becoming world-class companies.”
In particular, Tata won much praise for developing the Tato Nano, a car that costs $2,500 and is marketed for the “ordinary man,” according to Palepu, who says that this demonstration of empathy is unique at such a high executive level.
A HIGHER STANDARD
When Tata announced that he would market a car that would sell for under 100,000 rupees ($2,500), his mission was to manufacture an affordable car to sell to the lower classes in India.
“All you need to do is look at a family of four sitting dangerously on a two-wheeler as it drives through slippery roads flooded with rain to understand why this car is so significant,” Palepu says. “[Tata] is probably the simplest executive with the most amount of empathy that I have met—and that empathy is what allowed for this car to happen.”
In spite of its juggernaut size, Tata Group has been equated with commitment to service and integrity, many say.
“He cares about his country, his company, and his employees,” Nohria says. “And no organization in the world has a greater commitment to integrity and doing things ‘right.’”
The company is itself controlled by a collection of non-profit, charitable trusts, to which two-thirds of the profit of these companies contribute. This collection of trusts sponsors free cancer hospitals and education through grants and scholarships.
“This is a company that has a very solid reputation for doing good,” Ramanna says.
Professors note that this reputation is particularly noteworthy in a country that is riddled with high-profile corruption debacles.
“Tatas are known for values,” writes Sunita Singh-Sengupta, professor in management studies at Delhi University, in an e-mail.
“The moment any one who is familiar with the name, sees his photo image anywhere—the only thing that comes to one’s mind is respect, integrity, honesty, and contribution beyond business,” Singla writes.
The high regard that Tata has attained for himself all throughout India has only been amplified by his recent contributions to Harvard Business School.
“As a person of Indian origin,” Palepu says, “his donation makes me really proud to have someone like Mr. Tata step up and show the kind of commitment to Harvard Business School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, in its penultimate home game, the Harvard field hockey team squared off against No. 14 Boston College at Jordan Field. The Crimson (3-12, 1-4 Ivy) looked to snap a six-game losing streak under the lights, but the Eagles  (11-6, 1-3 ACC) were the team that shined, cruising to a 5-0 victory.
“We had a good game plan,” sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “I think we just came out a little bit flat.”
Boston College got on the board early, tallying the game’s first goal 42 seconds into the action. Eagles forward Courtney Tavener edged her defender along the left baseline and sent a pass to forward Jenna Anctil in front of the goal. Anctil one-timed the pass into the net for an easy score.
Roughly five minutes later, the duo struck again. This time, Tavener beat her defender by bouncing the ball on her stick. She found Anctil in the same place as before, and the senior buried the shot to put Boston College up, 2-0.
“I wish I knew [why we struggled in the opening minutes],” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “I think a lot of that is mental preparation…The first two goals were gifts, and you can’t give gifts to good teams.”
The Crimson shored up its defense for the rest of the half and even generated a few chances of its own. With 15 minutes remaining in the period, sophomore forward Nina Kucharczyk made a run on net with a defender on her left. Kucharczyk managed to fire off a solid shot, but Eagles goalkeeper Kristine Stigas hit the turf and smothered the attempt.
In the waning minutes of the half, Harvard had another scoring opportunity. This time, Kucharczyk drove into the circle and passed to freshman midfielder Rachel Rosenfeld, who then ripped a shot on net, but Stigas made a kick save—her only other save on the night—and the threat was averted.
In the second half, the Crimson’s bend-but-don’t-break defense finally buckled.  Anctil picked up a hat trick just eight minutes into the action with a shot from the left side of the circle—her 11th goal of the season. Boston College extended its lead towards the end of the game with a close-range goal from Tavener at 59:08 and powerful rip from forward Nicole Schuster at 63:20.
“In the second half, it got out of control,” Caples said. “We made a lot of decision-making errors. It put us on the defensive a lot, and we didn’t get on track.”
Harvard managed just one shot in the frame—a harmless deflection by freshman midfielder Mariah Pewarski with three minutes left in the game. The Eagles, on the other hand, recorded 17 shots in the same time span. The ball rarely crossed into the Crimson’s offensive half in the final 35 minutes.
“We need to handle the ball better out of our defensive end so that we get it over the 50,” Caples said.
“Our defense just needs to keep stepping up and putting pressure on them so they can’t get open shots,” Tassopoulos added.
If it were not for Tassopoulos’ stalwart play between the pipes, the score might have been even worse. The sophomore registered nine saves on the night as Boston College continually challenged the goalkeeper, particularly in the second half, in which she made seven saves. Her most impressive stop might have come in the first half, when Tassopoulos deflected a shot from Anctil, and, as the ball trickled towards the goal line, she dove and cleared the threat.
“[Tassopoulos] has been so strong,” Caples said. “She’s leading the defense. She’s the anchor back there. She’s been a rock for us.”
Harvard has now lost seven straight games and 12 of its last 13. The loss was the Crimson’s second straight to a ranked opponent, as it fell to No. 5 Princeton, 4-0, last Saturday.
“I think we can hang with the top teams,” Tassopoulos said. “Today was just a bit of an off day, and starting tomorrow we’ll get back on [track].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season had a dream start. A brand new stadium, a home crowd of over 3,000 fans, and a thrilling night-game victory over then-No.13 Stanford. The Harvard men’s soccer team had a ranking back then—No. 10, according to the National Soccer Coaches Association. This high ranking signaled optimism about Harvard’s chances to defend its Ivy League title and maybe have another deep run in the NCAA tournament.
Most people shared this sentiment. After all, seven starters, including last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year Brian Rogers, returned for another shot at the title. There was a new coach too, one that knew the team very well from his experience as assistant coach over the past two years.
Fifty-four days have passed since that opening evening at Soldiers Field, and both the Crimson and the Cardinal have lost their spots in the top 25 and sit below .500 overall.
At least Harvard lived up to the hype at the start of the season by winning its first two games in dramatic fashion. Stanford, on the other hand, had to live through a nightmarish loss in its first game of the season to Vermont—a team that had won only one game all of last year. The subsequent loss to the Crimson did nothing to help its cause. That result helped Harvard move up to No. 6—its highest spot from last year—while the Cardinal was dismissed from the rankings. From there, Stanford’s slump continued. It lost two more games against Californian schools before bouncing back by winning four in a row and rediscovering its scoring prowess. They even beat then-No. 13 UCLA—the highlight of a season full of ups and downs.
The Crimson? It took the team nearly a month to notch another “W”, which came against Yale in its first conference matchup. Before this, Harvard faced a slew of respectable nonconference opponents, but the results were troubling. Three draws and three loses weren’t appropriate for a sixth-ranked squad. As a result, by the end of September, the Crimson said goodbye to the national polls.
And now, both Harvard and the Cardinal are riding two-game losing streaks, stuck somewhere in the middle of their respective conference standings.
The Crimson’s fairy tale-turned-average season came to an end in a 2-1 loss last Sunday on the road against No. 20 Princeton, a disastrous blow to the team’s title dreams.
Or so it seems. Looking at the three teams above the Crimson in the standings—all of whom are ranked—there is still a possibility for a share of the title. Even so, it’s pretty farfetched. Harvard, of course, would have to win all of its remaining games. Princeton would have to lose two out of its three remaining games and tie No. 14 Penn. The Quakers have to also tie No. 13 Brown and then lose to Harvard in the final game of the season. And, finally, the Bears will have to lose to Yale and Dartmouth, two teams with .250 records.
Likely, huh?
Well, crazier things have happened, like the 2005 Champions League final in which Liverpool came back from a 3-0 deficit against AC Milan to win it all in a penalty shootout (a concept I don’t really like, but a soccer game must end somehow, right?). Or Andres Iniesta’s goal in the 93rd minute for Barcelona against Chelsea that propelled the Catalan team to the Champions League final and ultimately the title.
I guess what I’m trying to say is that if these things happened, then the Crimson still has a chance to salvage its season by sharing the title, no matter how small the probability may be. But that will only happen if the team steps it up.
Losing to the Tigers on ESPNU was disappointing, but Harvard will have to take away some positives. Sophomore Scott Prozeller scored off a well-taken free kick to put the visiting team ahead. The goals scored by Princeton were off set pieces as well, an aspect the Crimson defense will need to continue to work on. What the defense did well was contain the potent Tiger offense from scoring its usual three goals—its average output over the previous seven games.
What desperately needs to be addressed, though, is the recent trend of collapsing after going up on the scoreboard. It happened against Cornell, Boston College, and Princeton. In those games, Harvard went ahead but was unable to finish on top.
At the very least, the Crimson will have to score more than one goal in a game, a feat it has not accomplished since its televised matchup against UMass on Sept. 6. Harvard has enough talent on the attack to do so and now needs to put it to use.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you’re surfing through the channels this Saturday afternoon searching for the Missouri-Nebraska or the Michigan St.-Iowa football games, don’t be too surprised if you come across a pair of matchups that might seem better suited for a quiz bowl than a football game.
This weekend, two Ivy League contests will be coming to a living room near you. The matchup between Columbia and Yale will be broadcast on the YES Network, and Harvard will face Dartmouth on NESN.
While these games are sure to keep record numbers of viewers glued to their television sets, the networks may have slipped up in choosing which Ancient Eight games to air.
As these two contests are taking place in the limelight, the Ivy’s other four teams will be toiling in obscurity. America has no idea what it’s going to be missing.
In the other matchups, a pair of undefeated Ivy League teams—Penn and Brown—will battle for the top spot in the conference standings while two winless teams—Princeton and Cornell—will fight for the bottom spot. This is drama you can’t find on “Jersey Shore” or “Basketball Wives.”
Unfortunately, nobody will be able to see it.
But, luckily, I am here to tell you what’s going to happen this weekend so you don’t have to worry about missing a beat. On to the predictions…
COLUMBIA (3-3, 1-2 Ivy)                      at YALE (4-2, 2-1 Ivy)
Both Columbia and Yale will be looking to right the ship after suffering close losses last weekend. The Lions fell to Dartmouth by three, while the Bulldogs had a decent showing against Penn, losing just 27-20 after the team managed to make it close with a pair of late scores.
In order for Yale to stay in contention for the Ivy League title, the squad will have to prevail against Columbia, which boasts the best pass defense in the conference. The team will look to quarterback Patrick Witt, who enters Week 7 as the top passer in the Ancient Eight, averaging over 275 yards per game.
Yale’s defense will have its hands full dealing with Columbia quarterback Sean Bracket, a threat to run and pass. But given the Lions struggles on the offensive and defensive lines and the fact that the game will be played in New Haven, the edge goes to the Bulldogs.
Prediction: Yale 21, Columbia 17
PRINCETON (1-5, 0-3 Ivy)                    at CORNELL (1-5, 0-3 Ivy)
This matchup poses lots of interesting questions. For instance, what happens when you pit the league’s lowest scoring offense against the league’s worst scoring defense? Or, to put it more simply, which is the Ancient Eight’s worst team?
These questions should all be answered when Princeton and Cornell—the only two winless teams in Ivy play—square off against each other this weekend. If it weren’t for the elimination of the tie from college football in 1996, I might be tempted to have both teams go another week without a win, but alas, one team will have to emerge victorious.
All signs point to the Tigers as the less bad of the duo. After all, the Big Red has lost multiple games by at least 34 points, and Princeton’s offense has shown signs of competency, scoring 28 points last weekend against Harvard.
Prediction: Princeton 27, Cornell 10
BROWN (4-2, 3-0 Ivy)                         at No. 21 PENN (5-1, 3-0 Ivy)
This is the one everyone’s been waiting for—the matchup to see which team is the Ivy League’s top dog.
Sorry to rain on the parade, but try not to get too excited. Though both teams share an undefeated conference record, the two squads are not as evenly matched as one might think.
While the Bears have been beating up on the Ivy League’s cellar dwellers in its past two games, the Quakers have been displaying their mettle by defeating two opponents with winning records. Also, Brown is without starting quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero, who suffered a season-ending injury in Week 3. Backup signal caller Joe Springer had an impressive performance last week, throwing for 287 yards and two touchdowns, but those stats should come with an asterisk, reading, “*came against Cornell.”
Don’t expect Springer and rest of the Bears’ offense to have as much success against Penn, which boasts the top run defense and the fifth best total defense in the Football Championship Subdivision.
Prediction: Penn 24, Brown 14
HARVARD (4-2, 2-1 Ivy)                             at DARTMOUTH (4-2, 1-2 Ivy)
Believe me folks, this isn’t your older brother’s Dartmouth football program that went 21-78 over the past 10 seasons. While most Harvard teams from the past decade could use their matchup with the Big Green as a quasi-bye week, things are different in 2010.
Dartmouth football is in the midst of a revolution. Just six games through the 2010 season, the Big Green—led by star running back Nick Schwieger—has already racked up more wins than it had in the 2008 and 2009 seasons combined. Schwieger—who is averaging 141.8 rushing yards per game—has had a lot to do with Dartmouth’s revival, as the Big Green has not lost a game all season in which the runner picked up more than 151 all-purpose yards.
As much as I’d love to jump on the bandwagon and pick Dartmouth to win its first home game against the Crimson since 1993, I don’t see it happening this Saturday. For one, Harvard has an elite running back of its own in Gino Gordon, who is coming off a career-high, 204-yard performance against Princeton last weekend. The Crimson will also be aided by the return of senior quarterback Collier Winters.
Winters will likely make his first start of the season after throwing for two touchdowns in two quarters of play last weekend. Factor in Harvard’s defense—which currently ranks second in the Ivy League—and this Saturday should be just like old times.
Prediction: Harvard 28, Dartmouth 20

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a busy week here in Cambridge and on other Ivy campuses. The Head of the Charles came and went, winter sports have started, and homecomings are arriving. But in this season of change, much has stayed the same. The Ivies are still good at rowing, Princeton is still good at basketball, and Dartmouth’s football team will still play and lose to Harvard. Let’s take a trip around the water cooler and breakdown the latest and greatest from the Ancient Eight.
Coming out of the Head of the Charles weekend, the big story that dominated the pages was Harvard taking home the MacMahon Cup Regatta Point Trophy for the most total points by any club, school, college or university. However, the story that was buried under the accolades for Harvard was the strong showing that the Ivy League overall at Head of The Charles Regatta. For example, Princeton’s lightweight crew, which will go into the 2011 season as the two-time defending EARC and IRA national champions, smashed a 13-year-old course record on the Charles by nearly 12 seconds. Yale's lightweight crew took the top two spots in the lightweight four, while Princeton's women beat the reigning NCAA champion Virginia by more than eight seconds.
Basketball season is almost here. With the start of the regular season in only three weeks, preseason rankings for the Ivy League have been released. Both the Princeton’s men and women teams will start the season ranked first among Ancient Eight contenders while both Harvard’s teams will similarly start ranked second overall. Their matchups should be interesting as both the men and women teams of Harvard and Princeton are scheduled to face each other on the same days this season.
In news from the gridiron, Harvard will be on the road for a second straight week in another important conference matchup at Dartmouth. Saturday’s game, Dartmouth’s homecoming, will mark the 114th meeting between the two teams—Harvard’s second-longest running rivalry, second only to Yale. Crimson coach Tim Murphy has never lost a game in Hanover throughout his tenure. Against Princeton last weekend, senior running back Gino Gordo rushed for a career-high 204 yards on 20 carries and a touchdown to boot. He will look to match or even beat his record as he faces the Big Green defense that is ranked sixth in total defense within the Ivy League.
On Fitzpatrick watch, Harvard grad and NFL quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 passed for 374 yards with 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a loss against the notoriously stingy Ravens defense. While the 0-6 Bills may be the joke of the NFL right now, they actually have a passing offense that's moving the chains on a regular basis. Fitzpatrick has thrown for 11 TDs and owns a passer rating of 102.0 since regaining the starting role four games ago.

It's Halloweekend, and you know what that means: carving faces into oversized orange vegetables, taking candy from strangers, and dressing like a “slutty (noun of choice)." Sadly, some of us have spent too much time confronting the more pressing terrors of midterms to prepare an adequately horrifying/hilarious/skanky costume. But fear not, since Flyby is here to help you out with some last minute costume ideas using supplies that can be found right in your own house.
Laundry
Put on every single item of clothing that you can. Sweat a lot to create the authentic laundry smell.
Lamonster
Use eyeshadow to create dark circles under your eyes. Mess up your hair. Put on sweatpants and a sweatshirt, and attach incomplete problem sets and empty expresso cups to your outfit. Complete the look with some fangs.
Walk-o-Shame
Wear heels and a wrinkled going-out outfit (preferably with a ripped sleeve or two). Smudge your makeup and mess up your hair. Draw a few strategically-placed hickeys on your neck. Bring an umbrella on nights when it is not raining. Make sure to be seen walking—with your head down—from Wigglesworth back to your House.
Annenburglar
Put on a black and white striped shirt and wear a black stocking over your face. Carry around random unnecessary HUHDS items like saltines, fruits, plastic bowls, and cereal.
Final Club Sophomore Boy
Wear all white and head to the d-hall. Pour Hi-C or any other sugary red drink all over yourself. Congrats, you just got “punched."
Party Shuttle 
Wear a strobe light and carry drunk people back and forth between Mather and the Quad.
Lowell Bells
Gather all the alarm clocks you have in your room and affix them to your body. Set them all to cacophoniously go off at the most annoying times possible.
Hot Breakfast
Stay in your room the entire weekend. You no longer exist. (Exceptions can be granted for Saturdays before 10 a.m. when no one is awake.)
Primal Scream
Why limit yourself to just one naked celebration per semester? Wear no clothes and revel in the glory of having the most terrifying costume at your Halloween party.

It's not often that we see examples of nature's food chain in action here on campus, but several students got a front row seat on Tuesday. At approximately 1:35 p.m., three sophomores stumbled upon a bird that had pinned a mouse to the arm of a bench outside of Old Quincy.
The bird, which onlookers said they believe was a falcon, then pecked at the mouse and started to dismember it. After beheading the rodent, the bird worked its way through the rest of the poor creature, picking off chunks of meat until the mouse was no more.
"It was somewhat gruesome, but we were more fascinated," one onlooker told us afterward. "Otherwise, we couldn’t have continued to watch."
But the same eyewitness also said he found meaning in the killing. “In that moment, I came to realize the transience of life, and the existential fragility of my human existence,” he said.
