What is a writer, and why should anyone write? Novelist and essayist Zadie Smith addressed these questions at a lecture on January 24 at the Museum of Fine Arts. In front of a packed lecture hall, Smith discussed the complicated figure of the “creative writer”—viewed in academia, she joked, as a harmless idiot savant, and yet also romanticized with a certain kind of awe.
Smith had come to speak as part of the MFA’s annual Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Celebrity Lecture series, the lineup of which this season boasts such well-known guest lecturers as the mother-daughter pair of artist Laurie Simmons and filmmaker and HBO series “Girls” creator Lena Dunham, as well as acclaimed painter Kehinde Wiley.
Smith, who prides herself on defying convention, is known for wearing turbans; true to form, she was sporting a pink one at the event. Even the style of her presentation defied trends; rather than follow what Smith termed the fashion in literary lectures of giving off-the-cuff ruminations, Smith gave a more traditional talk. “Writing is the attempt to own an identity,” she said. “[Its main pleasure is] the secret of transformation [and] of living many lives in one. You can be all the parts of you [that] you can’t express in normative existence,” she said. Her description seemed hardly surprising given the preoccupations of her work. Beginning with her celebrated debut novel “White Teeth,” which concerns the immigrant experience of mediating one’s heritage with one’s new culture, Smith has attempted nuanced explorations of what it is to own an identity and to navigate the influence of histories over which one may have little control.
Smith was open about admitting that she does not have all the answers. When facing a blank page, she said, it is alright to admit,“I am feeling a bit pointless and absurd.” The task of a writer is difficult and largely unglamorous, she said. In a society increasingly defined by its capacity to consume, Smith says, writing has the appeal of freedom because it is a form of self-expression not tied to a credit card.
She was also honest about the difficulty of writing. “Despite the cacophony of careless writing we read every day, [one should write] without romantic self-pity or stylized despair,” Smith said. She advised aspiring writers to follow a mantra: “I am writing to make this sentence as good as possible.” When asked by an attendee how to convey to young students the importance of reading widely, she responded that reading keeps the aspiring writer from mistakenly believing his or her work to be completely new. 
These comments were reminiscent of advice Smith has given before. In 2010, British newspaper The Guardian asked noted writers for their “Ten Rules for Writing Fiction,” and Smith’s tenth piece of advice was, “Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never ­being satisfied.” 
Despite acknowledging that the process of writing can be thankless and arduous, Smith continues to be passionate about writing. In a 2013 interview with The Rumpus, an online literary magazine, Smith said, “You can’t write thoughtlessly[,]— that’s the problem with writing. You have to think about the damn thing all the time. I think that’s why it’s sometimes difficult. But rewarding, right? It’s rewarding.” Smith compared the writer at work on a story to a carpenter at work on a piece of furniture: No matter how well it is made, Smith says, “You have to accept that you are creating a surplus in demand and [may be] making a chair that nobody wants.”
Writing may be challenging, but it is necessary, Smith suggests. For her it serves its purpose and allows her to investigate complex societal themes. We might not need writing if we could be all the different people we wanted to be all the time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their homeland of North Korea, two sisters struggle to make the difficult decision between remaining faithful to their country or fleeing to the United States in search of a better life. Company One's production of "You For Me For You," playing at the Boston Center for the Arts’ Plaza Theatre through February 16, explores how the loving bond between two sisters can survive amidst political and personal turmoil. This new work, scripted by playwright Mia Chung, succeeds in creating a unique world through realistic and disarming sound effects, superb lighting to transition between scenes, and an insightful script that deeply explores each character's plight.
Junhee (Jordan Clark) and Minjee (Giselle Ty) cope with the dangers of communist North Korea, relying on each other to survive. Throughout the performance, the two actresses maintain a natural banter, a testament to both their acting skill and the accessible script. Ty's body language and expressions cast her convincingly in the role of an older sister in declining health—her hunched shoulders, persistent coughs, and strained voice all contribute to a believable depiction of an ill young woman.
 
The play highlights the struggle of Junhee in her efforts to take care of her older sister. Both Junhee and Minjee are persistent in putting the other before herself, even if that means suffering from political strife. But soon their differing opinions lead to conflict—despite unfair treatment from the North Korean government, Minjee remains steadfast, even stubborn, in her professed nationalism for her country. On the other hand, Junhee is adamant that their best and only chance for survival is to leave their home behind and travel to America. Eventually, Junhee convinces her sister that leaving home for the United States is the better option.
 
Chung depicts the stress of adapting to a new country while longing for home through the  exaggerated speaking tropes she creates. In scenes of dialogue with the American characters Tiffany (Anna Waldron) and Wade (Johnnie McQuarley), Junhee struggles to understand English. Because of the rapid and loud nature of the Americans’ speech, it is easier to see how a foreigner may be overwhelmed by American behavior. Clark’s reserved and tacit demeanor as Junhee when she reacts to the Americans contributes to the sympathy Chung creates toward the two sisters in the play, sympathy for their alienation from American life.
 
Fundamental to this alienation is the feeling of an unfamiliar environment created by lighting designer Annie Wiegand and sound designer Brendan Doyle. To exaggerate the contrast between the two countries, scenes that take place in North Korea are dimmer than scenes in the United States. Not only are the lights brighter in America, but sounds, including speech, are also louder. From the first moment that Junhee arrives in the States, the sounds distinctly place the scene in a different location; she is greeted by the clamor of a bustling and noisy train station. To heighten the the sense of oppression in the North Korea setting, Doyle accompanies a tense scene in the doctor’s office with a high-pitched buzzing noise. 
 
Again and again, Chung’s script highlights the contrasts between the two cultures. She draws attention to the characteristic consumerism of American culture with bold quips about American society—at one point Minjee says, “If you feel stress, you take a vacation that shapes your eyebrows.” Throughout the play, other characters also make blatant and occasionally snide references to aspects of American culture. The Smuggler (Michael Tow), who helps the sisters flee North Korea, serves as a stern but realistic voice to show Minjee the differences between life in the two countries. In one jab of his wry commentary, Tow references the perks of the American health care system; he remarks that the government not only provides medicine but even “pays” the sick to take time off. 
 
“You For Me For You” is a historical and cultural lesson that not only depicts life in a closed-off society, but also tells a tale of transition that might have been overlooked by a Western audience. Even though the play centers on two North Korean sisters, the lighting and sound design, coupled with Chung’s masterful script, help an American audience feel what it might be like to experience these characters' transnational struggle. These vital aspects of the play cast the two sisters in a constantly foreign environment, unable to settle, until finally—disregarded by North Korea’s government and unable to feel connected to American culture—the two sisters find that only with each other can they truly feel at home.

Tom A. Lehrer '46, the piano-playing musical comedian and the subject of this week's Arts cover, is also a Harvard man. Naturally, then, he likes a good highbrow reference—and he's especially fond of giving shout-outs to German-language composers. For those of you not primed on your lieder, here's a playlist of pieces for piano and voice by the composers Lehrer referenced.
Gustav Mahler—Wo die schönen Trompeten blasen ("Where the Beautiful Trumpets Blow") 
Lehrer's song "Alma" is about Mahler's wife, who also married the architect Walter Gropius and the novelist Franz Werfel during her life. Thus, she ended up with the full title of Alma Maria Mahler Gropius Werfel. Talk about name-dropping.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart—Das Veilchen ("The Violet")
Did you know that potassium and cesium both show up as violet in flame tests? If you need a review of your chemical elements, Lehrer is here to help.
Franz Schubert—Die böse Farbe ("The Evil Color")
The "evil color" Schubert is talking about is Yale Blue. Fight fiercely, Harvard.
Franz Lehár—Da geh' ich in's Maxim ("You’ll Find Me At Maxim’s")
If you find "Maxim"—the magazine, that is, not the restaurant referenced by Lehár—a little tame, you'll definitely sympathize with the narrator of this Lehrer song.
Johann Strauss II— Als flotter Geist ("An Orphan From My Early Days")
Strauss is known as the "waltz king," and, hey, what do you know—Lehrer wrote one too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, as Harvard students perused courses and finalized schedules, the University was left aghast at the extreme inaccuracy of its Pre-Term Planning data. Because of the unanticipated turnout for many classes, lecture halls were cramped and course lotteries were ubiquitous, leaving scores of students disappointed. Pre-Term Planning doesn’t work because Harvard students do not take it seriously, and for good reason: The goals of PTP are at odds with those of shopping week. In order to make shopping period a better experience for everyone, PTP will have to see some serious reforms.
The aim of such reforms would be to make Pre-Term Planning a more thoughtful process, such that data would more closely mirror actual turnout. As it stands, students clearly do not put much thought into the whole affair—otherwise, we would not see hundreds of students forced to lottery for overfilled classes.
One possible solution might be to require all students to meet with their academic advisors before submitting their PTP. This way, students would be less likely to pick classes at random or to choose classes that they will ultimately be unable to take because of their academic plan or schedule.
For similar reasons, the University might consider asking students to partake in Pre-Term Planning later in the semester, or even better, between semesters. Pre-Term Planning for the spring takes place in the middle of the fall semester, when spring course enrollment is among the least of students’ many competing priorities. Resultantly, students are not likely to have thought much about the next semester’s classes when Pre-Term Planning time rolls around and are likely to approach Pre-Term Planning with haste and annoyance. If the University were to ask students to complete Pre-Term Planning between semesters, they would certainly be more likely to put time and effort into the process.
Finally, to make Pre-Term Planning more useful, the College might consider asking students to indicate six or seven classes that they intend to shop rather than four courses that they intend to take. Harvard College students are lucky and grateful to have a shopping week, and Pre-Term Planning should better reflect the ethos of that week. If students were allowed to indicate more than four courses in their Pre-Term Planning, the data would strike a closer resemblance to how shopping week actually works—many students shop a number of courses, only finalizing their schedules after the week is over. It is not uncommon for students to select schedules that are very unlike those they had anticipated at the semester’s outset. Changing the system to reflect this tendency would improve the data by allowing for the flexibility and uncertainty inherent in shopping week.
Taken together, these reforms could do quite a bit to transform Pre-Term Planning from a dysfunctional mess into a useful and accurate tool. It is a great privilege to preview any of Harvard’s thousands of courses at the beginning of each term, and a reformed PTP system would help students make course selections in line with the spirit of shopping period. By injecting a bit of thoughtfulness, timeliness, and flexibility into the process, Harvard could avoid much of the chaos that characterized this semester’s shopping week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years after his Panglossian crusade for hope and change was slugged by the realities of a dysfunctional Washington, President Obama emerged reinvigorated from an arduous campaign and delivered a second inaugural address that boldly staked a progressive agenda for his second term. But despite his recent posturing, the disquieting evolution of President Obama’s puzzling political identity troubles me.
At the outset of his first term, an overcautious Obama squandered considerable political capital on tepid stimulus and healthcare bills due to a baffling inability to command the bully pulpit.  Mired in the minefields of increasingly radicalized Republican obstinacy, the administration’s myriad concessions and omissions rightly disheartened the president’s supporters.
To the glee of many of his supporters, the president delivered a full-throated defense of the social safety net, declaring that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security “do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.”
Jabbing at climate change deniers, Obama asserted, “some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”
The first president to ever use the word gay in an inaugural address, Obama most poignantly underscored the motif of equal rights for all people by grouping Seneca Falls and Selma with Stonewall, succinctly linking the women’s rights, civil rights, and gay rights movements.
The recent inaugural address revealed a bolder, more bellicose president who, no longer fearful of re-election, eschewed the traditional highfalutin, hollow rhetoric of inaugural addresses for an unapologetic liberal agenda. It was an eloquent rethinking of the American Dream through the progressive collective action embodied in the address’s refrain: “We the people.”
And the speech contained many points that Republicans ought to rally behind rather than impulsively dismiss as an unnatural return to liberalism, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did. Obama channeled the quintessentially American ideal of self-reliance in articulating skepticism towards government as panacea, a call for tax code reform, and a warning to reduce the size of the deficit.
Seeing that the House of Representatives remains under intransigent Republican control, it’s unlikely that the president’s emboldened rhetoric can affect actual change on the policy front. But Obama has begun his second term in the right tone: one that is a marked departure from the seemingly weak-willed tone of the first term’s negotiator.
But while the administration is in the throes of renovation, I cannot help but feel uneasy about the president’s identity (and not in the nonsensical birtherist way). After four years of pessimism with the way the president has authorized the National Defense Authorization Act and drone strikes and expanded the police state, I must ask—who is Barack Obama?
He’s certainly not the liberal messiah that the 2008 campaign hailed him as. There’s a striking cognitive dissonance between candidate Obama and his actions as president. This is evident when one looks at his administration’s continuation and bolstering of controversial Bush-era practices like warrantless wiretapping, kill lists that sanction the extrajudicial killings of American citizens abroad, increased reliance on drone strikes in Pakistan employing questionable tactics like double taps (follow-up strikes that target first responders) and signature strikes (unidentified victims fitting a certain description are counted as combatants). All liberals should be vehemently opposed to these policies, perpetrated by a one-time constitutional law professor, which so flagrantly infringe the Bill of Rights. The chorus of opposition to President Bush has sadly fallen silent.
One might try to prove him faithful to his campaign pledges by pointing to his first term “achievements.” But many of these were watered down to the point of irrelevance by a dysfunctional Congress, including the healthcare law, the rescue of the financial and auto sectors, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Perhaps the question of Obama’s political identity is best answered by the man himself: "The truth of the matter is that my policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I had back in the 1980s, I would be considered a moderate Republican,” the president said in an interview. It’s certainly true when one recalls that Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan increased the debt ceiling 18 times, and the individual mandate central to the Affordable Care Act was an idea promoted by the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank.
I worry about possible Democratic complacency as the Republican Party demagogues itself into obsolescence. Citizens should not embrace the false dichotomy of Democrat and Republican—the imprimatur of a self-identifying liberal president should not allow his controversial actions to go unchecked and unchallenged. The president and the establishment Democratic Party have drifted so far to the right that too many political debates are between center-right and far-right positions, leaving the center vulnerable.
As Yeats cautioned, when “the center cannot hold, things fall apart.”

Whenever Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ’78 gives a formal public address, the chances are good that he will mention Orchard Gardens School. Whether he is stumping for votes for President Obama, addressing the Democratic National Convention, or delivering the State of the Commonwealth address, Governor Patrick speaks with great pride and enthusiasm about the progress being made by the once-failing school he has chosen as his calling card.
Governor Patrick has made his commitment to education known at every available opportunity, and he has argued passionately for the opportunity and growth that education provides, not just as an end within itself, but as a means to achieve economic growth, progress, and excellence. This is reflective of the governor’s wider message: Through targeted development in sectors that form the foundation of our economy like education and infrastructure, Massachusetts can amplify its economic growth and recovery and its ability to compete on a regional and national scale.
It should be no surprise, then, that in his State of the Commonwealth address, delivered on January 16, and in his subsequent budget proposal, Governor Patrick argued for a new economic strategy centered on “education, innovation, and infrastructure.” In order to see this strategy to fruition, the governor’s budget proposal calls for a $1.5 billion increase in funding for education and transportation as well as increased local aid for the coming fiscal year. That is where the controversy comes in: To pay for the budget increases, Governor Patrick has proposed increasing the income tax from 5.25 percent to 6.25 percent while simultaneously lowering the sales tax from 6.25 percent to 4 percent to generate around $1 billion in net revenue.
To many Massachusetts residents who know the Commonwealth by the less-than-savory moniker “Taxachussetts,” the income tax increase is an unwelcome imposition. Critics of the plan argue that the tax hike adversely affects workers and families in a barely recovering economy. However, the merits of the plan are plain, as the proposed spending increases are designed to boost economic growth, equalize the tax burden, and elevate quality of living for the state overall. The plan’s benefits and the strategies it employs would mitigate the ill-effects of the income tax hike and would provide much needed improvements to the state now and in the future.
The most obvious benefit of the governor’s plan is the direct impact it has on education, transportation, and local aid. The budget proposal includes a $226 million increase in general education aid as well as a $112 million increase in state scholarships. This education funding is vital to preserving and advancing the progress made by Massachusetts K-12 schools and to making college more accessible to students regardless of their socioeconomic background. Not only is this beneficial to low-income students and schools across the state, but the funding increase also fosters future economic growth, first by better equipping students to work in a competitive, high-level economy, and second, by sending more students to local universities and increasing the likelihood that workers with a higher degree will stay in state.
The transportation component of the governor’s plan is similarly impactful. Under Governor Patrick’s plan, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will extend services to 2 a.m. The plan also calls for passenger rail service to Springfield and the Berkshires, with an extension of commuter rail services to New Bedford and Fall River, a much-needed addition that connects the state and makes the system more accessible to a greater number of Massachusetts residents. Additionally, unrestricted aid to local cities and towns would increase by $40 million and could promote local growth, help still-recovering communities, and support infrastructure improvements, all vital to elevating the state’s overall growth and national standing.
Critics acknowledge that the benefits of Governor Patrick’s plan are appealing, but dispute that they are worthy of an income tax increase that could potentially harm families still recovering from the economic downturn. These claims are less than strong given the design of the governor’s tax plan, which aims to reduce the ill-effects of a tax increase by simplifying and equalizing the tax code so it better reflects ability to pay. In addition to cutting the sales tax, which is naturally regressive, the plan reduces the costs its income tax hike will inflict on low-income earners by doubling the personal income tax exemption. It also eliminates some corporate tax breaks, plus 45 other income tax deductions. These measures would serve to make the tax code more equitable and reduce the burden on families who are unable to pay a higher share of taxes.
Fundamentally, the governor’s plan is about equality—equality of access to basic services, equality of tax burdens, and ultimately, equality of opportunity for us and for the generations that follow. Given the limited burden of the tax increases and improvements to the tax code as well as the lasting impact of the governor’s proposed funding allocations, the budget offers legislators the opportunity to shape the Commonwealth’s economic future in the short-term as well as the long-term.
In the midst of a still-new and uncertain recovery, it is natural to focus only on the present, and certainly the number one priority should be ensuring that we do not slip back into a recession or into intractable debt. But it is just as vital, if not more so, that we focus on our future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This school year Harvard College completed its six-year transition to the new Program in General Education. For all undergraduate students, the Gen Ed program requires completion of a course in each of eight categories: “Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding,” “Culture and Belief,” “Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning,” “Ethical Reasoning,” “Science of Living Systems,” “Science of the Physical Universe,” “Societies of the World,” and “United States in the World.” It also requires that one of these courses engage with the study of the past. The aim of the program is to expose students to a “broad range of topics and approaches” and to connect a student’s education to “life beyond college.” Effectively, General Education is what makes Harvard a liberal arts college.
Unfortunately, the program is not succeeding in its goals. The predominant sign of this failure is the student attitude toward Gen Ed classes. Many empirical reasoning and science classes are regarded as intellectually insubstantial and are chosen solely for this reason. Humanities courses are likewise scouted for easy grading and little work. Across the board, Gen Eds are regarded as less important than concentration or elective classes. In many cases a culture develops of not doing readings and paying little attention in class. These lectures are the first to be skipped, often with couched pride after “still getting an A.” The general attitude is not of becoming educated, but simply of fulfilling requirements as efficiently as possible.
This problem goes beyond the system or implementation of the Gen Ed ideal. It is fundamentally rooted in the conflicting missions of the student body and the College. While Gen Ed aims to provide a broad and liberal education, a consumerist reality means students have an eye on attaining ends. This is especially true at a school that only accepts extremely high-achieving applicants. Students take classes with their future in mind: getting into graduate school or medical school, acquiring useful skills, fostering a resume.
If this student attitude is a modern phenomenon, it is a result of social change and transition. The importance of broad education is rooted in class traditions that once demanded students to develop a breadth of diverse knowledge. Today, the learning process is much more compartmentalized. Literature and music can be irrelevant in the life of a engineer. It is a trope that humanities majors pride themselves on their inability to perform basic science and math.
This is not to say that General Education classes never succeed. Many faculty members, inspired by the opportunity to share knowledge with a broad range of students, offer phenomenal courses through the Gen Ed program. Many students find fascination and enlightenment in fields outside their concentration. Yet there is no faith in the system.  General Education appeals to a “spirit of free inquiry undertaken without concern for topical relevance or vocational utility” and “an opportunity to learn and reflect in an environment free from most of the constraints on time and energy that operate in the rest of life.” These ideals are simply not present among the current student body.
Harvard College needs to reconsider and restructure its curriculum to provide education for a post-modern age. If it is to fulfill the needs of the students it accepts, the General Education requirement should be removed. The classes themselves should stay, but the compulsion to undertake the process of erudition for the sake of completing requirements fuels reluctance and apathy towards many Gen Ed classes. If the College wishes to effectively maintain a mandatory liberal arts curriculum it must find a way to recreate the incentive structure behind liberal arts classes by fostering an attitude toward education in line with General Education ideals. Both students and the College should be encouraged to think critically about the meaning and purpose of a so-called “general education” at Harvard.

I am the whitest kid I know. From the pale skin, to the boat shoes, to the taste for pop rock and the inability to dance. Nine times out of 10 if there’s a white guy stereotype, I fit it.
So when it comes to food, it should come as no surprise that I have the spice tolerance of a five-year-old. And I say that as an expression, since I’m sure there are five-year-olds out there who would spice me under the table (where I hide milk and yogurt for emergencies). In my mom’s culture, a cucumber sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise is the spiciest of meals, and she raised my sister and me with similar standards. Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and spaghetti featured prominently in my childhood. The likes of Thai and Indian food never crossed my culinary path until far too late. I feared spice before ever giving it a chance.
Last year, my figurative internal five-year-old figuratively grew up. It happened, as so many things do, over a blockmate lunch of red spice chicken. Considering the menu item, I had of course loaded my tray with the requisite bowl of blue cheese sauce and three glasses of milk. My friends, meanwhile, were dipping their pre-spiced chicken in other sauces—Frank’s Red Hot, Tobasco, Sriracha. They decided the chicken, which was already plenty red spiced by my standards, wasn’t quite hot enough, and were trying to determine which of the dhall’s other sauces worked best to bring the meal up to par. I couldn’t keep up.
I decided then and there that I needed to transform my taste buds, to free myself from a life of pasta and rice. Gradually, under the careful guidance of my most pro-spice friends, I began to turn up the heat.
Early training was tough. Frank’s Red Hot was deemed the least painful of the available sauces, and I began adding it to things that even I agreed were bland: macaroni and cheese, tuna fish sandwiches, french fries. I’d force myself to splash a few drops across the whole thing, mix it together until the drops couldn’t be identified (and avoided), and eat steadily, rewarding myself with milk only at the end of the plate. Though my mouth tingled for a while after each meal, I gradually developed a taste for Frank’s particular burn. The initial fiery bite brought the other flavors to life, I learned, and I found myself thinking about other things I actually wanted to add the red liquid to.
I used the same technique to introduce Tabasco and Sriracha to my palate. For any meal I thought wasn’t too spicy to begin with, I’d break out a little red bottle and, steeling myself for the now vaguely pleasurable agony ahead, splash a bit on my plate. I was making progress. My goal of being able to share spicy foods with real people was coming true faster than I could have dreamed.
I got confident in my spices, adding cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to the kit at home, adding a bit of heat to my meat and pasta dishes whenever possible. My mom, from whom I inherited my weak spice tolerance, quickly learned not to eat anything I had made for myself. Grocery shopping became a battle of wills, as I leaned for the spicier options and she pulled for the safe varieties that now tasted bland to me. It was a constant debate: tomato and basil, or arrabbiata sauce?
When I returned to school last semester, it was time to show off my newfound immunity to spicy foods. Ordering Chinese food for a late-night snack was no longer a game of accommodation, in which my friends made sure there were mild options for the pitiable Andrew. “I thought you didn’t like spicy food!” became my favorite words to hear, as I’d wolf down another bite of whatever red-tinged noodles we had ordered that night. I don’t mean to brag, but I even began asking for a couple squirts of the green sauce when visiting Felipe’s. Ladies, contain yourselves.
Of course, I can’t keep up with my roommates—they’ve been raised on spice their whole lives. I’ve improved, yes, but perhaps I haven’t been completely inoculated? I still can’t dip my Red Spice Chicken in Sriracha like they can without crying myself to sleep later that night. What’s important, however, is that I no longer need to smother each bite with blue cheese or require the aid of milk.
Now if only I could get my mom to try some pepper flakes.

There is something both timeless and eerily beautiful about arches in Safavid architecture. The elegant ogees appear in both two and three dimensions across the city of Esfahan, forming façades and domes, lining bazaars, and crisscrossing the Zayandeh Rud in the form of four stone pedestrian bridges.
Stepping onto a pedestrian bridge is always a thrill. I still remember when I first walked across the Weeks Bridge, looking at the cars on both Soldiers Field Road and Memorial Drive and thinking to myself, “I bet you wish you could use this bridge.” Where else in Boston can you see people dancing Argentine tango beneath the full moon in the spring, jumping into the river in the summer, cheering on the rowers in the fall, and quickly running across in a bundle of down in the winter?
In Esfahan, the bridges are in neither the town square nor the city center. In fact, the most famous of them was merely built as a shortcut to an Armenian suburb. Nevertheless, they remain one of the city’s primary tourist draws along with the equally arched and majestic Naqsh-e Jahan, one of the largest public squares in the world. People from all over, including my fellow travellers and myself, snap photos of the bridge during the day, exploring the ins and outs of all of the arches through the low-ceilinged passageways. But this is no Ponte Vecchio; the only businesses to be found on the bridges are a few traditional tea houses built into the stonework underneath with windows gazing out across the riverbed.
Not that the bridge needs any other businesses, as tea somehow goes perfectly with Safavid arches. In the afternoons, people sit in traditional gardens, sipping the toffee-colored liquid out of pear-shaped clear glasses. These gardens are lush with flowers, orange persimmons, and bright magenta pomegranates hanging from the trees. The fountains, pools, and channels create a soft white noise, and the welcoming comments and invitations into people’s homes for dinner come from all directions. Some streets even have a Persian garden in the median. Despite the cacophony of traffic and motorbikes, walking down the middle of Four Gardens Boulevard is oddly calming. It was a far cry from what I had seen in “Argo” 72 hours before landing in Iran.
Esfahan sleeps earlier than Tehran, except for the square and the bridge. In fact, my first encounter with the most famous, the Si-o-seh Pol, which literally means the Bridge of 33 Arches, came at midnight under the harvest moon.
It started as an evening stroll with my travel companions suffering from cabin fever after the five-hour bus ride that took us from Tehran to Esfahan. With a cool but balmy desert wind, we approached the sodium-vapor orange glow of the bridge. I was torn between wanting to take as many pictures as I could and a desire to put the camera away and simply watch the lives moving past me on quiet strolls, walks home, and the occasional romantic rendezvous at one of the few places where the young people of Esfahan feel comfortable as themselves.
The world that I found at the bridge, and indeed in all the places I visited in Iran, is not the world often depicted in the American media. Rather, it is a space where people come together to do what we might do on a balmy summer’s night in the chairs of Harvard Yard: be ourselves with the people who matter most to us.
We had seen pictures of the bridge in the spring, when nearly the entire city comes to the banks of the river to picnic and see friends during the New Year’s celebration in March. In those shots, the water reflected the glow of the lights like something out of a fairy tale, illuminating the entire length of the bridge. As we walked to the riverbank in person, though, all we could see was the dusty expanse of rocks where there should have been water. Nowadays, the river runs dry for most of the year, and several of the arches remain unlit, their lights long since burnt out.
Some say the bridge is decaying. It is built of stone after all. Some say that the less and less that the Zayandeh Rud runs, the sooner the bridges will all collapse into the riverbed, another loss of Iranian grandeur far too soon after the destruction of the historic sites of Bam in an earthquake in 2004. I like to think, though, that this dark period in the bridge’s life might be more temporary. After all, stone has proven to be a most durable building material; the fully intact ancient fortresses of Iran across the region stand as testament to the material’s longevity, as do many of Rome’s finest treasures.
We made our way quietly down to the base of the bridge and walked underneath to listen to the echo our voices made in the concave ceiling. In the nooks of the outward-facing arches we saw people relishing the beauty of the full moon and thinking about everything that surrounded them.
Then, we heard the sound of music coming from further down the bridge. We walked out from underneath the arches and followed the melody to find three young Esfahani men who were strumming a guitar and singing quietly to themselves the elegant lilt of Persian rhymes. The melody was of a minor key, and the words, my colleague told me, were about love and loss. The men were eager to include us, and one by one, the Iranians around us joined in the song, each knowing the lyrics by heart.
We all went to bed shortly thereafter. But I still hear that music every so often, though the musicians are far away. It makes me crave tea with bergamot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:30 a.m.
Residents of nine of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses can start voting at noon Wednesday to fill 13 open seats on the Harvard Undergraduate Council.
The UC holds a special election at the beginning of every spring semester for members of the UC’s Executive Board, whose terms expire in December. This particular year, however, is notable for the high number of departures by representatives choosing to pursue internships or other extracurricular activities. Voters last February only had to choose seven new representatives.
Two representatives from Quincy and one each from Mather and Kirkland chose to run for re-election after a term on the Executive Board.
Residents of Dunster and Eliot Houses will vote for two new representatives, while voters in Adams, Cabot, and Winthrop House will elect a single new representative each. All of these positions were vacated by former representatives who resigned or declined to run for re-election.
Finally, last November’s election of Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Zhu ’14 as president and vice president left positions open in Currier House and Quincy House.
The special elections in Kirkland, Currier, Adams, and Cabot are uncontested.
Despite having all three of their seats up for a vote, residents of Quincy were generally apathetic about the election, with many admitting they did not know there was going to be one. Residents of Winthrop House, which held a special election last November after two of its representatives were expelled from the UC, were similarly in the dark about the election.
“I feel like [the UC] doesn’t have a direct impact on my activities,” said Benjamin Lopez ’15, a resident of Winthrop House who said he did not know about the special election or the names of his current House representatives.
Former Dunster representative Delara Z. Alameddine ’14 and Eliot representative Terah E. Lyons ’14, both of whom declined to give phone interviews, wrote in emails to The Crimson that they decided not to continue with the UC because they did not feel comfortable splitting their attention between the organization and their other commitments.
“I thought it would be less than fair to my housemates and fellow volunteers to take on a position in the UC once again,” said Alameddine, who is the co-director of the Strong Women Strong Girls volunteer organization and was recently elected as Dunster House Committee co-chair.
“I just simply didn’t have enough time to dedicate to the administrative duties of my position and wanted to give it to someone who would be able to dedicate the time and attention that it deserved this semester,” Lyons said. “I decided to step away from the UC because the break between semesters made for a more graceful, timely exit.”
Voting closes at noon on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:26 a.m.
The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will relocate “in almost its entirety” to University-owned land in North Allston in as few as five years, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson Tuesday.
The same announcement made later that day at the monthly Faculty Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences drew sharp criticism from SEAS professors concerned about upholding an engineering education integrated with the liberal arts.
Construction on SEAS facilities in Allston is slated to begin in 2014 and should be completed near the end of 2017 or early 2018.
The administration has long eyed Allston for an expansion of science facilities and Faust pointed to rapid growth in many areas of the sciences as an opportunity for corresponding physical expansion.
She said that SEAS—“a school that reaches out to other schools”—was also an ideal fit for Allston because of its collaborative nature. Moving across the river, she said, will facilitate connections between SEAS and other Harvard facilities, such as Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and the I-Lab, a center in Allston dedicated to student entrepreneurship.
“We think it can be a kind of generator, a hub, for spokes that will go out and reach to other key nodes of academic pursuit as they are established in Allston,” Faust said.
But SEAS professors expressed concerns at Tuesday’s meeting that moving to Allston would sever other important ties in Cambridge.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 first announced the move to the SEAS faculty last Tuesday, professors said at the meeting, and the information was unexpected. The “Allston bomb,” said Robert D. Howe, area dean for bioengineering, generated as much discussion “as if [Garber] had dropped a literal bomb.”
Many SEAS faculty members hold joint appointments with FAS and were worried that moving across the river would compromise SEAS’s interdisciplinary endeavors.
“I believe that should we be transported across the river, our model—our paradigm, really—cannot work,” said Steven C. Wofsy, area dean for environmental science and engineering.
Area dean for computer science Michael D. Mitzenmacher identified this “paradigm” as “an engineering school embedded in a liberal arts education.” Transplanting SEAS to Allston, he said, might discourage professors committed to that core mission.
“How can we maintain engineering being a part of the liberal arts education when we are going to be separated from the rest of the College?” he said.
Faculty members met the announcement with a range of largely “unexcited to hostile” reactions, Mitzenmacher said.
Garber said at the meeting that SEAS’s move represents only the first phase of long-term development in Allston.
“I don’t want to sugarcoat what is going to be a very involved process, but I also don’t want anyone to forget the terrific opportunity ahead,” he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Faust told The Crimson that while the move might be difficult in the short term, its long-term effects are worth it.
“I think change is always challenging,” she said. “People feel, ‘Oh my gosh, my life has been one way, my life will be another way once this plan goes into effect.’ But we’re excited about it.”
In 2003, the University announced its intention to build a science center and undergraduate housing complex across the Charles River from Cambridge and relocate the School of Public Health and Graduate School of Education to Allston, but the economic crisis in 2008 halted construction.
Last October, Harvard submitted plans for the land to Boston City Hall that were much less ambitious and designed for a 10-year rather than 30 to 50-year time frame.
Though the post-recession science complex design is less expensive than its predecessor, Faust told The Crimson in July that it would be a priority for Harvard’s impending capital campaign.
On Tuesday, she said that continuing financial pressure prevents planning new development too far in advance,
“We want to think about programming in smaller chunks... and really drill down on those opportunities,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For over a decade, aspiring physicians and public health scientists have been sitting in bricks-and-mortar classrooms to take a Harvard course called “Human Health and Global Environmental Change.”
This semester, for the first time, students sitting in front of computer screens across the globe will have the chance to take the class free of charge.
The new online version of the class, PH278x: “Human Health and Global Environmental Change,” will be offered this spring through edX, the online education platform launched by Harvard and MIT last May.
PH278x is the second School of Public Health class to be offered through edX. Last fall, in the first semester of edX, PH207x: “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research” boasted an enrollment of over 50,000 students.
PH278x will be co-taught by Aaron S. Bernstein, pediatrics instructor at Harvard Medical School, and John D. Spengler, professor of environmental health and human habitation at the School of Public Health.
“The goal of the class is to help students understand that when we alter the planet’s climate or dramatically change the way life on the planet lives, those actions have direct effects on the ability of humans to lead healthy lives,” Bernstein said. “There is a tremendous knowledge gap around the world on these issues, and the opportunity to provide a free resource to people all over the world is immense.”
PH278x has branched beyond the scope of Harvard’s campus before. In the past, course lectures have been recorded and distributed to hundreds of students in other medical school and public health universities. But Bernstein said the leap to virtual education will present new challenges, including the difficult task of assessing whether students are actually learning online.
Bernstein said that PH278x, along with other non-quantitative courses offered through edX for the first time this semester, “will be real tests of pushing past what this platform is capable of.”
The PH278x team has been discussing the idea of filming footage outside the classroom to be used in the course. For example, to complement his discussion of the globalized food industry, Bernstein said he might take a camera to the grocery store to document the components of a meal.
“We’re thinking of the life cycle of each of those goods on a larger scale and what that means for sustainability for food consumption,” Bernstein said. “Using those real world experiences—something you wouldn’t be able to do in the classroom—can really bring those ideas home. EdX is a great vehicle to have that conversation with.”

When CB22x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” debuts as one of edX’s first humanities courses this spring, the class will face an entirely new set of challenges than those faced by its quantitative predecessors.
CB22x, the online version of professor Gregory Nagy’s long-running course on ancient Greek heroes, will reach an anticipated audience of 40,000 when it starts this spring as part of edX, the online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT.
“Because we are a humanities course, what we need is a kind of variation of the Socratic method,” Nagy said. “Dialogue is more important than getting X amount of information uploaded at any given moment.”
Departing from the structure of his lecture course, Nagy will conduct dialogues with colleagues about the course’s assigned reading.
To encourage a more interactive experience, a technological development to facilitate private and public commentary is being developed for the class, which, according to Nagy, is the College’s longest continuously running course.
“We’re building a massive annotation tool, which will allow students to comment on any portion of course material, including video, audio, images, and text,” said Jeff Emanuel, HarvardX fellow for the study of the humanities.
Through the tool, students will be able to make private comments, which can be exported as course notes. They will also be able to respond to forum discussions.
According to Emanuel, 14,000 students have already enrolled in CB22x and participation is expected to triple. To accommodate the high enrollment, the CB22x team has been working with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Registrar to recruit past teaching fellows and students to serve as mentors for a “Board of Readers.”
Nagy said having mentors who have already taken the course and done the readings will greatly improve the experience of students who have not previously been exposed to the analysis of classic literature.
“The more people you have there, the more individual interaction you can have. [Having that] is obviously a challenge in a massive, open online course,” Emanuel said.
Although still in the development process, another technological tool will allow instructors to graphically see how the course is engaging participants at a macro level. Instructors will be able to see correlations between demographic characteristics and students’ analysis of the text, according to Claudia P. Filos, the course’s content editor.
CB22x will focus on analyzing ancient Greek texts, including Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Additionally, students will have free access to the electronic version of Nagy’s new textbook, “The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours.”
“It’s not for money. It’s a labor of love,” Nagy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of student and faculty presenters from the Boston area advocated investing in the brainpower of the Greece’s citizens to improve the troubled country’s economic outlook at an event Tuesday evening.
The Harvard College Hellenic Society and the MIT Hellenic Students’ Association sponsored the forum entitled “Repowering Greece: The Most Innovative Ways to Revamp Greece.” The symposium was co-sponsored by the RepowerGreece campaign, an international initiative to promote Greece.
The eight speakers, selected from many students and faculty throughout Boston, shared their solutions to the situation in a TED Talk-like format. Ideas ranged from advising that Greece set up a social media platform to match supply and demand for day-to-day services to suggesting that Greece invest more in mobile technology to better capitalize on tourism, its main industry.
“The real gold mine for Greece is in its people’s intellect,” said Nicholas Ashford, professor of technology and policy at MIT, who criticized Greece’s current operation to establish a gold mine in its northern regions. “We’re going in the wrong direction.”
Harvard students Paul P. Stavropoulos ’13 and Maria N. Theophanous ’13 echoed the same sentiment by applying an economic model to demonstrate the importance of innovation to Greece’s economic growth.
“Innovation is the best way for Greece to have a long-term and sustainable growth process,” said Theophanous, before revealing that Greece is ranked 146 out of 150 countries in the world as the best place to start a business. The United States, on the other hand, is ranked 13.
Ioannis Simaiakis, a McKinsey and Company management consultant with a Ph.D. from MIT, also compared the U.S. to Greece and proposed an explanation as to why the two differed greatly. Greece, he said, took a “shortcut” to the path of sustainability. According to Simaiakis, Greece had hoped to instill values by focusing its attention on its institutions and policies rather than creating values of its people.
Citing Ashford’s previous statement on the importance of self-discovery in Greece, Simaiakis agreed that a social transformation was greatly needed to improve the country.

Student activists and members of Harvard’s various unions gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall Tuesday to show their support for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers during what have become the longest contract negotiations between the University and HUCTW in history.
Tuesday’s showing was the fifth time over the past three weeks that workers have amassed in front of the building that houses senior administrators like University President Drew G. Faust. Union members have said they will continue to stand in front of Mass. Hall every Tuesday and Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. until the negotiations are resolved.
HUCTW represents more than 4,600 members of Harvard’s non-faculty staff. The previous contract between the union and the University expired July 1 of last year.
Although negotiations over a new contract began last spring, the two sides have yet to reach an agreement.
The current negotiations are the longest in HUCTW’s history. The second longest began in 1992, when the contract between HUCTW and Harvard expired on June 30 of that year and a new agreement was not ratified until January 1993.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that he is optimistic about the potential impact of the demonstrations in front of Mass. Hall on current negotiations, and hopes they encourage the Harvard community to engage in the discussion.
“When Harvard changes in one direction or another, it’s usually, more than anything, because there is a strong will of a broad-based community to go in a new direction,” he said.
A University spokesperson wrote in an email that Harvard’s focus is currently on the ongoing contract negotiations.
“We certainly recognize the union’s right to public protest, but our focus at the moment is on seeking a fair and constructive resolution through mediation, a process mutually agreed upon and announced with the union,” wrote the spokesperson.
Salary increases have been the largest source of conflict in the negotiation. Some protesters have claimed that the proposed increases to their salaries do not meet the rising cost of living­—a claim disputed by the University.
“We are confident that our wage proposals, which have consistently been well above local inflation, are both fair and competitive,” wrote the University spokesperson.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average inflation rate for all urban wage earners and clerical workers in Boston was 1.6 percent in 2012. In September, the University proposed a 2.8 percent increase to workers’ wages during the first year of a three-year offer, according to an email from Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann published on Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations website. Under that plan, wages would then grow by 2.5 percent in the second year and 2 percent in the third.
Jaeger said he thinks that the changes in salary for the University’s workers that have been proposed thus far are not enough, despite Harvard’s claims that its wage increases are on par with national standards.
He said he hopes the “symbolic” location of the demonstrations in front of Mass. Hall will help the union convey its message.
“We’re having an interaction with senior administrators by being there,” said Jaeger. “It’s not more than a nod or a smile or a quick word, but for [those] who work there to be reminded consistently that there are important questions that a lot of people feel strongly about is important to us also.”

UPDATE: February 7, 2013, at 7:13 a.m.
In the midst of a nationwide drop in the number of law school applications, Harvard Law School did not see the same dramatic decrease in its application numbers this year that it has in past cycles, according to the school’s Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02.
As of Jan. 25, the number of law school applicants nationwide this year had decreased by 20.4 percent, according to the Law School Admission Council.
“For the past two cycles, we experienced a decline that was similar to the decline in the national pool, but this cycle is shaping up very differently,” Soban wrote in an email.
Although applications to the Law School were due last Friday, Feb. 1, Soban said she could not release the number of applicants for this cycle until the fall.
Last year, the Law School witnessed a 14.6 percent decline in applications, a drop that followed a 16.4 percent decrease from 2010 to 2011. Both dips in application numbers were in line with a trend experienced at law schools nationwide.
This nationwide pattern might be in part caused by the increasingly competitive nature of the job market for law school graduates.
“It’s been a flooded market for a long time, but it’s taken a while for that fact to be brought to the surface,” said Jay Donde, a student at the Law School.
But while concern over the job market has plagued students at law schools across the country, employment rates for Harvard Law School graduates have remained somewhat constant over the past 20 years, according to Soban. For the past three years, the Law School’s after-graduation employment rate has been about 95 percent.
Kyle P. Elder, a student at Harvard Law School, said that while students might not get their first choice of jobs, Harvard graduates can depend on having options for employment.
“Harvard’s Harvard, so you’re always going to be able to get a job,” Elder said.
Beyond apprehension over employment prospects, students said potential law school applicants may worry about being able to pay back student loans as law school tuition rates increase nationwide.
“[Not including] the top tier of law schools, it’s a lot harder to get a job that can offset the cost of going to school,” said So J. Kim, a student at the Law School.
Harvard Law School has attempted to counteract the often off-putting cost of getting a degree, increasing the total financial aid offered by the school by 50 percent over the past five years, mostly through loan repayment assistance and support for public service careers.

After a fall semester that saw College students vote in support of a social choice fund and the University announce its plans to create one, Kennedy School students will vote next week on a referendum calling for Harvard to demonstrate a financial commitment to the new fund.
The student referendum, which will be voted on next Monday and Tuesday, will be the first ever held at the Kennedy School, according to organizers. It was proposed by a group of students in Responsible Investment @ HKS, an offshoot of the larger Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.
The referendum asks that the University allocate .1 percent—approximately $30 million—of its $30.7 billion endowment to seed Harvard’s social choice fund, which will be launched on July 1.
Administrators have said that the new fund will offer donors an opportunity to support the University through channels that account for social responsibility, but they have not indicated whether the University will contribute any existing funds from its endowment to the new social choice fund.
Kennedy School student David J. Garfunkel, a member of the responsible investment initiative, said he believes it is important for the University to jumpstart the fund with a substantial initial investment to ensure its longevity.
“The idea of the social choice fund is to show that using responsible investment criteria, we can generate returns in order to contribute to the important work that the University is doing while at the same time upholding our values as a University,” Garfunkel said.
Alexander “Alexi” White, a Kennedy School student and member of the initiative’s leadership team, said the referendum is intended to show that the call for socially responsible investment reaches beyond the College.
White said he is confident that the referendum will pass, calling it a unifying issue within a diverse school.
“This issue touches on everything,” White said.
Ten percent of students must sign a petition in order for a student-launched referendum to land on the ballot at the Kennedy School. That plurality—100 students among the approximately 1,000 who attend the Kennedy School—has been surpassed since the group began circulating the petition after the winter recess.
“The general feeling is that everybody is very supportive of the measure,” Garfunkel said.
If the referendum passes, the group will try to form a coalition of graduate students across the University in support of responsible investment, Garfunkel said.
The referendum question will share ballot space with the candidates seeking office in the Kennedy School student government.
None of the candidates has taken a stance on the issue, Garfunkel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just two periods of play, Harvard women’s ice hockey goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer had already set a new personal best. Through 30 minutes of play, the freshman had made 25 saves against No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot on Tuesday. The No. 5 Crimson went on to lose the contest, 2-1, to the Eagles at Matthews Arena.
Maschmeyer, who has played in 12 games this season, finished with 34 saves on the night and a save-percentage of .944. Her two misses came in the third period. With just under thirteen minutes left in the contest, Boston College forward Emily Field handed off the puck to freshman Dana Trivigno, who drilled in a goal from the left circle over Maschmeyer. Nine minutes later, junior forward Taylor Wasylk received a pass from defenseman Lexi Bender for a quick goal.
The rookie had registered her previous high in saves, 22, at Clarkson, where the Crimson fell, 3-1.
Maschmeyer’s tally of 34 exceeds co-captain Laura Bellamy’s season-high of 30, achieved twice this year, in wins at Quinnipiac on Oct. 26 and St. Lawrence on Jan. 26.
“The team played really well in front of me,” Maschmeyer said. “I think as a whole, in the game in general, everyone played really well, just a couple of big breakdowns. When we need to get something done, we just have to get it done. We can’t hold back, we just have to go for it.”
POWER [PLAY] FAILURE
Harvard received three power play opportunities and was unable to convert on each.
“We had some good looks on our power play,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “The goaltender played very well in front of them. It’s very difficult to score a power play so you want to get good looks at the net. I thought we moved the puck well.”
Harvard posts a power play percentage of 17.8 for the season, having scored 13 goals off 73 opportunities.
The team received its first chance 11:18 into the first period off a penalty on Eagles co-captain Blake Bolden for checking. While the two-minute man-advantage saw the Crimson win four face-offs and take three shots, it was unable to yield a goal.
A second window opened in the second stanza, when Boston College forward Meagan Mangene was sent to the box for checking. Eagles goaltender Corinne Boyles made four saves throughout the power play off shots from Harvard forwards junior Lyndsey Fry, co-captain Jillian Dempsey and sophomore Hillary Crowe, while additional shots from Fry and sophomore defenseman Sarah Edney went wide.
The third power play proved to be just as futile as after Bolden was flagged for hooking, the Crimson failed to reach the back of net on six attempts.
“It’s a great opportunity if you get a goal, but the good news is we were able to get one [goal] five on five,” Stone said. “Unfortunately, we did not stave off the pressure.”

Freshman forward Mary Parker scored her fourth goal of the season and the first of the game. She took three shots in the contest and found success nearly five minutes into the final frame.
Parker fed a pass to junior forward Gina McDonald, who slammed the puck into the goal. Boyles deflected the shot but Parker was there for a second chance. McDonald and Crowe came through for the hand-off and Parker was able to evade Boyles for the goal at the 4:52 mark.
Parker, whose older sister Elizabeth is a junior defenseman, also found the most success winning face-offs on the night. The forward won a team-high six face-offs, dropping only two.
Overall, Harvard trailed Boston College in face-offs, winning 24 to the Eagles’ 30. Boston College forward Alex Carpenter was the overall leader in face-offs, capturing 16.
“I think it was one of the best games [Parker] played tonight,” Stone said. “She played with a lot of grit and she had some jump in her step. She was good around the net and that’s how she got the goal on the second opportunity. She’s a good face-off player and so that was a big piece of it for us today. ”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-eight was the number of the night as Harvard men’s volleyball team hitters junior Nick Madden and freshman Branden Clemens combined for that many kills in a victory over Rivier College, 3-1, at the Malkin Athletic Center on Tuesday. The Raiders (2-3) were held to 28 kills as a team.
Rivier pushed the Crimson (5-2, 1-1 EIVA) to four sets, taking the second set, 18-25.
Harvard has not had a three set sweep since blanking Saint Francis on Jan. 25, four games ago.
“We had three weekends in a row that were away, so that was hard,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “We were a little tired, but we love playing at home. Hopefully we’ll get better each time.”
Clemens and Madden led the team offensively, while in a true team effort junior Michael Owen went for nine kills and sophomore Caleb Zimmick added eight.
For the second straight game, Clemens registered 27 total attacks but tallied six more errors that his last attempt, with eight on the night.
“It was really cool to play at home,” Clemens said. “It’s crazy that I’m here. I’m so excited to be starting and the team was really excited about it. It was a good feeling.”
The first set opened with the teams answering each other’s scores until Harvard pulled away, 8-5, with a service error off Raiders’ middle hitter Aaron Alamario and attack errors from junior middle hitter Terence Matall as well as freshman outside hitter Chris Markuson.
While Rivier climbed within two, the Crimson went on a 7-1 run to widen the lead, 18-10.
Assisted by several more attack errors, Clemens, Zimmick, and Madden pitched in kills to close out the set in Harvard’s favor, 25-15.
While the first set saw the Crimson hold a firm lead, the Raiders climbed atop in the second stanza. Three attack errors by Clemens and one by Owen allowed Rivier to lead Harvard, 8-3, early in the set.
The Crimson never fell into sync, dropping the set, 25-18. Their hitting percentage was stifled to .069.
“In the second, we weren’t passing well and we were hitting even worse,” Clemens said. “We kind of fell apart compared to what we were playing like in the first set. It was definitely just on our side of the court.”
Although Harvard held itself to six errors in the first and third sets and five in the final frame, 11 errors crept up on the Crimson in the second set.
The Raiders committed just one error in its victorious second stanza, yet creep up to 10 and then nine in successive frames.
“We were just making too many errors in the second,” Baise explained. “It’s really hard to win a volleyball game when you help the other team that much. We do this every day in practice, and we understand what it takes, so we were able to get a little better in the next two games.”
Returning to the floor for the third set, Harvard pushed Rivier’s kill percentage below zero to -.111. The Crimson jumped to an early advantage off attack errors from the Raiders, coming to lead, 10-3.
While Rivier trailed by as much as 12 in the middle of the stanza and it closed out just seven points under Harvard, 25-18.
“We talked in between the games, told ourselves we needed to focus,” Clemens said. “Then we collected ourselves and knew what we had to do, and we just cleaned ourselves up.”
The Raiders persisted through the fourth and final set, trading points and staying within five until a kill off Zimmick, handed off from senior setter Rob Lothman, took the Crimson to top its opponents, 19-14.
Eight more rallies, five of which were served off Zimmick, let Harvard close the contest, 25-16.
Lothman dominated his role at the net, doling out 46 of the 51 assists for the night.
“We’ll take the win,” Baise said. “I didn’t think we played particularly well. We were pretty sloppy in almost every part of the game. But these guys have shown that they’re finding a way to win, which is great, but we still have a lot to work on.”
The Crimson squad has lost just six games at the MAC since 2011 and the win was the third successful home opener for Harvard.
“We just need to stay focused and make sure that we don’t mentally get down on ourselves like we did,” Clemens said. “We just need to stay positive and make sure that we do what we need to be doing on our side of the court. The results will come from there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a game full of big plays and even bigger stops, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team went up against No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the 35th Annual Beanpot Tournament.
“Massive defensive zone breakdowns in the third period killed us,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Otherwise, it was a pretty good game. We did a lot of things really well.”
The final of three third period goals proved to be the difference as Harvard fell at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena by a final score of 2-1.
“When we needed to we didn’t take care of our own end,” Stone said. “It cost us big. You can’t afford that against good teams.”
The decisive goal came off the stick of Taylor Wasylk, who was able to get behind the defense and knock it through freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer’s pads.
“I saw an opening and went to the net,” Wasylk said. “Lexi [Bender] made an awesome play and hit me. I didn’t even know it was coming. It just kind of hit my stick and went in.”
Despite chances in the first two periods, the Crimson was unable to put one in the net.
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey came close, though, at the end of both periods. With less than 60 seconds left in the first, Dempsey shot a high attempt at net that was put aside by Eagles goaltender Corrine Boyles.
At the end of the second, a leading pass found a streaking Dempsey who, all alone, couldn’t slide it past Boyles. Boyles finished with 40 saves on the night.
On the other end on the ice, Maschmeyer had a career high 34 saves of her own. Both goalies had shutouts going well into the third.
Maschmeyer’s previous two games against ranked opponents, No. 2 Cornell and No. 9 Northeastern, ended in a pair of 3-1 victories.
The first converted opportunity in Tuesday’s contest came when junior forward Gina McDonald collected a puck behind the goal and sent it along to freshman forward Mary Parker, who was able to collect her own rebound and send it barreling into the back of the net. The goal was Parker’s fourth of the season.
Less than three minutes later, Boston College answered with some pretty passing of its own and put Dana Trivigno in the perfect position to slap the puck over Maschmeyer’s pads.
The night concluded Harvard’s longest scoring drought of the year. Going back to the last two periods of Friday’s game against Dartmouth, the squad went four frames without punching one past an opposing goaltender.
Despite amassing a combined nine shots, the Crimson failed to convert on three power play opportunities.
In the second, Parker sent one across the lip of the goal to set up sophomore forward Hilary Crowe, who was then stoned by an acrobatic right pad save.
The team’s next chance came as the result of a hooking infraction. During the man-advantage, Harvard rattled off five shots including a misdirection behind the net that almost got past Boyles.
“We had some good looks on our power play,” Stone said. “[Boyles] played very well in front of them.”
On the other end, the Crimson denied what would have been a strength-on-strength match-up by not conceding a penalty.
Harvard leads the country on the penalty kill, while the Eagles hold the nation’s second best power play.
Both squads were disciplined in their shooting lanes. The Crimson managed 14 blocked shots to Boston College’s 11, while Harvard had a harder time putting the puck on target, sailing a total of 18 shots wide.
Despite leading all skaters with nine shots, Dempsey finished with no goals or assists. The game was only the third of the season in which Dempsey failed to earn a point.
“I think we’ll think about this until midnight and we’ll take all the good stuff with us,” Dempsey said. “In the end, we’re going to have to get more gritty and grind those games out.”
Looking forward, the team plays Yale and Brown at home this weekend before meeting the loser of Boston University and Northeastern in the consolation game.
“From here on out you’re going to see us tougher in those situations,” Dempsey said. “We’re going to be tough to play against.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team got off to a rough start in its home contest against Dartmouth on Jan. 26, ending the first half down by nine after a 7-for-21 shooting effort. The only thing preventing the team from being blown out on its home floor was the performance of sophomore forward Jonah Travis.
The Minneapolis, Minn., native came up big for the Crimson in its second straight Ivy contest against the Big Green, shooting four-for-five from the field in the opening frame and seven-for-nine on the night. And while late-game heroics came from a variety of places, particularly co-captain Christian Webster, Travis’s offensive presence was consistent throughout the game.
“He’s what we refer to as a ‘bring your lunch pail, roll up your sleeves, put your hard hat on’ kind of guy,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “And our program needs that. He brings that for our team whether he’s starting or coming off the bench. That’s been his role, doing a lot of the dirty work for our team.”
Travis has been a constant performer for the Crimson so far this season. But just a year ago, the sophomore would not have pictured himself as such a key piece of the Harvard lineup.
“I knew that it would be a bigger role than last year, but I had no idea by how much,” Travis said. “If you would have told me, I probably wouldn’t have believed you. But I really worked hard this summer just so when an opportunity presented itself, like when the season came, I wouldn’t be knocked back on my heels.”
Standing at just 6’6,” Travis is an unlikely candidate for starting center in a Division I program. But nonetheless, he has stepped into a starting role that last year was filled in large part by former Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright, who stands at a still moderately sized 6’8.”
Last season, Travis saw an average of 6.5 minutes per game in the post for a then-veteran Crimson squad that had graduated a total of zero seniors from arguably the best team in program history up to that point, fresh off of a share of Harvard’s first Ivy title in program history.
Despite Travis’s solid rookie campaign, the move to center this season—where Travis played throughout high school—came as a bit of a surprise.
“I wasn’t expecting to play center coming to college,” Travis said. “But if that’s where the team needs me to go, if it’s going to be the best route for our team having success, then I’m all for it.”
So far, Amaker seems to agree. While Travis contributed a solid 2.4 points and 1.7 rebounds per game as a freshman on the way to Harvard’s second straight Ancient Eight crown, his presence has been felt to an even greater degree this season. In 2012-13, Travis’s numbers—4.1 rebounds and 8.9 points per game on a league-best 61.8 percent shooting—speak volumes to the improvements he has made in one year.
According to Travis, despite being undersized for his position, he has been able to capitalize on his strengths—particularly when underestimated by his opponents.
“What I lack in size and maybe overall weight and height, I think I can make up for in just working hard and my footwork and trying to position myself in the right places so that I can be successful,” Travis said. “I have to end up playing a lot smarter just to kind of make up for what I don’t exactly have physically [in some] matchups. I know I always have to try to be in the right position, or I’m usually going to get burned.”
Travis also noted that the transition back to center forced him to work on new aspects of his game, adding additional challenges he did not face before college.
“I get a lot of slower guys on me, so I can always just sprint to the ball and roll hard to the basket,” he said. “I have to work on that because it doesn’t come naturally to me. In high school, I could just chill right in the lane and ask for the ball. I wasn’t used to sprinting all across the court, setting ball screens and everything, because we never set ball screens in high school.”
After seeing non-trivial minutes off the bench in the Crimson’s first few contests, Travis earned his first collegiate start on Dec. 4 in a 79-63 victory over Boston College. Travis did not miss a shot in the contest, converting on all five of his field goal attempts and going four-for-four from the line.
“We decided to make changes in our lineup back when we played over at Boston College,” Amaker said. “We talked about practices being open, with opportunities for players who wanted to start. Jonah gives us an edge, he gives us a toughness that we need, and he’s earned that [role].”
Since then, Travis has started each of Harvard’s 11 contests, helping his team to a 9-3 record during that time. With that larger on-court responsibility, he has also taken on more of a leadership role on the youthful Harvard team.
“I think [our youth] has forced a lot of people to step up,” Travis said. “They might not have thought they were going to or that they had no idea that they were going to be thrust into this position so soon, but I think everyone’s responded really well.”
“[Being more vocal on the court] was kind of not something I expected but something I was willing to embrace,” he continued. “I didn’t think I was going to be the one having to yell at people or trying to communicate as much as I am, but I’ve been trying to embrace it as much as I can.”
Despite a few blips on its non-conference record, Harvard sits at an impressive 4-0 in league play—and, along with Princeton, is one of just two teams undefeated thus far in Ivy contests. And though Travis has found increased success down low, he admits that much work remains to be done if the team hopes to accomplish its goals.
“Collectively, our goal is to make it to the tournament and advance,” Travis said. “If that’s not our goal, and that’s not on the forefront of our mind going into every day of practice and every day when we go to work out, it’s a waste of time being here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Kyle Walczak’s house sits a brick. But this is no ordinary brick, given to no ordinary high school student. In the summer of 2011, Walczak attended 4th and 1, a football camp designed to help underprivileged high school football players improve skills both on and off the field. The brick, a memento that Walczak received from his time at the camp last year, symbolizes more than just time spent at a summer camp, however.
“At camp, we talk a lot about this concept of building a wall, one brick at a time,” says executive director of 4th and 1 and Harvard Law School alum Vivian Chum. “It’s from a Will Smith interview about how his father tore down a wall and made Will Smith and his brother rebuild it one brick at a time. In his life, he thinks about his success by laying down a brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid, one brick at a time. We talk about, every single time, moving towards a bigger goal by laying down that brick.”
In a letter that Walczak wrote to the camp, he talked of the hardships he was going through at home: “I look at my brick often because we recently lost our house because my dad lost his job. I brought my brick to my mom’s home and told her that this is my foundation, [this will] keep me strong. She will not let me down. Just as 4th and 1 did not let me down.”
For Walczak and countless other high schoolers who may never have the chance to attend an expensive football camp, 4th and 1 has made a huge impact. Along with training from former NFL players and college football coaches, the camp—held yearly in Michigan and Texas—provides guidance in areas in which ordinary football camps may lack, such as SAT preparation and resume writing.
“It pretty much changed my entire life,” says 4th and 1 student athlete Trey Rivera. “Before I hit 4th and 1, I didn’t care about school. I thought it was a waste of time, honestly, but when I started to get more into [the camp], I started realizing that it’s not all about football; you’re going to get tests if you keep playing. What it showed me was that people care about you, and they want you to pass.”
But Rivera and Walczak might never have gotten this opportunity if two law school alums hadn’t had a chance meeting years after their graduation.
ROOTS IN CAMBRIDGE
Daron Roberts didn’t have a typical start to his career. After graduating from the Kennedy School and the Law School, Roberts decided to pursue a different passion—football.
“It was in the summer of 2006, when after working in a couple of law firm jobs, some buddies of mine from my high school football playing days asked me to travel with them in working football camps,” Roberts said. “I did, and I had the best time of my life…. That experience re-ignited my love for football, so I decided to graduate from the law school in June of ’07 and pursue a career in coaching.”
Roberts did just that, taking an internship with the Kansas City Chiefs before becoming an assistant coach with the Detroit Lions. It was during his time in Detroit that Chum, writing a feature for ESPN, interviewed Roberts, her former floormate in Ames Hall at the Law School.
“He started telling me about his vision for a camp and really from there, it kind of grew out of our discussion,” Chum said. “For a while, when we were developing the idea for this camp, we had phone calls almost every single night, and we just talked about the things we wanted to have at this camp. That was early 2010, and then by July 2010, we had a camp. It was very much that once we had an idea, we had to do it.”
Roberts and his sister had previously run a similar camp in Texas, The Next Page, that provided standardized preparation for 15 at-risk minority students, so the idea of running a camp in his hometown in the Lone Star State wasn’t a foreign one.
“I thought about combining the philosophy, the mission of The Next Page with football to create a football camp that would include life skills development, SAT and ACT preparation, as well as football skills training, and I went to the same community college where my sister and I had founded The Next Page,” Roberts said. “I went to the board and asked for funding to start a one-week program in which we’d be preparing 30 at-risk students from the East Texas area. The board approved the measure, and we had our first camp in Mount Pleasant, Texas, in the summer of 2010.”
MORE THAN FOOTBALL
For one week each summer, 40 high school students, ranging from rising sophomores to rising seniors, pour onto the campuses of Northeast Texas Community College and Michigan State University, ready to learn new football skills from experts in the sport.
But to advertise this camp as purely a football camp, free to all of its attendants, would be incorrect.
“For us, the football is kind of the draw,” Chum said. “It is a fun part of the camp, but really we’re only on the field for a couple of hours a day. What we do emphasize is the teamwork and the discipline, those elements of sports that help you be successful, and we transfer that into the classrooms, so in the classroom, if student athletes are having difficulty understanding concepts, we may have someone talk about it in the context of football.”
For Rivera, football enticed him to apply, but he quickly found that there was more to the camp than just the sport.
“We were looking for a football camp,” Rivera said. “We didn’t have money to go to a football camp because there were some very expensive camps. I found 4th and 1, and it was pretty great when I found it. I’m just in love with football, but it was also about the SAT. When I was there and didn’t know something, they were there to help me. They give you the skills to do what you need to do to get to college, and it was such a wonderful experience to actually see people who care about you from all across the country.”
From about 200 applicants to the Texas camp, 4th and 1 accepts roughly 40 students who show “promise,” according to Roberts.
“Our philosophy is that the top football players in the country are accounted for in the system because of their athletic talent,” Roberts says. “It’s the student athlete with the average football skills, average academic skills, so we’re searching for the “average”-type student, and with a disadvantaged background, whether it be coming from a single home or part of a minority group, we want those kids to come. We want the camp to serve as a boost that will propel them into their senior year and also into their undergraduate career.”
The camp day begins with football practice in the morning, followed by a variety of workshops and SAT preparation classes led by volunteers and teachers, many of whom are Harvard alums or undergraduates.
“It is amazing to see the students progress through the week each year,” says Daniel Adler ’10, SAT Director for 4th and 1. “Most of their parents aren’t as savvy about the college admissions process as most Harvard students’ parents are, so they really have to do a lot more stuff on their own. So it’s very fulfilling to try to help them out to try to give them some of the advantages that I was lucky to have growing up.”
INTO THE FUTURE
The camp offers not only guidance to its attendees, but a lifelong personal connection to 4th and 1’s directors and volunteers.
“Each counselor takes a handful of students that they’re supposed to keep in touch with during the year, but it’s a two-way street,” Adler said. “Sometimes the counselors could probably do a little better job, sometimes the students could do a little better job, but we’re working on keeping that communication open throughout the year so it’s not just a one-week camp and then they forget about it for the next 51 weeks, and then they show up again.”
The brains behind the program are also working to expand and improve upon 4th and 1 in hopes to better the effects of the curriculum on its campers.
“I introduced [the Jacksonville Jaguars] owners to the camp,” Adler said. “From day one, when I started talking to the Jaguars about this job, my boss [Tony Khan] came across 4th and 1, and he was immediately really interested. When I came on as a secondary thing to my real job, we had talked about trying to launch 4th and 1 here in Jacksonville.”
The plans for the camp in Jacksonville include practice SAT tests on Saturdays and team-donated tickets to the Jaguars’ games on Sundays for the campers. The hope is that these efforts would maximize participation throughout the year rather than limiting the program to a summer schedule.
The camp in Jacksonville will also be unique in that the team will actually provide all of the funds to sustain the program.
“Last year, the Jaguars donated a bunch of shirts,” Adler said. “This year, with the camp in Jacksonville, they would be funding the entire thing.”
The program’s directors also look to increase participation from volunteers, recruiting from 4th and 1’s strong alumni network.
“Now that we have a significant pool of alumni, we are starting to integrate the alumni into our programming for the summer,” Roberts said. “We’re bringing our alumni back, and they are now helping to lead some of the writing courses, they’re helping to provide our current 4th and 1 student athletes with tasks such as crafting a resume, so we’re now cultivating futures within the program among the student athletes who can return and help the younger generation.”
Because 4th in 1 is such a new program, the directors and volunteers will be the first to admit that the past couple years have been a gradual learning experience, with each new year’s success surpassing the last.
“I feel like the camp is really growing and developing and becoming better as we all grow and develop and become better,” Chum said. “At the very end, we focus on, from here, what are you going to do? How are you going to stay in touch with your mentors? What are you going to commit yourself to in the year ahead?”

Hasty Pudding Theatricals has finally picked a Man of the Year for 2013, and it's the guy who played Jack Bauer on Fox's "24" (also known to some diehard, know-it-all fans as Kiefer Sutherland).
Once you've learned how to spell his name (we at Flyby recommend that you do this ahead of time so you can immediately tweet any spottings on Friday. Luckily the "i" before "e" rule holds true here), you may want to know a few more things about the enigmatic Canadian star.
Herewith, four things you didn't know about Sutherland, the male recipient of the Hasty Pudding's highest annual honor:
1. In 1991, he almost married Julia Roberts. Roberts, incidentally, was the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 1997 Woman of the Year Award. The greatest power couple never to walk down the aisle? Probably not. A fun coincidence? Definitely.
2. He starred in character as Bauer in a series of Japanese commercials for the nutritional supplement CalorieMate. As these commercials make clear, he does not speak Japanese.
3. He's an honest tweeter, even if that makes for lackluster tweets. Last February, he tweeted, "Don't have anything clever to say (not that I ever have) but having a great day & hope you are too!" So heartfelt and real!
4. He's no stranger to The Crimson. According to a Crimson review of the 2006 film "The Wild," an animated Disney film in which Sutherland voiced the part of Samson (protaganist and lion), "It could be said that Kiefer Sutherland is the next Sean Connery, albeit of a lesser talent than the legendary Scot."
Two years later, FM urged him to give up alcohol for lent.
Welcome back, old friend.

Is this you in class? Are you wishing that you hadn't taken those three Gen Eds? If you're having second thoughts about your course selections, Flyby has you covered. We've gone through the course catalogue and picked out some of the strangest classes offered this spring. The descriptions below are our best guesses of what these Gen Eds (plus a bonus Applied Physics course) might have to offer.
 
Fat Chance (Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 14)
Flyby Course Description: Is this serious? Fat chance. Bad puns aside, this class sounds like a Harvard version of "The Biggest Loser." We expect it will challenge students, or "contestants," to celery-eating contests and physically demanding treks across the Yard. An added bonus for freshmen—anything's better than eating at Annenberg.
Cultural Agents (Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 13)
Flyby Course Description: In this class, students will learn spatial reasoning and critical thinking skills through class-wide games of "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?". If you have nostalgia for your childhood or struggle with basic multiplication, we're confident that this is the class for you. By finding the elusive villain all over the world, we fully expect students to come out of the class with a working knowledge of both world geography and times tables.
Privacy and Technology (Computer Science 105—Satisfies Culture and Belief)
Flyby Course Description: This class on privacy is being taught by Professor Waldo, made famous in the classic children's series "Where's Waldo?". Once students are able to find their professor, they will discover the methods of stalking, using both standard social networking sites and more historical methods such as MySpace (a relic of the ancient past). The class will culminate in a final project in which students will be responsible for the cyber-stalking of another student for an entire week.
Introduction to Soft Matter (Applied Physics 225)
Flyby Course Description: (N.B.: This is not even a Gen Ed, but it does sound fun.) After all the hard work and time necessary for other SPU courses, this course offers a playful return to earlier methods of learning. It consists of a general introduction to the world of Play-Doh. (No, philosophy majors, we didn't misspell Plato.) Students in this course will discover the many different uses of the multicolored, mysterious substance, building sculptures and exploring the different properties of each Play-Doh color. The final project consists of the creation of a medieval castle (with possible extra credit for those who use LEGOs).
