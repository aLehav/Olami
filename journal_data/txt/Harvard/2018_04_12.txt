After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a background in ballet, songwriting, singing, and EDM, La’Toya Princess Jackson has done it all. As a Master of Liberal Arts degree candidate at the Harvard Extension School, she has brought her unique blend of art forms to Harvard. Her new original work, “Vanity Lane,” uses classical ballet, ’80s music, and EDM to tell a complex story about beauty and self-love. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Jackson to discuss her artistic trajectory, “Vanity Lane,” and inclusion on stage.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first become interested in ballet?
La’Toya Princess Jackson: My path is kind of unconventional. I started getting interested in ballet when I was in college as an undergrad. I had taken a ballet class when I was 14, but I hadn’t been exposed to ballet when I was younger. My path as a dancer started as a jazz dancer in high school. One of the girls in high school was very good at ballet, and she invited me to a ballet class, but when I went there, there weren’t any dancers that looked like me.
This was all in Fort Worth, Texas. I grew up in a small town in the Arlington/Fort Worth area, and there were no dancers [who] looked like me. They put me in ballet classes that weren’t appropriate for my level, so I thought that ballet wasn’t for me. I got exposed to ballet again right out of college. I saw Ballethnic Dance Company’s Urban Nutcracker. It was my first time seeing a ballet with black ballet dancers on stage, and I realized I wanted to do that. And that was when I started getting serious about ballet.
THC: Do you consider ballet to be your primary art form? Or are there other mediums you prefer?
LPJ: Ballet is one of [the] things I like to do to express my art. I wouldn’t say it’s my primary, because I started as a songwriter. Music and dance to me are married. They both play a huge part in the artistic creation, and in my artistic developments. I would say that it’s music and dance combined, but ballet is my favorite thing to do as a performer. I use what I do as a ballet dancer to inform what I do as a songwriter. I want the stories I create in my ballet to tell the stories I write in my songs.
THC: If you had to pick an influential artist, who would they be?
LPJ: I can’t pick one, but the two that have been instrumental in my process are Janet Jackson and Prince. Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” album is what [got me into dancing]. I was really young when I discovered “Rhythm Nation,” but it was something that inspired me as a dancer. When I was young I would watch her move, and how intricate her movements were. I wanted to replicate that.
Prince inspired me in my artistry. As a musician and songwriter, “Vanity Lane” was almost inspired by “Purple Rain’” and how Prince told the story of “Purple Rain” through the music as well as the movie, ‘“Purple Rain.” [It] was also a really important album for me growing up. It saved me from a lot of thing I was experiencing in my childhood and helped me escape that. Combined, Prince and Janet gave me an outlet to start to explore my own artistic expressions.
THC: What inspired you to draw on such a diverse swath of influences, ballet, hip-hop, EDM and ’80s music, in creating “Vanity Lane?”
LPJ: It’s all from everything that has inspired me: I started a ballet program at the Boys and Girls club of metro Atlanta, and a lot of those students didn’t really like ballet because they didn’t see how it related to them. I remember seeing them really respond to Princess Tiana from “Princess and the Frog.” I watched that movie and [thought] that these are the things these kids are connecting to.
With Ballethnic I saw how in “Urban Nutcracker,” they kept classical ballet elements in their “Nutcracker,” but they also started to infuse things that reflected the African American experience with Act Two.
All of those things shaped and informed how I decided to approach “Vanity Lane.” I wanted to have something where people could see themselves, especially African-Americans. In my experience—I work for the Boston Ballet—when I look at the audiences and the stories I realize that a lot of diversity isn’t reflected since so many of the stories come from the European tradition.“Giselle,” “Cinderella,” and “The Sleeping Beauty” are all European folklore or fairy tales. I felt like in order to tell a story that’s authentic to our experience, and to give people the chance to dance diverse roles, you have to get to the source. And the source of that is creating stories that people can relate to. That’s why I decided to write an original fairytale, an original story with characters that [are] so diverse, that when it comes to the stage it gives people the opportunity to have their experiences reflected in different ways.
THC: If “Vanity Lane” was to be condensed into a paper, what would its thesis be?
LPJ: The thesis would be that the main character goes through a journey of self-exploration and finds herself. Not in the traditional sense of finding love through a man or external forces but finding love within herself. When she finds love within herself, she realizes that’s where true beauty lies. True beauty comes from within, and the other things that we perceive beauty to be are external factors, and that’s not where beauty comes from.
THC: How do you feel that ballet, and perhaps the artistic community as a whole, needs to change and how can that change be made?
LPJ: First, I believe it starts with organizations recognizing that though they are trying to move forward with diversity, there are still a lot of things that they don’t get. For example, I’m the only African-American on faculty at Boston Ballet, and even within that we have programs that are great programs, but there’s still a disconnect on how we give access to students [who] typically don’t have access to ballet.
And we can give that access, but then there are also other barriers such as hair and tights. Pink tights for black ballet dancers do nothing for our lines, so it’s about having brown tights, and brown ballet shoes. It’s about changing the mindset and the culture of these ballet companies to where they are truly reflective of our experiences. It’s not enough to just have a program in a community, or to have one black ballet dancer as a company dancer or a principal dancer in the company. It’s about what you’re doing to change the culture of your company so that black ballet dancers and dancers of color feel welcome into your organization, because there are so many factors that go into dancers of color not feeling welcome.
Even in offering ballet classes or giving access, how are you [getting] people [to] come into the organization and feel included? It also starts with not just promoting people within the company, but having people in positions that can choreograph and create stories and give something more authentic. It’s also important to recognize that there are companies like Dance Theatre of Harlem that have black ballet dancers, that are doing phenomenal work and raising great ballet dancers. I think the ballet world has a lot of room to grow. They’re slowly getting there, but it’s not there. There are a lot of things that could be changed to get there.

Although a relatively new concept, the fast-food mixtape has already caught the hearts and minds of thousands of netizens. One of the earlier pioneers in this trend, Hamburger Helper, released a 13-minute EP for April Fool’s Day in 2016. While that may sound funny, the cumulative 14.6 million views the EP has garnered on SoundCloud is no joke.
A few weeks ago, fast-food giant Wendy's became the latest restaurant to ascend to rap meme-dom with their debut EP, “We Beefin?” Incorporating elements of trap and jazz, the EP mainly consists of blatant self-promotion and shots at fast food competitors. With lines like, “Why yo’ ice cream machine always broke” and “fries, burger, nuggets and a drink come with that,” Wendy's truly pulls no punches.
Racking up almost 180,000 views on YouTube in a couple of weeks, Wendy's rap debut is faring better than most. Considering the relative success of this album, this raises the question: Why would over 100 thousand people go out of their way to listen to what is essentially an advertisement? The secret sauce is Wendy's long reputation as a meme marketer.
At 2.49 million followers, the Wendy's Twitter account has attained great internet acclaim for its witty retorts and devastating McDonald’s disses. According to a Reddit Ask Me Anything, a team of marketers work over 40 hours a week to come up with the best one-liners they can. Wendy's Twitter attracted international attention when a user’s tweet became the most retweeted of all time after the restaurant promised a year of nuggets if the tweet reached 18 million retweets. Even though the Twitter user only got to 3.4 million, Wendy's still gave him a year of nuggets.
In an age when consumers are more saturated with advertisements than ever, Wendy's form of meme marketing gives the company a decisive edge. According to a psychological phenomenon called the mere-exposure effect, repeated interaction with a concept increases said concept’s favorability. With more internet hijinx and news spotlights, the chances of people actually eating at Wendy's increase. Though not great as an actual music album, Wendy's fast-food mixtape is absolutely doing its job.

Courtney Love has been literally everywhere—reality TV (as a guest-judge on Thursday’s episode of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”), late night TV (as a drug-addicted exhibitionist on “The Late Show with David Letterman”), ’90s tabloids (as the wife of Kurt Cobain), and even film (as a Golden Globe-nominated actress). American pop culture consumers may not know that there’s a one-of-a-kind musician, poet, and feminist under Love’s celebrity skin. In the ’90s, her band, Hole, made distinctive alt-rock magic meant to communicate the ugliest aspects of womanhood. While Hole is best enjoyed through their original songs, their covers highlight the band’s special style and their respect for other musicians.
5. “Gold Dust Woman” (1996)Original by Fleetwood Mac (1977)Hole’s rendition of “Gold Dust Woman” reveals the decadence of aggressive, distortion-driven alternative rock. The original song gently evokes an unsettled feeling with deceivingly dark chord changes and soft wavers in Stevie Nicks’s beautiful voice. The song takes on a slow tempo that initially feels laid back, but quickly becomes haunting. Hole ditches these subtleties entirely. Love moans and wails, refusing to mask her discomfort with pleasant singing. When Love sings the chorus, “Did she make you cry/Make you break down / Shatter your illusions of love?” she taunts this “you,” sounding outwardly accusatory, as if she’s jabbing you in the chest with an untrimmed fingernail. Guitarist Eric Erlandson, drummer Patty Schemel, and bassist Melissa Auf der Maur barrel the song forward with their powerful instrumentation, keeping the song polished, but allowing it to drip with raw emotion.
4. “The Void” (1994)Original by The Raincoats (1979)Hole released “The Void” as a B-side to “Doll Parts,” one of the most successful singles off of their 1994 album, “Live Through This.” The Raincoats were pioneers in the genre of lady-powered alternative rock, and Hole pays homage to them in their version of “The Void.” Erlandson smooths out the song’s opening guitar riff, which combines beautifully with Love’s murky rhythm guitar and then bassist Kristen Pfaff’s delicately dirty bass line. In typical ’90s fashion, distortion and screams facilitate the song’s transition into each explosive chorus. “The Void” provides the perfect template for Hole’s volatile style, where verses stay pretty and unassuming, while choruses blow up into organized chaos.
3. “Clouds” (1991)Original by Joni Mitchell (1969)Hole’s debut album, “Pretty on the Inside,” ends with this prickly, whimsical refashioning of the Joni Mitchell classic, “Both Sides, Now.” It’s not immediately clear that “Clouds” and “Both Sides, Now” are technically the same song, so it’s even more fun to find unexpected similarities between the two versions. For starters, they’re both suspended in the world of dreams with a distinctive musical background—Mitchell embellishes the original with grand orchestral swells (and some really fun clarinet and saxophone solos), while Erlandson plays one screechy guitar riff that can be indelicately, but accurately described as sounding like “wee-ooh, wee-ooh” all the way through. Mitchell and Love have strikingly similar voices, but Love decides to speak (and scream), rather than sing Mitchell’s melody, emphasizing the beauty and strangeness of Mitchell’s poetry. Love chews on Mitchell’s words, stretching them out and turning them into something unrecognizable, in a way that is sometimes concerning and all the more striking.
2. “Circle One” (1996)Original by the Germs (1978)A cacophony of scribbling guitars opens Hole’s rendition of “Circle One,” a track off the album, “A Small Circle of Friends.” “Small Circle” is a tribute to the Germs, who crowned themselves punk rock royalty in the three short years they were active. Notorious frontman Darby Crash, whose suicide at the age of 22 led to the band’s dissolution, opens the song, a 110-second self-proclamation, with “I’m Darby Crash / A social blast / Chaotic master.” Love has the audacity to sing the exact same lyrics, causing some die-hard Germs fans to shrink away with disgust, and others to commend her for being so unabashed, unladylike and unapologetic, because what’s more punk rock than that? Hole harnesses the song’s frantic energy, somehow making it sound adorable, yet just as powerful as the original. Love’s scream resounds loudly throughout the song because it exemplifies the way Hole plays with the ambiguity between beauty and ugliness—screaming should sound terrible, but Love somehow makes it a gorgeous expression of pure joy.
1. “Pennyroyal Tea” (1993)Original by Nirvana (1993)“Courtney killed Kurt” conspirators love to colonize the YouTube comment sections for videos of Hole’s Nirvana covers, which can make them a toxic environment for Courtney Lovers like myself. Every time a greasy man compares Love’s scream to the sound of a dying walrus, it’s clear he’s just jealous that Hole does the song better than his beloved Nirvana. While Cobain sings the song thinly and weakly, Love manages to be just as vulnerable while bewitching listeners with her deep, rich voice. Even Cobain’s scream shallows in comparison to his wife’s. Love’s scream drives the song forward with a thickness Cobain lacks. However, there’s no reason to pit Love and Cobain against one another—the two play a great version of the song together at the 1993 Rock Against Rape benefit (although, Cobain does let his wife take over lead vocals, just saying).

Superstars don’t have time for geometry class. But that doesn’t keep singer-songwriter Grace VanderWaal from making the time in the music video for her song “Clearly.”  The video begins with Grace staring introspectively into a mirror. She’s uneasy as she grapples with a serious dilemma. Her vocals ensue and the tense mood is crystallized by the anxiety in her voice. Grace is troubled, but she isn’t ready for her reveal yet.
Suddenly, she whips out her contour stick, and the source of her dissonance becomes clear. She digs the stick into her face, carving out arcs and curves with directed energy. She searches for a degree of permanence that she’s failed to actualize due to the transient nature of her pop-star lifestyle. It’s as if she believes inscribing these shapes into her body can override years of missed experience. Each stroke represents an attempt to transport herself into the life of a normal teenage girl, one who has time to attend regular high school class—geometry class! Grace loves shapes. She needs to sketch shapes. Where is her protractor?
Immediately following her contouring fit, Grace catches her reflected gaze in the mirror and her incisive self-awareness kicks in. She frantically scrapes the makeup off her face, but these aren’t mere ephemeral etchings. She dismisses the previous notion of unfulfillment, but regret tugs on the fringes of her newfound contentedness. She moves from mirror to mirror in the house, inspecting the canals that were previously filled with contour. She can’t rid herself of the feeling that a piece of her is missing. Clearly she enjoys her fame, but it isn’t clear that it’s worth everything she’s sacrificed. She knows geometry is important.
As the tempo ramps up, Grace busts through the front door of the house. All of her regrets and fears vaporize upon interaction with the outdoors’ fresh embrace. She belts “I can see clearly now the rain is gone,” as a mass of individuals cheer in the background. Never attending a high school geometry class begins to feel like a less prominent consideration, now. Squares and circles—they’re nice. Ovals, even better! But fame and wealth are her present and more than likely her future. Shapes are defined by their inevitable closure, but her stardom knows no bounds.

“I think you’re unprepared, you came with the wrong song, you’re not as good as you thought you were, but I still like you.” Say what you want about his style of criticism, but Simon Cowell is nothing if not prescient.
From the moment Niall Horan stepped onto the X Factor stage, he’s been more question mark than exclamation point. His audition—a relatively uncompelling delivery of Ne-Yo’s “So Sick”—was vocally lackluster, though undeniably charming. Had the judges not been looking for a fifth member for their new boy band, it’s hard to imagine any scenario where that rendition would take the then-16-year-old anywhere but back home, to ride out the rest of his teenage years in weak-timbred peace.
Even as a member of the newly-formed One Direction, Horan started out as largely unremarkable. Overshadowed by bigger personalities and bigger voices, he was largely relegated to harmonies and backing vocals. In conversations addressing the elephant in the room—whose career would stand victorious after the inevitable bloodbath once the group split—he was routinely overlooked.
How, then, has Horan emerged as the frontrunner among his post-hiatus bandmates?
The answer is that he knows his niche, and he knows it well. In a pop landscape saturated with vocal powerhouses and electronic drops, Horan carved out a space for himself by venturing into folk-pop. His album “Flicker” is mellow, his love songs understated. There’s a sense that he could at a moment’s notice pull off an acoustic version of any of his repertoire, and as one of the few members of the band who could actually play guitar, that’s likely fairly close to the truth.
Though hindsight is 20/20, it’s hard to understand how true fans of One Direction couldn’t see this one coming. In its later years, the band was pretty clearly folk-shifting, slowly exiting the heavily-produced pure pop scene for a taste of the grittier work Niall would soon be dishing out. Listening as the quiet pining of “Summer Love” gives way to casual maturity in “Ready to Run,” it’s not so hard to see why Horan was always the one to watch.
“Likeable-ness is not going to sell records. It’s talent. And you have a seed of it,” warned guest judge Katy Perry as she contemplated whether or not to send the teenager through. Fortunately, her intuition was sound. The past few years have provided dark horse Niall Horan ample time to grow and show us that he has enough of both qualities to hold his own in the industry.

On Mar. 31, the Fromm Players performed an eclectic assortment of pieces ranging from folk songs to contemporary concert music. Combining the talents of orchestral players and vocalists, the concert, entitled “Resistance and Hope,” evoked the joy and despair felt by those who wish to express themselves in a homogenized society. The concert brought together diverse music genres with ease while successfully maintaining the richness and quality of its musicians’ interpretations.
Opening the concert with “algún sonido de la vida,” a duet written by Uruguayan composer Graciela Paraskevaidis, oboists Elizabeth England and Ben Fox wove unexpectedly palpable emotion into their instrumental exchange. Despite consisting of only a few notes, the piece was rife with rhythmic nuances which England and Fox effectively conveyed through disconcerting pauses, mellifluous sustained notes, and bouncy repetition. Mirroring and, even more often, overriding and contesting each other’s phrases, the oboists elevated the piece to the point where it became not just a musical composition, but a realistic dialogue between two individuals.
Following the oboe duet, The Prince Myshkins, a satirical songwriting and performing duo, marched on stage wearing decidedly casual attire. After giving a brief introduction, Rick Burkhardt began playing the accordion as his partner, Andy Gricevich, sang the “Ministry of Oil.” Coupled with the duo’s scruffy appearance, the mock-heroic melody of the song lent an atmosphere of deceptively carefree ease. Upon closer listening, the song’s lyrics revealed a more cynical outlook on the war on terrorism.
Burkhardt and Gricevich matched the irony of their first performance in their next performances, which featured similarly politically and socially charged songs. In a particularly hilarious performance, Gricevich strummed folksy tunes on his guitar as Burkhardt assumed the role of an overly intellectual waiter whose knowledge of the disgusting nature of modern-day restaurant food scares away potential customers. Burkhardt’s raw and guttural voice gave him the air of a laid-back country singer, which contrasted humorously with the slightly neurotic persona he was embodying in his song.
This lightheartedness soon disappeared when pianist Stephen Drury and violinist Gabriela Diaz stepped on stage to perform Ustvolskaya’s 1964 duet. The piece immediately had listeners on the edge of their seats with its soft, squeaky violin notes reminiscent of fingernails scratching across a chalkboard. Drury and Diaz’s mutual attentiveness largely contributed to the success of their performance. Situated behind Diaz, Drury was able to multitask, glancing up multiple times to read Diaz’s cue while focusing on his own piano part. As a result of their skillful collaboration, the two musicians captured the ominous quality of the piece with their precise timing of suspenseful rests and harsh, motor-like bursts of notes.
In the next performance, the Kepler Quartet played “String Quartet No.5, Lonesome Valley,” written by Ben Johnston. Violinists Sharan Leventhal and Eric Segnitz, violist Brek Renselman, and cellist Karl Lavine added emotional depth to an already psychologically complex composition with their hauntingly ethereal rendition of Johnston’s fantasia. The players adeptly traversed through the tonal labyrinth while imparting a sense of woeful meandering. Throughout the piece, all four instruments were almost constantly active, demanding an exceptional level of listening and communication that the players were able to demonstrate through their smooth textural interplay.
The concert concluded with a dramatic performance of Ulstvolskaya’s “Symphony No. 2: True and Eternal Bliss!” While the orchestral players propelled the piece forward with their admirably unfaltering energy, pianist Stephen Drury’s thunderous pounds on the keyboard shone the brightest, as well as vocalist Ryne Cherry’s sentimental proclamation to the heavens: “Oh, Lord… True, true, merciful, merciful, eternity, eternity.” Drury’s well-spaced trills and chords added fervor to the increasingly rhythmic intensity of the piece, while Cherry’s recitations broke its severity with believable fear and anguish.
While probing and insightful, the performances were also refreshingly simple and candid in their portrayal of modern society. The concert’s diverse selection of contemporary music didn’t fall short on its ambition to capture the spirit of resistance and hope within the individual—it more than bolstered the sense of self through its cathartic repertoire.

I remember when I first realized how Harvard would lead me to discover myself.
You know Cambridge in August, with humidity and heat beating down on you as you brave the scorching sun in its final days before fall comes along and cold sets in until April. You sit with friends in the shade of the coming school year in all its promise, forming desires and dreams and plans, before the weeks warp you into a jaded statue. There’s a buzzing excitement in the hope that this year, this term will be different—a new chance to start over.
The College, up until now, has given us this chance to begin anew with the greatest of our academic institutions: "shopping week." Now it is threatened. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is considering alternatives to it on the basis that the inconvenience and uncertainty to teaching fellows and professors outweigh its benefits. These are certainly valid concerns. I sympathize with the logistical nightmare we undergraduates create in our endless decisions and revisions. But I can’t help feeling the College and the Faculty are trying their hardest to steadily erode many of the things that make Harvard what it is in the name of progress—such as removing our beloved seven-minute passing period known popularly as "Harvard time."
Yes, I am sentimental. Change is inevitable; Harvard time was a necessary casualty for the Allston campus move. But something like shopping week isn’t seen for the truly unique purpose it serves. Instead, it’s viewed for the problems it causes.
At the start of this term, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey launched “The Transcript Project,” a challenge to undergrads to reflect on choices made throughout their time here. For many of us, shopping week is the primary reason why our transcripts look the way they do, as it gives us a freedom seldom found elsewhere. It is the essence of what I view college to be.
College is the consistent rediscovery of ourselves, for we learn who we are with each passing action. I know I am not the same person who first passed through Johnston Gate two years ago. Shopping week facilitates this rediscovery, allowing us to learn about what we really want and don’t. I write this as an English concentrator who would have declared Government had I not shopped a certain English course last fall—one I hadn’t initially considered.
You know my experience, because you may have had it. You have only three courses finalized. You failed to get into either of the seminars you wanted. You rack the Q Guide in vain, searching for a course that hasn’t yet assigned readings or problem sets, that isn’t math, and that isn’t Ethical Reasoning, because you’ve somehow fulfilled that thrice.
And so you hastily act one Friday afternoon and follow your blockmate into a dusty, musty, Emerson room, to attend English 157: “The Classic Phase of the Novel.” And then, polite interest turns into genuine captivation within the first ten minutes. There’s no desperation here—you’re fascinated more than you’ve been all week. Where does this lead you?
For me, it led to the English Department one crisp November day, where I renounced Government for what I realized I really wanted. I was not the same individual who walked into Emerson two months prior—my whole outlook on college and academics had changed based on my experiences in the course.
You may scoff at my story. What are my individual experiences to the multitudes of teaching fellows and professors inconvenienced each term by the follies and whims of undergraduates?
But realize: The College experience changes us, makes us reconsider who we are, what we study, and why. Shopping week has been essential in making us ask these questions—existential and overwhelming in their import, but ultimately guiding us to answer them sincerely. Many of us have countless questions of courses, concentrations, careers—and shopping week is a guide to answering some.
How many of us change during shopping week? How many unexpected choices change the course of our semesters, our years, our time here? This is no pseudo-philosophical interrogation: Seriously, how many courses surprised you, for good or bad, and made you rethink your academic choices? Which do you regret taking or missing out on? I believe that, for many students, finding a delightful or disappointing course during shopping week helped reshape their academic career for the better. This is the beauty of it—each missed or taken opportunity is a chance for that continuous rediscovery of ourselves, in the potential that shopping week allows.
So please—if you’re a voting faculty member who reads this and is considering voting to end shopping week, I urge you: Do not do so. The unique educational experience offered by Harvard College would be irrevocably ruined. After all, we only go through college once—every chance to learn more of who we are counts. These chances have charted my Harvard journey, with the deeply fulfilling experiences I’ve had, both within and without academia. As my last two years approach, I hope the opportunity to continuously rediscover myself through academics won’t be taken away.
Because this is what Harvard is about. This is what makes us who we are. This is what keeps us always questioning, always learning, always rediscovering ourselves, in classrooms and dorm rooms.

Approximately one month ago, a spreadsheet entitled “Shitty Architecture Men” was publicly released online. The spreadsheet, which has been circulating among Graduate School of Design affiliates, documents anonymous accounts of sexual misconduct and racist acts allegedly perpetrated by over a hundred men connected to institutions of higher education and prominent architecture firms. Among those accused are more than a dozen GSD students, faculty members, and administrators—including the current dean.
We strongly encourage those who shared their stories anonymously on the spreadsheet to come forward and file formal complaints, either with their institution or with law enforcement as necessary. Such would be the ideal course of action for addressing instances of sexual misconduct. It would hopefully allow for fair investigations and meaningful consequences that could help prevent such actions in the future.
However, we recognize the institutional failures that might discourage individuals from coming forward. Within the Harvard community alone, the historical reaction to accusations of sexual misconduct has been slow and unsatisfactory. We understand why victims of such behavior would seek recourse outside of the formal complaint system, especially one in which they have autonomy and may be able to see more immediate results.
Given Harvard’s past shortcomings in addressing sexual misconduct, we hope that the University takes the publication of this spreadsheet as a sign that its work is far from over. Harvard must ensure that this community is as supportive of those who experience sexual harassment as it claims to be. We believe that the claims made in the spreadsheet should be investigated as quickly, diligently, and fairly as possible, regardless of whether or not the accusers come forward. The anonymity of the accusers is troubling from an investigative standpoint, but we must not ignore the opportunity to protect future Harvard students and affiliates from potential harm. These accusations must be taken seriously and ought to be investigated.
Additionally, we recognize that this spreadsheet is a warning from sexual harassment victims, seeking to prevent the accused from committing similar actions against future students and colleagues. The public nature of the spreadsheet, which is not ideal for accusations of sexual misconduct, is important. Everyone ought to be warned if they are going to be working alongside potentially dangerous individuals. Everyone should be afforded protection from sexual violence. Victims of sexual misconduct have the right to attempt to protect all those who enter their institutions from experiencing the same harassment that they faced.
At its core, the spreadsheet is a reminder that sexual misconduct and racism still persist within the Harvard community as well as other educational and professional communities. We hope the University steps up and begins to handle accusations respectfully and effectively so that victims of sexual misconduct no longer feel that spreadsheets of this nature are necessary. The formal complaint system should be accessible and efficient enough that victims do not feel compelled to take external action. And the results of such formal complaints should remove those found guilty of committing sexual misconduct from our community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 1945 report of the first committee on General Education is not the product of your usual Harvard task force. The inside cover is outfitted with the regalia of the United States government, replete with the State Department seal. The eagle clasps a banner that reads, “Truth is our strength.” The cover is emblazoned with the high aims of the program: “General Education in a Free Society.”
In those first post-war decades, it must have been easy to see Harvard as an essential American institution. President John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson editor, could hold meetings of the Board of Overseers at the White House and invite the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to be National Security Advisor.
These grandiose visions for Harvard’s role in American life have subsided over the last 70 years. It has been some time indeed since any State Department, never mind this one, charged Harvard academics with the mantle of defending democracy in America. Indeed, today Harvard is less a defender of Western forms of government than playing defense against ours.
Today’s Gen Ed guidelines will probably not make the case for electives as a bulwark against the dangers of communism. They will probably not include sentences like, “We are at a turning point indeed in human affairs,” and, “General education is the sole means by which communities can protect themselves from the ill effects of overrapid change.” But if the authors of the 1945 report thought rather too highly of the import of their work, it’s hard not to think that today there’s been an over-correction in the opposite direction.
Today the General Education program hardly seems like an urgent priority, or at least not since former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former FAS Dean William C. Kirby sought to reimagine it in the mid-2000s. We’re told that the most recent remake—announced in 2015 after a College report said the current program was “failing on a variety of fronts”—will be delayed a year to the fall of 2019.
Intended as a compromise between a non-departmental General Education program and a distribution requirement consisting solely of departmental courses, the new system will include required coursework in four categories: Aesthetics & Culture; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science & Technology in Society; and Ethics & Civics. (A proposed additional requirement is under review, entitled “Thinking with Data,” and I suppose it is somewhat amusing they thought that additional and separate requirement was necessary.)
I am sure that a great deal of thoughtfulness, scholarship, and genuine effort went into this new proposal, but it’s hard to not be at least a little cynical about its practical effectiveness. For starters, the categories are remarkably broad; it’s hard to imagine what—besides the most pure of the natural sciences—wouldn’t constitute “Histories, Societies, Individuals.” It seems to encompass all aspects of the human experience.
The interim categories for the transition to the new Gen Ed system are vaguer still. Witness the choice to amalgamate two existing requirements—“Science of the Physical Universe” and “Science of Living Systems,” where all qualifying classes now interchangeably count for both.
As part of that change, introductory computer science and statistics have been reclassified as fulfilling “Science of the Physical Universe,” a category traditionally reserved for the likes of physics and chemistry. Indeed, administrators seem to have decided that computer science is, upon second reflection, actually a science. (That’s wonderful news for me. I am weeks from a degree in political science, which, according to the Gen Ed program’s transitive-property-esque logic, might eventually be up there with physics.)
These over-expansive categories only reinforce one of the biggest failings of the present program: self-selection. Each shopping week, intrepid undergrads leave no stone unturned in a ceaseless quest to ferret out the not-quite-endangered species of the course catalog: Science classes sans problem sets and humanities courses devoid of readings. The rush to the (self-advertised!) lowest-common-denominator is one reason the program can’t encourage class-wide learning.
It’s a shame that our expectations for a Harvard education have become so vague and so easily fulfillable. The original 1945 program drafters had impossibly grand aims, but their articulation of the purpose of a college education should at least echo today. Present University administrators tell us frequently about their quest to graduate better citizens and citizen-leaders. Yet even as the new categories are more directly linked with social ends—look no further than the transformation of the science requirement into the study of “Science & Technology in Society”—the Gen Ed program has been dramatically simplified from its original Cold War-era mission.
It may be the case that Gen Eds past had little to do with the defeat of the Evil Empire. (That had, I think, a lot more to do with the presence of the United States in the world than with the presence of “United States in the World.”)
But there is a certain degree of rigor that seems appropriate, a certain sense that a Harvard education should have something to do with being an educated citizen of this country. Even the more modest aim of producing well-rounded graduates relies on it. On that front, at least, I hope very much for the new program’s success.

The Cambridge City Council discussed proposed measures to mitigate the effects of climate change at a working meeting Monday.
The Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Plan, drafted in Nov. 2017, outlines steps the City of Cambridge can take to address potential issues created by climate change. The plans lists four major concerns for the city: increased temperatures, precipitation, rising sea levels, and storm surges.
The plan states that, by 2070, the city will likely see nearly three months during which temperatures reach over 90 degrees. By comparison, 2017 boasted just two weeks with temperatures over 90. Additionally, flooding in Alewife will most likely increase, potentially bypassing the Amelia Earhart Dam.
John Bolduc, Cambridge’s environmental planner, said the city’s climate change plan highlighted many different strategies to protect the city from these environmental threats. The current version of the plan focuses on a prepared community, adapted buildings, resilient infrastructure, and resilient ecosystems, he said.
“The plan is based on the assumption is that there are no silver bullets, that we have to take a multi-pronged approach and do many things in combination to create a resilient Cambridge,” Bolduc said.
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said the city and its citizens have made climate change work a “priority.” DePasquale said he thinks the city is well equipped to study the consequences of climate change and to prepare ahead of time.
“We are ahead of most cities and towns, and we’ve had a long history taking a look at the potential impacts of climate change,” DePasquale said.
The city has practiced  climate change preparedness for several years, with efforts stretching back to at least 2015. That year the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment also reported four main climate change issues identified by the city. Part one of the CCVA, which examines heat and precipitation, was released in Nov. 2015 while part two, which examines sea levels and storm surges, was released in Feb. 2017.
The CCVA describes itself as a “technical foundation” for the CCPR Plan, providing the facts about the impact of climate change on Cambridge. According to the CCVA, research conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that climate change may be impossible to fully prevent.
Bolduc said he  thinks the scientific consensus on the existence and the future of climate change is clear. But he said predicting how and when the effects will affect Cambridge is more difficult.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about how much change we will experience and the timing of those changes,” Bolduc said. “We’re basically trying to plan for a moving target.”
Cambridge is currently advocating to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to continue assessing threats posed by climate change. Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq said the development of a focused mitigation plan through the CCPR Plan is also important work.
“Sometimes it’s hard to think, ‘What might be the silver lining here?’” Farooq said. “But truly the fact that we’re doing this work at the same time that we’re doing our comprehensive plan is a huge silver lining.”
DePasquale said he hopes Cambridge’s CCPR Plan will help other regions, too.
“We are one of the leaders in this area in terms of trying to understand it—to see not only how it’s going to affect Cambridge but also how it’s going to affect every community and how we’re all in this together,” DePasquale said.

Researchers from Harvard, MIT, and the University of Cambridge have found that sulfur-containing compounds present in the early earth’s atmosphere may have given rise to the building blocks of life, according to a research article published Sunday.
Astronomy professor Dimitar D. Sasselov, who directs the Origins of Life Initiative at Harvard, and astronomy graduate student Zoe R. Todd worked alongside Sukrit Ranjan, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, and John D. Sutherland, a chemist from the University of Cambridge, to devise the refined hypothesis for how life initially arose on Earth.
“We’re interested in the origin of life—how life came about on Earth—and applying that to other planets out there,” Todd said. “So, we’re answering the questions of ‘Are we alone?’ and ‘What other environments might be necessary in order for life to form?’”
Sasselov said scientists previously theorized that sulfur plays a key role in the formation of RNA nucleotides, which are essential for both coding and regulating genetic information.
Todd said the study published Sunday examines the effects of certain environmental conditions—in particular, the presence of sulfur-containing molecules like hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide—on driving prebiotic chemical reactions. These gases were likely produced by erupting volcanoes, he said.
The researchers found that, given the conditions of the early earth, there would be sufficient levels of sulfur dioxide, but insufficient levels of hydrogen sulfide, to give rise to primitive life forms.
“You’re going to have much more of these sulfur dioxide derived anions and much less of the hydrogen sulfide [derived anions],” Todd said. “The sulfur dioxide derived anions might be more valuable for getting this chemistry going.”
“This was not known before,” Sasselov added. “People just assumed that there was enough of this sulfur.”
Todd and Sasselov also emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary interaction between planetary science and chemistry.
“Probably the most valuable part of this study that I took away from it was this synergistic effect between the laboratory and the theory,” Todd said. “The laboratory showed that there’s the need for these sulfur ions in solution, and then they asked us in terms of theory, ‘How might you get this?’ So then, we went to the source, did this study and went back and said, ‘Hey, you might not get enough of what you wanted, but check out this other ion—you might get a lot of that.’”
Sasselov said he thinks the team’s multidisciplinary research moved the ball forward on understanding some of the most fundamental questions about early life.
“When I was a student, I remember people were saying, ‘Don’t even bother to work on the origins of life problems because they are not solvable scientifically,’” Sasselov said. “And to some extent, that’s because they are multidisciplinary. They can’t have just the chemists solve it, or just the astronomers solve it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight Ph.D. candidates presented their dissertation research to the public at the the Harvard Horizons Symposium held Wednesday evening in Sanders Theater.
The program, launched in 2013, provides Horizon Scholars in-depth mentoring and training to better their presentation and communication skills. Eight students are selected each fall, and they spend the spring semester working intensively with staff at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, as well as with faculty and their fellow scholars.
"The purpose of the program is to promote interaction and collaboration across disciplines and to help students build the critical communication skills that enable them to share their work with a broader audience, whether inside the academy or outside,” said Sheila Thomas, the GSAS dean for academic programs and diversity.
Each of the eight Ph.D. students had five minutes to introduce their research topic, present their findings, and discuss the implications of their research.
Argyro Nicolaou, a comparative literature student and one of this year’s scholars, said improving her communication skills formed her main reason for applying.
“I wanted to do Harvard Horizons because I love being able to communicate my work to a wider audience. Often times during the Ph.D. we become quite technical,” Nicolaou said. “I just wanted to get the opportunity to train myself and become more exposed to a more accessible mode of communication.”
Physics Ph.D. candidate Christie Chiu, who is studying quantum mechanics and electron movement, said that, while doing research is important in itself, it is also important to be able to communicate that research to others.
“Communication happens on different levels,” Chiu said. “On one level it’s communicating with professors... but it’s also communicating to the broader community, and Harvard Horizons is the most open to the public.”
The organizers of Harvard Horizons said they have worked each year to improve the program based on student feedback.
“The Harvard Horizons program has evolved over time as we learn from each cohort,” Pamela Pollock, director at the Bok Center and lead mentor for Harvard Horizons, wrote in an email.
Pollock wrote the program has specifically improved the faculty mentoring aspect, working to provide one-on-one mentorship with faculty members within and without a scholar’s discipline.
Chiu called the event “a celebration of all the different subfields.”
“I want to highlight how great all the talks are,” Chiu said. “Not only from the sciences like myself, but also humanities, social science, philosophy, psychology, urban planning.”

UPDATED: April 12, 2018 at 2:11 p.m.
The College will launch a new secondary field in “Educational Studies” for undergraduates beginning in the fall of 2018 after a years-long faculty and student-led push for the program.
Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan announced the news to Ed School affiliates in an email Wednesday morning. Ryan wrote in the email that students will declare their interest in the secondary during their junior year and “will be required to take five approved courses related to education in order to fulfill the requirements.”
Students will be able to take up to eight credits at graduate schools like the Ed School, and will take remaining credits through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. Dane wrote in an email that the collaboration between the Ed School and FAS is “first-of-its-kind.”
Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer in education, said the Educational Policy Committee—a body composed of faculty, deans, and undergraduates—voted to approve the new secondary at a meeting last week.
Merseth, who teaches the popular general education course, United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” said a student first approached her about the idea of writing a proposal for a secondary in education in 2014. Merseth said some at first confused the proposal with the Harvard Teaching Fellows program, a postgraduate teacher training and education program run through the Ed School.
“Initially, there was this confusion that we were suggesting this teacher education program for Harvard College, and we weren’t,” Merseth said. “We strongly enforced [that] the study of education is an intellectual endeavor and not a vocational program.”
The proposal began garnering interest among the FAS soon after its debut, Merseth said, but—given education is not a department—there remained the question of which senior FAS members would serve as advisors to the proposed secondary. In 2017, Ed School professor Julie A. Reuben offered to head the program.
“The education secondary field is always something I felt strongly supportive of, and we had a change of academic deans this year,” Reuben said. “I offered at that point to take over as kind of the point person because I didn’t want the momentum to be lost.”
Economics professor Claudia D. Goldin, who co-teaches the course Economics 980b: “Education in the Economy” and said she has been involved with the proposal for years, said she is “delighted” to see the secondary approved.
“I’m a great fan of interdisciplinary studies, and we do too few of them,” Goldin said. “Most universities, and this one in particular, are heavily siloed.”
Goldin said that—in addition to economics—fields like psychology, government, and literature are all interrelated to the study of education. Sociology lecturer Manja Klemencic, who specializes in the sociology of higher education, said she also sees this approval as a way to formalize courses on education across the University.
“I see this decision as an important step of building a community of students, researchers, and faculty from various disciplinary backgrounds who share interest in education,” Klemencic said.
Reuben, Klemencic, and Merseth all said many undergraduates have approached them in class to ask whether Harvard could offer more courses on education.
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who serves as education chair on the Undergraduate Council as well as on the College’s Committee on Undergraduate Education, said the past year of discussions about the proposal focused on which departments in FAS would support the new secondary.
“During these meetings, myself and other students who were on the education committee and served on the Committee on Undergraduate Education all agreed that, especially as a liberal arts institution, it’s extremely important that Harvard offers education as an academic discipline for students to be able to study, and to especially learn about how it intersects with other fields as well,” Palaniappan said.
Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19, who worked with Palaniappan to garner student support for the proposal, said the new secondary will provide centralized support for students, like herself, who want to study the subject in a structured manner.
The UC created a video in support of the secondary earlier this month.
“What an education secondary means for me and so many other students is the idea and ability to study education theoretically and be able to have resources and a community behind it,” Zhang said. “A lot of what tracks and concentrations give to students is the community behind it.”

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in southwest India to collaborate on research and education initiatives in critical care, pain medicine, and anesthesiology.
The memorandum identifies joint research and an exchange of faculty and students as areas for cooperation between the two institutions.
Beth Israel is one of Harvard Medical School’s main teaching hospitals. Though the Medical School itself is not involved in the memorandum, the three professors who visited the hospital before signing the memorandum all hold joint Harvard-Beth Israel appointments.
Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, also known as Amrita Hospital, is located in Kochi, a city in southwest India. The hospital boasts 1,300 beds, more than any of Harvard Medical School’s teaching hospitals.
Doctors from Beth Israel Deaconess visited Amrita last week before signing the memorandum. The team comprised Daniel S. Talmor, head of the department of anaesthesia and critical care at Beth Israel, Peter J. Panzica, assistant professor of anesthesia, and Satya K. Ramachandran, associate professor of anaesthesia.
Panzica said the three doctors visited Delhi last week, where Amrita is building a new 2,000-bed hospital, and gave recommendations about the new facility before proceeding to the current hospital in Kochi.
He named “working with them on some protocols for randomized control trials” and using data from Amrita’s patient population as priorities for future research endeavors.
Ramachandran said the memorandum of understanding will provide a valuable source of data for future research projects. He pointed to the hospital’s digital database in particular.
“They are one of the hospitals in India which had an electronic health record for the longest time. That was another opportunity for us,” Ramachandran said. “One of our strengths is in outcomes-database driven research.”
He also mentioned the hospital’s large intensive care unit as a potential resource for research efforts.
The memorandum could mean that Beth Israel will provide continuing medical education courses to doctors at Amrita. Beth Israel residents may be able to spend about a month observing patient care at Amrita as well.
“We’ve run workshops and training programs for training and teaching ultrasound technology for physicians at the point of care, different kinds of ultrasound technology, different kinds of bronchoscopy techniques,” Ramachandran said.
He added that Beth Israel has “a wealth of resources” that will enhance the collaboration between the two institutions. Specifically, the department’s junior faculty could “definitely benefit from the experience” of visiting Amrita and observing their operations, he said.

UPDATED: April 12, 2018 at 4:35 p.m.
The Department of English and the Department of African and African American Studies recently hired Jesse D. McCarthy as an assistant professor in both fields.
McCarthy is currently a doctoral student at Princeton University, busy completing his dissertation. McCarthy’s academic interests include African American literature, postcolonial theory, contemporary fiction and poetry, and film studies. McCarthy will assume his joint professorship at Harvard starting in the fall of this year.
Professor Lawrence D. Bobo, chair of the African and African American Studies department, wrote in an emailed statement that he is “delighted” McCarthy is on his way to Harvard.
“I do not recall ever having seen a more broadly consensual and excited faculty about an appointment than this one,” Bobo wrote.
McCarthy’s dissertation focuses on writing by black authors from the early Cold War period. McCarthy said that literature from 1945 to 1965 has not been periodized in the same way the eras directly before and after have. Additionally, McCarthy said, secondary sources tend to incorrectly classify black writers from this time under a communist or liberal umbrella.
“What I think is actually really distinctive and interesting about black writing, especially in this moment, is that I think they’re trying to dissent from both,” McCarthy said. “Hopefully, what my dissertation will do is show that, if we think about it as a discrete period, there are some real benefits in terms of the kinds of connections we can make in between writers that are sometimes not usually read together.”
At Princeton, McCarthy also started a digital humanities project, called Mapping Expatriate  Paris. The project involves analyzing the records from Shakespeare and Company—a Paris bookstore, founded in 1919, that was frequented by writers like Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound.
“We can see which books circulated the most and who was reading the same books or not,” McCarthy said. “Because you have the addresses, you can also map where people were living and how that changed over time.”
McCarthy is originally from New York, but moved to Paris at age eight. After graduating from Amherst College in 2006, McCarthy taught at South Brooklyn Community High School in New York, an institution that helps students who have had disciplinary difficulties, or have dropped out, seek another shot at a high school diploma.
“In a lot of ways, that’s where I learned the most, certainly about teaching,” McCarthy said.
While McCarthy is not yet sure what he will be teaching this fall at Harvard, he said he may teach an introductory lecture course on black poetry.
“He is going to bring a fresh, youthful perspective to African American literature studies taking up such critical topics as feminism, gender, and sexuality as well cinematic studies and criticism,” Bobo wrote. “The English and African and African American Studies Departments conducted a broad and thorough national search. Jesse McCarthy stood out unequivocally as the hottest new star on the horizon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council heard a proposal to dissolve a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee overseeing the use of human subjects in research and received updates on unionization and initiatives at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at its biweekly meeting Wednesday afternoon.
Associate Dean for Research Administration Patrick W. Fitzgerald presented the proposal to dissolve the Standing Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research. The Council—FAS’s highest governing body—voted to pass a similar proposal in February, eliminating the Council on Asian Studies, another FAS standing committee. The February proposal claimed the Asia Center already carried out many of the Asian Studies Council’s duties.
Fitzgerald used similar reasoning to advocate for the dissolution of the Use of Human Subjects Committee. He argued a larger University-wide committee, which reviews research projects involving human subjects across most of the schools including FAS, already performs many of the functions of that FAS standing committee.
Council member David L. Howell said the recent proposals to eliminate outdated FAS standing committees are likely part of an effort by FAS to clear away “bureaucratic clutter.”
“I gather it's something they've been trying to do for the past few years. They don't want to eliminate committees that are doing important work that isn't replicated elsewhere, but the ones that have become obsolete,” Howell said.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean-elect Emma Dench also spoke to the Council about the unionization vote slated to be held April 17 and 18; that vote will determine whether graduates students can form a union in order to collectively bargain with the University. She reminded Council members that professors are allowed to express their opinions on the issue but should be careful not to say anything that might pressure graduate students to vote a certain way.
The Council also listened to Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III present about current SEAS efforts to create new programs and collaborate with other schools within the University. Doyle spoke about a new Masters program in Design Engineering that will graduate its first class this semester, as well as a new joint program with the Business School, among other initiatives.
“I think in general, he wanted to say that SEAS, because it is the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is very interested in thinking of—of course—new technologies, but also new techniques to serve the greater community through practical problem solving,” Howell said.
The Council will hold its next meeting, slated to be the last one for the semester, on Wednesday, April 25.

Last week, in an email outlining his position on graduate student unionization, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 argued that existing bodies for graduate student representation, like the Graduate Student Council and the Harvard Graduate Council, are sufficient.
But several current and former members of the GSC executive board have contested that idea, arguing that that their work does not accomplish the same goals as the proposed union.
Several GSC members, including current president Masha Bertling and vice president Benjamin R. West, say the nature of the feedback they provide differs from the topics under the proposed union’s purview.
“Elected representatives represent the voices of these students in conversations about academic, administrative, and residential affairs,” West wrote in an email. “In contrast, I think that the union will focus on collective bargaining and negotiation. Rather than playing an advisory role, the union will engage in advocacy.”
Eligible students will head to the polls on April 18 and 19 to weigh in on whether to form a union to collectively bargain with the University on issues like stipend rates, healthcare, and housing.
In addition to highlighting graduate student government, Garber also listed resources like the Harvard International Office and Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, as channels students can use absent a union.
“Harvard students, individually and through elected student government, have long worked together with faculty and administrators to extend and improve student services,” Garber wrote. “Their collaborative efforts began well before paid organizers from the United Auto Workers came to our campuses.”
In an emailed statement on behalf of HGSU-UAW, John M. Nicoludis, a Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers wrote he feels the council lacks the degree of power a union would have to influence the deans’ decisions.
Members of the executive board of the GSC meet with deans of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences on a monthly basis to relay concerns and make suggestions on behalf of the student body.
GSAS Dean for Administration and Finance Allen D. Aloise wrote in an email that GSC input has led to major policy changes in the past, naming the increase in the MBTA Semester Pass subsidy, an increase in the Parental Accommodation and Financial Support, and free Care.com membership as examples.
Bertling, who noted that the Council remains neutral on the unionization issue, wrote in an email that the union might be able to argue for changes outside the GSC’s wheelhouse.
“Right now, GSC doesn't have an input as to how funding decisions are made. If anything, we are often informed post hoc and have an opportunity to provide comments on the decisions that have been made,” Bertling said. “I can imagine that lots of negotiations at such a level would transfer to the union.”
In his email, Aloise noted that the GSC will likely become more involved in budgeting in the future.
“Last year, the GSC asked how it could become more involved in the annual budget process and proposed the creation of a finance committee that would meet regularly with administrators,” he wrote. “GSAS agreed, and the GSC is in the process of finalizing the committee membership.”
Former GSC president Summer A. Shafer said that because a union would “wield the power of contract negotiation,” it could accomplish things than the council is not equipped to do.
“It might actually even make the GSC better, because it’ll force a redefinition of goals and priorities,” Shafer said.
“One holds the weight of federal law, and the other begs to be heard,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 12, 2018 at 2:00 p.m.
The Republican tax overhaul passed in December may affect Harvard's pension investments and the University is currently “reviewing” the situation, according to a Harvard spokesperson.
Last December, Republican lawmakers passed tax legislation requiring private colleges with endowments greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent tax on annual endowment returns. Harvard numbers among the 35 institutions affected, and would have paid $43 million under the tax if the legislation had existed in fiscal year 2017.
The bill could potentially affect the University’s pension investments, which currently serve many retired Harvard affiliates as well as current employees hired before 2001. University spokesperson Vanessa McMillan wrote in a statement that the impact of the endowment tax on these pensions is still unclear.
“Harvard is aware there is concern that the net investment income tax could potentially apply to pension/retirement investments,” she wrote. “We are examining the issue and awaiting IRS guidance.”
In 2017, Harvard paid a total $64.7 million in pension and post-retirement health benefits and held $836 million in pension assets, according to the financial report for fiscal year 2017.
While the University has not provided defined benefit pension plans—which guarantee a certain amount of retirement income—since 2001, Harvard has since separated the pension plan investments from the University’s endowment investments. Instead, Harvard has established a trust separate from the endowment and worked with external financial organizations to manage pension investments.
University employees hired after 2001 participate in 403(b) retirement plans, a kind of defined contribution plan into which both employees and Harvard contribute financially. These plans do not form part of the University’s pension investments.
The management of pension funds is regulated by the federal government and the Department of Labor. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act which passed in 1974, employers like Harvard have a legal obligation to provide information to employees about their retirement plans and to manage those plans in the best interests of employees.
In 2008, Harvard Management Company—which manages the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—decided to invest pension plans separately from the endowment. Since employees depend on pension funds in retirement, pension plan investments are generally more conservative than the endowment investment.
In 2010, the University created a seven-member Defined Benefit Investment Committee which “is responsible for the evaluation, selection and maintenance of the investment funds held in the retirement plan trust,” according to McMillan. The current chair of the Committee is Thomas J. Hollister, the University’s chief financial officer.
Michael Beaver, a lawyer specializing in pension benefits, said the formation of a committee to manage pension investments is “not uncommon.” He added that Harvard’s shift from defined benefit pension plans to defined contributions is consistent with the trend across different companies.
“A certain amount of financial and investment uncertainty exists as well, so that private employers find it difficult to plan adequately for the future,” he said. “By shifting to defined contributions, it lowers some of the burdens and brings quite a bit of certainty to retirement plan costs.”
While Harvard Management Company still plays a “limited operational role” for the pension plan investments, the Investment Committee meets quarterly to make final decisions on investments. State Street—a Boston-based financial services company—serves as the custodian of the investments, according to McMillan.
In 2012, the University hired Willis Towers Watson—a multinational risk management company—to advise and partner with HMC to “support the Investment Committee on areas such as strategic portfolio construction.”

A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Republican tax overhaul passed in December may affect the pensions of Harvard employees hired before 2001. In fact, the tax will only affect Harvard's pension investments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate School of Design students hung banners denouncing sexual misconduct in the school’s main workspace last week in response to the recent circulation of an anonymous spreadsheet accusing prominent GSD affiliates of inappropriate sexual and racist acts.
The “Shitty Architecture Men” spreadsheet, created last month and still publicly available online, contains a list of anonymous accounts of sexual misconduct and bigoted acts allegedly perpetrated by men in the architecture field. The sheet includes accusations against at least 18 GSD students, faculty, and administrators, including current Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi and former chair of the school’s Department of Architecture Iñaki Ábalos.
The spreadsheet is now “temporarily closed,” according to a message posted by the list’s administrators in the past few days.
The installation, which debuted last Friday, currently hangs in the Design School’s Gund Hall, a large, airy space that houses studios and offices for approximately 500 students and more than 100 faculty and staff. Lining all five levels of the hall, the banners display messages of support for those who have experienced sexual assault and assert students stand united against sexual misconduct at the school.
“We, student leaders, stand united in response to misconduct,” reads one banner.
“This cannot end in conversation. This must end in action,” reads another.
Still another: “We will not allow the GSD to stand silent to injustice.”
As of Wednesday, 22  student groups had hung banners in Gund Hall asserting the organizations “will not stand silent.”
Natasha H. Hicks and Lena M. Ferguson, GSD students and leaders of the African American Student Union and the Harvard Urban Planning Organization, respectively, directed these efforts in collaboration with other student organizations like the Student Forum, a student governance body, and Women in Design.
“A core message behind the installation is unity,” Hicks and Ferguson wrote in a joint emailed statement. “We wanted to make clear that we as student leaders stand together in our dedication to cultural change.”
Hicks and Ferguson wrote they thought it was “important” students installed the banners Friday—the same day the Design School held an admitted students open house.
“We wanted to send a message to incoming students that there is a student community here at the GSD committed to changing the toxic culture,” the two wrote. “We wanted to extend an invitation to those admitted students to come and help us continue to demand for institutional and cultural change.”
In a statement provided Wednesday by GSD spokesperson Travis Dagenais, Design School Executive Dean Patricia Roberts wrote the installation represents “the type of  expression” the school encourages from students.
“At the GSD, we are working hand in hand with students and other offices across the University to maintain an open dialogue and take constructive steps to address these issues collectively,” Roberts wrote.
Phillip R. Denny, a Ph.D. student at the GSD, said he thinks it is “inspiring” to see students take the lead in speaking out against inappropriate behavior.
“It’s tremendously inspiring to see student leaders craft a statement of principle and to declare them so prominently and so publicly,” Denny said. “It really speaks to the belief that positive change is only going to come about if we all hold each other accountable as a community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2018 at 12:45 a.m.
President Donald Trump’s former press secretary Sean Spicer will visit the Institute of Politics Thursday to participate in an off-the-record study group with fellow Scott Jennings.
Spicer will be discussing the 2018 midterm elections in the Kirkland Senior Common Room, according to an email sent Thursday over an Institute of Politics email list. Jennings, a current IOP fellow and a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
This is not the first time Spicer has visited the IOP. Last October, he spent three low-profile days  at Harvard as part of his visiting fellowship with the Institute.
The IOP's decision to grant Spicer the fellowship generated controversy among students and alumni at the time. More than 600 Harvard alumni signed an open letter calling for the rescinding of Spicer's fellowship, as well as a visiting fellowship granted to Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign adviser. While on campus, Spicer attended 11 events, all of them off-the-record and closed to the general public.
The announcement of Spicer's visit did not appear in the IOP Weekly Newsletter. The email was sent over an IOP mailing list at 8:00 p.m. the night before the event is slated to take place.
While in Boston, Spicer will also headline a fundraiser for Geoff Diehl, a co-chair for Trump’s campaign and Elizabeth Warren’s challenger for Senate on Thursday, according to The Boston Globe. Spicer is expected to draw a crowd of 50 to 60 people at the fundraiser, according to campaign spokeswoman Holly Robichaud.
The IOP email did not specify how long Spicer will stay at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Design has “made plans” to hire a diversity and inclusion officer following allegations of sexual misconduct against more than a dozen school affiliates, Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi wrote in an email to GSD students, faculty, and staff Monday.
Mostafavi and former chair of the school’s Department of Architecture Iñaki Ábalos number among at least 18 GSD affiliates  accused of sexual harassment and racist acts in a publicly available online spreadsheet titled “Shitty Architecture Men.”  The spreadsheet is now temporarily closed, according to the list’s administrators.
In an email sent to GSD affiliates Monday, Mostafavi wrote the Design School does not “condone” the alleged behavior reported in the spreadsheet. He added the administration has been working with student leaders and Title IX coordinators from both the GSD and the University to develop a plan of action in the wake of the allegations.
Mostafavi also wrote the school “has already made plans” to hire a diversity and inclusion officer in order to respond to concerns from various student leaders about the culture of the school and wrote he will “depend on student involvement” to shape this position. According to Mostafavi, student leaders and the GSD Executive Committee met Wednesday to speak about “a set of proposed ideas.”
Mostafavi’s email comes in response to a letter penned by student leaders from nine student organizations at the GSD last week that urged Design School administrators to make “concrete change” regarding sexual misconduct at the school.
“As student leaders, we are dedicated to ensuring that the discussions sparked by the ‘Shitty Architecture Men’ spreadsheet does not end in conversation, but in action,” the students’ letter reads. “While it is important to continue critical dialogue around how to reform the current procedures, we must demand more from each other than just conversation and hold our community accountable to concrete change.”
The letter, emailed to the the school’s student body, was written by representatives from students groups including the Student Forum, the GSD student government, the GSD African American Student Union, and the Harvard Urban Planning Organization.
Natasha H. Hicks, the co-president of the African American Student Union, and Lena M. Ferguson, co-president of the Harvard Urban Planning Organization, wrote in an email Wednesday that the letter contains “key recommendations” they would like to see GSD administrators take to heart.
“We are committed to working with the administration from here on out to develop an action plan for changing the culture at the GSD and the greater design community,” Hicks and Ferguson wrote.
In addition to calling for a full-time employee devoted to diversity and inclusion—the exact position the GSD has now created—the students asked the school to supplement its Title IX policies by specifically providing more “reporting mechanisms” for sexual harassment. The students also requested “regular communications” from the administration regarding inclusivity issues at the school and called for the creation of a student task force to review hiring decisions.
Mostafavi wrote in his email that neither the GSD nor the University’s Title IX Office has received complaints related to accounts from the spreadsheet since the list's creation. He encouraged students to come forward with any information they have regarding these allegations.
“I am hopeful that soon, by talking together, maintaining transparency, and moving forward as a diverse but single community, we will be able to find other ways to share ideas and concerns toward a common goal of a vibrant and welcoming community,” Mostafavi wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For just the fourth time in program history, the Harvard baseball team has won the sole Beanpot championship.
With an 8-6 victory over Northeastern on Wednesday afternoon, the Crimson (13-14, 3-3 Ivy League) lifted the silver trophy coveted annually by four Boston-area schools—Boston College, UMass, Northeastern, and Harvard.
The Crimson rallied explosively after going down 6-0 early, plating eight unanswered runs and shutting down the Huskies (18-11, 5-1 CAA) late to ride out the triumph. Freshman shortstop Buddy Mrowka’s third-inning bases-clearing triple proved to be the difference-maker.
Leaving Friedman Diamond in Brookline, Mass., the Harvard squad knew that capturing the Beanpot title was a rarity to cherish.
“Especially being a local guy, growing up with the Beanpot, [winning the title] means a lot,” said rookie right fielder Tommy Seidl, who hit second in the order and scored a run. “It’s a big deal around here, not so much for the rest of the country—but definitely for me and the local guys, it means a lot.”
What makes the Beanpot victory especially remarkable was that Northeastern had a remarkably strong team, ranked 14th in the nation, according to the RPI Division I rankings compiled on April 10. The Crimson was 157th on the same list, far below its southward neighbors.
“It’s a big-time win for us,” said junior catcher Devan Peterson, who hit an RBI double in the second to jumpstart Harvard. “I’ve been dreaming about winning the Beanpot ever since I came to college. Now, to have that trophy on the bus with us, it’s an unbelievable feeling.”
The trophy didn’t come easy.
The Crimson had an inauspicious start, as starting pitcher junior Kevin Stone was tagged for six runs and three walks before he even recorded his second out. Huskies sophomore outfielder Kyle Peterson did the most damage, hitting a grand slam with one out. By the time the Harvard defense jogged back to the dugout after the bottom of the first inning, nine Husky batsmen had stepped to the plate and the score was 6-0 in favor of Northeastern.
But to Stone’s credit, he stepped it up, settled down, and prevented any more scoring thereafter. The resilience required to shut down such a strong team after a bad start was a true “Bad Boy” effort.
“The first inning was a little bit shaky, but he bounced back,” said freshman pitcher/designated hitter Buddy Hayward. “None of us ever doubted him. He’s a true Bad Boy—we all knew that he was going to come out and shove. Post first-inning, Kevin Stone was the true Kevin Stone that we know and love.”
Stone didn’t have his best stuff, walking five, but still finished with a line of 5.0 IP, six hits, five earned runs, and two strikeouts. As head coach Bill Decker believed in him and let him stay in the game, the righty got the gutsy win to move to 3-2 as a pitcher.
The two-man relief effort following Stone’s exit was just as instrumental in preserving the Crimson’s win.
Junior outfielder John MacLean, thus far thriving this season on the mound, excelled in the sixth and seventh innings, giving up one hit and striking out one in 2.1 shutout innings. According to his teammates, MacLean had an interesting secret to success leading up to the game.
“None of us were surprised when he came in and did the job that needed to get done,” Hayward said. “I don’t know if you’ve seen his hair, but Johnny’s a little wild. He says he’s been eating only beans for the week leading up to this, just to get ready.”
Sophomore righty Kieran Shaw, fresh off a six-out save over the weekend, recorded a clean five-out save thereafter to send the teams home. The Los Gatos, Calif., native recorded two K’s, one of which was a swinging strikeout to end the game and begin the celebration.
Shaw didn’t need legumes to shut down the Northeastern offense, however.
“Keiran followed up with a great performance, just throwing strikes, getting guys out,” Hayward said. “It was awesome. It was so fun to watch from the dugout.”
While the pitching staff was busy keeping the Harvard squad in the game against a strong team, the offense used an explosive rally in the third inning to overcome the initial hole and never look back.
Down 6-2 in the top of the third, the Crimson got off on the right foot with a Seidl walk to lead off. Junior first baseman Pat McColl followed with a single, and junior slugger Patrick Robinson brought Seidl home with a single to inch Harvard closer.
Northeastern began making pitching changes.
With momentum on its side and the comeback in progress, the Crimson rattled off a huge inning perfectly exemplary of the crooked innings its offense has come to utilize. With one out, senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg smacked an RBI single to right to make it 6-4 and keep the bases loaded.
Mrowka then made the Huskies pay with a bases-clearing triple to the deepest part of Friedman Diamond, giving Harvard an unlikely 7-6 lead the Crimson pitchers would never relinquish.
“They came out swinging, got the 6-0 lead, but we came back, took the lead right back,” Peterson said. “The pitching staff, being the Bad Boys that they are, they came in and shut it down for the rest of the game. It took a lot of grit, but we were happy with it.”
Peterson’s sac fly to score the freshman tacked on an insurance run, but Mrowka’s three RBIs, his sixth, seventh, and eighth on the year, proved to be the winners.
With an 8-6 lead in hand, the Harvard pitching limited Northeastern to nine scattered hits on the game, though the Huskies got two loud flyball outs in the bottom of the sixth. The Crimson, meanwhile, got 11 hits, led by Rothenberg, McColl, Mrowka, and Peterson, who all had two-hits days.
Peterson got Harvard on the board with a two-RBI double in the second inning, an important hit that gave the Crimson an immediate response to the Huskies’ six-spot a frame prior.
“I was sitting dead-red, saw a pitch that I liked right in my wheelhouse,” said Peterson of his second-inning two-bagger. “Took a good swing on it, and luckily put it in the gap, scored a couple of runs. It felt pretty good to get the boys on the board.”
The loss denied the Northeastern its seventh Beanpot title but added to Harvard’s sole titles in 1991, 2005, and 2014. The Crimson won a joint title in 1998 with UMass when the championship game was rained out.

Sections
There’s only a month left till the semester is over, and you’ve realized that you need to be in your TF’s good graces to salvage your grade. Chances are, he/she doesn’t even know your name or doesn’t like you because you often fail to contribute “meaningful discourse” during section. Thankfully, it’s not too late. Use these Flyby-approved tactics to finally establish a connection with your TF and finish the semester on a strong (or at least passable) note.
Mutual Interests
“Oh my god, you listen to NPR too?” Try to find out what your TF does in his/her free time or has an interest in, and try to build some conversations out of it. This will make you memorable to the TF, and it shows that you might actually care about building connections and not just boosting your grade.
Office Hours Bananza
Go to office hours, but don’t be basic and ask for help on your p-set. Instead, delve in and express a deeper interest in the subject. Tell your TF that you were just fascinated with that lecture last Wednesday and was wondering where you could find more supplementary material to satiate your desire for more knowledge on the topic. Of course, don’t lay it on too thickly, but a show of deep interest should definitely work in your favor later on.
The Present
No, do not get your TF a $100 JCPenney gift card. Instead, go on the thoughtful track, and bring in some baked goods, or even better, a handmade gift that shows you care. Feeling that this takes too much finesse? Give your TF a handwritten card instead. A few words can go a long way.
The Early Bird
Want to look like a dedicated student? If you can, show up to section before your TF. Don’t just sit there, though: read some supplementary material on the section topic, or show off your studious nature by poring through your lecture notes. As a bonus, try to be the last kid to leave section. It shows dedication.
Manners
Sometimes all you need is some good manners. Simply saying a genuine “good morning” and “have a nice day” leaves a lasting impression. It shows acknowledgement and respect to your TF, something that anyone would certainly enjoy.
Bottom line is, don’t suck up too hard, but make sure you’re doing something that gets your TF to actually notice and appreciate you. Enjoy the rest of the semester!
