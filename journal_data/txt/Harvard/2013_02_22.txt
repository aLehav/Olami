After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No, I am not saying government is not “rocket science,” nor am I saying it is not “an exact science.” Government, simply put, is not a science. This is not to say that government should not use science, but rather that it should view science as a tool and not the basis of all insight.
It’s entirely understandable why government wants to be considered a science. Firstly, science describes things in definite terms. We can argue endlessly about whether Harvard is too liberal but we only have to count to discover 11.6 percent of Harvard votes Republican. The complex ideas we express in words take such energy to write, read, and debate, whereas a pie chart is a pie chart is a pie chart.
Secondly, the potential payoff of a foolproof formula for election prediction is incalculable.  Half of the Harvard student body worships before the secular altar of Nate Silver, and no, I do not have statistics to back that up. But why stop at description or prediction alone? Why not prescription! With the proper formula a scientist could produce “perfect” policies and to prove it, here are the numbers! Not convinced? Try more numbers!
Yet, for government to be treated as a science, certain assumptions have to be made that are contrary to the traditional conceptions of governing bodies. Government is fundamentally normative. Government exists to govern and to implement policy, courses of action to achieve aims. The “aims” of government are not reducible to hard and fast rules of nature like those concerning survival and evolution. Government is contrived from subjective morals and personal preferences. Science must be nothing more than a tool to examine a fundamentally normative premise. To derive from science the aim of government is to have the tail wagging the dog (which, as science tells me, is not what actually happens).
Science proper is the study of the natural and physical world by means of observation and experiment. The study of government is neither physical nor natural. How does one observe, say, the height or weight of a law? How does one physically transform into a senator? The government is supposed to exist to transcend the physical. We don’t need laws to be tangible to be effective or senators to transform for them to gain power. Neither is government natural. In fact, government was our solution when we wanted to escape nature. I keep waiting for my pet hamsters to form a proper assembly, but no luck yet.
Most importantly, scientists (real scientists, mind you) feel the need to distinguish between the “social sciences” and themselves. It is no coincidence that shortly after political academics started calling their field a science, departments like chemistry and physics responded by calling themselves “hard sciences.” I like the implication of this distinction; one may study hard science or easy-feeble-soft-kitten science.
I respect Harvard for having a “government” department and not a “political science” department. Yet the department lauds its aspiring political scientists with research grants, shiny new professors, and oodles of class options. Meanwhile the department forgets about its theorists and historians, the scientists’ moody, middle-aged, unemployed siblings.
I speak solely about the government department because I have firsthand experience with it. I’ve read countless papers attempting to shoehorn philosophy into formulas. I’ve seen students in section cite the Solow residual and wait patiently to be offered tenure at Yale. Quotes from Aristotle make for a good paper heading but are left unexamined.  Government has swung towards empiricism over rationalism. We think about what we observe and few observe what we actually think. Psychology has taken the place of political theory. Statistics has assumed the role of political history.
But just because something is normative or unverifiable does not mean it is not worthy of study. In fact, precisely because government is normative and unverifiable, it is extremely important to study. Anyone can talk politics and that’s what makes government so great and so difficult. “Political science” is, to a degree, elitist because few know the proper scientific terms. Anyone can argue what counts as an individual’s “right,” but few can tell me what homoscedasticity is. (Though it obviously means to have the same “scedasticity”).  As Gilbert, of Gilbert and Sullivan put it, “If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me, why, what a very singularly deep young man this deep young man must be!”
Back when MIT’s political science department included sociology, one mathematician noticed this very same trend. So I’ll leave you with the lyrics of Thomas A. Lehrer, Harvard grad, part-time mathematician, part-time musician, and full-time genius:
Joes, who wrote prose,
Now write algebra, who knows —
It may be sociology…
They consult, sounding occult,
Talking like a Mathematics PhD.
They can snow all their clients,
By calling it science,
Although it's only sociology!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was very late last Saturday night, in fact around three or four o’clock Sunday morning, when four or five men put their muscle to dislodging the bronze bust of James Russell Lowell from its pedestal in the Lowell House courtyard. What they thought they were doing is beyond my imagining. The bust is heavy, weighing perhaps 500 pounds. It could not have been easy to pry it up from its base. Indeed, the groove at the top of the pedestal seems to have been made by a crowbar, hammered into the base. The bolts that held the piece in place were four or five inches long and came out of the base with the bronze bust when it was toppled to the ground. At that point at least four strong men must have dragged the bust behind the yew trees to a huge garbage can with wheels into which they perhaps thought they could slide the bust, then tip it up and wheel it away. . .somewhere. Alas, this was probably beyond their strength, or perhaps it dawned on them that there was nowhere to go wheeling a huge and heavy trashcan. Or perhaps they had a sighting of the Securitas officer. In any case, James Russell Lowell lay with his head in an overturned trashcan as the snow fell that night.
James Russell Lowell, Class of 1838, was born at Elmwood, the Lowell family estate in Cambridge, now the residence of the president of Harvard University. He was a poet, an abolitionist, and ambassador to Spain and later to the Court of St. James. The artist Daniel Chester French (1850-1931) grew up in Concord and briefly attended MIT before undertaking an apprenticeship as a sculptor. His first work was in his native Concord when, at the age of 24, he cast the bronze image of the Minuteman that stands on Concord Green. At Harvard, his best-known work is the statue of John Harvard (1884), and nationwide it is the marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. (1920). The bronze bust of Lowell was commissioned by the Harvard Class of 1883 to be placed in Massachusetts Hall. It was moved to Lowell House soon after the House was built in 1930.
Being a House Master at Harvard is a many-sided job, which is why I consider it a joy. On a week like this one, it involves not only teaching a full load of classes, but also pouring a hundred cups of tea on Thursday, attending a Master’s Dinner with government professor Beth A. Simmons, listening to two five-minute Lowell House speeches each night, delivered by our students in the Dining Hall, interviewing talented graduate students applying to be resident tutors, encouraging our Dining Hall staff when the Lowerator breaks yet again and they have to scrape and stack all the dirty dishes, and hosting a cocktail party for the support of the Lowell House Opera.
Being a House Master also includes taking responsibility as a curator for the portraits, sculptures, and furnishings of the House, most of which are the property of the Harvard Art Museums. Last summer, I spent a month creating a booklet, “Hanging Around Lowell House,” documenting and describing for students and visitors the portraits of the men and women, mostly men, who live with us in the Dining Hall, the Common Rooms, the Courtyard, and the Masters’ Residence. Of course, there were a lot of Lowells, and none more beloved in 19th century Harvard than James Russell Lowell. It was not a joy to find him snow-covered in a trashcan on Sunday.
It took five men from the University Art Museums to lift the bronze bust, to slide it onto a sled to be wrapped, secured, and wheeled away. The Fogg staff present assured us that this could not possibly have been an attempted art theft, calculated to get a Daniel Chester French bronze into the market. It was surely, as we all might have imagined, a misguided, alcohol-soaked caper linked, perhaps, to inter-house rivalry or to the theft that same night of the Lowell House banner that has hung in the Dining Hall each night for the past month as a backdrop to the podium where our students deliver their speeches.
It is my hope that those who toppled this bronze bust will come forward to amend this act and offer compensation to have the bust restored to its place. I hope they do so for their sake and for the good of a community in which theft and vandalism have no place in community spirit. But whatever happens, I hope this act will have a sobering effect on those involved when they think about what they have done. And I am quite certain that when they take their families to pose at the John Harvard statue or take their children to the Lincoln Memorial, they will remember this late-night incident with deep regret.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m probably the only one, but with all the talk about depression at Harvard my mind has been jumping to John Stuart Mill, who once argued, “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.”
I said it to my Social Studies tutorial sophomore year and I’ll say it again: I’d be a happy pig over a miserable man any day. Mill offers various reasons why he thinks few people would agree to become one of the “lower” animals, including pride, independence, power, and dignity. None of those things really get me inspired to be an unhappy human being. And I certainly wouldn’t care much about them if I were a pig (though future pig research may prove me wrong). Give me some slop and some mud, and you can go on contemplating the meaninglessness of life.
The memory made me wonder whether Harvard students’ intelligence may be the cause of our higher-than-average rates of depression and suicide.
Many point primarily to Harvard’s pressure-cooker failure-shaming environment. Lord knows that there is truth to that characterization, though I would argue that your average Harvard student pressures himself infinitely more than anyone else does.
What, though, converts this pressure-induced stress into chronic depression and suicidal thoughts? High intelligence may be the culprit.
Though I could find no study showing a correlation between generic depression and intelligence, psychologist James Webb reports that highly intelligent people are more likely to suffer from what he terms “existential depression,” which entails struggles with certain basic issues of existence: mortality, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness.
Translation: Death is inevitable. No one can decide what life path you should choose but you, and there are no absolute standards by which to judge your decision. No matter how close you grow to another person, a gap will always remain. “Meaninglessness stems from the first three,” Webb explained after waking up on the wrong side of the bed. “If we must die, if we construct our own world, and if each of us is ultimately alone, then what meaning does life have?”
Existential crises are a universal phenomenon, of course, but they seem to happen particularly frequently and severely with Harvard students. Perhaps our analytical or secular tendencies stubbornly refuse to allow us to ignore the absurdities of life. Perhaps Harvard students take an unusually nasty shock to their sense of place in the universe when they discover that they are no longer smarter than everyone around them or destined to change history.
Woody Allen once said, “It's very hard to keep your spirits up. You've got to keep selling yourself a bill of goods, and some people are better at lying to themselves than others. If you face reality too much, it kills you.”
Cynical? Sure. True? For a lot of students here, yes.
My hunch is that being intelligent makes it harder to sell yourself a bill of goods. A lot of Harvard students are overextended, unhappy, concentrating in subjects they dislike, and entering careers they have no interest in. They know it, too, but won’t take the pressure off themselves for fear of admitting defeat. For some, depression and suicidal thoughts may result.
For many Harvard students, college is a brutal cycle of crushing course loads, demanding extracurriculars, endless deadlines, lack of sleep, frayed nerves, loneliness, and numbing, debaucherous escapes. Some eventually question whether Harvard is really worth it in the end.
“Why can’t I hack it? Besides, is the opportunity to go spend a few more years of my life in another potentially highly stressful environment – whether it’s Wall Street, consulting, medical school, or law school – worth being unhappy and stressed during the four years that many of my friends are spending at party schools? If it’s not, then why am I here? And how could I leave without having to endure the barely concealed judgment of classmates, friends, and family who thought I could handle Harvard?”
Obviously I cannot presume to fully understand anyone else’s depression, and the picture of mental health at Harvard that I’ve sketched is not comprehensive. But I believe it is part of the reality, and having a better understanding of why the Harvard personality type may be converting school stress into existential crises allows us to more effectively help those suffering from depression on campus. For better or worse, we are a campus closer to the Socrates end of the spectrum than the fool end. We need mental health resources that can address the accompanying unique concerns (since pig reincarnation, scientists tell us, is decades away).
Oftentimes, though, no therapist or Tumblr or voice on a hotline (useful as they are) can substitute for another regular human being who’ll sit in front of someone they can sense isn’t quite right, look him or her in the eyes, ask what’s wrong, mean it, and listen. We all have a responsibility to be that person, and there’s no shortage of students here waiting for someone to reach out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We have all seen it. That person checking their email in lecture. Or creeping Facebook in section. Or trawling the Web for good deals during seminar. Now, some professors are taking notice, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may follow suit.
Last week, The Crimson reported on the status of laptop use at the College. Right now, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has no computer policy, allowing instructors to set their own rules about electronic devices. Yet this could soon change, as the issue of students using the internet during lecture has become a staple of faculty gatherings. Already, faculty members across the departments are placing bans on laptop use, deciding that “at the moment…arguments in favor of disallowing [laptops] outweigh” the positives.
Professors should be fed up, and we agree that something has to be done. A few instructors have forbidden laptops entirely. We think that is a non-starter, and we find such an approach paternalistic and impractical. Our generation never learned shorthand, and today’s Harvard students take notes on computers or tablets. Mandating that everyone hand-write lecture notes would be problematic, especially for people who write down their instructor’s every word. Further, it would arbitrarily disadvantage those whose handwriting is on the slower end of the spectrum.
Yet there are other ways to minimize distraction in class. One possibility, mentioned by some faculty, is to turn off internet access during lecture. This would give electronic note-takers all the leeway they need, while eliminating the specter of online distraction.
On the other hand, seminars and humanities-based sections are a different matter. Instructors and teaching fellows should have a right to restrict the use of laptops in these classes. Here, students are not meant to be stenographers, but rather active participants in discussion. Dialogue and repartee require an intimate learning environment, an aim hindered by the presence of electronic devices. We realize that many courses assign hundreds of pages of reading material per week and that some readings will have to be accessed electronically to save money and paper. For this reason, some seminars and sections allow Kindles or iPads, while others permit laptops, guarding against Facebook and Gmail through spot checks.
We lament the delinquent behavior that laptops enable, and this situation must be remedied. However, an engaged classroom is not irreconcilable with computers and other electronics, which are valuable educational tools that enhance the educational experience of many students. We must not let this make Luddites of us all.

If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic "Are there serious deficiencies with Harvard's mental health services?" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, Feb. 27 at 6 pm .
Democracy, the Ugly Kid
Let me be clear: I am emphatically opposed to the Boy Scouts of America’s policy of excluding openly gay individuals from its membership. Yes, the policy further isoaltesadolescents questioning their sexualities. Yes, it is considered by many to be “backwards” in a progressive age. Yes, such a policy contradicts the Scouts’ own oath to “help other people at all times.”
Nevertheless, I even more emphatically support BSA’s right to hold such views. Boy Scouts of America is a private, non-governmental organization supported entirely by donations. As such, the Supreme Court has held in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that their freedom of association allows them to exclude members that hinder the group’s ability to “advocate public or private viewpoints.” Where opponents of the Dale decision err, though, is their assumption that the freedom of association is a blanket protection of the organization from individual or group efforts to change these values. Wrong. Freedom of association protects BSA only from a government intervention. Actions such as Eagle Scouts renouncing their medals or legislation banning the organization’s tax exemption are still rightfully allowed.
Freedom of association, a derivative of the freedom of speech, states that “Congress shall make no law” infringing on individual or collective rights. Let’s imagine that Congress disbanded any organization that expelled or banned members on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. How many churches, country clubs, cultural groups, fraternities, sororities, and political parties must the government then dismantle to prove its point, and with what consequences for the civic life of our country? The right to band together around a set of views—savory or unsavory, radical or conservative—is the fundamental cornerstone of democracy that we must consciously guard against trampling, as progressive as our intent may be.
Democracy is not the homecoming queen; it’s the ugly kid in the back of the room that we still include at recess. Democracy is tough and ugly in a country as large and diverse as ours. At times, it is easy to dismiss others’ viewpoints as “incorrect” or “un-American,” but we must always, as Franklin stated, “defend to the death” their right to hold those views, because like it or not, they are equally sovereign parts in this centuries-long project of self-rule.

The Boy Scouts of America and the Limits of Free Speech
When the Supreme Court decided Boy Scouts of America v. Dale in 2000, it did so by the thinnest possible margin—a 5/4 split. At issue in the case was whether a New Jersey ordinance mandating nondiscrimination in places of public accommodation unconstitutionally infringed upon the Scout’s freedom of speech. The controversial ruling ultimately upheld the Scout’s discriminatory ban on gay members, deeming it a form of expressive association protected under the First Amendment.
From the day it was decided, Dale stood out like a sore thumb against the remainder of the Court’s free speech jurisprudence. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent, it marked the first time in the Court’s entire history that “a claimed right to associate in the selection of members prevailed in the face of a State’s antidiscrimination law.”
What is worse, in the 13 years that have elapsed since Dale’s issuance, there has arisen the mistaken belief, especially among communities of so-called intelligent people, that the Constitution generally affords all private organizations the right to exclude any person from membership on the basis of freedom of association. This is false. Anyone who claims otherwise has either not read Dale, or has misinterpreted the ruling.
As the majority opinion clearly noted, state laws prohibiting membership discrimination are wholly germane unless—and this is the key to understanding Dale—“it affects in a significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints,” in which case the ordinance would fail constitutional muster. It is for this reason that Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, keenly noted the Court is “obligated to independently review the factual record.” In other words, the Court must carefully attend to the facts and decide for itself, without deference to a group’s opinion, whether compliance with a state’s anti-discrimination law affects the group’s ability to express a viewpoint in a significant way.
This legal standard balances the state’s compelling interest in eradicating the socially corrosive effects of invidious discrimination, against a private organization’s interest in freedom of expression. Although the requirement may seem highly subjective, it has been a fairly high bar for most of the Court’s history, placing a considerable onus on private organizations to prove their core expressive functions are seriously curtailed through compliance with generally applicable non-discrimination ordinances. Because this legal standard has teeth, most private organizations remain, to this day, prohibited in many states from discriminating in membership on the basis of a litany of categories. It is only when it comes to gay people that the legal standard losses its force.
The reason for this seeming anomaly rests, as Justice Stevens noted, not in logic, but in the atavistic attitudes of his colleagues. Luckily for those of us sympathetic to the cause of equality, Dale need not be an everlasting curse. If there is one truth in our system of law it is this: Beyond the Supreme Court always lies a further court of appeals, the American people. If recent shifts in attitudes are any indication, Dale will not be with us for much longer.

The Boy Scouts of America and the Limits of Free Speech
Yes, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The Boy Scouts of America is, to the best of my knowledge, a private organization funded by members and private donors, and thus the government has no role in dictating decisions regarding its membership. Should it choose to, BSA should have the right to discriminate among its leaders and members according to its founding principles, provided it does so without actively harassing people outside of its contained operations.
However, the questions of should BSA be allowed to and should they are entirely different and must be addressed as such. During my many years as a scout, I met a number of other scouts who did not necessarily fall within BSA restrictions of membership. These people contributed to and gained from the program as much as I did, and certainly left their respective troops better than they found them. The teaching of the principles of scouting to these people certainly follows the BSA’s mission statement: “to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.”
Clearly BSA believes that the inclusion of homosexuals and agnostics is a violation of the oath’s lines, “to do my duty to God and my country,” and “to keep myself … morally straight.” However, these people’s individual beliefs are antithetical to the oath and law only under the strict lens of conservative Christianity, which set the guiding principles behind the founding of BSA in the early 1900s. That lens should no longer be used to judge the value of potential members because it no longer accurately reflects the moral zeitgeist. I believe that homosexuals, heterosexuals, atheists, agnostics, and believers alike can greatly benefit from the strong foundational principles that govern the scouting experience, and that they can greatly contribute to the program in return. So should BSA be allowed to exclude persons from membership? Yes. But should they? A resounding no.

Universal Acceptance
Growing up as a Boy Scout, I never thought my ability to join this organization was based on a “freedom of association”; the only thing that concerned me was making friends and having fun.  One year removed from my Eagle Scout ceremony, it saddens me to think that boys as young as six will be prevented from joining this organization due to their beliefs. Although the Supreme Court declared in 2000 that the Boy Scouts of America has the freedom to ban members whose beliefs conflict with the organization’s “expressive message,” the continuation of this policy in no way benefits Scouts or Scouters.  If the BSA’s mission statement states that the goal of Scouting is “to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices,” then the continued exclusion of members from Scouting contradicts this essential goal.  By preventing prospective Scouts from expressing their identity, this policy inhibits the development of each and every Scout.  The preparation these young men go through does not happen in a vacuum; it occurs through exposure to others, regardless of race, sexuality, or religion.  Rather than adopt a universal policy barring membership, the BSA should instead attempt to foster a sense of community and acceptance.
When I first joined the Boy Scouts of America, I was just a shy first grader who wanted to make some friends.  Throughout my years in this organization, I learned more through exposure to my peers than I did by practicing knots or lashings.  Recently, the BSA decided to reconsider its ban on openly gay members.  Hopefully this organization will honor its rich history by removing not only its ban on gay Scouts, but removing all membership restrictions, creating an accepting environment for all.

Freedom to Discriminate
Although, as the Chief Executive of the Boy Scouts of America claims, all organizations have the right to membership criteria, these criteria should not be based upon inherent conditions over which a person has no control. Freedom of association should not extend to the ability to discriminate, especially when a group has “quasi-official status,” which the BSA benefits from, according to legal scholar Andrew Koppelman. By excluding people on the basis of sexual orientation, gender, race or disability status, the organization in question perpetuates social stigmas and sends the message that those excluded are inferior. These messages are not only detrimental to those excluded but also to the members of this organization, as they are implicitly associated with discrimination at the very least and may be more susceptible to biases. For this reason, the admissions criteria for youth organizations should be held to a much higher standard.
Youth organizations can be highly influential in the lives of children and can have a large impact on their perspective later in life. As such, any prejudices transmitted to children at this formative period of their lives will most likely influence their actions in one way or another for a large portion of their lives. According to an article from Rolling Stone, LGBT Scouts often experience identity crises. Conversely, Scouts may grapple with their own prejudice as a result of BSA’s policies. Currently, LGBT teenagers face high levels of discrimination at the hands of their peers, which could be exacerbated by the exclusion of LGBT members on the grounds that they cannot comply with the organization’s moral values. As the effects of exclusionary policies negatively affect all of society, they should be banned.

Out of Hopeful Green Stuff Woven
The fewer policies that the Boy Scouts of America has regulating membership, the better the organization will fulfill its goal of spurring personal growth in teenage boys. The core value of scouting is found in its lack of adult involvement and overbearing direction—that’s how it fosters independence and self-discovery.
I only learned about scouting’s exclusionary membership policy from the newspaper. In my troop, we never discussed whether someone should or should not be a scout. All you had to do was show up at a meeting to become one. Our scoutmasters were little more than organizers. They gave us money for buying supplies, drove us to a campsite, and then sat back and watched while we figured out how to help each other set up tents, build fires, and protect ourselves from the rain.
In the midst of idyllic groves and creeks, pitching campsites was analogous to pitching identities. Issues that were forbidden in classrooms were the staple of our fireside conversations—all sorts of naïve misconceptions and prejudices were floated regarding class, ethnicity, gender, and courtship—only to be quickly challenged by some and subjected to discussion by all. Despite the fanciful notions of scouting’s national leaders, there are few environments more saturated with covert talk about sexuality than a Boy Scout campsite in the middle of the Midwestern woodlands.
Our troop was successful because it created a community of equals in which scouts could challenge their conceptions of self and society and grow as individuals. If our troop had more diverse membership, this dynamic would only have been more positive.
The most beautiful part of scouting is its kaleidoscopic nature: Many local troops, with traditions of their own, each of which is made up of unique individuals, creating distinct identities for themselves. Like our country, scouting must not be afraid to contradict itself, to be large and contain multitudes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors interviewed by The Crimson praised discussions on changing the structure of reading period to better accommodate students who primarily take courses with final papers.
The proposal, discussed at the Committee on Undergraduate Education’s meeting on Feb. 6, would change the structure of reading period so that final assignments and papers would be due on specified days during exam period rather than reading period. Students would find out exam and due dates during shopping week.
“This change, if it goes through, should give students in courses with final projects or papers, rather than final exams, more time to complete them: the result could be more and better learning for everyone,” English professor Stephen L. Burt wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Cheryl B. Welch, director of undergraduate studies in the Government Department, told The Crimson in an email that she approves of the proposal.
“As different ways of assessing student work have become more common, it seems odd to save a long period only for traditional seated exams,” Welch wrote. “I know of many cases where students get completely jammed up with paper and project deadlines in Reading Period and then have nothing in exam period.”
Folklore and mythology professor Maria Tatar said she regularly encounters students in the humanities with over 70 pages to write during reading period—something that would change if a recent proposal becomes policy. Tatar added that she would be able to expect her students to spend more time on their final papers without the need to rush to finish by the middle of reading period.
Amanda J. Claybaugh, an English professor who attended the meeting when Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris introduced the proposal, said that the suggested changes made her consider problems with the current system. The proposal, she said, is an “excellent solution.”
“What was interesting to me about the meeting was that I really hadn’t thought about the implications of student scheduling when I [assigned] paper deadlines,” Claybaugh said, adding that her final paper deadlines are during exam period already.
Undergraduate Council Education Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15, who attended the committee meeting, said the proposal could have positive effects on students because it would give those with multiple final papers more time to complete assignments and ensure that due dates would be spread out.
In an interview on the evening of the committee meeting, UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 told The Crimson that many students would probably welcome the change. But going forward in the discussion, she added, the UC wants to make sure that the change would not “add additional burden” on students during “an academically stressful time."

Harvard College received a record 35,022 applications for the class of 2017, 719 more than last year, the University announced early Friday morning.
Although the 2 percent increase represents the first time ever that Harvard’s application numbers have broken the 35,000 mark, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 called this year’s numbers “a continuity.”
“We’ve had really about the same number of applications for three years now,” Fitzsimmons said. “From year to year it can almost be noise in the system when you have a small increase or a small decrease.”
Fitzsimmons attributed Harvard’s consistently high application numbers to the school’s “steadfast” recruitment process.
The College reaches out to potential applicants in a number of ways. Using the College Board’s Student Search Service, Harvard writes to thousands of high school students every year. Admissions officers spend months traveling both internationally and to over 120 American cities to encourage people to apply.
“Really over the past decade or so, we’ve had a very steady outreach,” Fitzsimmons said.
According to Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73, the demographic makeup of applicant pool to the Class of 2017 is similar to that of previous years. Following two years when Harvard’s computer science concentration has nearly doubled in size, this year’s applicant pool saw a “26 percent increase in prospective computer scientists,” McGrath said in a press release.
Fitzsimmons said that although the exact number of applicants may fluctuate from year to year, the admissions office prioritizes ensuring “that we reach, one way or the other, all of the people who have a chance of getting in.”
“Our theory is not to focus on the number of applications, but to make sure that the quality and diversity, often the very same thing, of the pool is robust every year,” he said.
According to Harvard College Director of Financial Aid Sarah C. Donahue, this year’s applicants demonstrated a greater level of economic diversity than those of year’s past, with 37 percent more students requesting that the application fee be waived—a figure that she said in a press release indicates “more applicants from low- and modest-income backgrounds.”
Thus far, the College has already accepted 895 students from an early applicant pool of 4,856 people. Those accepted to the Class of 2017 in the fall represent the second group to be admitted early since the University reinstated its early action program in 2011.
Applications to Yale this year rose 3 percent to an all-time high of 29,790. Princeton University received 26,505 applications, and Columbia, 33,460.
The University of Pennsylvania received 31,219 applications—one more than the 31,218 it received last year. About 22,400 applied to Dartmouth and 28,807 to Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira introduced new initiatives to help undergraduates cope with mental health issues during a Committee on Student Life meeting Thursday.
To strengthen UHS’s efforts in confronting mental health challenges, Barreira said that the University has begun to hire a number of full-time psychiatrists who will focus their attention exclusively on students’ mental well-being.
“The college age group is when many of the most common psychiatric problems first commonly present themselves,” Barreira told The Crimson in an interview.
HUHS has been criticized in the past for its mental health services, with students complaining about the lack of personalized attention for patients and the perceived specter of being pressured to take time off from school for mental health concerns.
According to Barreira, the hiring of more psychiatrists will not only strengthen the University’s ability to deal with mental health cases, but also help tackle some of the underlying pressures that students may face.
Being away from home for the first time, managing the college workload, and dealing with uncertainty about the future are all factors that contribute to student stress, Barreira said.
Barreira said he thinks getting students to open up about their well-being may be the biggest challenge. Although it is becoming increasingly more acceptable to talk about depression and other mental illnesses, there is still a “stigma around admitting failure,” Barreira said.
“Rather than coming in open-eyed and inquisitive, [students] shut down,” Barriera said.
To help address the problem, UHS plans to release a series of videos similar to those in the “It Gets Better” video campaign—a nationwide project that releases videos encouraging LGBTQ youths to believe in their potential for happiness as adults
“It’s always good to hear that people are actively involved,” said Tijana Katushevska '16, a member of the Undergraduate Council’s Committee on Student Life. “Everything [Barreira] suggested seemed helpful.”
At the meeting, Barreira also introduced a number of student-initiated programs relating to both mental and physical health, including the creation of a peer education group related to general health scheduled to debut in the fall 2013, and Crimson EMS—a student run ambulance service that already has about 30 trained students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department this week became among the first departments in the country to use Twitter to report potential crimes in nearly real time.
Since launching the new initiative earlier this week, the department has begun using its Twitter account, @CambridgePolice, to alert its nearly 3,900 followers of possible criminal activity, disturbances, and neighborhood incidents—all in 140 characters or fewer. The tweets, which are sent out by an automated system using descriptions filed from 911 calls, have been appearing just minutes after the completion of a 911 call.
At 7:25 p.m. on Tuesday night, Twitter-savvy Cambridge residents could have read of a potential assault on Broadway Street. And early Wednesday evening, residents of Chilton Street who followed CPD on Twitter could have seen a tweet about a possible missing person in their area.
The new tweets each begin with a timestamp followed by a summary of the reported incident and the hashtag #CambMA.
Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas said in a press release that the new initiative was part of the department’s strategy to use social media to engage with Cantabrigians.
“This is something we’ve had in the works for a while,” Haas said. “Tweeting information about serious incidents will better inform our residents about what types of incidents police are responding to in their community.”
CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello also stressed that timely communication was a top priority of the project.
“It’s a way to share information in real time, so people know what’s going on with their community,” he said.
According to Riviello, the new program does not entail a change of procedure for the department or its officers. The text of the tweets is generated from the brief reports that emergency operators file after every 911 call and that are used to dispatch officers. From there, a new application designed by CPD and the Cambridge Emergency Communications Department sorts through the reports and, after a short delay, shares incidents that meet CPD’s criteria via Twitter. These include most reports related to serious crime, with the exception of murder and rape.
Riviello said he believes CPD is only the second police department to broadcast reported incidents almost after they happen. Last year, the Seattle Police Department pioneered the new strategy by launching 51 hyper-local accounts on Twitter to report potential crime in city neighborhoods.
Riviello said that the public’s response to CPD’s new initiative “seems actually to be pretty positive.”
But in the Twitterverse, reviews have been mixed. While some Twitter users praised the strategy, writing that they appreciated CPD’s efforts to keep them informed, others were more skeptical of the new crime updates. One common criticism voiced on Twitter was that CPD’s automated system does not automatically update followers on the outcome of the initial reports it disseminates.
For example, on Wednesday afternoon, the department tweeted “report of possible person with gun on JFK [S]treet in #CambMA.” When no immediate updates were posted, multiple users complained about the lack of follow-up tweets. Thirty-three minutes later, CPD tweeted that the gun report had been unfounded.
Following the incident, Cambridge resident and Twitter user Jeremy Rothman-Shore questioned the prudence of CPD’s new strategy. He wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening: “Messages like that make people feel unreasonably unsafe in their own city...Every city has reports of people with guns. But [C]ambridge is now shouting it from the rooftops. It doesn’t make us safer.”

CORRECTION: February 23, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted a tweet written by Cambridge resident Jeremy Rothman-Shore. In fact, Rothman-Shore wrote on Twitter that he believes that some disseminated information about crime, such as a tweet about a report of a person with a gun circulated by the Cambridge Police Department, makes citizens feel "unreasonably unsafe," not "unreasonably safe."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To some, the “preponderance of the evidence” standard is “crucial to the fair and equal treatment of women.” To others, it is a “fatally flawed” path to “injustice” that erodes the rights of students.
In recent months, an expired piece of legislation has placed a few words of legal jargon, tucked away in the disciplinary codes of colleges and universities all over the country, at the forefront of a polarizing national debate. The argument centers around a charged question: how much evidence should an institution of higher education require to find an accused student guilty of sexual misconduct?
The preponderance of the evidence standard might not mean much to the average American, but to many of the activists watching Congress debate the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, it is a pivot point for the future of America’s universities. Those four words have been caught in the middle of a months-long battle to renew the legislation, which contains new provisions that explicitly regulate the sexual assault investigations conducted by institutions of higher education.
An early draft of VAWA contained language which would have mandated colleges and universities to adopt the standard, which would make it easier to discipline students accused of sexual misconduct. But last week, the U.S. Senate approved a version of VAWA that dropped the clause entirely. The Senate’s bill must still be reconciled with a rival version in the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law by President Barack Obama.
For schools like Harvard, which do not use the preponderance of the evidence standard, the Senate’s bill offers a momentary reprieve from external pressure to adopt a lower burden of proof. But even though it does not legally require Harvard to alter its standard of evidence, the bill still leaves the door open for federally mandated changes in the way the Administrative Board handles cases of sexual assault.
FOUR WORDS
Drafted in 1994 by then-senator Joe Biden, VAWA allocated federal funds to help streamline the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against both men and women.
The act was reauthorized in 2000 and 2005 with bipartisan support, but hit a snag when it was considered for renewal in 2012. House Republicans objected to new provisions that extended parts of the legislation to Indian reservations and  undocumented immigrants. Ultimately, differences between the versions of the bill drafted by the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican House prevented the legislation from being renewed before 2013.
At the same time, a separate debate raged over new portions of the bill that concerned sexual assault on college campuses. An early draft of VAWA incorporated much of the language of the Campus SaVE Act, a bill that Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey introduced in 2011 to reduce sexual violence on college campuses. Among other changes, the bill would have mandated that colleges and universities adopt the preponderance of the evidence metric when investigating sexual assault cases.
The standard, which is also the legal burden of proof used in U.S. civil courts, would require that a university’s disciplinary body be at least 51 percent convinced of a student’s guilt before meting out a punishment for a sexual offence. Compared to the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal courts that deal with sexual assault, a preponderance of the evidence rule requires less certainty.
LOOKING INWARD
Currently, Harvard has no standardized burden of proof for disciplinary proceedings across its various schools. The Law School uses the more stringent “clear and convincing evidence” standard—typically considered to require about 80 percent certainty of guilt—and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences mandates that the members of the Administrative Board be “sufficiently persuaded” of an accused student’s guilt before assigning a punishment.
While the Law School’s standard has been criticized for making it difficult for victims to attain justice, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ standard has come under fire for being too vague.
“I think it’s very unclear what ‘sufficiently persuaded’ means,” said Kristi L. Jobson ’06, a law clerk at the Massachusetts Appeals Court. “It could be lower than preponderance of evidence or higher than that. We just don’t know.”
In the Ivy League, only Harvard and Princeton do not use the preponderance of the evidence standard. Princeton employs a “clear and persuasive” standard.
In fall of 2011, Yale announced that it would adopt the lower standard after the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights launched a 15-month investigation of the university for alleged violations of Title IX.
Last June, Harvard’s Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said that Harvard did not have plans to change its sexual assault policies in response to Yale’s move.
When asked for comment on the Senate’s VAWA bill, a Harvard spokesperson revealed that the University has hired a Title IX coordinator to oversee compliance with the law across Harvard’s schools.
“We think we have some strong policies and processes in place at Harvard. That said, we are continually reviewing our practices and we are always open to refinements,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email. “Going forward, we are continuing to think hard about these issues, which we know are of such importance to students.”
UNDER PRESSURE
Although the current text of the VAWA bill would not require Harvard to change its standard of evidence, the University may still face pressure to change its procedures in compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which requires schools receiving federal funding to implement sexual assault policies that promote “equal access” to education for women.
In April 2011, the Office for Civil Rights sent out a “Dear Colleague” letter to colleges and universities, recommending that schools that receive federal funding use the preponderance of the evidence standard in their grievance procedures in order to remain in compliance with Title IX.
But the letter—which the Department of Education calls a “significant guidance document”—is neither a regulation nor a mandate which schools are legally required to follow. Still, schools that refuse to adopt the new standards risk a formal investigation of Title IX compliance by the Office for Civil Rights, which could result in the loss of federal funding.
S. Daniel Carter, a campus safety advocate who helped lobby for the Campus SaVE Act, said that the Senate’s VAWA bill “neither affirms nor undermines” the preponderance of the evidence standard as promoted by the Office for Civil Rights.
“We do not believe that the VAWA reauthorization is structured in a way that will undermine Title IX,” said Carter, who works for the VTV Family Outreach Foundation, a nonprofit group that pushed for the revised version of the act.
Carter added that the “substantive essence” of the bill remained intact, even though the preponderance of evidence clause had been removed.
But Wendy Murphy, a law professor at the New England School of Law who filed a 2011 Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School that is currently being investigated by the Office for Civil Rights, expressed concerns about the revised VAWA’s impact on the OCR’s “Dear Colleague” letter. Since VAWA does not explicitly codify the preponderance of evidence standard, she said, schools might point to the bill as proof that the lower standard is not required by federal law.
Still, Murphy said, “It’s better to have nothing in place than to codify a higher standard.”
Even the detractors of the “preponderance of evidence” benchmark agree that the new law will push universities towards the less stringent standard.
“Even if that standard is not codified in federal law, it’s being promulgated by a federal regulatory agency, and many schools will probably start to abide by it,” said Wendy Kaminer, a lawyer who has spoken out against the act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ‘14 urged UC representatives to attend a student-organized rally demanding that the administration take action on mental health in an email sent over the Council’s mailing list early Friday morning.
“As advocates for students, we need to be there to express our support for our peers,” she wrote. “This is an incredibly important moment for our community.”
The rally is scheduled to take place just one day after an anonymous Crimson op-ed written by a Harvard undergraduate with schizophrenia sparked conversations about mental health across campus and attracted attention on social media websites. According to the email and various online postings, the demonstration is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. Friday outside of Massachusetts Hall—home to the offices of senior Harvard officials including University President Drew G. Faust.
The organizers of the event are unknown, but a commenter on The Crimson’s website appears to have nudged the call to action.
“Enough is enough, how many ‘I Am Fine’s, anonymous op-eds, mental health exposes, and suicides is it going to take before we, the students, demand action?” the commenter asked. “Why isn’t the UC holding demonstrations outside Mass Hall? Why aren’t we all?”
“Let’s demand that the admin address students’ mental health needs. Spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, house email lists. We can demand change,” the comment continued.
An apparently different commenter responded on the discussion forum urging students to rally support.
“[W]e’ve asked politely, for years, in our panels, discussions, op-eds, spoken word performances, student advocacy groups, and nothing has happened. It’s time to ask in person,” the post read.
In addition to the rally, some UC representatives planned to meet with University Health Services spokesperson Lindsey Baker Friday morning to discuss the op-ed and mental health resources at Harvard, according to emails sent over the UC mailing list.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 23, 2013, at 2:34 p.m.
Chanting the words “Reform mental health” and “Our Harvard can do better,” a group of more than 150 students gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall Friday afternoon to urge administrators to take action on mental health.
“The drumbeat of student voices for reform is growing, but change is happening too slowly,” Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said in an interview. “It's our responsibility to step in and advocate for students.”
The rally came one day after an anonymous Crimson op-ed written by an undergraduate student with schizophrenia generated dialogue in dining halls, on email lists, and on social media sites about perceived flaws in mental health services at Harvard. Also on Thursday, Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira spoke at a Committee on Student Life meeting to present several University mental health initiatives, including the hiring of a number of full-time psychiatrists whose work will be devoted exclusively to improving students’ mental well-being.
At Friday’s rally, the demonstrators arranged themselves into a large circle, and for one hour, shared personal experiences with UHS and brainstormed a list of specific demands from the administration. That list, in addition to other signs written by demonstrators, was hung on the facade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and other senior administrators.
“I lost 4 friends to suicide in 6 weeks. I’m not better,” read one sign. “Harvard we are MAD,” read another.
Twenty minutes into the rally, Assistant Dean for Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña entered the circle and offered a warm room for students to discuss their concerns with administrators and Barreira.
“We are willing to sit down, we’ll listen for as long as you want us to be there,” said dela Peña.
Although demonstrators turned down the offer and continued their discussion outdoors, dela Peña promised that administrators would review the signs and pass along the list of demands.
During the discussion, students called on Harvard to clarify its policies regarding leaves of absences, provide students with advocates within the system, ensure that financial resources do not prevent students from obtaining care, personalize what one student characterized as an “impersonal” system, and hire more therapists to cut down on wait times.
Late Friday, UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker released a statement in response to the op-ed that sparked the rally.
“The health of Harvard students and all of our patients is of the utmost importance and we consider it to be our top priority,” Baker wrote.
In her statement, Baker wrote that there is no monetary cap on prescription drug benefits through the Harvard University Student Health Program, which covers mental health and other health services and is available to all registered students. Baker also wrote that UHS offers need-based financial assistance through a special Medical Hardship Fund and “makes every effort” to schedule appointments in a timely manner.
“Anyone with an urgent need can usually be seen within 24 hours, and anyone with an emergency can be seen almost immediately,” she wrote.
In the hours before the rally, undergraduates mobilized to promote the demonstration via House mailing lists, Facebook, Twitter, text messages, and word of mouth. Some student groups—including “Our Harvard Can Do Better,” which campaigns for reform of Harvard's sexual assault policies voiced support for the demonstrators’ cause or asked members to attend.
“The Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign recognize that mental health intersects with sexual violence,” the group wrote in an email sent over the Harvard College Democrats email list. “We, the student body will stand together in holding our school accountable for its policies that too often have driven many of us to despair and failure.”
Raghuveer also urged UC representatives to join her at the rally in an email sent over the Council’s mailing list early Friday morning. A number of students affiliated with the UC, including former UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13, former UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, and current UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, were in attendance at Friday's demonstration.
“UC reps are attending this rally to stand in solidarity with people on this issue of mental health on campus, as well as to listen to the people present to better understand the students' asks, so we can work toward a solution,” said Zhu.
Council representatives ended the rally by promising an open forum with administrators, UHS representatives, and House Masters to be held within the next two weeks. The UC will also devote time during Sunday’s general meeting to discussing mental health, according to Raghuveer.
Following the rally, a new Facebook group called Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard was launched. The group aims to provide “a platform to bring together those on Harvard's campus who support improving mental health.” By Saturday afternoon, the group had amassed 110 members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend marks the first of back-to-back road stints for the Crimson. First on deck this week is a Friday night game against Brown. Then, Harvard will travel to New Haven to take on the Bulldogs in a Saturday showdown. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s matchups.
1) How does Harvard keep the momentum going from last weekend's wins?
JSG: One of the biggest keys for the Crimson on this road trip will be treating these games as it did its last contest—that is, viewing Brown and Yale as just as big of threats as Princeton. While we all know that neither the Bears nor the Bulldogs have the same level of the talent that the Tigers do, having a let-down game after a big win is all too common in sports. If Harvard wants to keep the momentum rolling from last week, it must throw some early knock-out punches—it must come out with energy and passion in the first halves of the respective games, and not rely on the previous success it has had coming back from large deficits against lesser teams. It is all about energy for the Crimson—whether it be that of sophomore Kenyatta Smith on the defensive end or that of freshman Siyani Chambers on the offensive side of things—they must show early on that they care and that they take this weekend’s match-ups seriously.
2) Is Harvard's stingy interior defense sustainable for this weekend's games?
DF: After sophomore center Kenyatta Smith’s emergence on the defensive end last weekend, the Crimson has a defensive anchor to pair will its four quick perimeter defenders. Smith and sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi protected the paint well against Penn and Princeton and should have no problem continuing the same this weekend against Brown and Yale. Brown’s top two scorers—Sean McGonagill and Matt Sullivan—are both guards who play more from the perimeter (a combined 273 three-point attempts on the year). Similarly, the Bulldogs are led primarily by guards Austin Morgan and Javier Duran—who combined for 18.5 of the team’s 66 points a game. Moundou-Missi and Smith excel when allowed to roam the paint and help on smaller guards; their struggles come when faced with elite back-to-the-basket talent. With two guard-heavy teams on the schedule this weekend, the Crimson will continue to protect the paint.
3) Who should get the most minutes this weekend: Steve, Jonah, or Kenyatta?
CEC: After this past weekend’s performance, you have to go with Kenyatta Smith.
Despite starting his first game since Nov. 27, the sophomore made his presence felt against Penn, shattering Harvard’s all-time single-game blocks record with 10 against the Quakers. Not to mention he had 20 points and nine rebounds—just one board shy of a triple-double. One night later, against the Crimson’s toughest in-conference competition, Smith had 14 points, seven rebounds, and six blocks—two of which came on shots by Ian Hummer, who is arguably the top forward in the conference. The effort skyrocketed Smith into second place in the Ivy League in blocks per game, while simultaneously helping the Crimson to a 1.5-game lead in the conference standings.
In my opinion, Smith has earned a spot in the starting lineup—at least against Brown. That said, Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi could also see considerable minutes this weekend, and if past games are any indication, at least one of them will. Although his performance was overshadowed by that of his classmate, Moundou-Missi scored in double-digits in both contests last weekend, with 11 and 14 points against the Quakers and the Tigers, respectively. He averages 7.0 ppg and 4.9 rpg, while Travis has contributed 7.6 and 3.5 so far this year. You haven’t seen the last of either of these two guys.
4) What can Harvard do this weekend to avoid a repeat of its last close call against Brown (a double OT win)?
ARM: Simply put, the Crimson just needs to keep its composure. In terms of talent, Harvard is leagues above the Bears and should win this matchup nine out of ten times. But as we saw the last time these two teams met, crazy things can happen in that other ten percent. Coach Amaker spoke last week about his team’s penchant for making things interesting at the end of games, and he mentioned that his team was still very raw. The Crimson regularly starts two sophomores and a freshman and depends on production from two more sophomores off the bench. Still, there’s a reason those players get so much playing time—they’re the reason Harvard sits atop the Ivy standings. If they have used those close calls from earlier in the year as learning experiences, the Crimson should skate by Brown easily. The team’s raw ability will make sure of that.
5) Last time Harvard visited Yale, it was a 20-point blowout. Can Harvard dish out another big win this weekend against the Bulldogs?
HS: After nearly blowing it against Yale at Lavietes earlier this season, the Crimson has the capacity to put the close win in the past and come up with a big victory when it travels to New Haven on Saturday. Last time Harvard was at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, junior guard Laurent Rivard led the team with 18 points, but this year Harvard was plagued with foul trouble as freshman point guard Siyani Chambers was forced to sit out for half of the second period, allowing Yale to mount a near comeback in the first meeting between the two teams. If the Crimson plays clean basketball, there’s no reason that the team should not roll over the Bulldogs. Last time out, Yale had only one scorer—Armani Cotton—in double digits with 15 points, but since then Cotton has slowed down, putting up a combined 15 points in his last three games. If Harvard shows even a fraction of the interior defense it displayed this weekend, it should be able to shut down a Yale offense with no true sparkplug, even with the return of leading scorer Austin Morgan, who sat last time out and is averaging only 11.3 points per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just like Ray Lewis, Matt Birk ’98 has decided to go out on top.
After 15 seasons in the NFL, the Ravens center announced his retirement today in the library of Baltimore’s Battle Grove Elementary School, surrounded by a classroom of children.
“I'm old. I have six kids. It's just time,” Birk said. “I really enjoyed playing football [and] I got to play it for a long time. I've been very fortunate. I just feel like it's time to do something else.”
The six-time Pro Bowler ends his career as one the most accomplished big-four-sport athletes in Harvard history.
After earning first-team All-Ivy accolades with the Crimson, Birk was a sixth-round draft choice of the Minnesota Vikings in 1998. He was a two-time All-Pro with Minnesota before moving on the Ravens, with whom he won his first career Super Bowl earlier this month.
"Matt will down in NFL history as one of the best players, classiest guys and great human beings,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy wrote in an e-mail. “He is a an outstanding ambassador for the NFL and Harvard.”
The 2011 NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year, Birk had strongly considered retiring after last season but instead decided to return to Baltimore. The 36-year-old had two years and $8 million left on his contract when he decided to hang up the cleats.
“Ultimately I followed my heart,” Birk said. “I just kind of waited a couple weeks for it to settle and kept coming back to this being the right decision for me and my family.”
His former coach said he was not surprised by the decision.
“Matt informed me of his impending retirement at the beginning of [December],” Murphy wrote. “Me and my son Conor flew down to see his last home game against the Giants as his guest[s].”
After the announcement, a number of Birk’s teammates paid their respects to the center on Twitter.
“Matt Birk was one of the greatest people I've ever played with...truly a great role model and parent...very fortunate to be his teammate,” wrote wide receiver Torrey Smith.
“I have been blessed with the people that I have been able to learn from. Matt Birk was one of the best. It was my honor truly,” added linebacker Jameel McClain.
When told his teammates’ comments, Birk reportedly got emotional.
“It just stops you in your tracks,” he said. “You play the game for a lot of reasons. But the respect of your opponent, and more so the respect of your teammates, is probably the biggest thing you shoot for.”
The Ravens wanted to have a press conference for the center, but he declined. Instead, he chose to make the announcement at the elementary school where his HIKE Foundation will be opening a “Larry Bryant Reading Oasis,” in honor of a special-needs fifth-grader with whom Birk became close.
After going out a champion, Birk said he did not have any definitive plans for what he is going to do next.
“I certainly didn’t plan on playing football for 15 years,” he said. “Not having a plan has worked out for me so far, so I’m going to stick with it. To cap it with a Super Bowl win, that's a great thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—For a majority of the first half, it wasn’t a question of who had more points, Harvard or Brown, but whether the Bears had more points or turnovers.
It was the latter, but a Brown run midway through the second period enabled the Bears (10-14, 4-6 Ivy) to close the lead to single-digits for the first time since the score was 11-2 less than six minutes into the contest. Though the Crimson (17-7, 9-1) would win the game, 65-47, Friday night at the Pizzitola Sports Center, its sizable advantage had to be regained in the last fourth of the contest.
After 3:43 of radio silence from his squad’s offense to begin the second period followed by an and-one from teammate freshman Cedric Kuakumensah, junior co-captain Sean McGonagill fueled a 12-3 Brown run by hitting back-to-back shots—a jumper and a spinning layup.
Harvard’s only response in the next 5:07 was a free throw by sophomore Wesley Saunders and a layup from classmate Kenyatta Smith. The Bears, on the other hand, followed McGonagill’s baskets with a baby-runner thrown up by co-captain Matt Sullivan, a steal and a resulting layup, once again from Sullivan, and one more McGonagill jumper from the right wing.
What was once a battle between Brown and itself, was now one between the two schools. With just over 10 minutes remaining in the game, the Crimson’s lead was down to six, and its strongest defensive presence, Smith, was sidelined with four fouls.
“They’re a really resilient team,” Saunders said. “So they don’t get fazed when they get down by any margin, as we’ve seen before. That’s been a trend our whole season, letting teams back into the game, but you have to give credit to them for [continuing to] fight.”
But, in the next five minutes, Harvard was able to regain its substantial lead by doubling the Bears’ offensive output during that stretch. Thanks to free throws and layups from sophomore Steve Mondou-Missi and Saunders, the Crimson found breathing room again with 4:53 remaining and a 51-39 advantage. Harvard could coast the rest of the game, and did so, stretching its lead to the final margin of 18.
“We were outclassed by a better team tonight” Brown coach Mike Martin said. “Are they a better team than us? Absolutely. Should we compete better than we did tonight? Absolutely. It’s unacceptable. Right now those guys are the standard in our league.... They showed that tonight.”
The opening segment of the game seemed to emphasize Martin’s point as the Bears had already accumulated 10 turnovers by the time it knocked in its fifth point at the 7:58 mark. The home squad would go on to make four more mistakes before intermission and, accordingly, went into the locker room with a 29-18 deficit.
Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, when asked whether the turnovers were results of Harvard’s defensive pressure or Brown miscues, stated that it was both.
“I thought we defended fairly hard, fairly well in the first half in particular,” Amaker said. “We were able to get a few turnovers and run-outs that enabled us to have that wide margin that we had, but I’m sure [Martin] would probably say there were some errors on their part, some lack of execution…I think [it was] combination of the two.”
The Crimson began the first period on a 21-5 run, instigated at the outset by Smith, the unexpected star of last weekend’s play. Smith opened the night with two baby hooks and a blocked shot before leaving the game in foul trouble.
“I thought the way we started the game was critical,” Amaker said. “We got out to a pretty sizable margin that allowed us to have…a comfortable cushion.”
As the contest approached halftime, the Bears would test that cushion, continually forcing their way to the charity stripe. In the final eight minutes before intermission, Brown went to the line 10 times, decreasing its deficit to only 11.
While Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers led Harvard’s offense on the night with 19 and 14 points, respectively, it was their defense on McGonagill and Sullivan that drew praise from Amaker. Saunders drew the assignment of Sullivan, the Bears’ leading scorer, and held the senior to just four points on 28.6 percent shooting. Chambers, meanwhile, kept McGonagill to 10 points and forced him to cough up the ball six times.
“We’re pleased with the defensive effort without a doubt” Amaker said. “We’re talking about trying to improve, we’re trying to keep the focus…. This time of year if you can still find ways to improve, that’s a huge sign, a very positive sign for this ball club.”

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
No meal is complete without dessert. Although The Red House is a seafood restaurant in Harvard Square that specializes in lobster dishes, it also whips up decadent desserts with favorites like key lime pie and tiramisu on the menu.
The Red House's Key Lime Pie ($6) tasted like dense cheesecake and was infused with tarty flavors from the lime. The homemade graham cracker crust was a bit dry and didn't stick together very well. The key lime pie was served with fresh whipped cream and a slice of orange.
The Dark Chocolate Decadence ($6) is the restaurant's gluten-free dessert option. This rich, flourless chocolate torte was messily drizzled with Chambord sauce made from raspberries, vanilla, honey, and cognac.
The Chocolate Pecan Bread Pudding ($6), served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, had big chunks of pecans and chocolate chips. The bread pudding would have tasted better if it had been crispier on top and moister inside.

February 18, 1913: Remedies for Social Evils
That the social evil in American cities is the fault of men and not of women was the conclusion reached by Dean Walter Taylor Sumner of the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, Chicago, in his lecture on "Efficient Citizenship" at the Union last evening.
He first proved the futility of remedying the social evil by segregation, which, he says does not stop the white slave traffic. A social evil law to better the situation is hopeless, for it is unconstitutional. He summed up the fallacies of our present ignorant system as follows: "We turn the entire problem over to police, giving them three distinct powers which they abuse. They are allowed to make pseudo-laws to regulate vice; they are then expected to enforce these laws and punish offenders."
February 18, 1942: Army Will Commission Pre-Med Students Now
Moving to forestall a threatened shortage of doctors, the Army last week extended draft deferment and a chance for commissions to men in their first and second year of medical school and pre-med students who have been accepted by a reputable graduate school.
The new ruling is a broadening of the procedure which has been followed until now, under which commissions were offered to third and fourth year medical students only. In the past these men have been commissioned in the Medical Administration Corps of the Army and then sent back to finish their training.
February 20, 1965: Harvard Hits Top of Gift List in '64
Harvard has regained its position as the nation's number one money-attracting university.
Collecting almost $39 million from a variety of private sources including alumni, foundations, and bequests, Harvard topped Stanford, last year's winner in the dollar sweepstakes, by nearly $3 million. Cornell amassed some $27.7 million for third and Yale $22.5 million for fourth. The figures for fiscal year 1963-64, compiled by John Price Jones Company, Inc., New York firm of financial consultants, now that all eight Ivy League colleges rank among the nation's top twenty universities in private gifts. Dartmouth, the poorest, received $5.3 million in gifts. And Pennsylvania, the second poorest, received $9.6 million.
February 19, 1969: The Washington Monthly
If this country is falling apart, no one feels more guilty about it than the liberal journalist. He feels guilty for the entire year 1968—the assassinations, the riots, the rise of Wallace, the blood in Chicago. Saying that liberals feel guilty about things is somewhat a cliché (that is, after all, how we normally discount what they say). But look at what it means to feel guilty.
First, guilt implies a sense of responsibility for events. Few normal people feel guilty about what happened in Chicago. They may feel outraged or happy about it, but to feel guilt is the prerogative of those who feel responsible. The liberal journalists who feel this way are saying that somehow they could have prevented what happened in Chicago or that they could have refrained from causing what happened. But how?
February 23, 1974: Dan Rather Criticizes Nixon at Winthrop House Discussion
When it comes to "foul and odorous things," the Nixon administration is in a class by itself, Dan Rather, White House correspondent for CBS evening news, told an informal gathering of approximately 100 in Winthrop House yesterday afternoon.
"There have been a lot of foul and odorous things in previous administrations, but just look at Nixon's record," he told the group. Citing former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew's felony conviction and the indictment of 14 White House associates, Rather added, "the Harding administration is not even comparable."
Rather declined to say whether he thought Nixon should be impeached, but did say that if he were "betting the rent money," he would wager that the president stays.
