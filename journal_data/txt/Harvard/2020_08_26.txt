After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Did you think that Massachusetts politics were too liberal to put progressive ideals at risk? Dramatic elections do take place in this deep blue state. Students often feel like outsiders during elections but the reality is that all members of the Harvard University community have the right to take part in Massachusetts state and local elections, be it by actually casting a ballot or through political activism. I urge you to pay particular attention to one of the closest-fought Democratic primaries in the nation: the race between incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.). Kennedy, unsatisfied with his seat in the House, has decided to challenge Markey for a seat in the Senate. Since Markey is best known today as the legislator who introduced the Green New Deal resolution in the Senate, this race is nothing less than a referendum on the Green New Deal itself. It is a race of historic importance. To borrow a quip from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics: “welcome to the most unusual Senate primary in decades.”
Members of the Harvard community — actually, all undergraduate and graduate students at universities in Massachusetts — should defend the sitting climate champion against this strange challenge, and vote for Ed Markey in the Senate primary on September 1.
Much ink has been spilled on the many excellent reasons to send Markey back to the Senate. In their recent endorsement piece, the Boston Globe Editorial Board explained that as a longtime advocate for emissions standards and cap and trade, Markey “is poised — and arguably more prepared than any other politician in the U.S. government — to fill in the conceptual aspirations of the Green New Deal resolution that he cosponsored with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with practical policies and to get them passed in Congress.” His work to stop insider trading, ensure universal broadband access, and end nuclear proliferation is undoubtedly laudable, but what makes him truly irreplaceable is that he is one of Capitol Hill’s foremost advocates for green jobs and a livable future. That is why the Sunrise Movement — a youth-driven advocacy movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process — has supported Markey and why we have made thousands of phone calls to voters on his behalf.
Kennedy, while a cautious supporter of many of the same causes, is not a visionary. My family and I live in a brutalist apartment slab in his House district; fellow constituents and I made calls and some even visited his office urging him, successfully, to actually sign onto the Green New Deal resolution — the one that Markey had the foresight and drive to bring to the table with Ocasio-Cortez. Nevertheless, Kennedy enjoys considerable and sincere support in the state. I keep running into his supporters at busy intersections in the extreme heat — hotter than it was a few years ago, by the way — waving lawn signs on sticks at passing cars. A Kennedy has never lost a race in Massachusetts, and this one has a real chance of taking out one of America’s most famous advocates for sweeping climate change legislation. And for what? Kennedy has struggled to explain what he could possibly offer to residents of Massachusetts — and the rest of this planet — besides ambition.
The Harvard University student body should exercise their collective voice in this race. It will be closely fought and every vote will count; students must cast a ballot to defend the Green New Deal. After all, imagine the gift that Kennedy would give to Mitch McConnell if he won. It would allow McConnell to say that even in Massachusetts, voters think that a green jobs program is an impossible fantasy.
When I contemplate the harmful effects that a Senator Kennedy would have on the bitter fight to pass large-scale climate legislation in 2021, I am forced to conclude that my Kennedy-supporting neighbors are making a mistake. I urge all readers to cast their ballot for a true progressive and keep one of our best hopes for a just climate transition in public office.
If you are registered to vote in Massachusetts and will be voting absentee: To apply for a vote-by-mail ballot, those with a Cambridge address must fill out the 2020 Vote By Mail Application. This application must arrive at the Cambridge election office by mail, email, or fax by August 26. In order for your vote to count, your mail-in ballot must arrive at the Cambridge Election Commission office by Tuesday, September 1st at 8:00 pm.

As students, faculty, and staff trickle back to campus, Harvard has set up a testing apparatus aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. Students living in campus housing have to get tested three times each week; most other affiliates have to get tested once a week.
Still, there are some factors Harvard can’t entirely account for, including the hundreds of students moving into off-campus housing in Cambridge and Boston over the next several weeks. At other colleges and universities across the country, off-campus housing has been the locus of several COVID-19 outbreaks, in some cases causing schools to shift their reopening plans entirely online. It remains unclear whether those students will cause a rise in Cambridge’s case count.
Below is a summary of the data Harvard and the city of Cambridge have reported about test results in the area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates said they are dismayed and frustrated with Olympia Moving and Storage, as some students have encountered financial and logistical hurdles in retrieving the items they stored with the company after leaving campus in the middle of the spring semester.
When Harvard mandated that undergraduates leave campus in March due to growing concerns over the coronavirus, the University partnered with Olympia Moving and Storage to provide students with an option to store their belongings during the summer.
After administrators announced in July that only freshmen and a limited number of upperclassmen were permitted to return to campus, students not returning faced the decision of whether to collect their items or keep them in storage — a choice some say came with unexpected costs.
Lauren V. Marshall ’22, an international student from the United Kingdom, said she contacted Olympia expecting to spend around $1,500 to ship her items to her home from Massachusetts. The quote she received, however, was nearly four times that amount.
“They gave me a shipping quote of $5,767, which is dramatically more than I expected,” Marshall said. “When we were packing up, Harvard providing the service of picking up boxes from our rooms made a massive difference to me, but at this point, the quote that they've given me is just so egregiously high that it feels like deliberate sabotage.”
Though Marshall’s stored boxes contain important items like her winter coats, textbooks, and entire composition portfolio, she said she will not be able to ship her items due to the high cost.
Students previously voiced concerns over both fall storage and Harvard’s assistance after the University announced their fall plans. Will Dey ’23 said he has struggled with getting in contact with Olympia to inquire about extending his storage time.
“Whenever I called the Olympia number, the Boston office would pick up and I would say I was a Harvard student,” Dey explained. “Then they would immediately transfer me to the Harvard student team, and it would always go straight to voicemail.”
Dey added that he was able to connect with a member of Olympia’s Harvard team last week who told Dey “to call him back anytime.” Dey has since attempted to contact the team member again to no avail.
Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22, who chairs the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee, said more than 130 students have contacted her over the past week with concerns about shipping and storing items with Olympia.
“The UC asked the administration back in March to work with Olympia over the summer,” Ganesh said. “We asked them to do that with Olympia so they would have enough time to hire new people to go through the inventory and prep for this.”
During the spring semester, the Undergraduate Council introduced the “Storage Relief Program,” which paid the $55 balance not covered by Harvard’s summer storage grant. The Council hoped to introduce a similar program for the fall, but Ganesh said it is currently struggling to raise enough money to account for the rising costs of storage.
“We have about $30,000 in our budget, and we would like to use that for storage. The issue is, with the increased costs for the school year and everything, that’s nowhere near enough money,” Ganesh explained.
Ganesh added that she estimates the average cost of storage for students will be $450 and has concluded that the Council needs $100,000 “to even meet a reasonable amount of need.” The Council has endeavored to raise $15,000 to bring their budget from $30,000 to $45,000 to help more students satisfy their storage costs.
So far, they have raised $280.
Michael Gilmartin, president of Olympia Moving and Storage, said in an interview Tuesday the high cost of shipping is due to the fact that the company relies on outside carriers to ship items, adding that it is out of his company's control. He added that the cost of shipping also reflects processing and repackaging Olympia does prior to shipping.
“We don't control that pricing,” Gilmartin said. “We have labor and other costs that go into it, but we're just subbing that piece of it out, and we're trying to relay the cost. We're certainly not trying to make a huge markup off of something like this.”
According to the Olympia website, Harvard students have the option of extending the storage beyond the original Sept. 15 storage date, having the item shipped, or picking them up at the company’s facility in Holbrook, Mass.
“Please keep in mind that due to the high volume of requests and efforts to keep shipping cost-effective, we cannot accommodate custom timelines for shipping,” the website states. “Olympia will work to ensure that all requested items are shipped prior to the end of the original student storage program of September 15, 2020.”
Gilmartin also said the company initially intended to only store the students’ items over the summer and then return them to campus. Olympia, however, was overwhelmed by shipping requests, partly due to the fact that the company has lost roughly 70 percent of its labor force due to the pandemic.
“We can't handle that large sum of small moves, nor are we geared towards handling a student with four to five boxes on an individual day to deliver somewhere off campus,” he said. “The expectation was that we were going to deliver all those students’ back to campus and be able to deliver them prior to the students coming back and we can organize it in a way that we have historically, and that didn't happen.”
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane reiterated that the $175 subsidy provided by the College is intended to defray the cost of storage or shipping.
“When decisions came together about the fall, Harvard anticipated the need for additional aid for students to ship their belongings home or store them for longer,” she wrote. “Students should make sure when they call for a rate, they are sharing with Olympia that they are students at Harvard and are asking for Harvard’s rate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
{image id=1344501 size=large byline=true caption="Harvard Medical School and biopharmaceutical company AbbVie will launch a $30 million research alliance to combat viral infections, like the novel coronavirus tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the study and development of new therapies.}
Harvard Medical School and biopharmaceutical company AbbVie will launch a $30 million research alliance to combat viral infections, like the novel coronavirus tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the study and development of new therapies, the University announced Tuesday.
The partnership will focus on the integration of fundamental biology into preclinical and clinical development of treatment for viral diseases. In addition to providing $30 million in funding over three years, AbbVie will also offer other forms of scientific support, including scientists, facilities, and expertise.
The announcement comes as the United States and many other parts of the world continue to experience high volumes of COVID-19 cases. The collaboration will aim to develop treatments with an eye toward both the COVID-19 and future pandemics.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard Medical School has led several other large-scale research efforts, including a $115 million five year partnership with Chinese researchers.
“Harvard Medical School, as the nucleus of an ecosystem of fundamental discovery and therapeutic translation, is uniquely positioned to propel this transformative research alongside allies like AbbVie,” Medical School Dean George Q. Daley said in a press release announcing the effort.
Daley said that the “cataclysmic nature” of the COVID-19 pandemic should serve as a reminder of the importance of preparing for public health crises, a key aim of the research alliance.
Like Daley, AbbVie Vice Chairman and President Michael Severino also said advance research will be key for addressing future outbreaks.
“There is much to learn about viral diseases and the best way to treat them,” Severino said in the release. “By harnessing the power of collaboration, we can develop new therapeutics sooner to ensure the world is better prepared for future potential outbreaks.”
The collaboration will cover five subjects: immunity and immunopathology, host targeting for antiviral therapies, antibody therapeutics, small molecules, and translational development. A Medical School faculty member and a senior scientist at AbbVie will co-lead programs in each area.
Harvard Medical School Executive Director of Therapeutics Translation Mark N. Namchuk, who will head the small molecules program focusing on discovery and development of drugs preventing replication, said in an interview that the partnership will take advantage of the complementary strengths of academia and industry.
“I think one thing [AbbVie] can bring to the table is the ability to take initial discoveries and translate them towards a therapeutic much more quickly than we could do in an academic setting,” Namchuk said. “What we can bring to the floor is the science and pushing on how well we understand how the virus works, pushing on different ways we can think about the discovery of new antivirals.”
Harvard Medical School Biochemistry and Systems Biology Professor Pamela A. Silver, who will lead the antiviral therapy program, wrote in an email that the partnership also provides Medical School students and trainees exposure to “real world drug development.”
“We gain from their experience with early drug discovery and the in house platforms for accelerating discovery,” Silver wrote. “Success would be identifying leads to drugs or processes that could be used to treat COVID.”
The fifth working area, translational development, will allow the researchers to validate, test, and optimize promising discoveries in Harvard-affiliated hospitals, moving towards clinical application.
Namchuk said the team hopes to achieve an “extraordinary level of collaboration.” He said they hope to “see if we can get more strengths from working together than just parsing the pieces off into individual labs.”

You’ve completed your COVID-19 training, compiled a list of courses to take this semester (kind of?), and hauled out your suitcase from the back of your closet. Aside from the usual things to bring, however, the current season demands a few precautionary items. Here are five extra commodities to bring with your favorite pair of jeans that you’ve worn since the tenth grade! Don’t bring any “I Took CS-50” shirts. Please, the world begs you.
Masks, Masks, Masks
Face coverings are not just highly recommended, but required by a state order. Even though they may feel like a hassle, you can be creative with this powerful infective-agent-abolishing accessory. Going to miss your sunny West Coast home? Go for a cute floral pattern. Dream of being a cast member of Grey’s Anatomy? Buy the traditional surgical face masks. Want to match your indie rock outfit? Get an Arctic Monkeys face mask. While we’re talking about accessorizing, throw some disposable gloves into your carry-on as well. Bonus points if you’re extra enough to have them match your mask.
Disinfectants
Each person on campus, from first-year students to custodians to teaching teams, is equally responsible for keeping physical spaces sanitary and safe. Whether you prefer to clean away the pesky germs with wet wipes or spritz your heart out with a spray bottle, your peers (not to mention the rest of the country) would be very appreciative of you maintaining a hygienic campus. There’s nothing like destroying microscopic particles that once had the ability to make someone sick.
Extra Large Water Bottle
Being properly hydrated during a typical semester was challenging enough, but now, who knows how many public water fountains will be available? Always have a sufficient amount of fluids nearby with a very large water bottle. Chances are, you’ll be in your room watching Netflix more than you should be, so you might as well save a trip to the dining hall. Perfect skin, here we come!
Pictures of Family and Friends
Being away from home during a pandemic can be rough. Depending on your class time and your family’s work schedule, it may be tricky to find a good time to have a phone call. To remind yourself of the people who are rooting for you from back home, print out photos and pin them up in your dorm room. Go wild with it! Put up mini polaroids, fancy frames, and cute fairy lights! (There can NEVER be enough fairy lights.) Feel free to include pictures of pets or idols.
Picnic Blanket
If you ever need a change of pace and get some fresh air, a picnic blanket can come in handy before the temperature starts to drop in Cambridge. Do your readings by the Charles River, stargaze on the Quad lawn, or eat a meal in front of one of the graduate schools. Don’t forget to also pack some hand sanitizer to use before you begin eating. Plus, you can snap a great Instagram photo.
Packing for college is always an exciting time and this year is more unique than ever. Throw in these items to make sure your stay is extra safe and comfortable!
