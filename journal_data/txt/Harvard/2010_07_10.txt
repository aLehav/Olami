After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Cambridge residents Donald H. Heathfield and Tracey L. A. Foley were among the 10 Russian spies who were flown to Vienna, Austria Friday to complete a spy swap with Russia.
Russian officials traded the 10 sleeper agents for four alleged Western spies at Vienna’s international airport, marking the biggest exchange since during the Cold War in 1986. The settlement lasted about one hour, bringing a quick end to an investigation that climaxed in a series of arrests and a swift prosecution.
In the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Thursday, the 10 defendants each pled guilty to a single count of conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign government.
The charge to commit money laudering, which was placed on most of the 10 prisoners, was not officially settled until the exchange was successfully completed in Vienna.
Priet Bharara, the U.S. prosecuting attorney in Manhattan, requested that all charges against the 10 defendants are dropped, ending the criminal case, The New York Times reported. All 10 agreed never to return to the United States without permission from the attorney general.
In a moment reminiscent of old-fashioned spy stories, seven of the sleeper agents revealed at Thursday’s arraignment that they had assumed false names during their time in the United States. Heathfield and Foley said that their real names were Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova.
The couple was transferred from Boston earlier this week to join the eight other defendants in New York for the arraignment, which laid bare the results of a multi-year investigation by the FBI and other federal agencies into a program that officials believe was sanctioned by the Russian foreign intelligence service.
Heathfield—who graduated from the master’s in public administration program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2000—and his wife were arrested at their Trowbridge Street home in Cambridge on June 27. The couple was charged with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Heathfield and Foley—who were legally married, according to the former’s attorney Peter B. Krupp—had desired a quick resolution to the prosecution if that would best help their two sons, Timothy and Alexander. Krupp said that he cannot confirm whether they are the couple’s biological children.
Heathfield is a Russian citizen who was educated in Canada and in the United States, according to Krupp, who said he did not know why his client chose Harvard as part of his time in America.
On one side of his double life, Heathfield worked as the chief executive officer of Future Map, a consulting firm that helps governments and businesses develop systems for leadership. As a sleeper agent, he allegedly met with a U.S. government official involved with nuclear weapons research and was tasked with assembling data on U.S. foreign policy.
Foley states on her professional website that she was a real estate agent for Redfin and claims to be a native of Montreal who was educated in Switzerland, Canada, and France.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After waiting through a national coaching search that spanned more than three weeks, members of the Harvard men’s soccer team were happy to learn that their new head coach would be someone they were all familiar with—their former assistant coach Carl Junot.
Harvard athletics director Bob Scalise announced Thursday afternoon that Junot, who served for two seasons as an assistant under former head coach Jamie Clark, would take over for Clark, who left in mid-June to take over the head coaching position at Creighton.
“All the players thought it would be a good idea to have someone who was close to the program and had an idea what the players were like,” said reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Brian Rogers. “If anything, I was hoping for [Junot] and was pleasantly surprised.”
Choosing someone close to the Crimson soccer program is not surprising given the team’s success in recent years.
Under the leadership of Clark and Junot, Harvard posted a 26-10-1 record over two seasons, reached back-to-back NCAA tournaments, and captured the Ivy League championship in 2009.
Following the Crimson’s elimination from the 2009 NCAA tournament in the third round, Junot was rewarded for his time as an assistant with a head coaching offer from Tufts.
Junot took the offer and was announced as the head coach at Tufts on April 16.
But when Clark resigned to take the job at Creighton in mid-June, Junot was contacted by hiring director Nathan Fry and encouraged to apply for the opening in Cambridge. Despite having forged a strong relationship with his new players and bosses at Tufts, Junot knew it was the right move to throw his name into the hat.
“I am very grateful to [Tufts athletic director] Bill Gehling and his entire athletics department,” Junot said. “I was very fond of the players at Tufts—we had started to build expectations…That being said, the whole time I knew moving to Harvard was where my heart was and that it was the right move.”
And after a three-week search, Junot was selected as the one to guide the Crimson to another Ancient Eight championship.
“We looked nationally for our next head coach, but it soon became clear that the best candidate was right in our backyard,” said Scalise, according to
gocrimson.com. “Carl knows Harvard, he knows the program, and he has a proven track record in recruiting student-athletes. He will continue the upward ascent of our men’s soccer program for years to come.”
But while Junot may know the program, that is not to say things will be run the same way from now on.
“He will be a little more confrontational than coach Clark was,” Rogers said. “Coach Clark left a lot of the motivation up to the players on the team. It was really up to us to get ourselves motivated and to get us working harder. I think coach Junot will be a little harder on us and more demanding.”
Rogers also admired the way Junot, who played college soccer at Furman and was invited to the MLS Combine in 2001, would stay after practice to work individually with players.
“He definitely has an enthusiasm about the game that’s contagious, that everyone seems to respond to really well,” Rogers said.
Now that the coaching search has concluded, both the players and the coaching
staff can go back to focusing on their primary goal—defending the Ivy League title.
“It would be rewarding to be the head coach at any program, but having had a hand in building the success at Harvard, there is an extra sense of gratification,” Junot said. “It’s equally rewarding to know that the players and staff were happy to have me back.”

You hear about it all the time. Hungry late-nighters slipping an extra chicken sandwich out of the dining hall, or some of the more slippery folk who try to sneak into Annenberg through the back door. But say that these people aren't even students at Harvard, but just a bunch of, well, freeloaders.
An interesting guest commentary piece in the Cambridge Chronicle this past week shed light on freeloaders—people "who drift from one freebie event to another, uninvited, gobbling up food and mixing in with the invited crowd."
Unfortunately, the article doesn't divulge the name of the anonymous source, referring to him simply as "K." (K as in Krafty? Kovert?) Mr. K. cites several instances in which these freeloaders—about 15 regulars—blend into the reception crowd at the Harvard reception for departments and museums in both Cambridge and Boston.
According to The K., each freeloader seems to have a similar tactic, usually involving large coats with spacious pockets or cleverly stored piles of food. One quick brush of the hand could land an entire bottle of wine into one of those pockets. The culprit goes essentially unnoticed—except by Special K.
"These people have a technique. They will station themselves by the food table, pile their plates, and then just start putting stuff away in their pockets and plastic bags," Detective K. told the Chronicle. "When I’m on a job in the evenings, I typically work for about four hours, sometimes longer, and usually hope there might be some food left at the end of the event so I can have something to eat. There’s never anything left."
"Some of them may just be real loners and have no friends," Mr. K. added. And so the twisted psychology brimming underneath such elaborate freeloading behavior emerges.
Well, whoever these people are, we sure as hope they don't load up on our favorite meal of the day.
