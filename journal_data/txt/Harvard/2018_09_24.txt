After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I can’t quite pinpoint the exact origin of my elementary school obsession with “High School Musical.” Maybe it was Ashley Tisdale, whom I’d seen on “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” or Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, then-newcomers whose appearance in the made-for-TV film would propel their careers to a household name status. Most people underestimated “High School Musical”—its own writer, Peter Barsocchini, would later remember calling it a “fun little movie,” secondary to another project he’d been working on at the time. But in my infinite eight-year-old foresight, I trained a well-honed eye on the advertisements that were sandwiched between episodes of “Kim Possible” and “Hannah Montana.” This, I thought, was going to be something big.
Almost overnight, the movie proved me right. Barsocchini’s other, more serious project, a one-hour Lifetime drama, was ultimately cut from the air, while the “fun” one became an international teen juggernaut, launching two sequels and an international tour. The kids in my grade knew all the words to every song. We blasted the soundtrack in the car as our parents drove us to school.
In those days, I was obsessed with a lot of things—yet I consider this my first real brush with super-fandom. I loved it with a fervor that I didn’t know was possible. I remember begging my parents to buy the soundtrack CD and the DVD of the movie. One birthday called for a “High School Musical” t-shirt. The next garnered a trivia book and a special edition of Tiger Beat that included salacious behind-the-scenes details. I tracked the progress of production for its sequels. It thrilled me that Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens had started dating, as if some of the on-screen universe had bled into the real one. (Video evidence suggests that I even pressured my younger brother into performing a theatrical rendition of “Bop to the Top.” The choreography involves a ladder.)
It was easy to love. I loved it for its music, which seemed then to articulate truths I already knew about the world — defy stereotypes, be who you are inside — yet also seemed to gesture at something greater that I was too young to understand: romantic love, or a Disney lyricist’s approximation of it.
I suspect now that there was another rationale altogether, one whose subconscious underpinnings I was too young to interpret. “High School Musical” was based on an ethos of authenticity and acceptance, which understandably appealed to me, an eight-year-old Asian American girl who’d always stuck out unfavorably among white classmates. In the anticipation of a social media era — one founded on the premise of self-presentation, self-mediation, and judgment — it was essentially ludicrously effective anti-bullying propaganda, wrapped up in flashy production and catchy show tunes. Basketball players can dance, and scholastic decathlon nerds can sing Broadway tunes. Even skaters can play the cello! Teachers and parents, with all their old-school expectations and pressures, will yield eventually to persistent, plucky teenagers with a newer notion of the world, one that accepted — encouraged, even — bucking the norms. Or to borrow the film’s own terms, breaking free, as opposed to sticking to the status quo.
But it was never disruptive enough to be threatening. There was no sex, no drugs. It sold a wholesome view of American adolescence, as if the most scandalous indulgence a high schooler could have would be secretly baking crème brûlée or break-dancing. Nothing about my concept of morality was ever challenged. Good kids like Troy and Gabriella were rewarded with summer pool parties and happy endings; bad kids like Sharpay learned their lesson, then promised to reform, to come back as nicer kids, until the next movie rolled around. (I’ll save the politics of punishing Sharpay for being a woman with ambition for another “High School Musical” thought piece.)
Maybe if I’d had a little more foresight, I would’ve seen that the cost of teen fame created devastating consequences for many of its beneficiaries — when Hudgens’ private photos were leaked to the public, and Efron suffered from cocaine addiction, and even cello guy was arrested for robbing a pizza store — that under the strictures of Disney PR, their public lives were perhaps as performative as their onscreen characters’.
But those revelations were still yet to come, even by the end of the “High School Musical” franchise in 2008. At the time, it felt like an important cultural moment. The third and final installment was the only one to screen in theaters, and my mom took me one afternoon, a rare movie outing. When the final curtain dropped — a moment that Hudgens would later describe at the film’s 10-year cast reunion as “saying goodbye to our childhood” — I felt strangely empty. Was this goodbye to my childhood, too? I wondered. Would this irrevocably seal off some era of my life?
It did not. It was 2008. I was 10. By the time I arrived at high school myself, I had long since been disabused of the notion that being a teenager involved New Year’s dance parties and spontaneous karaoke with strangers who looked like Zac Efron. In retrospect, there was little authenticity or novelty: a version of teenagehood dreamed up by adults for whom high school was already a distant memory. There were teen movies before “High School Musical,” and there were teen movies after “High School Musical.” It seemed self-aware about the conventions of its genre, but so was 2001’s “Not Another Teen Movie,” which parodied teen movie clichés with much more focus. Its title is almost laughably generic: “High School Musical” is as literal as a Chinese restaurant naming itself “Chinese Restaurant.” Rewatching the movie now, it’s comical how hokey some of the lines are: “The ice princess returned from the North Pole” as a searing insult, or “We were worse than jerks, because we were mean jerks” as a heartfelt apology.
But in the advent of Internet meme culture, it’s precisely those campy, unrealistic lines and strange jokes that endear it to its viewers. It has somehow managed to become a cultural touchstone for an entire generation, inspiring enough memes and Tumblr posts to supply a few Buzzfeed listicles (most famously, variations of Troy’s very understated, very subtle “Bet On It” performance from the second movie).
About a year ago, a fan-made teaser trailer uploaded to YouTube imagined a fourth installment to the franchise. A newer, acoustic rendition of “What I’ve Been Looking For” was superimposed on clips of the original cast’s more recent work. “Once a Wildcat,” the title card read, referencing the film’s fictional basketball team.
It was a strange nostalgia trip, seeing these actors whom I had grown up watching, now a decade older, their familiar faces like old friends’. I remembered, suddenly, what it felt like to care so deeply about a movie, and I was reminded of how much time had really elapsed since I had watched the movie for the first time — like seeing an old picture of yourself, and noticing how much you’ve changed.
One thing was certain — I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. Shared eagerly on social media and circulated widely by online pop culture blogs, the fake trailer has since garnered 13 million views and counting. In the age of reboots, it was not implausible for even an older franchise like “High School Musical” to get another installment many years later, and the trailer, despite being unofficial, had the films’ fans — now college-aged and older — clamoring for another movie.
There are few films that can unite a generation as ubiquitously as “High School Musical.” For better or worse, it’s seared in our collective pop culture memory, like an inside joke we were all in on together. You know how the saying goes. Once a wildcat….

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As with many Harvard students not from New York or overseas, one of my first impressions of Harvard Square was its walkability. With all its shops, cafes, and restaurants, so close together, with relatively narrow (and often one-way) streets and bike lanes galore, the Square felt like a page from a post-Jane Jacobs urban design textbook had come to life.
Then, I went to the other Cambridge.
During my semester studying abroad at Cambridge’s Jesus College, I certainly noticed the bikes: one in three adults bike five times a week, the highest share in the United Kingdom. But I barely noticed how easy it was to walk around the city center — how I never had to weave in between cars stuck in traffic or jog across a street to avoid a speeding driver. In fact, I rarely had to wait more than a few seconds to cross.
Upon my return to Harvard’s campus this summer, though, these differences were no longer “99% invisible.” My commute from 29 Garden Street to Radcliffe Yard, so simple on paper, involved multiple perilous crossings of four-lane streets with speeding cars and confusing stoplight patterns. When the school year started, I noticed more pedestrian-unfriendly crossings, particularly on Massachusetts Avenue, which most students at the College cross every day.
No, I’ve never been hit, but many are not so lucky: About 90 pedestrians and bicyclists are hospitalized by car crashes in Cambridge each year. And the symptoms of pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly design extend beyond safety. By discouraging Cantabrigians from biking or walking, this planning encourages them to drive (or ride-share) instead, stuffing the roads with cars. As a result, those who commute through Cambridge sit longer in traffic — not only wasting time but reducing commuters’ physical activity, worsening air quality, and emitting more planet-stifling carbon. Finally, by worsening walkability, one of the most appealing aspects of urban life, and making longer, car-based commutes easier, car-centric design incentivizes those who can move to the suburbs to do so, with terrible consequences for racial integration and public finance.
The instinctive response of cities to clogged streets for a century has been to focus on improving traffic flow — to widen the streets, eliminate crosswalks, add more complex traffic light systems like left-turn arrows, and, where possible, increase speed limits. In other words, we’ve sought to make it easier to drive. But anything that makes it easier to drive has the same ill effects as discouraging walking or biking. In fact, you might notice that the elements that make driving easier are the same as those that make walking harder.
This is no coincidence. All forms of road transportation compete for space, but cars’ spatial inefficiency (especially single-occupant cars), speed, and weight make them particularly adversarial and dangerous to the rest. As a blog post titled “How Much of Making Transit Easier is Making Driving Harder?” argues, making cities more car-friendly necessarily makes them more hostile to other (safer, healthier, greener, more efficient) forms of transit — and vice versa.
Luckily, Cambridge has already taken significant steps to return its streets to non-drivers, with an ambitious plan to add 16 to the city’s 25.8 miles of bike lanes by 2030. In summer 2017, the city removed a lane from the stretch of Brattle Street in front of the American Repertory Theatre and added a protected bike lane in each direction. The result, a vastly more bikeable and walkable neighborhood, represents a model for cities everywhere.
But humbler and simpler redesigns could also make the Square more pedestrian-friendly. For example, the curb extensions on Mount Auburn behind Oberon make Mather residents’ walk to class safer and easier. The city should add curb extensions westward on Mount Auburn and a few on Massachusetts Avenue, say, in front of the Harvard Bookstore, Clover, and Waterhouse Street. This would sacrifice one or two parking spaces each.
More recently, a “sudden inundation” of dockless electric scooters in Cambridge pushed questions about street design to the public forefront. I am quoted in The Crimson’s article about the city’s response as saying that “scooters represent a potential to continue moving away from cars and toward more sustainable and more spatially efficient ways of getting around the city.” For lack of space, the rest of my rant to the reporter was understandably cut. Suffice it to say that as Cambridge expands bike lanes, which seem like a better fit than either roads or sidewalks for the 15-miles-per-hour scooters, the advantages of this cheap, compact, clean, quick, and low-effort form of transit will become even clearer.
To that list of adjectives, I should add “safe.” Some complaints about scooters dress up a fear of change or hatred of anything that smells like Silicon Valley in safety concerns. Such complaints are, always, statistics-free. When one man died this week in a dockless scooter accident, bringing the all-time total to two in tens of millions of rides, it made international news. (Assuming the day of the man’s death was an average day in traffic deaths, about 80 people died in car accidents!) By allowing Cambridge commuters to take Birds instead of Ubers or their own vehicles, we would be allowing a shift to a much safer form of transportation. Critics also worry about the effects on accessibility, but as a Crimson staff editorial recently noted, scooter companies have already taken steps to address these concerns — and a reduction in the car traffic that sends us scurrying across Mount Auburn would no doubt make crossings easier for pedestrians with mobility problems.
In the century following the Model T, cities across the country, including Cambridge, redesigned themselves to be as car-friendly as possible. With a few miles of bike lanes and a handful of Birds, Cambridge has only begun to reverse this environmental, sociological, and public health catastrophe. Here’s hoping they keep biking down that path.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the recent sexual assault allegations against current Supreme Court Justice nominee and Harvard Law School lecturer Brett M. Kavanaugh, there’s been a jarring reaction from many Republicans.
The allegations that the then-high-schooler Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault a woman come at a critical time in the confirmation process for the spot on the high court. With little more than a month until the 2018 midterm elections, such a revelation could turn the November vote into a referendum on Republicans’ and Democrats’ reactions to the multitude of sexual harassment allegations that have become increasingly prevalent.
Keeping with the moving-the-goalposts approach that they’ve used for other scandals and allegations against members of Congress and even the President, Republicans first defended the nominee’s character with testimonials by women who hadn’t been sexually harassed by Kavanaugh.
The first strategy seeming insufficient, senators then began addressing the allegations directly. Made anonymously at the time, the allegations were attacked as hearsay with Senator John Cornyn taking to Twitter to retweet a post likening the allegations to gossip. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then attacked the timing of the allegations as politically motivated, despite the fact that the allegations were first publicized through The Washington Post and The New Yorker, and not through Democratic senators.
With now-Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford coming forward as the accuser, the attacks have become even more pointed and now include character attacks on the accuser herself. Those attacks have already begun on Twitter, spreading her home address and contact information and attacking her past political contributions. In a more juvenile fashion, Donald Trump Jr. mocked the allegations on Instagram.
Others, like Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have returned to defending Kavanaugh by citing his youth at the time: “[W]e're talking about 35 years ago. I'd hate to ask, have somebody ask me what I did 35 years ago.” Though it might be noted that 35 years ago, Grassley was a freshman senator.
Desperate to push the nomination through, senators are now calling for Ford to testify before the Senate immediately, denying her the investigation that many like Senator Orrin Hatch had lauded back in 1991 with the Anita Hill allegations. Though back then he called such an investigation “the very right thing to do,” a tweet from his office just this week defended denying Ford a similar investigation, saying that “the FBI does not do investigations like this. The responsibility falls to us.”
There are more and more examples of disheartening reactions by people in power — too many for me to cite — but these reactions show their true character. If this kind of reaction from the majority party in both houses of Congress is acceptable to you, then by all means, vote them back in and confirm Kavanaugh. To me, these are unacceptable.
This country has seen allegations of sexual harassment come up in the nomination of a Supreme Court justice before, but that time the Senate failed in its function. It can’t happen again. With one man credibly accused of sexual harassment on the Supreme Court already, it’s imperative that our representatives in Washington not usher in a second.
Ed Rollins, chairman of a conservative political action committee, was quoted as saying that “if this is the new standard, no one will ever want or be able to serve in government or on the judiciary.” If that is the new standard, this country should take a look into the pasts of other elected and appointed officials, because no one guilty of such sexual harassment should ever be able to serve in government or on the judiciary. Judging by how many allegations have come to light, it’s not hard to believe that more will come.
More than that, though, the greater culture echoed by Grassley, Cornyn, Hatch, McConnell, and others cannot be accepted. It must be changed. Come November, I can only hope that all of these reactions stick in the mind of voters as they enter the polling booths. They stick in mine, and I’m voting for a better culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After controversially placing student religious group Harvard College Faith and Action on probation, the College has at last outlined concrete procedure regarding future disciplinary action toward student groups. Over the summer, the Office of Student Life developed a four-step process through which administrators would address violations of school rules by student groups. This process consists of a report and subsequent review, a decision on the part of the College, the possibility of an appeal, and possible punishments student groups may receive. These punishments range from a “Warning,” in which the group is alerted of its rule violation, to a permanent “Revocation” of the group’s status as a recognized Harvard organization.
We have previously criticized of the vague details surrounding HCFA’s year-long probation. HCFA, despite being on probation, did not experience any immediate losses of student group privileges, such as booking spaces on campus or being eligible for Undergraduate Council funding. Although a clearly structured policy would have been much appreciated prior to this incident, we commend Harvard for creating a procedure to discipline student groups. Now that the College has clarified what constitutes various disciplinary measures, student groups presumably will be aware of the consequences they may face for violating community rules, and will thus have an incentive to follow College’s guidelines.
However, the College’s new policies leave something to be desired. While the College is making efforts to hold groups to community norms, it has yet to satisfactorily articulate and disseminate what those norms are. The norms detailed in the Student Handbook are mostly abstract principles, with the exception of the clause on discrimination. Harvard should further articulate the standards to which it holds student organizations. Were the College to more clearly spell out what it expects from its student groups, the benefits would extend far beyond fairer punishments. Indeed, giving student organizations a clear understanding of Harvard’s community values would improve the character of student life in a non-punitive manner.
Additionally, the College owes students a more clear dissemination of its new punishment system. While the guidelines were announced at meetings for student group leaders at the beginning of the semester and explained in the 2018-2019 Recognized Student Organization Resource and Policy Guide, the majority of students at the College did have an opportunity to attend the former and do not have easy access to the latter. Only by making sure all students are apprised of these punishments, and of the community norms to which they are held, can the College make a maximally effective positive impact on student life with these policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s School of Public Health raised $933 million total in its capital campaign, school officials announced at a campaign celebration Friday.
The total more than doubles the goal of $450 million the school announced in October 2013.
Donors, administrators, and alumni packed into a tent in the school’s Kresge Courtyard for Friday’s celebration, which marked the culmination of a campaign that began quietly seven years ago. School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams opened the event and led a panel discussion between four former deans of the school.
Julio Frenk, who served as dean between 2009 and 2015 and now serves as the president of the University of Miami, described the financial difficulties the school faced in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. With hundreds of millions in its coffers, he said, the school is now on stronger financial footing.
After the panel discussion, Jonathan Lavine — the co-managing partner of Bain Capital who co-chaired the campaign with his wife, Jeannie Lavine '88 — took the podium to announce the campaign had raised $933 million from around 13,000 gifts.
“I was sort of hoping that there’s a $67 million gift in the room so that we could round it up,” Lavine joked after stating the total.
The school will be able to establish 12 new professorships as a result of the donations from the capital campaign, which will also go toward initiatives like financial aid, Lavine said. Donations came from all 50 states and 62 countries.
Lavine then introduced University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who used to teach summer courses on environmental health and management at the School of Public Health. Bacow emphasized what he sees as the broader societal impacts of research at the school.
“Everyone benefits when we uncover the human cost of climate change and shed light on the realities of gun violence. What happens here is not just public health; it is public service,” Bacow said.
He added that the school’s work regularly saves lives.
“To save one life, just one life, is the equivalent of saving the entire universe,” Bacow said, referencing the Talmud. “We have saved and continue to save the universe, over and over and over again.”
Roughly 40 percent of the capital campaign haul came from a $350 million donation by Gerald Chan, prompting Harvard to rename the school after his father, T.H. Chan.
The event included several video messages from individuals including Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 and Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, a former dean of the School of Public Health. Both thanked Gerald Chan by name for his donation.
Williams said Chan’s gift “injected new energy here at the school that sparked innovative, out-of-the box thinking.”
The School of Public Health’s campaign formed part of the University’s record-breaking capital campaign, which raised a total of $9.6 billion, administrators announced last week.
Several other Harvard schools, including the Kennedy School, have also announced fundraising totals well in excess of their goals.
Correction: Oct. 1, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard Medical School had not formally publicized its final capital campaign total at the time of publication. In fact, the school had posted its final fundraising total on its website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department is investigating one burglary and one attempted burglary Friday morning in freshman dorms, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano announced in an email to University affiliates Friday.
Several Wigglesworth Hall residents reported that someone climbed through their first floor window while they were sleeping and stole “several laptops, wallets, and an iPhone,” Catalano wrote.
Approximately four hours later, officers discovered an attempted burglary at Mower Hall while in the Yard investigating the burglary in Wigglesworth Hall. The offender or offenders pulled the screen off the window but were not able to break into the room due to the vent lock.
“It is unclear whether these incidents are connected; however, all of these incidents are being actively investigated by HUPD detectives,” Catalano wrote.
These incidents come just a few weeks after another string of thefts were reported in Holworthy and Mower Halls. The earlier thefts are similar to those that occured on Friday in terms of both methods and items stolen.
On Aug. 28, a freshman in Mower reported that, while he had been asleep the previous night, someone raised the screen on his open window and took a laptop from a nearby desk. On Sept. 5, several Holworthy residents reported the theft of laptops, wallets, and an iPad. Once again, the perpetrator climbed through a window.
The burglaries prompted some freshmen on the first floors of Holworthy and Mower to take additional precautions such as locking windows and avoiding placing valuables near windows.
“You’re not living in a total bubble. There’s stuff you have to look out for,” said Douglass A. Bryant ’22, who lives on the first floor of Holworthy, after the initial break-ins occurred.
Though thefts like these do occasionally happen in the Yard and the upperclassmen houses, this many in such a short time frame is unusual.
In response to a similar string of thefts in February of last year, a college subcommittee worked with the UC to improve residential security and produce a report of their findings. The group was part of the larger Harvard Safety Committee, which seeks to raise awareness about security breaches across the College.
In his email on Friday, Catalano urged Harvard affiliates not to prop doors open, to keep their rooms locked, to close their windows when leaving the room, and to “keep all property away from windows.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s record-breaking $9.6 billion capital campaign sends a strong signal of faith in Harvard and higher education — but it also highlights ongoing tensions in the industry, experts say.
Launched in 2013 under former University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard’s capital campaign set out to break a record previously held by Stanford University, which had raised $6.2 billion in its campaign that concluded in 2012.
Harvard’s goal — $6.5 billion — was ambitious at the time. Three years later, Harvard sailed past its target and was well on its way to the eventual $9.6 billion haul the University made public last week.
At a time when both Harvard and higher education face a hostile political climate marked by a high-profile lawsuit against Harvard, a tax on some university endowments, and criticisms of higher education's efficacy to the average American, the capital campaign still managed to exceed expectations.
Tamara E. Rogers, vice president for alumni affairs and development, said the campaign ended “very successfully.”
The unprecedented haul displays donors’ confidence in both the value of a Harvard education and the ways in which administrators use financial gifts, experts say.
Fred Weiss, chief research and data officer at the Washington, D.C.-based Council for Advancement and Support of Education, said the “big impact” of Harvard’s success is its demonstration that “educational institutions are really worth supporting.”
Weiss said enthusiasm in capital campaigns like Harvard’s results from “carefully built relationships” with established and potential donors whose priorities align with those of the institution.
“Where those things overlap, it can turn into the results we’ve seen for Harvard and for other campaigns,” Weiss said. “All of these things advance the mission of an institution and, more broadly, the mission of education, and, more broadly, the impact that education can have on individuals, families, and communities.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a higher education law expert at Stetson University, on the other hand, said the campaign’s success also conveys a different kind of faith in Harvard — that donors believe the school is using their gifts effectively across the University.
He particularly pointed to Harvard’s approach to paying its staff, putting funds behind student groups, and backing long-term endowed professorships — taken together, a strategy that can help schools avoid perpetual concerns over annual operating budgets.
“Obviously, the folks willing to commit those kinds of resources believe chiefly that the choices are good ones,” Lake said.
Critics of higher education around the nation, however, may not necessarily agree in the value of these investments. Weiss said the success and high visibility of Harvard’s campaign creates a certain awkwardness in light of Harvard’s efforts to fight the tax on its endowment.
Republican lawmakers passed a tax overhaul in Dec. 2017 that levied a 1.4 percent excise tax on the returns of large university endowments. Harvard has spent money and sent University presidents to Washington to make the case that taxing the endowment will hurt financial aid and other essential University initiatives. Raking in almost $10 billion in donations could appear to contradict this message.
“Success like this runs the risk on the one side of people saying, ‘Well look at how rich these institutions are, and we should try to tax them more,’” Weiss said.
Yet Weiss said this is a “misunderstanding” of the way both campaigns and endowments work.
“Donors want to support causes that they feel really strongly about and, as a result, they put restrictions on some of the things that they support,” he said. “Endowments aren’t places where an institution can go and just write a check out of.”
Public relations implications aside, Lake said Harvard’s “extraordinary achievement” with its campaign also highlights increased stratification in wealth between liberal arts colleges and universities across the country.
“The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and there are a hundred colleges out there that would just beg to split a billion dollars amongst them,” Lake said.
A higher bar for Harvard, then, doesn’t necessarily translate into higher fundraising goals across higher education, Weiss and Rogers said.
Rogers, who will step down at the end of the calendar year, said university leaders observe each other’s campaigns, but that most schools — including Harvard — tend to think more about the “impact of the funds they raised” rather than the final number.
Weiss said Harvard’s base of support is particularly extensive because of the school’s elite status.
“There are very few other institutions that can achieve those types of outcomes,” he said. “I think most institutions are going to sit back and say: what is right for us, what is right for our community of donors, what is right for the local community that we’re in, and let’s make sure that we’re setting realistic goals.”
Rogers and Weiss said colleges and universities must also examine what the expectations might be for the level of support an individual campaign might receive. Rogers said this is crucial in a campaign’s “quiet phase” — a testing period prior to a campaign’s launch that helps universities determine a realistic final goal.
Even if Harvard’s campaign doesn’t set a new bar for higher education fundraising, it might still serve as a model for more effective campaigns, Lake said. Other schools are likely to try “studying the film” from the campaign to borrow from Harvard’s fundraising tactics in their own efforts.
“It’s likely to influence how people operate their capital campaigns,” Lake said. “I think people are going to try to figure out, ‘How did they do this? How do you turn that much money up in such a short period of time?’”

On Friday Sept. 14 as the Category 1 Hurricane Florence was making landfall, all Carolina natives at Harvard could do was watch as they waited to hear back from family members and see if their homes sustained any damage.
Since Florence arrived on the east coast, there have been at least 43 confirmed deaths, flooding estimated as high as 30 inches — which would be a state record for North Carolina if confirmed — and possible contamination of rivers due to flood damage to a dam in North Carolina.
Caroline Tew ’20, whose mother was able to evacuate to Boston, said they frantically watched the news hoping to see how her hometown, Myrtle Beach, was doing after the storm.
“They were forecasting that for North Carolina, and maybe even for my hometown of Myrtle Beach, it would be as bad as Katrina was, and so I was really panicked,” Tew, a Crimson arts editor, said.
Tew said in the days leading up to the storm’s landfall, she was preoccupied with tracking the storm and contacting people she knew still in the area.
“It was kind of hard to focus on the smaller assignments just because I spent several hours of my day on and off checking weather reports and texting people that I didn't normally text to be like, ‘Are you safe?’” she said. “So I had like a lot more on my mind than usual.”
North Carolina native Mari Jones ’21 said contacting her family the weekend after the storm was not possible due to power outages.
Now that the storm has passed, however, the majority of problems result from flooding. Issues include cars fully submerged in roads that now resemble rivers, lack of access to basic facilities due to road obstruction, and fallen trees, which have caused a number of deaths.
“When you are closer inland, you don't have the drainage set up to handle that much water, so it's not really the winds and stuff, the infrastructure is fine for that, but it's the amount of water damage that can happen to a lot of buildings that’ll actually make them collapse,” Jones said.
In a move that sparked controversy, South Carolina announced that it wouldn’t be evacuating its prisons, even though many are along its coast. Salma Abdelrahman ’20, advocacy chair for the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, expressed frustration at this decision, pointing towards Hurricane Katrina as an example of what can happen when prisoners are not evacuated.
“At the time, they had been staying in cells with water up to their chests and the prison guards were told to evacuate the building, and prisoners were really just sitting in their cells, swimming in water, with no support or relief,” Abdelrahman said.
Abdelrahman said that, at an upcoming HOPE event, the group would urge people to call the governor’s office and the department of corrections in South Carolina.
“It's just despicable, quite honestly, to dehumanize people to an extent where we allow them to stay in cages at risk of losing their lives,” she said.
A number of major roads, including Interstate 40 and Interstate 95, are still closed, and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster estimated that Florence cost the state a total of 1.2 billion dollars.
Hurricane Florence arrived near the anniversary of Category 4 storm Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, leaving many residents still trying to recover nearly a year later. Jones said storms like Florence and Maria, while highlighting insufficient infrastructure, also exacerbate economic and social problems since those with the most resources can more often afford to leave or rebuild.
“I feel like natural disasters, I don't want to say are handled poorly, but there's just not enough infrastructure because South Carolina isn't used to hurricanes, neither is North Carolina,” she said. “But I think when they do happen, those who are more financially well off tend to come out a little more blessed than other people and then other people are kind of neglected in it, which I think we also saw with Puerto Rico.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s “Name It, Face It, End It” symposium, speakers and attendees discussed the issue of sexual violence in schools and strategies to prevent it.
The symposium, held on Friday, consisted of a day-long conference divided into two interactive workshop tracks, one for those working within the K-12 education system and one for those working in higher education.
After the conclusion of workshops, attendees reconvened for a keynote address from Jackson Katz, an educator, social theorist, and Ed School alum. Katz is the founder of the Mentors in Violence Prevention program, which provides sexual harassment and gender violence prevention training to organizations.
Katz focused on the positive impact of prevention and education programs for not only young women, but also young men. He stressed that language and communication often perpetuate sexism and the acceptance of gender-based violence.
“You’ll hear people say ‘How many women were sexually assaulted on college campuses last year?’ rather than ‘How many men sexually assaulted women on college campuses last year?’” Katz said. “Or, you’ll hear, ‘How many teenage girls got pregnant last year?’ rather than, ‘How many men impregnated teenage girls last year?’”
This is the second symposium on the issue of sexual violence in schools that Justine Finn and Rachel Hanebutt, both of whom graduated from the Ed School in 2016, have organized. They cited a dearth of discussion around sexual violence in schools for pre-professionals entering the education field as the impetus for the conference.
“When we were at [the Ed School], there seemed to be a lack of courses and events that prioritized talking about sexual harassment and gender-based violence in schools,” Hanebutt said. “There were very few resources for educators to facilitate and learn how to prevent these types of violences.”
With the current wave of anti-sexual assault activism, the organizers found they had a large amount of interest in the symposium. Regardless of political moment, however, Finn said their efforts to combat sexual violence in schools will continue.
“As the news changes and comes and goes, we are still going to be doing this work,” Finn said. “If the #MeToo movement is just a moment, we are still going to be in the trenches. Where we are happy to be.”

Upperclassmen, alumni, and faculty travelled to and from the podium of Memorial Church Sunday afternoon for the College's first Latinx Convocation themed “Mis Raices, Mi Communidad.”
The ceremony, the title of which translates to “My Roots, My Community,” was organized by Latinx student leaders in order to welcome students of Latinx heritage in the Class of 2022.
Genesis N. De Los Santos ’19, one of the student speakers, spoke of her upbringing in Dorchester, Mass. and her experiences and growth at Harvard.
“Whatever paths you trekked to get here, whatever mountains our ancestors climbed, whatever borders they crossed — both the physical and theoretical — we have achieved the unfathomable,” De Los Santos said.
She continued to address the incoming class, focusing on the feeling of “otherness” that she said the students may encounter during their four years at Harvard. She reassured the class, “If you’re feeling inadequate, know that you are not alone. We have all at least once felt this.”
Mariachi Veritas opened the ceremony and played several songs before the speakers addressed the audience. The ceremony was followed by an evening reception with light refreshments in Teresita Fernández’s art installation in Tercentenary Theatre, called “Autumn (... Nothing Personal).” First-year students were congratulated with roses as they mingled among peers and speakers.
Angel A. Mata ’22, who is of Venezuelan heritage, was one of the several dozen first-year students at the event.
“Coming to Harvard is very different. I didn’t really realize how much I’d miss that part of my life,” Mata said, referring to his upbringing in Florida in a predominantly Latinx environment.
“To me, this [convocation] means representation on campus and acknowledgement that we are here, and we are powerful,” Xochitl Morales ’22 said. “I’m excited for the freshmen next year.”
Elizabeth Solomon, assistant director of academic affairs and fellowship programs at the Harvard School of Public Health and a member of the Massachusetts Tribe at Ponkapoag, was one of many faculty members and administrators to speak at the convocation. She acknowledged the history of the land where Harvard stands and its ties to the indigenous people of the region.
“When indigenous communities in the United States gather together, they traditionally acknowledge the ancestral holders of the land they are meeting on,” Solomon said.
“Many non-Native communities have started to incorporate this practice in public events both to honor Native peoples who belong to the land and to recognize that the use of the land by Harvard has come as a result of displacement of the land’s original holders.”
In addition, a few faculty members addressed Latinx Convocation guests. Among them were María Parra-Velasco, a senior preceptor in the Department of Romance Literature and Languages; Brian D. Farrell, Leverett House Faculty Dean and a professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology; and Alejandro De La Fuente, a professor of Latin American history and economics.
Dianisbeth M. Acquie ’16, a second-year Law School student and Lowell House resident tutor, said she was involved with the Latinx community during her time as undergraduate, including as vice president of Fuerza Latina. In her speech, she told first-year students that it was “remarkably brave” to leave their homes and chase that “beautiful dream” at Harvard.
“There is a shirt I’ve seen before, and it reads, ‘I am my ancestor’s wildest dreams.’ And it’s true. I am. You are.”
Correction: Sept. 25, 2018
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Alejandro De La Fuente. It has been updated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of astronomy enthusiasts filled every available seat to listen to Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb describe recent innovations in the search for life beyond our solar system.
Loeb, who chairs the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, presented to the packed house in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics’ Phillips Auditorium on Thursday.
The Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, founded in 2015 by investors Yuri and Gloria Milner, is a “$100 million research and engineering program aiming to demonstrate proof of concept for... ultra-light unmanned space flight at 20% of the speed of light,” according to the initiative’s website.
Space flight at this speed would allow a flyby mission to reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to Earth, within our lifetimes, reducing a mission that would have taken tens or hundreds of millennia with current rocket propulsion technology to just a few decades.
In particular, astronomers hope to photograph Proxima b, a planet which — according to Loeb — sits at just the right distance from Proxima Centauri, a dwarf star in the Alpha Centauri system, to potentially have liquid water on its surface and thus sustain life.
Loeb began his lecture by explaining his belief in the “cosmic modesty principle.” According to Loeb, Earth is probably not the only planet to contain life, due to the sheer size of the universe.
“If you realize that a quarter of all the stars are hosting habitable Earths, then there are more habitable planets in the observable volume of the universe than there are grains of sand in all the beaches on Earth,” Loeb said in his lecture. “An emperor or king…boasting about a piece of land here on Earth is no more different than an ant that is hugging a grain of sand on one of these beaches.”
Loeb said in an interview Monday that one of Breakthrough Starshot’s greatest challenges is designing a lightweight spacecraft that can travel at a fifth of the speed of light. In order to reduce excess weight, according to Loeb, the spacecraft must only contain necessities, including a camera, a navigation device, and a communication device.
“[Our spacecraft prototype is] based on a sail that is being pushed by light,” Loeb said.
According to Loeb, scientists plan to shine a powerful laser on the spacecraft and accelerate it “over a distance that is roughly five times the distance to the Moon” until it reaches the desired speed, giving the craft enough energy to travel to Alpha Centauri.
“The amount of energy that you need to invest in this launch process is similar to the liftoff of a space shuttle,” Loeb said. “Except now, the concept is to deliver it to just a few grams of material  — that’s why it reaches a much higher speed — instead of many tons.”
Loeb said the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative is in the “first baby steps” of a three-phase process, which include the feasibility phase, where scientists attempt to demonstrate the technology; the testing phase, where scientists build a prototype of the spacecraft; and the launch phase, the culmination of the scientists’ work.
He compared the cost of the final phase to that of “the biggest science projects that are currently funded, like the James Webb or the Large Hadron Collider.” Looking ahead to the future, Loeb said international collaboration would be yet another hurdle of Breakthrough Starshot, even after the scientific and technical challenges are resolved.
Loeb emphasized the immediacy of the initiative, referencing a statistical analysis that compares the likelihood of extraterrestrial life existing in the present versus in the distant future.
“If you allow life to exist only around stars similar to the Sun, you find that being here and now is the most likely thing,” Loeb said. “We are here and now. Perhaps that says something.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students flocked to the center of Tercentenary Theatre on a sunny Friday afternoon to break dance, recite slam poetry, and muse about legal history — all in the name of affirmative action in Harvard admissions.
Members of the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies and the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights organized the “afternoon of education” — entitled “Defending Diversity: A Timeline of Affirmative Action and Race-Conscious Admissions” — to show support for Harvard’s race-based admissions policies.
The event comes as Harvard’s affirmative action policies are set to face a legal challenge in federal court on Oct. 15. The University is facing allegations that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
Student leaders of TAPAS displayed posters on a large art installation in Tercentenary Theatre outlining the history of affirmative action in American higher education from the post-Civil War era to modern policies at schools like Harvard.
The event included three interpretive student performances as part of its “celebration of diversity.” To open, one student delivered a slam poem in two parts.
In the first portion, the student addressed her poem to Asian tourists in the Yard and spoke of racial dynamics at the College. In the second part, she read from a section of the College’s admissions office website. That section, called “What We Look For,” lists a number of questions for prospective students to consider as they apply.
Members of the Harvard Breakers followed the poem; the break dance troupe performed in the center of the art installation as students and tourists looked on. Two student musicians — one on the flute and the other on the violin — closed out the event with a classical performance.
Visitors to the event were able to write comments and sign their names on posters asking about the value of diversity and discussions about race.
Emily C. Zhu ’20, a member of TAPAS who was involved in organizing the Friday event, said the hour was aimed at sparking conversation around campus about the relationship between racial diversity and college admissions.
“We feel that a lot of people are, perhaps, not super-familiar with what affirmative action actually is or its history,” Zhu said. “So we just wanted to do some education, raise some awareness, and just get people out hear and talking about what is happening.”
The “Defending Diversity” event was not the first time Harvard students have spoken out in support of the University as its admissions controversy comes to a head.
In late August, 25 Harvard student and alumni groups filed an amicus brief arguing their school “must consider race” in order to reap the benefits of a diverse student body. A Harvard senior recently filed highly personal ratings and evaluations from his admissions file in a show of public support. And several students and alumni have now petitioned the judge overseeing the case for permission to testify at the trial.
The art installation in Tercentenary Theatre, which will be on display until Oct. 1, is intended to be “a space for public dialogue and performance.” Student groups will host events around the installation throughout the remainder of its time in the Yard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following two shutouts last weekend against Northeastern and UMass, Harvard field hockey, led by senior back Olivia Allin’s two second half goals, prevailed 6-0 against Yale in its first Ivy League matchup of the season, once again blanking its opponent.
Under the lights at the Berylson Family Field Hockey Field, the Crimson (6-1, 1-0 Ivy) took the field on Friday night, surrounded by flocks of Harvard fans waving long stemmed red cups that the Harvard Shop handed out as fans entered. As one of the featured games of the week, the matchup between Harvard and the rival Bulldogs began with intensity from both sides from the first ball drop.
With Yale (3-3, 0-1) conceding a penalty corner within the first two minutes, junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen, assisted by fellow junior midfielder Casey Allen, broke through to score the Crimson’s first goal of the game and her eighth on the season.
Harvard carried the momentum on another penalty corner four minutes later to score their second goal of the game. Senior Emily Duarte punched the ball into the goal for her first of the season with van Vlijmen assisting. The Bulldogs never recovered and the Crimson maintained the control for the rest of the first half. The sound of plastic on metal could be heard with each Harvard success from the crowd gathered.
The Crimson continued to rely on offensive bursts in the second half, while Yale struggled to move the ball past the midfield line.
Breaking through a line of Yale defenders, Allin shot on target to score her first goal of the season. Six minutes later, Allin once again drove through the Bulldog defense surrounded by her Harvard teammates to score her second goal of the game. This was Allin’s first two-goal game in her Harvard career.
Allin’s goals opened the floodgates for the Crimson as the team continued to find the backstop with junior forward Maddie Earle and freshman midfielder Olivia Hoover both netting goals. The crowd rumbled with Hoover’s goal as she scored her first in a Harvard uniform.
Throughout the game, Harvard attempted a total of 23 shots with 15 on goal, forcing Yale’s sophomore goalkeeper Sydney Terroso to make nine saves throughout the game. The Crimson dominated the box score as the Bulldogs visibly struggled. The crowd at Berylson Field took notice. With each Yale misstep, cheers could be heard from the Harvard fans gathered in the bleachers.
Defensively, freshman goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo saw little action with Yale only shooting the ball five times with only one shot on goal. Shahbo recorded one save and her second win on the season in net as she allowed no goals for the second game in a row.
With the shutout, Harvard maintains a six year winning streak versus Yale with the last loss to the Bulldogs in 2012.
After the win, the Crimson, with a perfect home record intact, stand at the top of the Ivy League standings, tied with Princeton, Columbia and Penn as conference play looks to pick up in the next few weeks with the next conference game at Penn on Sept. 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a hot start to the 2018 campaign, the Harvard women’s rugby team (2-1 NIRA) endured a setback on the road at Dartmouth. After jetting out to two strong double-digit victories over Quinnipiac and Army West Point, the Crimson struggled on both offensive and defensive sides of the ball on Saturday.
By the end of regulation, the hosts had run up the final score to 55-13. Saturday was another instance of the Big Green asserting its dominance over the Crimson squad in the last few years. Although Harvard has had Dartmouth’s number in 7s play, the Big Green improved to 6-2 all time against the Crimson in 15s, with Harvard’s last 15s triumph coming nearly four years ago.
Despite the disappointing result, the Crimson showed promise to begin the match as both teams remained deadlocked at zero. About 12 minutes passed in scoreless action before Dartmouth struck first as, Big Green senior Alex Stendahl added a try to open up a 5-0 lead. For the rest of the first half, Dartmouth would stretch its lead, adding another 26 points in a row to reach a 31-0 advantage. In the final 10 minutes of the first half, the Crimson regained some momentum, keeping the Big Green off the scoreboard and adding three points of its own before the half. Harvard senior Jenny Kronish maintained her team-leading scoring by pushing a successful penalty kick through the goalposts.
In the second half, the visitors started off how they left off the first—with some of their best play of the game. Coming out of the locker room, the Crimson built on its first score with another five points in the first three minutes of the second half; senior Rachel Harkavy cut the deficit to 31-8 with her first scoring effort of the season. Dartmouth would repay the favor, however, as the Big Green would rattle off 24 unanswered points. Looking to respond, the Crimson capped off the match on a high note, completing another try to finalize the scoring at 55-13.
Despite the tough defeat, the Crimson can take some silver linings from Saturday’s tilt. First-year Sofie Fella scored the final try of the game, continuing her streak of scoring over the first three games of her career. Also, despite the final result, most of Dartmouth’s scoring came in two spurts, with the Crimson evening momentum if not taking some back in the other portions of the game. Finally, the 13 points that the Crimson tallied marked the most that it had registered against Dartmouth in 15s since 2016. Although this loss marks the Crimson’s first defeat in Ivy Rugby play, the team still sports an impressive 2-1 record in National Intercollegiate Rugby Association (NIRA) competition. The squad will look to rest up with an off week before returning home to Mignone Field to take on NIRA rivals Quinnipiac on Oct. 6th at noon. The game will also be broadcast on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense wins championships, but defense prevented a goal being scored in nearly two hours of soccer, leading to a tie.
Overtime did not allow either Harvard (3-4-1, 0-0-1 Ivy) or Penn (6-1-1, 0-0-1) to emerge victorious in the Ivy League opener this past weekend. The match, hosted at Rhodes Field in Philadelphia, Pa., was a battle of defenses, and both goalies refused to let their teams down.
Crimson senior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel shut out Penn’s four shots on goal to receive her third solo shutout of the year. Unfortunately for the visitors, Quaker junior goalkeeper Kitty Qu was up to the task, denying Harvard’s five shots on goal to earn her sixth solo shutout of the year.
Freshman defenseman Jillian Wachira led the Crimson’s offense with three shots, while sophomore forward Murphy Agnew and senior midfielder Leah Mohammadi contributed two shots apiece. Penn senior midfielder Allie Trzaska led the Quakers with six shots, three of which were on goal, but all easily handled by Etzel. None of Harvard’s 12 shots nor Penn’s 15 were enough to change the outcome of the scoreless game.
The defensive matchup was a stalemate from the start, with both touted defenses holding tough at the beginning of the contest. The first true opportunity did not come until 17 minutes into the game, as the Quakers fired a shot wide of goal. The Crimson, matching with an attack of its own, saw a shot from freshman midfielder Taylor Nielson miss over the crossbar just over four minutes after Penn’s early opportunity.
The Quakers kept up the pressure, testing Etzel early. The Harvard goalie recorded her first save on a shot in the 26th minute, leading to a Penn corner. The corner gave the Quakers another opportunity, but the ensuing shot was blocked.
The first half only resulted in six shots combined, limiting both teams’ ability to gain any momentum. The intensity picked up in the second half, with shots and saves finally becoming frequent. Within the first few minutes of the second 45, Wachira attempted a strike off a corner kick, but a Penn defender was able to block and clear the ball. A few more corners throughout the match provided scares for both sides, but the defense consistently prevailed.
Both teams had opportunities to score in the extra sessions, including an attempt by Mohammadi in the first period, but missed over the bar. This would prove to be the last offensive chance for the Crimson. The second overtime saw only the Quakers on the attack. Less than a minute and a half into double overtime, Etzel came up big for Harvard with a crucial save to keep the game tied. Penn would see one more chance to earn a late victory, but a wide shot in the 108th minute held the game scoreless.
This was the fourth time the Crimson has been held scoreless this season, while it was only the second time for the Quakers. Both teams are on a streak of shutting out teams; Harvard is on a 466 consecutive minute streak, and Penn is on a 290 consecutive minute streak. The Quakers’ 6-1-1 record is the best start in school history. Harvard will look to secure its first Ivy League victory against storied rival Yale.

The Harvard men’s tennis team continued its strong start at the Ivy Plus tournament at Princeton and Yale this weekend, winning 15 of 27 matches in their second tournament under new head coach Andrew Rueb ’95. That leaves the Crimson needing just two wins from six Sunday matches to leave Ivy Plus with a record above .500.
Harvard’s standout performer at Ivy Plus over the first two days was sophomore Robert Wrzesinski, who is looking to improve on an exciting freshman year during which he was a Second Team All-Ivy selection in doubles. The Vilnius, Lithuania native remained undefeated on the season by sweeping the first three rounds of the Lenz flight, all in straight sets. The wins send him to the finals and a matchup with LSU on Sunday, yet to be played at press time.
Wrzesinski also paired with senior Christopher Morrow in the Silver Gold flight, with the Crimson duo winning both of their opening day matches by scorelines of 8-6 over Brown and 8-2 over Washington. It was an impressive first day for a pair that did not play together last season, providing a good sign of things to come. Wrzesinski and Morrow have advanced to the finals of the Silver Gold flight, where they will take on Princeton on Sunday morning.
Coming off of a 3-0 doubles debut at last weekend’s Chowder Fest tournament, freshman Brian Shi and junior Logan Weber split their two Friday matches, defeating Alabama, 8-5, before falling to Princeton by the same score.
The victory over Alabama was particularly noteworthy as the Crimson Tide team included standout senior Mazen Osama, who came into the season ranked No. 3 in the ITA Singles Rankings. Shi and Weber will now look to end the weekend on a high note on Sunday morning, when they face LSU.
With captain Andy Zhou sitting the tournament out, Shi, who came into Harvard as a five-star recruit, was the lone Crimson man at the tournament’s main Tiger Gold flight. Shi fell to Alex Brown of Illinois, who was No. 50 in the preseason ITA Singles Rankings, in straight sets, sending him to the loser’s bracket of the Tiger event.
Shi then went on to split his Saturday matches, leaving him at 1-2 heading into his final match Sunday against Tulsa. The Jericho, N.Y. native continues to face tough competition in his introduction to college tennis, as he went 1-1 against two other ranked players — Indiana’s Antonio Cembellin (No. 66) and Texas Tech’s Tommy Mylnikov (No. 69) — at last week’s Chowder Fest tournament.
Elsewhere, freshman Harris Walker continued to build off of a strong start to his college tennis career. Walker entered the Cordish flight off the heels of a 2-1 singles performance at the Chowder Fest tournament last weekend. He won two of three Cordish matches across Friday and Saturday and will face Illinois on Sunday morning with the hope of finishing 5-2 in his first two college tournaments.
Harvard will conclude Ivy Plus play on Sunday and then gear up for ITA Regionals, which take place in Princeton, N.J. from Oct. 11 through Oct. 16. It will try to build off of a promising start, especially considering the fact that 2018 is its first year without ex-head coach Dave Fish, who spent 42 years with the team, racking up 21 Ivy League championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the decisive men’s 21-36 win at the HYP meet and a strong third place finish from the women’s team last week, the Crimson once again competed at Franklin Park this Friday at the Beantown annual. Over 400 runners represented 28 teams, with some coming from as far as Utah State University, and others as close as Northeastern University.
With the HYP meet occuring last week and an upcoming meet at the Roy Griak Invitational next week, Harvard fielded significantly fewer runners this year than previously before, with hopes of resting the majority of its racers to prepare for later meets.
The men’s team this year was represented by only three racers: sophomores Matthew Pereira, John Fish, and Michael Kolor. Pereira led all three with a final time of 25:20 in the eight-kilometer race, coming within two seconds of his personal record which he ran last season at the Princeton Invitational. Junior captain Charlie Davis had high praise for Kolor.
“On Matt’s race, it was great to watch him running as he moved up throughout the entire race and started to close in on a pack of Dartmouth racers,” Davis said. “I’m confident that if it had gone longer he would have passed them. He stayed calm and focused throughout the race, and really executed well.”
Meanwhile, John Fish (26:39) and Michael Kolor (26:47) followed not far behind, placing 172nd and 181st, respectively. Both racers had personal bests, beating their times from just a week before at the same course.
With the men’s course divided over five sections, the first two miles took the runners around White Stadium twice, the third and fourth mile covered the Wall of Stone and the Hairpin Turn, looping around the entire course and leading into the fifth mile, which had the runners circling Bear Cage Hill before returning into the Playstead and finishing the race. All three runners held mile paces of below 5:30.
With clear skies and temperatures in the mid-sixties, the historic Franklin Park course offered a perfect opportunity for each runner to either set or almost match their personal records.
For the women’s team, sophomore Lauren Spohn ran a personal record of 20:52, dropping nearly a minute on her previous five-kilometer race. Following a track similar to that of the men’s, she ran around White Stadium and Bear Cage Hill for the first two miles and rounding around the Wall of Stone and the Hairpin Turn before finishing in the Playstead.
“The performance at Beantown wasn’t really a good benchmark for where the team is, just because we didn’t have a full team running. [We were] scouting out the Northeast and Ivy League competition and that was definitely very helpful to see, knowing just a little bit more about some of the teams that really matter when it really counts,” Davis said. “Griak will be the first test with some other teams at the national level, letting us know what to look at for the rest of the season. There will be a lot of work to do in preparation but it’s going to be really good getting some momentum for the rest of the season.”
The Crimson look to continue their season next week at the Roy Griak Invitational in St. Paul, Minn., on September 29th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an underwhelming start to the season two weeks ago at the Doc Gimmler, the Harvard men’s golf team traveled to Quechee, VT., looking for an improved showing at the Quechee Club Collegiate Challenge.  After two rounds of play Saturday and Sunday, the Crimson came away with a fifth-place finish out of a field of 12 teams.
Bucknell emerged with the victory after a stellar second round of play, cementing a final tally of 583.  Fellow Ivy League schools Cornell and Princeton tied for second place, with Drexel besting Harvard by 10 strokes for fourth place.
After not being able to travel with the team in Harvard’s last tournament, sophomore Grant Fairbairn led the way for Harvard in his season debut. The California native shot a 70 on Saturday, good enough for two-under par and third place on the leaderboard. Sunday saw him turn in a solid 73, which slid him back three spots to end the tournament in sixth place in a field of 74 competitors.  He was also able to compile seven birdies over the two rounds, a number topped by only six other competitors.
Host school Dartmouth finished in the middle of the pack only one stroke behind Harvard, with 600 total to the Crimson’s 599. Another member of the Ancient Eight, Brown, came home with a disappointing finish after what looked to be a promising start.  When Saturday’s round ended, it found themselves locked in a three-way tie for second place with Princeton and Harvard. While the Tigers and the Crimson were able to stay near the top of the leaderboard after Sunday, the Bears tumbled down to 10th place after a poor second round.
Harvard’s level of play improved from the first to second round, with four out of  five players shooting a lower score on Sunday than Saturday. Sophomore Peter George was able to improve on a dismal 82 by four strokes in the second round, leaving him with a total of 160 and tied for 66th.  The sole freshman competing, Brian Istzwan, was not able to repeat his team-leading performance from the Doc Gimmler, and his total of 157 left him tied for 54th.
Comprising the remainder of the field was, in order of finish, Holy Cross, Hartford, Siena College, Fordham, and Bryant.
Along with Fairbairn, junior Rij Patel had a strong weekend.  His scores of 75 on Saturday and 73 on Sunday were good enough to place him in a tie for 12th with John Bowen of Holy Cross and Jeffrey Cunningham from Drexel. Captain Aurian Capart had a commonplace showing, leaving Vermont tied for 24th after a final tally of 151.
Also present at the tournament was Harvard’s Ollie Cordero, who competed as an individual and finished one stroke behind Capart.
The Crimson will compete next weekend at Yale in the MacDonald Cup, held Sept. 29-30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s volleyball dropped its first Ivy League contest of the season to Dartmouth in a back-and-forth battle that ultimately ended the Crimson’s four-game winning streak.
The hard-fought match went the distance, with set scores of 26-24, 21-25, 25-21, 17-25, and 15-17. The Big Green (5-6, 1-0) got its revenge on Harvard, as the Crimson (5-5, 0-1 Ivy)  defeated the Big Green in both matchups last season for a two-game sweep. Harvard has historically handled the the Big Green well; despite its loss Friday, the Crimson is 51-22 all-time against its Hanover rivals.
The fourth set was hardly a true blowout, but it set the stage for the tie-breaking duel, in which Dartmouth held a slight edge for most of the way.  Harvard clawed back to knot the score at 12-12, and a kill by junior middle blocker Maclaine Fields gave the the Crimson women the lead. The Crimson held on until 15-14, but the Big Green reeled off a 3-0 run capped by an ace by Cox to win the set and the match in a hard-fought heartbreaker for the losing side.
Senior middle blocker Christina Cornelius posted a stellar performance against Dartmouth almost exactly a year prior to Friday’s showdown. She was impressive in Hanover, NH. again, notching her second double-double of the season with 14 digs and 14 kills.  The Los Angeles, Calif., native earned All-Ivy first team honors last season and is on her way to another strong campaign this year. Fellow Californian Fields also delivered for Harvard, narrowly missing out on a double-double with 14 kills and nine blocks.  The junior tied her career high in the latter category. Freshman setter Bella Almanza continued a good start to the season, racking up a season-high 43 assists and 10 digs.
Senior libero Anna Uhr, who paced last year’s squad in both total digs (283) and dig/set average (3.18), led the way against the Big Green with 19 digs.  Junior outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank and sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry both turned in solid showings, tallying 10 and nine digs, respectively, and co-captain Brooke Istvan recorded a career-high 13 digs.
Harvard got off to a shaky start as Dartmouth came out firing on all cylinders to claim a 13-4 lead.  The Crimson recovered quickly, though, and climbed back into the set, forcing the Big Green to use a timeout with the score at 21-15.  The pause proved ineffective for Dartmouth, as Harvard continued its roll and cut the deficit to one point at 24-23. A clutch Marbry kill brought the Crimson even, and another two points later clinched the victory.
The second set was as close as the first, and the Ivy League foes dueled to a 20-20 standoff.  Harvard took the lead on a bad set by Dartmouth junior defensive specialist Maddy Schoenberger, but the Big Green immediately called a timeout, and this one had its intended effect.  The break catalyzed a set-sealing 5-0 run for Dartmouth, including a dagger ace from junior right side hitter Corinne Cox.
In the third clash of the night, the Crimson controlled nearly wire to wire, opening up an 18-12 at one point.  Dartmouth ripped off five unanswered points late in the set, but Harvard shut the door on an ace from Mabry to take a 2-1 lead in sets.
The Crimson was within two points at 7-9 in the fourth set, but the Big Green then opened its advantage to 13-7 and never looked back, maintaining at least a four-point lead for the rest of the set on the way to securing a 25-17 win.
Harvard will look to bounce back over the weekend, when it takes on Cornell and Columbia.  A rematch with Dartmouth is set for October 19, and both teams are certain to come out firing.

Harvard students may have a lot going for them — brains, intellect, wit, the ability to come up with synonyms — but there are definitely areas of their lives that could be drastically improved if they had some superpowers to help them out. Here are just a few that Harvard students are desperately in need of. 
The power to find love
It’s not heart to believe that the satisfaction of completing a pset or turning in an essay can only fill the gaping holes in our hearts for so long. Some of us would love to go on a date before we become as wrinkled as a date.
The power to manipulate time
Step one: make Harvard Time a thing again so dhall lunch will no longer be a foreign concept. Talk about no longer being ticked off.
The power to alter your taste buds
This would be a tasteful power for the days when the HUDS menu just isn’t cooperating with your cravings...
The power of invisibility
This is for the inevitable moment when you drop your tray in the dhall and want the ground to swallow you up. Also a useful superpower if you get cold-called in class and don’t want to feel like a total phony.
The power to fly
No longer having to trek to and from the Quad would be a fly superpower. Also, if your grades aren’t soaring, at least you still can!

We know some of you still haven’t decorated your common room, and, let’s be honest, we haven’t really either. Not to worry, because we’ve rounded up the quickest ways to make your room #goals.
Pinterest
For a complete ~lewk~ go on Pinterest and find a dorm room to essentially copy. You know you wouldn’t be able to come up with a better one on your own.
Hang up Twinkle Lights
A key component of any of the aforementioned Pinterest rooms, twinkle lights easily spruce up a space. They add a really cozy vibe, and look nice in photos!
Buy a Succulent
Succulents have lots of pros: they look nice and are almost as easy to take care of as a fake plant, but have the added bonus of not being a fake plant. And if you’re like us and manage to kill one, they’re relatively inexpensive.
Use Your Bookshelf
Most people ignore the pesky Harvard-provided bookshelves because they can take up space, but we’re here to tell you not to! Even if it’s just with your required reading and textbooks, filling up your bookshelf makes the room look more homey.
Print photos at CVS
If a wall collage of all the most adorbs photos of you and your blockmates/ roommates is more your style, you can go online (or just go in-store!) and order and print photographs at CVS for reasonably cheap. They almost always have a promotion going on where if you order a certain amount, you get them for a reduced price!
Spice up your life and decorate your common space! You’ll thank us later when your friends and family assume you have your life together because of it.
