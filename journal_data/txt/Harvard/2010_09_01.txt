The building of an Islamic community center two blocks from Ground Zero has clearly struck a nerve for the American people. Vociferous debate has erupted across the country over whether the development of the center, which is to contain a prayer room as well as a theatre, space for educational programs, a swimming pool, restaurant, and a 9/11 memorial, should be allowed to move forward. Not only do the planners of the community center have a legal right to build on the Park 51 site, but allowing them to construct the center undisturbed upholds the multicultural values that America represents.
The First Amendment promises freedom of religion, and since the creation of a Christian, Jewish, Hindu or other faith-based community center would undoubtedly face little opposition in Lower Manhattan, an Islamic one should be treated no differently. Constitutional rights apply equally to all Americans;  Muslims should be permitted to pray and gather in the same neighborhoods where members of other religions can do the same.
Additionally, the building of the Islamic community center embodies the spirit of diversity and tolerance for which America is proud to stand. Muslims have lived in this country for hundreds of years and have made significant contributions to its growth and prosperity. Many Muslims died in the 9/11 attacks and Muslim-Americans have suffered through the aftermath of those terrible events along with their fellow citizens. Therefore, the millions of Muslim-Americans deserve to be trusted to practice their religions safely. In fact, continuing the uproar over the Park 51 sight would further alienate Muslims in this country who have thus far acted in an upstanding manner. They may feel as if their conscientious actions have been willfully ignored and overshadowed by knee-jerk prejudice.
More generally, anti-Muslim rhetoric that makes an explicit tie between the Islamic religion and terrorists is unjustified and dangerous. The values and ideals of the terrorists who attacked New York City on September 11, 2001 are very different from the beliefs of the majority of Muslims. It is important to remember that the 9/11 attackers represent only a small, fundamentalist portion of Islam, and that the religion as a whole should not be interpreted only at its extremes. We appreciate Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s unequivocal support for the project.
Some outside observers fear that the funding of the community center is suspect and may come from sources who support those wishing to harm Americans. We understand that the devastating terrorist attack on New York City left many with emotional and practical reasons for concern. However, there is not enough information regarding the funding to claim that those building the mosque have ties to dangerous organizations. Development is, in fact, in its initial stages. Sharif el-Gamal, the developer, has not secured financing or started fund-raising for the site. The country should assume that any fundraisers eventually recruited are innocent until proven guilty. Still, as a step of goodwill, we encourage the Islamic leaders of this project to be forthcoming with their funding sources. Given the heated debate over their project, such openness would be a good olive branch to extend to the building’s opponents.
Given that the community center is now a nationwide symbol for American attitudes toward religion, it was correct that President Barack H. Obama commented on its construction. The tensions unearthed by the project have been echoed in similar situations across the country. Last week, there was a fire at the construction site of a mosque in Murfreesboro,  Tennessee, which news sources report was very likely a case of arson. A church in Florida is preparing to hold “Burn a Quoran Day” on the 9th anniversary of 9/11. As opposition to mosques and Muslim causes arises across the country, it is important to not let September 11th engender fear of Islam in general. The events of that day shaped but do not define America, and our 300-year commitment to multiculturalism should trump the actions of a few angry men.

France is a nation of contrasts, as I observed firsthand while studying abroad in Paris last semester. Last May, I rode the train à grand vitesse, France’s famed high-speed train, from Bordeaux to Paris. The TGV is a technological marvel, capable of speeding through the French countryside at over 170 mph.
But on this particular day, my train ground to a halt for hours somewhere outside Poitiers. Thousands of nurses, striking for higher wages, had overrun the tracks at Paris’s Montparnasse station, blocking all train traffic. Ironically, the train of the future had been stopped in its tracks by an old-fashioned labor protest.
My experience on the TGV illustrates the cognitive dissonance between France’s modern technological achievements and its antiquated labor laws. This dichotomy exists throughout Europe, but the conflict between past and future is starkest and most contentious in France.
In many respects France is well-prepared for the 21st century. The country’s public transportation is first-class; the Paris Metro is quick, reliable, and in a constant state of expansion. The TGV can transport you from Paris to Marseille in about three hours (when the tracks are not occupied by angry protesters). France is also a world leader in green energy production; seventy-five percent of its electricity comes from nuclear power.
But French workers’ militant, ’60s-style mindset undermines these advancements. France has long been notorious for frequent, interminable strikes. Most notably, a general strike in 1968 shut down the country for two weeks and nearly brought down the government of then-President Charles de Gaulle. Although labor disruptions have since become much rarer in most Western countries, they remain common in France. In the course of my five months in Paris, the nurses, the subway workers, the air traffic controllers, and even the high-school students went en grève.
Constant striking has helped French workers obtain lavish benefits and strong job protections. The retirement age is 60; much of this year’s labor action protested the government’s proposal to increase it to 62. Americans draw maximum Social Security benefits at 67. In France, most employees work 35-hour weeks, though a 2008 reform allowed businesses to extend the workweek on a case-by-case basis. Firing workers is notoriously difficult, as employers must prove in court either that an employee’s performance is poor or that they must eliminate the position to remain competitive. Together, these laws and customs have resulted in high structural unemployment and anemic economic growth.
Strikes inconvenience the public and make France a less appealing place to visit and do business in. More significantly, they foster an anti-free market environment that stifles political efforts to improve France’s economic competitiveness. If France’s economy continues to stagnate, its government will eventually be unable to maintain its admirable commitments to public health, education, and other social programs.
Ambitious, far-reaching labor-market reform is needed to improve France’s economy. The retirement age should be raised, the workweek should be extended, and tax incentives should be given to encourage employees to work more hours and years. French employers should be allowed to dismiss their workers without endless legal battles, since businesses that fear being stuck with incompetent employees will be reluctant to hire liberally. Most importantly, unions must be persuaded that labor-market liberalization is in their members’ long-term interests.
In an increasingly globalized world, technological prowess must be matched with a vibrant labor market in order for France to remain a world leader in commerce, culture, and technological advancement. Without a national consensus that the French worker must become more competitive, the nation of Delacroix and Debussy risks idling on the tracks forever, as other countries that are willing to make hard but ultimately beneficial choices bid it au revoir.

Accusations of fraud are not new to the vast, multi-billion-dollar college industry. In 1991, the Justice Department accused the Ivy League of price-fixing, a charge that it neither denied nor admitted: In a settlement, the eight colleges simply agreed to stop sharing information on student financial aid. The issues of why tuition rate hikes occurred in virtual lock-step across the Ivy League or why financial aid officers were producing nearly identical financial aid packages were not addressed. While some institutions have since taken demonstrable steps to improve affordability for the country’s smartest but poorest students, the status quo for paying for college nationwide is a labyrinthine culture of secrecy. Endless paperwork requirements, convoluted financial application procedures, and complex loan packages not only complicate students’ lives but are also significant barriers to entry.
This secrecy, coupled with consistent and significant increases in tuition bills, may hinder growing numbers of poor Americans from ever reaching the gates of higher education. It is not trivial that the Higher Education Act of 1965, which established the first federal college aid policies, piggybacked off the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In some sense, college finance is not just a financial issue; given the tremendous stakes for college applicants with poor backgrounds, it is also a civil rights issue.
According to the College Board, more than two out of every three undergrads graduated in 2008 with some debt, with an average cumulative debt of over $27,000. To put that figure in perspective, the average annual cost for a public university is $17,452 as an out-of-state applicant and $25,143 for a private college. In contrast to grants and scholarships, loans are demanding and inflexible. They must be repaid with interest and on a predetermined schedule, are often administered not by universities but by third-party vendors, and have important implications for an individual’s financial health long after receiving a diploma. For several decades, the student lending industry was an almost exact replica of the subprime mortgage market, a “Wild West” of lending, in which predatory lenders, exorbitant interest rates, and collusion between colleges and companies abounded.
The overhaul of the student loan industry signed into law Mar. 31 by President Obama, in which banks were removed as middlemen in loans, was long overdue. While this was a positive step toward greater transparency, the core issue of college affordability remains unaddressed. Some critics have pointed out that the legislation itself inadequately addresses the issue of solely private lenders, who may capitalize on the government’s failure to cover all demonstrated need. Moreover, the Obama administration has not yet seriously challenged private colleges on tuition pricing structures. It makes little sense that college tuition is countercyclical, increasing most quickly during recessions and at faster rates than inflation.
As for the paperwork and toil requisite in applying for both federal and college-provided financial aid, the Department of Education has only now revised the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The New York Times estimates that 1.5 million applicants don’t even bother to fill out the form due its intricacies. Yet FAFSA is just one piece of the puzzle. Another common form, the College Scholarship Service Profile, is administered by the College Board, and individual colleges often have their own proprietary datasheets. Standardizing, simplifying, and overhauling the unnecessarily complex web of forms would do much to ensuring that applying for financial aid is not only accurate but also fair.
It is easy to lose sight of college’s original purpose in the debate over college finances. We must not forget that colleges have a privileged status as nonprofit organizations. In exchange for exemptions on taxes, which can run into the billions of dollars, they are obligated to ensure the accessibility and quality of education for students. Instead of acting as profit-driven corporations, universities should and must return to these roots. Instead of citing colleges’ “sovereignty” as a pretense for inaction, the federal government should investigate the civil rights implications of exorbitant tuition and logistical hurdles to financial aid. Let us complete the work of the civil rights activists that preceded us and open the gates to higher education to all Americans.

The modern UFO phenomenon began in the 1940s.  Yet despite decades of evidence, and the fact that opinion polls (such as Gallup) have consistently shown that the majority of people believe that flying saucers are real, this phenomenon has yet to be seriously and systematically investigated by the academic and scientific mainstream. Why? In large part, it has to do with the hypothesis that unexplained UFO sightings represent encounters with artificial, intelligently-controlled craft of non-terrestrial origin. Extraordinary evidence, such as an alien body or an intact craft, has yet to be made publicly available; many claim that such evidence is indispensable to justify any serious investigation at all into this issue, as claims that Earth has been visited by a non-terrestrial intelligence are inherently extraordinary. But while perhaps intuitively correct, this notion crumbles in the face of logical reasoning and facts.
Naturally, this begs the question, “If the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth is not an inherently extraordinary claim, then what is?” An example soon comes to mind. Bigfoot sightings typically occur in the northwestern United States of America. Whether or not Bigfoot exists (and let me be “clear” that I do not intend to argue for or against the existence of Bigfoot in this op-ed), what matters here is that in the case of Bigfoot, there does in fact exist a clear frame of reference justifying a standard of proof far higher than would normally be required for a phenomenon new to science. The region as a whole is highly populated, includes major urban areas, and enjoys a modern, fully-developed infrastructure of roads, airports, hiking trails, etc that allow people more or less free access to even the remotest parts of the region. Large numbers of scientists and experienced outdoorsmen have operated throughout the region for more than a century, and in that time have achieved intimate familiarity with the area’s fauna, large and small. As such, one has at least some reasonable basis to claim that, if Bigfoot exists, its existence would probably have been confirmed by now. The notion of Bigfoot as an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence stems from a frame of reference firmly based in sound logic and relevant facts.
However, no comparable frame of reference exists for UFOs. Far from having an intimate, century-long understanding of other solar systems (even in our own part of the galaxy), we in fact know virtually nothing about them. According to the “Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia” maintained by Jean Schneider of the CNRS-LUTH Paris Observatory, as of the writing of this essay only 460 extrasolar planets have been discovered—most of them gas giants like Jupiter, and none of them similar to our own. We do not even know where the Earth-like planets are or how many of them there are, let alone how many of them have intelligent life—or even life at all. Figuring out how many planets contain intelligent beings of sufficient technological sophistication to perform interstellar travel is barely (if at all) even on the radar screen yet. As such, the prevailing assumption—that interstellar travel is extremely rare or even non-existent (in our corner of the galaxy at least) —is made with no basis whatsoever in observable fact. As such, the notion that reports of objects appearing to be intelligently controlled craft of non-terrestrial origin must be subjected to extremely high standards of evidence similarly lacks basis in fact. Despite the extraordinary things our astronomers have accomplished in recent decades, even the nearer reaches of deep space remain a near-total mystery. We’ve yet to even detect other Earth-like planets, let alone acquire the degree of detailed knowledge about such planets that would justify current demands that abnormally high standards of evidence be met before science entertains the possibility of extraterrestrials visiting Earth
Given our current frame of reference, there is simply no logical reason to hold reports appearing to be of non-terrestrial craft to any higher standards of evidence than is customary for other previously unknown phenomena encountered by science. Granted, the possibility of interstellar travel is difficult for many to comprehend. But cell phones, the Internet—even such now-antiquated technologies as radio and the film projector—would have perplexed even the most advanced scholars of the ancient or medieval world. And yet, we think of all those things as commonplace today. Given human history, it does not take a great deal of imagination to hypothesize the existence elsewhere of technology far beyond our current understanding.
If we are to hold those UFO reports apparently caused by sightings of unknown craft of probable non-terrestrial origin to the abnormally high standards of evidence currently deemed acceptable, we must do so based on a solid, logical frame of reference derived from facts, and not from vague, poorly thought-out, and emotionally-derived notions that aliens and interstellar travel are somehow “wacky” or “out-there.”  Even the most rudimentary survey of human history compels any thinking person to accept the potential for technology based on principles that we do not at the moment comprehend, and be open-minded about the possibility that maybe, just maybe others have solved advanced technological riddles before we have. Otherwise, we shall be no wiser than the Aztecs, who thought the Spaniards were gods due simply to their technological head start on things like ship design and metallic weaponry, or those (at the time) eminent scholars at the turn of the last century, who loudly proclaimed from the heights of academic authority that powered flight simply could not be done.

In keeping with its efforts to improve student online resources, the Undergraduate Council launched a new website last week that will serve as a unified portal for the UC’s web initiatives.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said the UC’s new website will consolidate its web presence, which was previously spread over the old UC website, the UC Juicy Blog, Twitter, and Facebook. The site will also provide easy access to other sites relevant to Harvard life—including Harvard’s online marketplace Crimson List and the new Harvard Courses application organized by Computer Science 50 lecturer David J. Malan ’99.
Hysen and UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 have made improving the UC’s online presence one of the hallmarks of their administration, and Hysen said he sees the new website as the next step in improving students’ access to online resources.
According to site programmer Punit N. Shah ’12, who is also a Crimson blog editor, the site’s new organization will make it easier for students to find the information they need. UC sites are listed at the top of every page, and information on UC procedures, party planning, and issues such as January Term and Social Life has been consolidated.
“The old website was just all the unchanging information about rules and committees,” said UC Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11. “Now it has all the changing news too—the initiatives the UC is running, news on progress the UC has made. It’s really now all in one place.”
The new site received about 800 unique visitors over the last four days, Hysen said. The UC was unable to provide web traffic data for its old site.
Hysen said he hopes the new centralized site will help the UC encourage more non-UC members to create websites such as Harvard Courses and Harvard FML.
“We really want to change the culture at Harvard so that we can support cool things like that,” he said.
He also said that the revamped website will be updated more frequently, as the updated software is easier for UC reps to use.
“Any UC rep is going to be able to update the site this year, whereas last year only three knew how,” Hysen added. “It’ll be updated pretty much every day.”

A resident tutor in Currier House will serve as acting resident dean this academic year while Harvard College searches for a permanent replacement.
Allison D. Diop-Frimpong will fill a vacancy left by Katherine Stanton, who announced in August that she will become assistant dean in the Office of Undergraduate Education on October 1, when she returns from her maternity leave.
Diop-Frimpong began serving as a tutor in Currier in 2008 and graduated from Boston College Law School in 2009. She was named the Allston Burr resident dean this past summer, according to interim Currier House Master James L. Cavallaro ’84.
The College will begin its hunt for a permanent resident dean in mid- to late fall, and the search is expected to end this spring, according to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
A select group of House Masters, Currier students, and staff will interview candidates and provide feedback. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds will make the final appointment, Nelson said.
“The goal is to consider a diverse pool of candidates and to eventually hire someone who has the skills and experience to do the job well,” Nelson wrote in an e-mail.
As Allston Burr resident dean, Diop-Frimpong supervises the House’s tutors, aids students in academic matters, and typically acts as a representative of Currier undergraduates to the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.
Diop-Frimpong, who declined requests for comment, wrote in her biography on the Currier website that she received her bachelor’s in Latin American studies at Vanderbilt University, in addition to law and master’s degrees in social work at Boston College.
“I’m proud to call Currier my home, mostly because of the people,” she wrote. “While the perks are nice, the food wouldn’t be as delicious, the housing as comfortable, or the study breaks as stress-busting without the people who work and live here.”

Five years had passed since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, but a group of students from universities across the nation had only four weeks to document the remnants of the devastation and rebuilding efforts in the city.
Adrienne C. Collatos ’10 and Candice R. Porter ’13 were part of a team of eight students commissioned by Students of the World, a non-profit organization that annually selects university-level students to create multimedia projects highlighting global issues and the work undertaken to address them.
This year’s team produced a multimedia project that focused on the collaboration between two areas in New Orleans—the Lower Ninth Ward and the Broadmoor neighborhoods—with organizations created to aid the rebuilding of those neighborhoods.
Though they had corresponded via e-mail in the spring, the students had not met each other until late May. After three days of pre-production in Austin, Texas, the team began their four weeks of work in New Orleans.
Armed with notepads, cameras, and tripods in the middle of the redeveloping city, the students had a weighty task on their hands. Collatos, the producer of the project, said she realized that the team’s work required true immersion in the culture and community of New Orleans.
“The biggest challenge was developing trust with the people you’re interviewing,” said Andrew M. Eisbrouch, a student at the University of Michigan who served as the media coordinator for the team.
Many outsiders had already strolled through the city, capitalizing on its hardships—every now and then, the team would see tour buses cruise through, Eisbrouch said. To gain the residents’ trust, the students spent the first week meeting people without cameras.
“You don’t want to injure them again,” said Porter, the journalist of the team, adding that she wanted to create a story that was “true and sincere.”
“You don’t want to portray them in a wrong way and tell the story wrong,” Porter added.
Through face-to-face interactions with city residents, who sometimes even invited the team into their homes, the students said they found a community driven by hope and in the midst of great change.
“Just being there with the joy and optimism that’s there—you don’t see it in other places,” Porter said. “You walk down the sidewalk and say hello to the neighbors. I’m from New York, and you don’t see that, so I miss that inclusiveness.”
The students plan to hold screenings of their film and photo shows to increase support for Students of the World on campus.
The project's daily blogs can be found at sowbroadmoor.wordpress.com and sowmakeitright.wordpress.com.

Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser canceled his two courses at the Harvard Extension School due to the “controversy surrounding the investigation” into his alleged scientific misconduct, according to a letter sent Monday night to students enrolled in his fall course.
The night before Hauser’s fall class was scheduled to begin, Mary Higgins, associate dean for academic administration at the Division of Continuing Education, wrote to students that Psychology E-1153: “Cognitive Evolution” would be canceled “at the request of the instructor, Professor Marc Hauser.”
Hauser, who is on leave from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences after Harvard found him responsible for eight instances of scientific misconduct, will also not teach his spring course Psychology E-1006: “The Moral Sense: From Genes to Law.”
“Because of the controversy surrounding the investigation, I have decided that the best thing for the students is that I not teach at the Extension School until things conclude with the case,” Hauser wrote in a statement included in Higgins’ letter. “Given my great desire to teach, I look forward to sharing my knowledge of these disciplines in the future.”
In an e-mail to The Crimson Monday night, Hauser wrote that he was “deeply disappointed” about the cancellations and would return to teaching in the fall of 2011 at the College and the Extension School.
FAS spokesman Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement that the decision to cancel the courses was made on Monday.
The cancellation of these courses follows a statement Hauser made last week that he was “keen to extend [his] reach of teaching experiences” by teaching Extension School students while on leave.
As recently as Friday, Extension School spokeswoman Linda A. Cross wrote in an e-mail that it was “not uncommon” for professors on leave to teach at the school. Meanwhile, Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension Michael Shinagel called Hauser’s course well-liked by students.
“Professor Hauser is a talented teacher, the recipient of several Harvard awards for distinction in teaching,” Shinagel wrote in an e-mail on Friday, before the courses’ cancellation. “Professor Hauser has expressed his regret and has assured us that he very much looks forward to teaching his course this semester.”
Academics in the field were reserved in their reactions to the cancellation of Hauser’s classes.
Leslie M. Kay, a University of Chicago associate professor of psychology, said Hauser’s decision not to teach the courses may have been influenced by factors unrelated to the investigation.
“I think in any situation a professor can cancel a continuing education course simply because they don’t have the time or energy to teach it,” Kay said. “And personally, I wouldn’t hold that against anybody.”
Christopher L. Coe, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he was “hesitant to condemn [Hauser] from so far away,” but the importance of trust in the field remained paramount.
“Oftentimes, something like this can ruin a person’s career and is irreparable, and one can’t land back on one’s feet,” Coe said. “Some scientists leave academics and find another way to be a writer or thinker—but not in the sacred world of academics.”
“It’s very tempting to manipulate data, to lose objectivity and impartiality, which is at the core of scientific empiricism,” he added.
Hauser took leave from FAS after a three-year investigation into accusations of scientific misconduct. In a letter to the Faculty earlier last month, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote that Hauser was found “solely responsible” for eight instances of misconduct involving the collection, analysis, and storage of data and the reporting of research methods and results.
Without naming specific measures taken against Hauser, Smith said that he did “impose appropriate sanctions,” which he said could include forced leave, increased oversight of laboratory practices, and limitation of research.

After two years during which no transfer students were admitted, 12 new students have arrived at Harvard as the latest additions to the classes of 2012 and 2013.
Out of 614 transfer applicants, 13 were accepted and 12 decided to attend, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
These students moved in last Thursday and have participated in an orientation program tailored to transfer students over the past week. Special activities included a group dinner and presentations about various aspects of life at Harvard, ranging from General Education to House life to information technology assistance.
The students—four sophomores and eight juniors, according to transfer student Sarah L. A. Erwin ’13—come from a variety of universities around the world, including small private schools like 26-student Deep Springs College, research universities like Brown and Georgetown, and international schools such as McGill in Canada and Pontificia Universidad Catolica in Chile.
The 12 students have been placed among Harvard’s Houses, with one in each of 10 Houses and two in Adams House.
David H. A. LeBoeuf ’12, who transferred to Harvard from Clark University in Worcester, Mass., said he is impressed by the facilities and programs at Harvard.
“I came from a very small school so to me this is a complete shock. We had one dining hall, one library. We didn’t have anything near the support you get from the housing system. I feel like I’m on vacation right now,” he said, noting that he enjoyed attending a barbecue and stein club in his new House.
Erwin, who said she transferred from Johns Hopkins University in hopes of finding a safer environment and more extracurricular activities, said she has enjoyed spending time with fellow transfer students. “We’re a pretty close-knit group already,” she said. “I couldn’t imagine a better group of people.”
Laura E. Schlosberg, who directs the transfer orientation program, praised the return of transfer students to Harvard.
“As new Harvard students with previous collegiate experience, they add unique perspectives to our community,” she said.
LeBoeuf said that the two-year hiatus in transfer admissions has made transfer students an “exotic” breed on campus. He said he has been surprised that so many Harvard students are unaware of the existence of new transfer students this year.
“If you see somebody looking really lost, just come over and try to help them,” Erwin advised.

Expanding out of a windowless, 80-square-foot office in the basement of Memorial Church, the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard will open its own community center this week, according to the organization’s officials.
““We’ve completely outgrown that space,” said Harvard’s Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein.
The organization will host its first meeting in the new space at 19 Arrow St. later this week, said Epstein, author of New York Times Bestseller “Good Without God.”
The center’s opening marks the first time a chaplaincy in the United States has established a Humanist community center, Epstein said.
“A lot of people wanted a space to get away from all the Harvard hustle and bustle, to talk about big ideas and have a place to call their own,” said Assistant Humanist Chaplain John Figdor. He said the chaplaincy’s presence up until this point has been dispersed across campus, and events have been hosted at locations spanning the graduate and undergraduate campuses. The center, he said, will help consolidate activities.
Epstein said the new center was made possible in part through donations from Harvard alumni, but the majority of funding was provided by an anonymous donor not affiliated with Harvard who had read his book.
The community center—which currently has no official name—will host regular, scheduled community meetings on Thursday nights for graduates and on Friday nights for undergraduates. The meetings will allow for discussion and participation in service, art, music, poetry, and science, Epstein said. Aside from scheduled events, Epstein said he hopes the center will be a place for students to “just hang out” and come together.
“This is a great way to promote a community of nonbelievers; it’s something that could really break new ground here,” said Andrew G. Maher ’11, vice president of the Harvard Secular Society, the undergraduate branch affiliated with the University’s larger Humanist chaplaincy.
Epstein said the new community center—located directly across the street from the Harvard Catholic Student Center and only a few blocks from Harvard Hillel—will establish “a triangle of chaplaincies” and will create “a new focal point for religious life on campus... or nonreligious life, as the case may be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are most concerned with University budget cuts and January Term programming, according to the results of a survey conducted last May by the Undergraduate Council released last week.
The survey questions focused on student opinions of the UC, its recent initiatives, and campus issues such as budget cuts and hot breakfast. The survey, which was emailed to all 6,650 undergraduates, had 607 respondents—less than 10 percent.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said the council will use these results to determine how it approaches the administration this fall. For example, Hysen said the UC will place special emphasis on January Term planning, which 163 respondents indicated was one of the most important issues the UC tackles.
The survey also included questions about general student opinion of the UC, which UC Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11 said will be useful in determining the UC’s plans this semester.
“We had more students thinking that we’re doing a good job than not,” Hysen said of the results. “That sort of reflects that last semester we did a lot of work that people actually saw.”
Hysen cited last April’s T-shirt giveaway at the men’s lacrosse game tailgate—an event that 61 percent of survey respondents deemed “effective”—as an example of the visible efforts the UC has made over the past semester.
Most of the survey results indicated that students are unfamiliar with many UC initiatives. Almost half of respondents said they “haven’t heard of” last spring’s Student Initiated Programming Pilot, which provided funding for house events in Quincy and Pforzheimer last April. Hysen said the UC plans to make better communication with students a priority this semester.
“I’m positive that pretty much every one of them has gone to a UC-funded event,” Hysen said. “One thing we’re going to do is to talk about things that people maybe have an idea of but don’t know the names or attach them to the UC.”
In addition to a survey on social life that the UC hopes to organize this October, the UC plans to use these results as a “baseline” for future annual surveys, according to Hysen.
“A lot of times UC reps, or anyone who’s talking about the UC, talk about it in terms of student opinions,” Fabrizio. “But there was really no way to know what students know about the UC. That was the idea behind the survey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the revelation that a Harvard investigation has found psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct, the question remains exactly what repercussions he will face. Hauser has announced that he will take a leave during the coming year, but further sanctions may be in the cards for the celebrated professor. In a letter to the faculty, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said that the University is cooperating with the Public Health Service Office of Research Integrity, the National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts. These agencies will neither confirm nor deny whether they are investigating Hauser, but below are a range of punitive measures available to these agencies.
Public Health Service Office of Research Integrity
WHAT IT IS: ORI is a government organization that monitors institutional investigations of research labs.
CONSEQUENCES: According to John Dahlberg, the director of the division of investigative oversight, in a case like Hauser’s ORI can choose to either disbar the professor or subject him to increased supervision by colleagues at the University.
Disbarment entails being unable to receive or work on projects with federal funding, a move that would serverely curtail Hauser’s ability to carry out his research. ORI can choose to disbar an individual from around 3 years to the course of an individual’s career.
HISTORICALLY: Most disbarments are 3 years in length. ORI disbars from 20 to 30 individuals per year.
 
National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General
WHAT IT IS: The NSF OIG provides independent oversight of the agency’s programs and operations.
CONSEQUENCES: According to Edward T. Waters, a Washington D.C. attorney with the firm Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell, the NSF Inspector General can investigate a case with the ability to refer his findings to the NSF and other branches of the federal government, including the Justice Department. That means the IG has a wide range of punitive options available to him if he finds criminal or civil wrong-doing.
HISTORICALLY: According to Waters, the government rarely deals with cases of scientific misconduct. A search of a Department of Health and Human Services database turned up only two cases of scientific misconduct in the past 10 years.
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts
WHAT IT IS: This federal agency functions as the principal litigator for the U.S. in the District of Massachusetts.
CONSEQUENCES: If the U.S. Attorney’s office for MA chooses to investigate the case they will present their findings to a grand jury, which will decide whether to indict Hauser.
HISTORICALLY: The MA U.S. attorney has had little interaction with the University over the past 10 years, with the notable exception of the $120 million suit brought against the University regarding economics Professor Andrei Shleifer’s actions while an advisor to the Russian government in the early 1990s.
The attorney’s office has also prosecuted two former researchers at the Medical School who were accused of stealing trade secrets from the University. The materials were returned, and the case was settled out of court.

Pulitzer Prize-winning nonfiction writer J. Tracy Kidder ’67 was named the first A.M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at The Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School for the fall semester.
Kidder—the author of “The Soul of a New Machine,” which won the National Book Award in 1982—will lead student workshops, participate in Shorenstein Center events, and continue working on a new book, “Good Prose,” as writer-in-residence.
The new position, created in honor of Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times executive editor Abraham Michael “A.M.” Rosenthal, aims to provide writers with the opportunity to conduct research on a specific project and interact with a community of students and scholars, according to Shorenstein Center director Alex S. Jones.
Jones met with Rosenthal’s widow, Shirley Lord Rosenthal, in 2006 to create a position that would commemorate Rosenthal’s contributions to journalism and support nonfiction writers who write narratives. Rosenthal, who died in 2006, oversaw the New York Times’ coverage of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers, and the Watergate scandal.
“I never belonged exclusively to fiction. I write in narrative, but the important difference is that I don’t make stuff up,” Kidder said. “For example, one’s understanding of the Great Depression would be incomplete without ‘Grapes of Wrath,’ but it would also be incomplete without seeing the individuals caught in particular situations. We are hard-wired to see stories.”
Jones said he hopes the program will make accessible to Harvard students journalistic writing that is “not only powerful and beautifully written, but proves important in shaping opinion and advancing the opinion of humanity.”
“Kidder is at the top of the mountain,” said Jones, with no pun intended. Kidder’s acclaimed novel, “Mountains Beyond Mountains,” chronicled the experiences of Harvard Medical School Professor Paul Farmer.
Kidder said he started his undergraduate years at Harvard in the government department and aspired to become a diplomat, but switched to English to pursue a career in writing.
“It will be nice to be back in Cambridge again. I love the place, my daughter is in Boston, and many of my friends live there,” Kidder said. “I look forward to meeting fascinating people and hearing their thoughts on nonfiction. I have lots to learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those of you that haven't been keeping up with the latest trends in NCAA rules, allow The Back Page to fill you in. This year, the NCAA has mandated that college athletes either be tested for Sickle Cell trait or sign a waiver declining testing.
As the NCAA kindly explains, Sickle Cell trait is "the inheritance of one gene for sickle hemoglobin and one for normal hemoglobin." It's particularly hazardous to athletes, because, while symptoms may not arise in day-to-day activity, intense exercise can lead to blocked blood flow, which can cause collapsing and death. Not surprisingly, the NCAA tries to avoid these occurrences whenever possible.
Though this year is the first that the NCAA has included the Sickle Cell test in its rulebook, the dangerous trait has been a known quantity for quite some time. The condition affects one in 12 African Americans, and in the past decade it has brought about the deaths of 21 college football players. In fact, the new NCAA recommendations emerged largely in response to a lawsuit initiated by the family of one of the deceased athletes, Dale Lloyd II of Rice University.
Despite the track record that Sickle Cell trait has acquired and the highly-contentious lawsuit that pushed testing into the spotlight, the condition continues to fly under the radar. Searches on University Health Services’ website for "Sickle Cell Trait" or simply “Sickle Cell” yield no results.
But despite the lack of publicity, testing is available at UHS for Harvard students that want it. So, if you're at all concerned that you might have the trait, especially if you plan on exercising at some point in your life (this should be everyone), it certainly makes sense to stop in at UHS and ask for a test. As too many have found out the hard way, your life could depend on it.

Welcome to shopping period, one of the most hectic and yet defining times of the year (good classes=happy semester)! if you aren't running around in between classes already with a criss-crossing schedule and no time for lunch, here are a few more things you should keep in mind before you take that leap of faith and put your favorite class on your study card.
Supervised Reading and/or Research. These independent research courses (with course numbers that typically begin with a "9" and end with an "r") require an application or a petition in order to enroll. Depending on the department, students may need to prepare a proposal or fill out an application for approval. Course applications can be found on the individual department's website.
Creative Writing. This set of courses from the English department requires an application with attached writing samples. Applicants should submit three to five pages of poetry, prose, or dialogue, depending on what is relevant to the course. The application, which can be found on the Creative Writing page of the English department website, is due to the Barker Center today at 4 p.m. So hurry up!
Dramatic Arts. Some of these courses, include the fall choreography and acting courses, require an interview or an audition for enrollment. No formal application, but be prepared to improvise.
Music. A few music courses, such as Classical Improvisation and Performance and Analysis, require auditions prior to the first day of class. Missed the deadline? You can still take Orchestral Conducting as auditions will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 7.
Happy shopping!

Even if you're planning to be a rebel by skipping  the Activities Fair today (held in the Quad from 4 to 7  p.m.), Harvard has almost essentially mandated that you attend. All dining halls, with  the exception of Dunster, will be closed for dinner tonight, so many  students might find themselves eating at the Quad. The upside? The Activities Fair dinner features a  fancily named “Taste of Boston” menu. We're not exactly sure what that entails, but guess the entire campus will find out soon.

In 2002, The Crimson broke a story that uncovered one of the darkest chapters in Harvard’s history—the “secret court” that actively persecuted homosexual undergraduates in the 1920s.
Almost 90 years later, this story has been transformed into a play that debuted Aug. 20 at the New York International Fringe Festival, taking its overall excellence award for best ensemble. “Veritas,” written by Stan Richardson, dramatizes the 1920s episode at Harvard with a slew of stunning cast.
In an interview with FlyBy, Richardson said that he first got the idea to write “Veritas” from a friend, who had read an article on the subject in Out Magazine in 2003. He then spent weeks poring over 500 pages of cryptic documents involving the incident that eventually turned into an award-winning play originally completed in 2007.
Although the play draws upon the event in which the secret court prosecuted the homosexual Harvard men, Richardson said he made a conscious decision not to depict the court itself in order to avoid drawing any basic, easy conclusions. He added that he was more interested in “imagining the moments of fracture.”
Richardson explained further: “One thing that got me hooked was a letter Keith Smerage ’21 wrote to his mother before the court convened. He was so eloquent in his hopes for himself, what he thought Harvard could do for him and what he could do for the world. He just couldn’t pull it together after this and committed suicide ten years later.”
“People like to see plays and be morally tucked into bed at night,” Richardson said. “But that’s useless to people. My play is a warning, trying to break through the idea that just because it happened in the past, it’s nothing [that] couldn’t happen again.”
