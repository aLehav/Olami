Kevin B. Holden ’05 still recalls the moment he first read T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land.” For many students of literature, the poem stands as a towering testament to the modernist tradition. But for Holden, the attachment went deeper than intellectual appreciation — there was something that drew him viscerally to the uncommon energy of the text, even as an adolescent.
“I was sitting in a chair by the window, and it was snowing,” he says. “It felt very, very powerful. It made sense to me somehow, linguistically, the way that it worked.”
He shifts in his chair on the top floor of the library of Kirkland House, where he is a tutor. Fittingly, the cramped room is surrounded by books. “It’s sort of magical,” he says of Eliot’s verse. “There’s something strange and elegant, and the subjectivity is fractured in different ways.”
All these years later, fractured subjectivity remains a staple in Holden’s literary taste. His favorite novelist is Virginia Woolf. He admires modernism — Joyce, Faulkner, and Beckett, to name a few. One of the reasons, as he came to realize as he delved further into his literary studies at the College and beyond, was because those novels exhibited the kind of experimentation and inventiveness closest to the way language works in poetry.
“The kind of fragmentation, the experimentation with grammar, the lyricism — it’s highly musical. Image-driven,” he says. “It’s about constant consciousness, not as much about narrative. To this day, that just remains the case.”
Holden is now a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, a program that provides three-year fellowships to scholars of exceptional promise at the beginning of their careers. After studying Literature at the College, Holden went on to earn graduate degrees from Yale University, Cambridge University, and the University of Iowa. He is the author of seven poetry books and chapbooks, the latest of which is “Pink Noise.”
Reading many genres of books, including novels, comes inevitably with the terrain of Holden’s line of work. His heart, though, has always been with poetry.
“I just feel so much more drawn to the way that language itself works in poetry,” he says. “It works in different kinds of poetry differently, for sure. But the kind of particularity of language, the kind of tactility or texture of language. Certainly the musicality, the sound, and, just frankly, the way that it makes meaning.”
If there is one word that could capture the ambition of Holden’s poetry, it would be tactility. Holden is not interested in assembling the aesthetically pleasing arrangements that are currently in vogue. At once remarkably practical and abstract in his poems, he evokes organic materials from the natural world to make sense of the ways we live and bring new language to experiences of desire and change.
At once venerated and misunderstood, poetry is commonly critiqued as a genre that is out of touch, ensconced in an opacity that makes access difficult. Holden is no stranger to this strain of skepticism. Rather than turn away from it, he advocates for a reframing of the language used to describe poems that challenge us.
Holden is not a fan, for instance, of the term “difficult poetry.” Rather, he opts for “complexity.” After all, it is precisely the sort of inventive complexity that can result in the most faithful reflections of reality.
“When people say something’s very difficult, it often suggests that they’re basically taking interpretive models that are applicable to other forms of discourse or language — like understanding an article — and then applying those same kinds of metrics of thinking into objects that, by definition, elude those modes of thinking,” he says. “It’s kind of a category error. What happens is that you’re looking for a kind of parsable meaning where there might not be.”
The poems of “Pink Noise” reflect this commitment to complexity as a vehicle to grasp realism. The poems also demonstrate a keen interest in the philosophical dimensions of empirical disciplines like math and science.
This interdisciplinarity has followed Holden since his undergraduate years. (In fact, he briefly considered concentrating in Physics at Harvard.) As someone who appreciates the expressive forms present in both the humanities and the sciences, he finds the conventional wall between them artificial.
“Things in math and things in poetry and things in painting are all grasping dimensions of reality, right?” he says. “They do not need to be separated.”
“The intersection of those things seems accurate to something in the nature of reality,” Holden adds. “That’s what poetry for me is, which is maybe a little bit rare. It’s somehow trying to map or open up something in reality.”

Harvard Corporation senior fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 said “several very good candidates” have been identified in the search for the University’s next chief financial officer.
Pritzker, who helms the University’s highest governing board, said in a phone interview Monday that the search process for the next CFO is “mature” and “going well.”
Harvard launched its search for a new chief financial officer six months ago after Vice President for Finance and CFO Thomas J. Hollister announced he would retire at the end of the 2022-23 academic year. Hollister has served in the role since joining Harvard in 2015.
As the University’s top financial officer, Hollister steered Harvard through the financial challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In a prescient move, Hollister led efforts to prepare for an economic recession, releasing a University-wide “recession playbook” in October 2019, just three months before the first Covid-19 case was detected in the United States.
Harvard’s next CFO will also be tasked with guiding the school through economic uncertainty as the U.S. economy continues to grapple with heightened inflation and the possibility of a recession.
The new CFO will likely have to work closely with Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay in leading a new University-wide capital campaign, an initiative expected to be announced just a few years into her presidency. Hollister arrived at Harvard amid its previous capital campaign, which ultimately netted a historic $9.6 billion.
Pritzker, however, said it is “unclear” if a new CFO will be appointed before Gay assumes her new post in Massachusetts Hall on July 1.
“They have a group of good candidates,” Pritzker said. “I would hope that that is something that gets announced sooner rather than later — but exactly when, I don’t know.”
Pritzker also said she does not know if Gay will announce her successor as Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean before she departs the role this July.
“She and the Provost are very focused on it,” Pritzker said. “But I don’t know exactly when that will be completed.”
In recent weeks, Gay appointed an interim dean for the School of Public Health and announced outgoing Harvard Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton will serve in the role until the end of August as the search for the school’s next dean continues. Gay has yet to announce who will serve as FAS dean or dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences when the positions vacate on July 1.
Pritzker said during the interview that ensuring a successful presidential transition is currently “top of mind for the Corporation.”
“One of the most important things that we can do is to work with the new president, assuring that she has the support she needs to have her first year be successful,” she said.
Pritzker said the Corporation “has been in dialogue” with Gay, and she meets personally with the President-elect every one to two weeks.
“She and I have a regularly set call that we do, an engagement, and then we also speak between those times on topics as they arise,” she said. “I’m very, very, very excited about her leadership.”
