After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One major problem seems to affect almost every aspect of the Harvard undergraduate experience.
This, of course, is the recurring issue of the College’s peculiar social environment, characterized by exclusive organizations and a lack of inclusive student social space. As we have written time and time again, it is our belief that the best way to address this problem is through a revitalization of House life. For this reason, we eagerly await the much anticipated House Renewal initiative slated to begin in 2012—newer, improved living spaces can only strengthen House community spirit. One concern about this Renewal initiative we had raised in the past was the question of so-called “swing space”—i.e., living arrangements for displaced residents of Houses currently under renovation. The first of these designated renovations is due to take place in Quincy House next year, and, from the College’s plans currently available, it is good to learn that swing space will be managed appropriately throughout this transition period to more updated living spaces in the River Houses.
On Housing Day 2012, around 400 freshmen will receive notice that they have been placed in Quincy, and that instead of receiving what is arguably among the worst sophomore housing on campus, they will receive some of the best. Old Quincy will be the first of the River Houses to be renovated, with the 15-month construction on the complex starting in June 2012. The House will serve as a test case for the Renewal project as a whole, which will eventually extend to Kirkland, Dunster, Eliot, Winthrop, Lowell, and parts of Leverett. While this half of Quincy is under construction, the sophomores who would have been housed there will live in interim housing.
Many had feared that this swing space would be located or in an isolated, distant location. Rumors floated, for instance, that dislocated students would be sent across the River to temporary housing near the Business School. Luckily, however, it seems that the swing space locations will be right in Harvard Square, scattered between Plympton and Mt. Auburn Streets. These locations—with a host of amenities that include cable T.V. and kitchen appliances—are frankly only matched by current overflow housing in DeWolfe. Most importantly, they are all reasonably close to Quincy House and seem very well equipped to fulfill their temporary role. After the widespread concern over the disruption House Renewal would cause, these options for temporary housing come as something of a relief.
This is not to say that there are not small concerns that still remain about these swing spaces. It is unclear, for instance, whether wireless internet service will be available in all these residences, and we hope that the College will ensure that proper security measures are taken in preparing these buildings for undergraduates. In many other campuses where students live in apartment buildings such as these, and in an urban environment, it is often customary for security personnel to staff permanently building entrances. Since Harvard will have to convert these buildings rapidly for undergraduate dorm purposes, it is worth considering implementing a comparable security procedure.
Of course, one other worry is the effect that this disruption will have on Quincy House community spirit. Ultimately, however, the tradeoff of having a revitalized infrastructure is worth a temporary hiccup in House community life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unfortunate side effect of the many successes of the feminist movement is that feminism is often prematurely deemed obsolete, a quaint relic of a chauvinist, bygone era that has since been replaced by a culture of equality. “Her Campus” Magazine, an online publication aimed at female college students, is a fascinating specimen precisely because it, on the one hand, constructs itself as a modern, progressive publication that empowers college-educated women, but on the other, is a product of the reactionary, antifeminist trend that threatens to do just the opposite. “Her Campus”, striving to celebrate independent women, ultimately falls short of its goal and instead perpetuates the very obstacles that stand in the way of women’s social equality.
“Her Campus”’s piece “HC’s 20 Favorite Bathing Suits for Spring Break,” typical of women’s magazines, features mainly unrealistically thin, flawless models. The negative psychological effects that such features have on women are well documented and cannot be underestimated, but what makes this article especially disconcerting is that the one model who does appear to be of a realistic sports a suit that covers her entire stomach and midriff, while virtually all of the others wear standard bikinis. Ironically, the caption says “if you have amazing curves, don’t be afraid show them off [sic] and have fun with your swimwear.” “Her Campus” deserves recognition for attempting to incorporate realistic representations of the female body, yet the implicit message here is tremendously problematic for women of all body types: Slim, conventionally attractive women should show off their bodies, but the rest of you who just can’t live up to our impossible standards should just cover up—the only way for you to accentuate your bodies is to hide them.
Much of HC’s advice on sex, far from adding anything original or insightful to the discussion surrounding sexuality, instead panders to the double standards that we all know and love. A piece addressed to a sexually active college woman from “Her Gay Best Friend” reproaches her for having “become a bit of a ho.” Lazily built on the assumptions that women who sleep around are bound to get hurt and should preserve their chastity to earn respect from men, the article can be characterized as at best a misguided attempt at helping women and at worst a blatantly sexist denunciation of women’s sexual agency.
The piece also propagates frustrating stereotypes about men, asserting that “men don’t buy the cow when they can get milked for free”—that is, men won’t commit to you unless you force them to. By comparing sex with milking a cow, the article constructs sex as something given to men by women rather than something that both parties desire.
Her Gay Best Friend’s disclaimer, naïvely overlooking the realities of sexual inequality, maintains that “almost every piece of advice in this article is also applicable to guys.” While this is certainly true, that fact is that this advice is generally not applied to guys, and when it is its implications are vastly different because of the cultural prestige of male promiscuity. Women, far more than men, are subject to this brand of sexual policing.
Above all, HC’s problematic nature is rooted in its highly prescriptive perception of what it means to be a college woman. HC fails to challenge the impossible standards to which women have historically been held, and in doing so has failed to be what a magazine for independent young women should be. Publications like HC, perpetuating obsessionswith physical appearance and chastity, threaten to subject women to the very forces from which the feminist movement seeks to liberate them.

Clinging to one of its last potential claims to relevance, Time Magazine published yesterday its annual list of the “100 most influential people in the world,” spanning from Wael Ghonim to Patti Smith. Twenty-fourth on the list was Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, responsible for the Birdnest at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, as well as a number of other elaborate conceptual projects. Ai’s inclusion had as much to do with his well publicized detention by Chinese authorities as with any item on his artistic resumé. Accompanying a three-part photograph of him shattering a jug was a curiously aggressive blurb from U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman: “It is very sad that the Chinese government has seen a need to silence one of its most innovative and illustrious citizens. For the world, Ai continues to represent the promise of China.”
This type of appreciation for Ai’s art seems a distinctly mixed blessing. Much of the strength of Ai’s more recent work derives from its efforts to efface the presence of the artist, to convey the overwhelming feeling of being caught up in something greater than oneself. Because of the political attention, however, Ai’s own artistic personality has now replaced his work, overshadowing the ambitions of his delicate subject matter.
It’s worth visiting some of Ai’s work on display at Harvard now, outside the Northwest Labs building. Hundreds of quilted backpacks are affixed to giant columns, a memorial to the children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Ai believes that the “tofu construction” of the government schools was responsible for many of the children’s deaths, a fact officials have been trying to cover up. This week the packs looked particularly stark, serried against a white sky and unmoving despite fierce wind; the drab coloring of their fabric helped them blend into the drabness of a Cambridge spring. The work has no name, listed simply as “Untitled”: perhaps because the tragedy’s magnitude seems so great any title would be an injustice. The effect might have been greater than intended; with no markers whatsoever, most students walking down Oxford   Street do not give the exhibit a second glance. If one does look closely, however, the sheer build-up of objects is tremendously moving.
The project marks a departure from many of Ai’s previous efforts. After film school in Beijing, Ai studied at Parsons in the ’80s. Like many other New   York artists, he dabbled in Dada and ready-mades, which acquire meaning transcending their status as mere objects only through the explicit presence of their creator. Ai has a recognizable face—soft cheeks, playful eyebrows, a distinctive beard—and he was fond of featuring his own image in his work.
It was when he moved back to China to be with his ailing father that Ai grew interested in the social landscape of his country, and began to ask how one could utilize modern design techniques to highlight political issues. Repetition provided the key. In “Untitled,” he plays with the idea of losing one’s individuality in the mass; his stated ideal is a “stylelessness” free of narration, whether his own or that of the state. The closest analogue is another work of his called “Sunflower Seeds,” in which the enormous foyer of London’s Tate Modern became the scattering ground for thousands of seeds people could walk on, pick up, and sift through their hands. Ai’s oeuvre can be alternatingly brilliant and gimmicky, but this angle seems a particularly powerful one. To move away from the self-conscious artistic presence toward a more universal understanding of the past suggests a vast ambition to come to terms with the tragedies of history—not only as a single, subjective individual but also in a grander capacity.
Indeed, Ai’s backpacks are part of a larger exhibit organized by the Graduate School of Design called “Divine Comedy.” Against the relentlessly modern backdrop of the GSD lobby, Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson takes up the present with a series of 54 “sensation-producing body machines.” To him, art is not about creating, but about “organizing and transforming”; his theme is the bafflement of a modern world to which every person brings a unique perspective, evoking the complex, paranoid novel of systems.
It is Ai’s contribution though, grappling with history, that conveys the clearest and most powerful message. Turning to the past makes sense—over and over, we realize how much it matters, digging it up again to reexamine its particulars. Without care, events fade; a collective presence is needed to anchor them, not just an individual one.
This is Ai’s project, and it fits into the trajectory of the larger architectural landscape away from the solitary artist. The design world looks askance at self-promoters far more than does the world of cinema (in which the auteur still has a hold) or literature (by definition a solipsistic enterprise). Today’s large-scale projects often require computer scientists, builders, and entire studios; a work can move from start to finish without the designer himself. In the current issue of Harvard Design Magazine, architects comment on the disappearance of the visionary architect altogether. The self-conscious role Ai is now being expected to assume—the role of the persecuted artist—thus seems singularly misguided. In this respect, ironically, the western media is mirroring the Chinese government: Drawing attention to Ai’s personality, it distracts from his art, and from all the serious concerns behind it.

I wonder if anyone in the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence popped in “Lawrence of Arabia” on Tuesday and watched Peter O’Toole famously tell the British Officers’ Club, “We have taken Aqaba.” When the United Kingdom announced that day that it would send military advisers to Libya, while the United States announced it would not, a shift became clear: in United States foreign policy, expect more drones and less T.E. Lawrence.
The United States led the attack on Muammar Al-Gaddafi’s regime through the assault on anti-aircraft installations last month, but has effectively removed itself from leadership on Libya. While it continues bombing, its allies have escalated involvement that has until now only ensured stalemate in Libya. With the rebel forces too disorganized to take much advantage of air superiority, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are all sending advisers to organize the rebels.
It’s been a long slog through history since the camel-backed victories of the Arab Revolt during the First World War. The U.K. advisers on their way to Libya will most likely not gulp down lemonades after a camel assault in Lawrence fashion. Yet there is something surprising about the enthusiasm of Europe’s response to the situation in Libya. Even before this announcement of the sending of military advisers, the willingness of the old guard of Europe, France and the United Kingdom, has come as a surprise. The jokes about France’s military ineptitude and the narrative of both nation’s downsizing of military capability and involvement no longer ring true.
Instead, it would appear the United States stands at a crossroads, at least of involvement in foreign engagements for the near future. United States policy has not exactly followed the T.E. Lawrence route. Rather than train local rebels to mount their own insurgencies, maintaining advisery involvement on the ground, if we go in, we go in big, then worry about the training later. There do not appear to be too many people confident of what will happen when these after-the-fact trainees take over primary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Concern, instead, centers upon whether we will simply abandon our allies upon withdrawal. In what appears to have been a move to prove Afghanistan would not be abandoned, the government has now touched off international concerns we will maintain permanent bases in the nation. The questions of the fallout after U.S. withdrawal are difficult enough that it appears we are determined to avoid similar ones about a new involvement any time soon.
The front line for the United  States is not Libya. It remains in our (mostly) covert operations in Yemen and our Predator drone strikes in Pakistan that continue to add to tensions there. In Pakistan, droids have largely replaced soldiers. Pakistan has complained about American use of drones over its territory; now we will appease Pakistan by providing it with 85 “Raven” drones.
As support escalates in Libya, it appears the U.S. response will follow this shadow war example, now relying on the same tool, the Predator drone. What makes this response interesting, however, is that other nations are not pursuing such a limited approach. Algeria appears to have aggressively backed Gaddafi’s regime in disregard to the United Nations and international community. Meanwhile, the nation providing uniforms and weapons to the Libyan rebels is not the United States, but Qatar. The nation that will then begin processing oil from the rebel-held eastern Libyan oil fields will not be the United States, but Qatar.
No one will expect Qatar to morph into the next international superpower, but its involvement represents an ambitious, straightforward, investment. The European nations, however, do not seem clear on what role they have assumed. Less than ten advisers peer nation will not turn the war in Libya. If anything, they will help promote order in the rebel forces to avoid decisive defeat. It appears clear, however, that even with total air superiority, the rebels’ organization is at best a work in progress. Mass defections in the Libyan army or a significant change in the equation will be needed if the rebel efforts are to succeed.
If they remain committed to their promises that such advisers will be the only military personnel to arrive on the ground, the ancient three of Europe appear caught in the middle in their policy, while the United States provides support without the risks of ground involvement.
Maybe our recent military ventures have finally reinforced the lessons of Vietnam in teaching us that military advisers are seldom the final answer. Unless we support a U.S. occupation of Libya—and I have registered my disagreement on that before—we should perhaps be grateful. The rebel effort in Libya will require an overhaul that could take quite some time, and the United States should continue to support it.
Resisting the temptation to send in advisers or more appears a rare show of foresight and restraint by the U.S. foreign policymakers. Qatar and Europe, however, appear eager to assume the mantle of T.E Lawrence. They will find it a heavy one to bear.

Harvard physicists at the Greiner Lab recently devised a “quantum magnet” that could aid with the development of high-temperature superconductors and quantum computers and may thereby expand the possibilities for future material science engineering.
“The idea is then we provide some feedback—by studying the matter from a fundamental microscopic perspective—to the people who actually do real material science,” Physics Research Assistant Waseem S. Bakr said. “We help them choose which materials might be suitable candidates for things that might have applications in technology.”
The bigger objective, said Post-Doctoral Fellow in Physics Jonathan Simon, is to “understand real materials that are too complicated to simulate on real computers.”
The quantum magnet is governed by quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics, according to Bakr, which enables particles to exist in superpositions—meaning they can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Bakr and Simon emphasized the application of the quantum magnet in high-temperature superconductors, which allow the transfer of energy without dissipation.
“The magnet’s ability to exist in multiple states at a time makes it invaluable to constructing the high temperature superconductors,” Simon said. “The classical picture of this has been well-developed and understood over the last 100 years but, recently, we’ve been reaching a limit where you need to see non-classical correlations and entanglements—the concept of existing in multiple states at one time—between the electrons to understand the behaviors of the materials.”
Although quantum phase transitions have been observed before in 2001, this magnet spurred the first observation of a quantum phase transition in a magnetic system with cold atoms, according to Bakr. While traditional phase transitions occur when temperature is altered, quantum phase transitions result when other physical parameters of a system are changed.
“A difficulty we encountered was reaching a limit where thermal fluctuations aren’t a problem,” Simon said. “Thermal fluctuations can drive phase transitions and they can, more importantly for us, destroy the initial magnet.”
Although Simon said there was a lot of controversy over whether temperatures this cold would be accessible, the researchers were able to reach temperatures that approximated 100 trillionths of a degree Kelvin.
“In the end, we want to make new materials, and it turns out that ultra-cold atoms can be very good simulators of the same physics that happens in the real material,” Bakr said, adding that the frigid temperatures allow scientists to more closely control the parameters of the system.
The development of the magnet should also aid the larger efforts of the physics community to develop a quantum computer, which can be much faster than a classical computer at certain types of computations.
Markus Greiner, senior author of the research paper and Associate Professor of Physics, is out of town and could not be reached for comment.

Harvard Stem Cell Institute researchers may have found a new use for cell therapy in patients with cardiac damage.
In the latest edition of the journal Cell Stem Cell, Harvard researchers reported that specific cells in the bone marrow called c-kit+ stem cells interact with existing cardiac stem cells, stimulating them to rebuild and repair the damaged cardiac tissue.
While previous research has shown that cardiac function improves after stem cell treatment, the specific mechanism was unclear since stem cells are not believed to turn into heart tissue.
“Right now, we don’t know the best way to heal the heart in the same way that injured leg muscles heal themselves,” wrote Harvard Medical School Professor Richard T. Lee, who led the HSCI study, in an email.
“However, we have a number of clues that humans and other mammals like mice have at least a little capacity to do this.”
The study reaffirms these clues and suggests that cardiac stem cell therapy may serve to stimulate existing stem cells or progenitor cells to augment repair, holding implications for the treatment of cardiac disease and patients facing post-heart attack rehabilitation.
While stem cells have traditionally been used to replace cells, Lee’s study indicates that they may also serve as stimulators to existing cells in the body.
“In some circumstances, stimulating the body’s own stem cells at the right time might end up being simpler than growing cells in the laboratory and getting them back into the organ,” Lee wrote.
He said that his research opens the potential for drug-like treatment using stem cells.
“We might be able to stimulate the patient’s own stem cells with chemicals or drugs that are more like traditional drugs,” he wrote.
Initially tested on mice, the treatment requires further research.
“Right now, we just don’t know how to regenerate many important organs, so everything has to be on the table,” wrote Lee.
The study highlights the further possibilities regenerative medicine has to explore.
“It’s an exciting time in regenerative medicine, because the potential is so enormous and there are so many unanswered questions,” Lee wrote.
“Harvard’s a great place to tackle these challenges, because there is such a concentration of scientists interested in the problems, even though they are tough problems.”

Librarians at the Harvard Law School Library now check out bicycles and helmets to Law School students. While cooking in Thayer Hall’s basement kitchen, College freshman can feed their leftover ingredients to a green box full of worms. If Harvard Medical School students need file folders or desk lamps, they can check out the Medical School’s “freecycling” room, a pseudo-Room-of-Requirement where one man’s trash becomes another’s treasure.
Since 2008, when the University’s sustainability efforts began in earnest, Harvard’s campus has changed in big and small ways to reduce carbon emissions, save energy, and decrease waste. In the midst of today’s Earth Day celebrations across the University, Harvard’s many schools are rolling out new programs and initiatives to continue to encourage a culture of sustainability.
YESTERDAY WAS THURSDAY, TODAY IS EARTH DAY
In celebration of Earth Day, Harvard College, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Law School have prepared events and activities related to sustainability throughout the month of April, or “Earth Month.”
The College’s Earth Day awareness events took place last week, culminating in a celebration in the MAC Quad last Saturday. Each weekday had a theme: electricity, aqua, recycling, topsoil, and health, spelling out EARTH.
The Law School will celebrate Earth Day today on the Harkness Patio with free food from local, sustainable vendors such as b.good and Veggie Planet.
On Monday, the School of Public Health’s sustainability team “EcoOpportunity” will organize a Bike Repair Clinic. The free clinic will teach attendees how to repair a flat tire, adjust a seat post, and provide a basic overview of bike parts.
“We’re trying to encourage and make it easier for people to take their bike to work,” School of Public Health Program Coordinator David J. Havelick said.
“EcoOpportunity” has also continued their annual “Take The Stairs” campaign, in which teams of five compete to climb the height of a mountain in flights of stairs.
On the same side of the Charles River, the Medical School hosted a “Lessons in Sustainability and Research” lecture featuring Director of Boston University’s Center for Energy & Environmental Studies Nathan Phillips.
GOING GREEN
As part of the sustainability initiative, the University announced yesterday that it will sponsor five bike share stations in Allston and Longwood as part of Hubway, Boston’s new regional Bike Share Program.
According to a press release, Harvard will also sponsor four bike share stations in the City of Cambridge when the program expands.
In another effort to reduce the environmental impact of the University, the Law School has installed lighting updates in Langdell Library and has added successful heat recovery units in Hauser Hall, according to the Law School’s Office for Sustainability Coordinator Kathryn A. Cosgrove.
The University held its second annual Green Carpet Awards ceremony early last week to honor University affiliates who have significantly contributed to sustainability efforts.
“Designing green buildings is in [line with] the mission of the school,” said Daniel O. Beaudoin, a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design accredited official and the manager of operations, energy, and utilities at the School of Public Health, which garnered this year’s Green Carpet award for the Green Building Project.
4 YEARS IN, 4 YEARS TO GO
The graduate schools have been working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since 2008, when University President Drew G. Faust announced an initiative to reduce emissions by 30 percent from 2006 baseline levels. According to the Office for Sustainability, Harvard as a whole has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from 2006 levels, but many of Harvard’s graduate schools are well ahead of projected progress.
Compared to 2006 levels, by the end of 2010 the School of Public Health had reduced emissions by 19 percent, the Law School had reduced emissions by 21 percent, and the Business School had reduced emissions by 34 percent. The Medical School has yet to release figures for 2010, but by the end of 2009, the school had reduced energy consumption by 8.9 percent.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent as of 2010.
According to Claire K. Berezowitz, the Longwood sustainability manager at the Office for Sustainability, the Medical School faces unique challenges in reducing emissions due to “the fact that we have so many energy and waste-intensive labs at HMS, as compared to other schools that are more exclusively classrooms and office space.”

In response to proposed changes to the MCAT, faculty who teach popular pre-med courses say they are unlikely to dramatically change their course curricula.
Preliminary recommendations by the American Association of Medical Colleges would lengthen the test by 90 minutes, add a new social sciences section, and expand the breadth of natural sciences covered on the exam by 2015.
“We’d have to really study the matter, but my inclination would be certainly not to create new courses or otherwise generate curriculum based on this exam,” said Dean of Undergraudate Education Jay M. Harris.
Harris added that the College—which has no formal pre-med curriculum—creates courses “based on [its] faculty’s educational vision and not based on what the medical schools or creators of the MCAT or whoever else have to say,” he said.
However, Harris said he does expect pre-med students to voluntarily take additional courses such as psychology and sociology to prepare for the revised exam.
Director of Premedical and Health Career Advising Lee Ann Michelson ’77 said that the College cannot exclusively cater course curricula for pre-med students.
“Harvard science courses are designed for more than pre-meds,” she said.
However, Michelson added that the College may “fine tune” pre-med course logistics, such as rearranging the allocation of lab sections.
University Professor George M. Whitesides said he does not intend to change the way he teaches Chemistry 27: “Organic Chemistry of Life” regardless of whether the recommendations are approved.
“While the MCAT test is an issue that is undoubtedly important for students, we can’t teach according to the MCAT,” he said.
However, Chemistry lecturer Logan S. McCarty ’96—who co-teaches the popular pre-med physics courses Physical Sciences 2: “Mechanics, Elasticity, Fluids, and Diffusion” and Physical Sciences 3: “Electromagnetism, Curcuits, Waves, Optics, and Imaging”—said he may make small alterations in his curricula if the proposed recommendations go through.
“I think if anything I would push to make PS 2 and PS 3 even more biological,” said McCarty. “These changes [to the MCAT] provide even more incentives to think of biology as the thematic organization of the courses and physics as the courses’ content.”
McCarty said he is confident that PS 2 and PS 3 will prepare pre-med students for the MCAT without major alteration of the syllabi.
“We’re going to be very much aligned with what they’re doing with the MCATs,” McCarty said.

Researchers at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have developed a new model for understanding how irradiation affects the instability of materials surfaces, which may help the nuclear industry improve structural materials for its power plants.
The team, led by Michael J. Aziz and Applied Math and Applied Physics Professor Michael P. Brenner, came across this key insight while studying collisions of energetic ions with solids in the laboratory.
“If you irradiate a solid surface with high energy particles, sometimes it’s completely stable and sometimes it spontaneously erupts into nanometer-scale patterns,” said Aziz, a professor of materials and energy technologies.
Understanding the origin of these tiny patterns has been the main goal of their research, as there is interest in harnessing the phenomenon to shape materials on scales much smaller than is possible with conventional methods.
The collisions themselves last for mere trillionths of a second—a duration that can be simulated using complex computer calculations. The researchers ran hundreds of these simulations to measure the average behavior resulting from an individual impact. They then developed a mathematical theory that took the results of the simulation and extended them over a vastly longer timescale, as they were interested in the cumulative effects of hours of steady irradiation.
To their surprise, they found that the instability of irradiated surfaces is not primarily caused by atoms being blasted away by the radiation—the conventional wisdom among materials scientists. Instead, it is the much larger number of atoms that are “knocked around” on the surface, but not actually discharged, that determines whether a surface remains stable.
“We’ve discovered that the whole field, including us, was wrong in understanding what causes the patterns,” Aziz said. This groundbreaking result in materials science also has practical implications for the nuclear industry, particularly for nuclear fusion technologies.
Fusion, if it can be successfully harnessed, has significant advantages over the fission currently used in nuclear power plants. Fusion generates much more power, produces no radioactive waste, and is renewable since it is fueled by water.
Current experiments with fusion reactors use plasma-facing fusion reactor walls made of tungsten. Tungsten atoms are so strongly bonded that the particles in nuclear fusion plasma do not have enough energy to blast them away from the wall surface. Yet, the walls surprisingly become “foamy” and degrade over time.
The recent discovery at SEAS explains how these surfaces might degrade without discharging tungsten atoms.
“It opens a very interesting path for understanding possible causes of instability, and could lead to better design criteria for the stability of materials under irradiation,” Aziz said.
Acquiring a better understanding of materials stability may bring us closer to the goal of mobilizing fusion power for commercial use.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate dining halls last night bustled with excited students browsing over buttered potatoes with sprinkles of parsley, cheddar and pepper jack cheese cubes on a wooden cutting board with crackers on the side, as well as an ice cream sundae bar with a flavor appropriately named “Green Monster.”
Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services celebrated Earth Day last night with its annual sustainable dinner, which featured entrees and side dishes made with local, seasonal, and organic ingredients.
This year’s sustainable dinner included entrees that ranged from cider and thyme steamed mussels and carved herbed roasted chickens with a maple and shallot glaze to peppered turnips and lobster bisque.
In the Adams dining hall, Amol Pai ’13 tried to cool his steaming bowl of lobster bisque by blowing on it before bringing a spoonful to his mouth.
“It’s the best soup I had at Harvard,” Pai said, “It makes me feel like I just got out from my final exam.”
“It doesn’t get better than this,” Pai said. “The first spoonful [of the lobster bisque] made my legs melt.”
The sustainable dinner became an annual tradition in 2008 when University President Drew G. Faust announced Harvard’s commitment to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2016.
The dinner reflects HUHDS’ “effort to celebrate the University’s overall green commitment,” said HUHDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
Although the actual Earth Day is today, Martin said HUHDS decided to serve Sustainable Dinner last night because dinner attendance on Friday is typically lower than other nights.
“We wanted as many people to enjoy this popular event as possible,” Martin said.
“Many people don’t connect food and sustainability,” Martin said. “We want to celebrate all that Earth Day represents by highlighting regional foods we enjoy regularly.”
Specifically for HUHDS, Martin said sustainability focuses on food that is grown or made locally.
Though Alexandra G. Mironov ’13 said the menu wasn’t too different from a normal day, she said she enjoyed the papardelle with brown butter roasted butternut squash and sage.
“It tasted fresh and not taken from a premade container,” she said. “It had fresh herbs and lots of flavor.”
Jakob O. W. Lindaas ’13, the Resource Efficiency Program representative for Adams, said all the ingredients for the night’s dinner are from within a 250 mile radius of Harvard.
“The idea behind local food is that it’s not only better for the environment since it travels less, but it’s also a way to support local economy,” Lindaas said.
HUHDS has taken several measures to promote sustainability in its kitchens and dining halls. For example, Dunster/Mather became the first commercial kitchen in the country to be LEED silver certified, while 12 of 13 residential dining halls compost pre- and post-consumer waste.
Depending on the season, 35 to 70 percent of produce provided in the dining hall is grown locally and HUHDS spends 25 percent of food budget on local goods.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The General Education Office in the Holyoke Center was abuzz with chatter yesterday as members of Science of Living Systems 21: “Evolutionary Medicine,” a class that applies Darwin’s methods to understand illness, presented their “disease report” final projects.
Students displayed their “novel hypotheses”—original interpretations based on research on diseases such as myopia, rabies, and phenylketonuria—on colorful posters hung throughout the room.
“I am terrifically impressed with the enthusiasm and knowledge of the students,” said Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology Peter Ellison, who co-teaches the course with Associate Professor Charles L. Nunn.
Science of Living Systems 21—which is being taught for the first time this semester—is among a number of Gen Ed courses that are replacing finals with nontraditional final projects.
Creative Gen Ed assignments such as the “disease report” final project “allow [students] to internalize things for themselves in a way that some of the more traditional approaches might not,” according to Director of General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
Kenen added that the Gen Ed program was designed to give faculty the flexibility to explore different approaches to teaching and assessment.
“There are certain trends in education toward active learning and learning-by-doing,” she said. “What we’re really trying to do is provide an experimental space to see what else works.”
Ellison began developing the course out of a seminar. Once Nunn joined the faculty, Ellison said he saw the potential for bringing an evolutionary approach to medicine to a wider audience.
“Evolutionary medicine has been developing for twenty years,” Ellison said. “I’ve been professionally active in trying to promote evolutionary thinking.”
Students said they enjoyed the class.
“This class makes us think outside the box,” said Angela Liu ’12.
In their presentations, students were allowed to think creatively, while maintaining academic rigor.
Liu’s presentation on myopia focused on her novel hypothesis.
“Night lighting elevates dopamine, eventually leading to dopamine insensitivity, which causes eyeball growth,” she said.
Looking around the conference room, Mihir J. Chaudhary ’12 said he admired the work of his classmates.
“The most interesting parts are the original hypotheses they come up with.”

Planning is underway to celebrate Harvard’s 375th anniversary during the 2011-2012 academic year.
University President Drew G. Faust said that she hopes the anniversary will serve as an opportunity for the University to celebrate its past and reflect on its future.
“We plan to honor Harvard’s rich history and cherished traditions, the great minds that have taught here, and the great minds those teachers have inspired, and we will also focus our energy and attention on the questions that will define our present and our future,” Faust wrote in an email.
Anniversary festivities will culminate in a “birthday party” kick off on Friday Oct. 14 that is slated to be held in Tercentenary Theatre, according to University Marshal Jackie A. O’Neill.
The event will feature parades and special House dinner receptions. O’Neill, whose office is still in discussions with House Masters and Committees, said that she hopes each House will march into Tercentenary Theatre in a display of “House identity” and pride.
At Tercentenary Theatre, revelers will partake in a community dance and enjoy artistic and cultural performances and a dessert buffet.
O’Neill said that this celebratory event—and the others that will occur through the year—will showcase Harvard’s greater diversity and global outlook acquired since its last milestone 25 years ago.
“There’s no question that there’s interest and hunger to mark 375 years of a venerable institution like Harvard and reflect upon the enormous difference between where we are now and where we were at the 350th year benchmark,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill also said that anniversary festivities will help rally Harvard spirit for an upcoming captial campaign that is currently in a planning phase. But she said the event will not signify the kick-off of the University’s campaign, whose official start date has not been announced.
“This is not the launch of our capital campaign, but the [anniversary and campaign] will play into each other,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill added that the University hopes to engage many contingents of the Harvard community with this event, which falls on the same weekend as Freshman Parents Weekend and the Harvard Alumni Association’s fall meeting.
The Alumni Affairs and Development Office similarly hopes that, in addition to students, faculty and staff, many alumni will be involved in the anniversary celebrations, according to Alumni Affairs and Development Vice President Tamara E. Rogers ’74.
“I am excited about the plans for the upcoming anniversary,” Rogers wrote in an email.
In addition to the Oct. 14 celebration, many other events—including a series of academic panels and a president’s forum—will be held throughout the year.  The University plans to launch a website featuring a list of anniversary celebrations this summer.

Sustainability efforts at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences were recognized early last week at the Green Carpet Awards, a University-wide ceremony honoring Harvard affiliates who have aided campus sustainability efforts.
The SEAS laboratory operated by Physics Professor David A. Weitz was one of the finalists for the “Green Building Project” award, which was eventually won by a building at the School of Public Health.
Weitz’s experimental soft condensed matter lab recently moved to a new and more environmentally friendly space on Oxford Street.
Thomas E. Kodger, a graduate student in this lab, was closely involved in the implementation of several green initiatives in the new venue.
He said that one of the most important changes was the efficient monitoring of fume hoods, which absorb and expel poisonous gases from the lab but consume enormous amounts of energy—as much annually as a four-person household.
Weitz said that the way forward for SEAS is to “continue exactly what they have been doing,” which should include refurbishing all the remaining labs and implementing similar green initiatives in them.
He emphasized that social demands push institutions to update their equipment and their operations and that Harvard has been excellent in effectively responding to those demands.
A recent SEAS shift in focus from physical to chemical projects necessitated a greater awareness of sustainability standards, Kodger said.
The changes within the Weitz Lab also included automated, energy-conservation lighting as well as a workspace oriented more towards utilizing natural light. The lighting was initially considered a hassle by several members of the lab but eventually gained favor due to its ease of use, Kodger said.
He added that the most surprising modification was the replacement of all the windows in two of the labs. He cited the enormous cost of the undertaking as the reason for his surprise, but acknowledged that heat loss through the windows is the lab’s largest energy cost. Kodger estimated that the changes would pay back on their initial investments within five to eight years.
Kodger said that Harvard has successfully shifted towards meticulously following Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines for constructing new buildings and workspaces.
“Recycling of old materials might be the one thing [that could] be done better,” he added.
Two individual recognitions were also given to SEAS at the Green Carpet Awards. Matthew N. Hayek, a graduate student, was awarded for his work in the Student Sustainability Advisory Group and his climate change research. SEAS Custodian Joanne Carson was recognized for her initiative in recycling coffee grounds for innovative uses such as fertilizer.

Harvard laboratory researchers, led by Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology David R. Liu ’94, have found a new and faster technique of directed evolution, generating biomolecules with certain desired properties, by co-opting the life cycle of a bacteriophage.
Their paper, entitled “A System For The Continuous Directed Evolution Of Biomolecules,” was published this month in the journal Nature.
The researchers created a system named “phage-assisted continuous evolution,” called PACE, in which genes are transported between host cells of E. coli through a bacteriophage and undergo multiple rounds of continuous evolution.When a single round of traditional directed evolution takes days to complete, research that requires hundreds or thousands of rounds could take years.
PACE promises to speed up this process by nearly 100-fold.
“In the past, directed evolution has been constrained by the relatively slow speed and labor-intensive nature of most conventional methods,” Liu said.
“The purpose of this research is to develop a new method of directed evolution that dramatically speeds up the process by removing the requirement of researcher intervention from virtually every step of the cycle,” he added.
Liu, a Harvard College Professor and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, worked closely with Kevin M. Esvelt and Jacob C. Carlson, two graduate students who co-authored the paper.
Esvelt and Carlson have spent a combined nine years on the project.
Having now developed a general method for evolving proteins, the group’s next goal is to find techniques that can target more specific biomolecules.
“The fact that we can do this very quickly would have very powerful therapeutic applications,” Carlson said.
Liu also alluded to even broader implications of their work.
“In our lab, much of the research is inspired by biological evolution,” Liu said. “We’re using PACE to answer some basic evolutionary questions that would usually demand years to address.”

Harvard Law School is currently under investigation by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for alleged violations of Title IX—specifically, violations of part of Title IX that stipulate how a school should handle cases of sexual assault.
New England School of Law Professor Wendy Murphy, who filed the complaint, says that Harvard Law School is one of many institutions across the nation that violates Title IX’s mandates regarding sexual assault. Murphy has also filed complaints against Yale University and Princeton University.
The Law School acknowledged the investigation in a statement.
“We are aware that the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education has been contacted. We defer to OCR for whatever comment they deem appropriate,” Law School spokesperson Robb London said in a statement.
The OCR did not return calls requesting comment.
Murphy said that the complaint was based on three main problems with the Law School’s policy on responding to sexual assault. According to Murphy, these three discrepancies in policy have yet to conform with new guidelines released by Vice President Joe Biden in conjunction with OCR.
These guidelines make clear to institutions that sexual assault on campuses is under the jurisdiction of Title IX and clarify exactly how to handle cases in a “prompt and efficient” manner.
Murphy cited the most important flaw in the Law School’s policy as its currently drawn-out system for holding hearings for alleged assailants. Murphy said that holding hearings quickly is crucial considering a potential victim is only covered by the rules of Title IX while she or he is still at the institution—at the Law School, for three years—and would potentially be forced to learn alongside his or her assailant while awaiting the hearing.
Murphy said that another discrepancy was the Law School’s requirement for students who alleged they were victims of sexual assault to prove their allegation by “clear and convincing evidence,” which she said is contrary to the Title IX mandate and the standard in the justice system.
Title IX states that the burden of proof must instead be a preponderance of the evidence, a lower evidentiary standard.
She also said that the Law School has failed to provide a written timeline to outline how long a hearing would take, which is required by the Title IX guidelines.
Cari S. Simon and Amy J. Sennett, both third years at the Law School and the President and Vice President of the Harvard Women’s Law Association, respectively, said that although they are not aware of the specifics of the complaint, they support actions to improve campus safety.
“The Harvard Women’s Law Association supports efforts across the country to create campuses that are safe for women and provide equal opportunities to access higher education,” they wrote in an email statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
S. Alison Kraemer ’12 knew she wanted to research stem cells before she came to Harvard.
At 13, she had a spinal injury while dancing that left her with herniated discs. She recovered from her injury with physical therapy, but she was no longer able to dance.
Kraemer’s injury helped spark her interest in stem cell research. She hopes that finding clinical solutions to spinal cord injuries will help those who were not as fortunate in their recoveries as she was.
Since the summer after her freshman year, Kraemer has worked continuously at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. She researches in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Professor Paola Arlotta’s lab, where she investigates practical applications for recent breakthroughs in stem cell technology.
Kraemer’s work involves culturing induced pluripotent stem cells, skin cells which have been transformed into stem cells in order to eventually create corticospinal motor neurons. These neurons help transmit signals from the cortex, down the spinal cord, and ultimately to the muscles. They can be damaged in the case of spinal cord injuries or Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Kraemer’s laboratory hopes that if the damaged neurons can be replaced, some of these patients may be able to move again.
Coming into the lab, Kraemer was unfamiliar with the intricacies of stem cell research.
“I felt a little ignorant, and I needed to learn a lot to keep up,” Kraemer said.
She read many scientific papers on stem cells and gradually caught up.
“I can really engage in conversations now, and I feel like I’m helping answer the theoretical questions we’re asking,” Kraemer said.
Kraemer said she loves lab work. “Whenever I learn a new procedure I feel like a little kid. I’m like holy cow. That’s so cool,” she said.
Kraemer is invested in the implications of her lab’s research because ultimately she hopes to treat patients through clinical work, possibly in pediatrics, dermatology, or oncology.
“I’d like to be able to completely change someone’s life for the better,” Kraemer said.
Kraemer is part of the first class to graduate in the new Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology concentration.
Outside academics, Kraemer is a co-editor in chief of the Harvard College Global Health Review, a publication she joined her freshman spring in the first year of its publication.
Outside of science, Kraemer’s other passion is music. She has played the flute for 13 years and has played for the Mozart Society Orchestra and with Mather Chamber Music, while also volunteering with MIHNUET, an organization that performs music in nursing homes and hospitals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2001, a research team in Manhattan discovered unexplained levels of polychlorinated biphenyl toxins in samples of human breast milk. To pinpoint the underlying cause, the team needed to find a control group isolated from the pollutants of a heavily industrialized city like New York City. So they packed up and headed to the Canadian Arctic.
Journalist Richard Lister, a British Broadcasting Corporation World Service broadcaster, former State Department reporter, and current affiliate at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, got to go along for the ride.
“The team went to the Arctic thinking these people lived far from factories,” Lister recalls. “But actually, they had five times as many toxins because they were eating fish and ocean mammals that were full of them.”
This insight into the pervasive chain of pollution was one of many turning points that inspired Lister to delve into environmental journalism in the midst of a career that has taken him to over 40 countries and brought him face to face with everything from turmoil in the Balkans and famine in Ethiopia to the O.J. Simpson trial.
Today, Lister is at Harvard with his wife Philippa Thomas, another BBC journalist and a Nieman fellow. The Foundation gives affiliate standing to its fellows’ spouses.
Capitalizing on his affiliate status, Lister has chosen to audit several Earth science and environmental history courses to enrich his understanding of the issues he hopes to cover when he resumes his role as a BBC reporter.
“We’re dealing with either potential catastrophe or potential opportunity, and nobody as yet has found a way to sort out satisfactorily which one it will be—or if it must be both,” he says of the current climate crisis. “I just have the sense that at this moment there’s really no more important issue in terms of its impact on people around the planet.”
COPY TASTING
Immersed in American Studies at the University of Manchester in England, Lister might never have discovered his passion for broadcast journalism if he hadn’t ventured across the pond to Pennsylvania State University for his junior year of college.
At Penn State, he co-hosted a weekly comedy radio show called “Absolutely Live,” working with about 20 peers to write and deliver sketches over the undergraduate airwaves.
“I suppose I enjoyed the creative energy of it, working with a group of like-minded people,” he says. “The instant reaction—being able to talk to a large number of people at once and have them react to what you were doing—was very exciting.”
After college, he ran with his radio momentum and started applying for journalism training courses, largely through the BBC. When he landed a job as a local radio reporter, he was thrown into the world of broadcast journalism full-speed ahead as a “copy taster,” pulling and comparing stories from press agencies.
“You’re expected to do everything—produce, write, cut the tape,” he says. “You get to do an awful lot very quickly.”
But when he joined the BBC World Service radio team—the arm that broadcasts to the rest of the world—he says an even steeper learning curve was in order. Not only were the stories much bigger, involving places “you barely knew existed,” but reporting to international audiences proposes a unique challenge, Lister says.
“It’s relatively easy to report your country’s politics to people who live in your country,” he says. But reporting to the world outside Britain’s borders made him “think more deeply about what the story was and what was important about it.”
While he says he got up to speed on what was happening globally “pretty quickly,” making the adjustment from covering local court cases or duck pond preservation projects to covering political upheaval in Zimbabwe was no small feat.
Working out of Westminster, Lister’s World Service phase was also the one in which he met his future wife. The couple has managed to coordinate several career relocations so that they’re always based out of the same city—a plus for their eight-year-old son.
Lister’s coverage shifted across the Atlantic when he became a United States affairs analyst working on stories that the BBC heard about before people in the U.S. were even awake.
“I had one of the first internet connections in the BBC,” he remembers of this period in the mid-1990s. “I don’t think people really knew whether or not the internet would be important enough for everyone to have it.”
He next made his television debut, working for BBC World TV, which Lister says initially was “sort of a terrifying experience.”
“Suddenly you’re working with an editor and a producer and they both have different ideas about what each piece should be like,” he says. “It was a good lesson about working with colleagues.”
But it was only a matter of time before Lister relocated from the West London television center to a new perch up-close-and-personal with American politics: Washington, DC.
A VERY BUSY TIME
Lister says international travel was one of the allures of broadcast journalism, but it wasn’t until he became the BBC’s U.S. State Department correspondent that his passport started to really get a workout.
“I went to at least 40 countries with [Secretary of State] Madeleine Albright,” he says. “At least half of them more than twice. It was a very, very busy time.”
Lister was one of eight to ten journalists who routinely shipped out with Albright. He says that despite competing to assemble the best broadcast, those exhausted journalists shared quite a bond.
“When many people on the plane would be sleeping, we’d have to be writing or filing stories,” he says. “In 24-hour news, everybody expects you to be able to file all the time.”
Radio—and occasionally TV—broadcasts could be a struggle in some foreign locations, he remembers, juggling language barriers, technical difficulties and transportation obstacles. But reporting from North Korea, Mongolia, China, India, Pakistan—“everywhere, really”—had rewarding elements as well.
“It gets the adrenaline running,” he says. “The buzz is knowing that you’ve been able to produce a story under very demanding circumstances, and do it in a way that people find interesting, or informed, or intelligent.”
Environmental issues were not an intentional focus of Lister’s—but after covering mudslides in Venezuela and earthquakes in Turkey, he started to develop an interest in natural disasters and questions of sustainability.
A trip to Barrow, Prudhoe Bay, Kaktovik, and the Arctic Village in Alaska involved reporting on possible drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The Inuit on the edge of the Wildlife Refuge were, much to Lister’s surprise, in favor of drilling that might disrupt caribou migration patterns because of potential job opportunities. But south of the mountain range, where families relied on caribou for survival, opinions were very different.
“So many big environmental stories are not black and white,” Lister says. “And these issues are multidisciplinary in their impact. ... Really no area of the planet is not affected in some way by environmental change, access to water, access to power, and so on.”
‘OFF THE TREADMILL’
As a Nieman affiliate, Lister has explored everything from climate change in Medieval European history to modes of energy production, in addition to auditing a seminar called “This Land is Your Land: North American Environmental History,” taught by History of Science Lecturer Conevery B. Valencius.
Topics in this class include the role of waterways in the creation of federal power, the Native American dispossession of the Great Plains, and the portrayal of industrial intrusions into the environment in literature, poetry, and music.
“I think if we look out the windows of where many of us live and work, it’s hard to see a deeper history because so much of our present is asphalt and pressure-treated glass,” Valencius says. “Tracing the root of how we got to various situations, whether it’s our dependency on fossil fuels or the concentration of humanity into cities, gives us a sense of what kinds of changes or alterations we could possibly make.”
The Nieman Fellowship—which includes 24 fellows and their families each year—encourages fellows and affiliates to attend creative and nonfiction writing seminars, journalism discussions, and community events.
Lister has greatly enjoyed getting “off the treadmill” of 24-hour reporting, which has allowed him to read for pleasure, dabble in fiction writing, and meet other fellows who he says are awe-inspiring and “humbling.”
“Lots of these journalists are based in dangerous places,” he said. “It’s one thing to report on popular events in Zimbabwe and then get on a plane and leave—but that just pales in comparison to some of the things these journalists have to do every day.”
Robert H. Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation—who was himself a Nieman fellow studying urban affairs and urban renewal in 1966—said the program sees an explicit connection between education and journalism.
“The press is covering a very complex world and they draw great value from the learning that goes on in Harvard classrooms to help them become more knowledgeable and authoritative in the subjects they’re covering,” he says.
Auditing classes is not a one-way street for the Nieman fellows and affiliates, Giles said.
“The fellows bring into each class their experience, their knowledge, their cultural values,” he said. “We get notes from professors every semester saying how much the contributions of the Niemans are appreciated.”
Lister, in fact, is going to be answering questions about environmental journalism in an upcoming session with interested students in Valencius’s seminar class.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Valencius says that her class discusses the use of science in environmental arguments and the discrepancy between scientific consensus and public views regarding climate change.
“Looking at the role of environmental arguments in writing for the public in the last 150 years helps us understand how we would get to a point where Americans have such a different view of science than the scientists do,” she says.
What’s more, Valencius adds, books like Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” show how writing can cast a familiar-seeming world in a revolutionary light.
“I see all kinds of media—books, online sources, blogs—as some of the most powerful forces shaping the material world,” she says.
Lister said he feels the debate about climate change has shifted from whether or not the climate is changing to what we can do about it—though he acknowledges that there are still individuals focused on the first debate.
But for Lister, the facts are straightforward.
“If you mess around with any chemical formula, it will change the outcome of the formula—and we are messing around very seriously with the chemical formula of the atmosphere,” he says. “It’s bound to have some kind of impact.”
But the challenge of environmental reporting, he says, is selecting what’s reasonable to include and what can be left out.
“Do you include the views that some people think the climate isn’t changing?” he asks. “All journalists really have a mission to explain, a responsibility to try and gather the best facts you can about a particular issue and disseminate them in a way that’s clear and comprehensive and fair.”
The historical perspective introduced in some of his classes has contextualized environmental issues in a powerful way, he says.
“It’s tempting to think about climate change as a recent phenomenon, but actually in other ways it’s always been there,” he says.
“The sad truth is that we’re better at wreaking environmental change than any generation that preceded us in human history—the best, or the worst,” he says. “For a journalist, that means that I should be in business for some time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though he hails from outside the University, faculty say they are confident that newly selected University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will smoothly transition into his new position this fall.
Garber’s interdisciplinary expertise in economics and medicine will be an asset as University President Drew G. Faust works to unify the University and develop Allston.
Harvard Law School Professor John C. P. Goldberg—who served on the Provost search committee—said that the committee weighed the pluses and minuses of selecting an “outsider.”
Though Garber received both his A.B. and Ph.D. from Harvard, he has been a member of the Stanford University faculty for 25 years.
Goldberg said there was some concern that an external candidate might not be “attuned to some aspects of Harvard culture and background, [which] might create some problems an insider wouldn’t experience.” But ultimately the committee felt that this concern was not serious in Garber’s case, Goldberg said.
Professor Joseph P. Newhouse ’63, who has known Garber since the mid 1980s, said that although “undoubtedly there will be some learning curve,” he does not believe that this challenge is specific to the transition of an external selection.
“There are lots of internal people who don’t know much about the University-at-large,” Newhouse said. “Harvard is a vast place. Any person would face a considerable learning curve.”
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said she believes that his outsider status will be helpful to Harvard because he can bring insights and knowledge from Stanford.
“I think it is actually fantastic that he is an insider-outsider,” Minow said. “He has real, deep understanding about how another great University functions.”
In addition to integrating the University’s schools and encouraging interdisciplinary study, Garber said that Allston was a priority in an interview with The Crimson shortly after his selection.
Newhouse said he expects that Garber will be very involved in Allston development, but that he does not believe that this was the single most important factor in his selection.
“The fact that he complements her in that he knows science and medicine is more important than how his talents air on Allston,” Newhouse said. “It is his judgement, his integrity, and the chemistry between him and the president.”
Newhouse also added that the expertise and talents required for Allston are “somewhat diffuse” and could include a sense of design or knowledge of the environment, and that “potentially a lot of people would satisfy those requirements.”
Faculty said that Faust will dictate how she and Garber split responsibilities within the University. “I think he will play the role she wants him to play,” Newhouse said. “I think his top priority will be his relation to her.”
Goldberg said that he believes that Faust “will have to decide how best to make use of his skills and the office of the provost.”
Minow said that she believes that “a central goal” for Garber will be to assist in realizing President Drew G. Faust’s “wonderful vision of one University.”
However, she believes Faust will be more concerned with shaping the vision for the University, while Garber will have a more direct involvement in day-to-day activities at Harvard.
Minow called Garber a “true Renaissance man,” and said she believes his background in medicine and economics makes him the ideal person to bridge between the sciences and social sciences at Harvard.
Minow said she was impressed by Garber’s intellectual curiosity and interest in the humanities even though it is outside his direct area of academic work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Assistant Professor Tarek Masoud allayed fears that the powerful Muslim Brotherhood will turn Egypt into a Islamist nation, though he warned that there is much that is not known about the situation in the country to predict what will happen in September’s parliamentary elections and the future.
In a seminar jointly sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies yesterday, Masoud mainly spoke of the Muslim Brotherhood, said to be the largest and oldest Islamist organization in the world. Founded in 1928 in the northeast Egyptian city of Ismalia, it has among its professed goals “the introduction of the Islamic Shariah as the basis controlling the affairs of state and society.”
Although candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood were officially independents ever since the movement was banned in 1954, it was already the second largest party in the legislature before the recent overthrow of Hosni Mubarak and the National Democratic Party.
However, Masoud said that “the Muslim Brotherhood doesn’t represent a majority of the population.”
Still, the Brotherhood will likely have a tremendous political advantage in the upcoming September parliamentary elections, he said. In the relative chaos left by Egypt’s current political vacuum, Masoud said the Islamist organization is uniquely organized because members of the Brotherhood have a high level of commitment, as it takes four years of examination to become an active member.
Further proof of the Muslim Brotherhood’s influential role can be found in the Egyptian people’s recent vote for a series of amendments to the constitution, according to Masoud. These amendments, which were supported by the Brotherhood and opposed by secular forces, include a provision that would destroy the constitution upon the election of the new Parliament.
Masoud did not attribute this outcome solely to the Brotherhood, instead saying that it was a result of a public that needed “certainty.’
Regardless, the parliamentary elections will now be vital in shaping the new Egyptian constitution and, as a result, will bring up polarizing issues like the role of the Shariah in the state.
"A new constitution is job number one of the new parliament,” he said. "By making the constitution writing number one on the agenda, you're ensuring that a religious cleavage would be the most salient political cleavage in the upcoming elections."
Masoud also addressed fears of what could happen because the organization is generally anti-American and anti-Israeli. Masoud said that the Brotherhood would like pursue a more confrontational course with Israel, though the pro-American Egyptian military would potentially serve as a counterweight to such a move and would perhaps take a larger role in governance.
“There is this cleavage in the military,” he said. “Some people in the military actually believe that the military should govern, while some believe that they should just get out.”
Overall, the message Masoud sent about the Brotherhood’s future in Egypt’s government was one of uncertainty.
“Are they about to take over?” He asked. “I don’t know.”
This article has been revised to refelct the following correction.
CORRECTION: APRIL 23, 2011
The April 22 article "Masoud Talks Islam in Egypt" misquoted statements made by Professor Tarek Masoud. While Masoud said that tension between Egypt and Israel is likely to increase, the Muslim Brotherhood is unlikely to support an attack on Israel.

A male graduate student was robbed at knife point on Tuesday night outside of 16 Prescott Street—across the street from the Harvard Faculty Club—according to a Harvard University Police Department community advisory sent Wednesday night.
A backpack, laptop, cellphone, Mac charger, planner, eyeglasses, sunglasses, and a wallet with $150 cash were taken from the 24-year-old resident of Prescott Street.
According to the Cambridge Police Department’s report, the victim was walking home at approximately 10:50 p.m. when he was stopped by two males in their 20s.
The shorter of the two males pulled out a knife and showed it to the victim.
“Give me what you got,” he said, according to the police report.
“Take what’s in there,” the victim said to his perpetrators, handing over his backpack.
The shorter suspect rummaged through the victim’s backpack while the taller suspect asked whether the victim had anything else on him.
After feeling his pockets, the victim found his cell phone, an “iTouch cell phone” according to the report, and the suspect took it.
“Just take the whole bag, and let’s go,” the taller suspect said, according to the report.
The two suspects walked away toward Harvard St. The student was not injured during the armed robbery.
The victim returned to his apartment and called the police. CPD units searched the area but did not find the two suspects.
The incident is being investigated by CPD because it did not take place on Harvard’s campus.
HUPD reminded students that if someone approaches them displaying a weapon and demanding property, it is recommended that the victim complies with the request and not resist.

The Committee on Student Life discussed the party policies in the Houses at a meeting yesterday morning, with students arguing for more consistency in party form policy while administrators resisted, citing natural House variability.
In general, administrators present agreed that all tutors should receive the same party training, but not everyone agreed with a UC proposal that House policies should be changed, citing House architecture as a barrier to uniformity.
A UC handout circulated at yesterday’s meeting said that students resort to less safe, unregistered parties or off-campus parties in lieu of registered parties because there is not enough information given to students and there are disparities between House regulations.
Vice Chair of the UC Student Life Committee Francisco Triana ’13 criticized the requirement that party forms be submitted multiple days in advance. He said that if some students’ plans fall through and they decide they want to have some friends over to their room, they have to fill out a party form, but “having these forms due 3 or 2 days in advance doesn’t allow for that kind of spontaneity.”
House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said that the conversation should go beyond rules on forms. He said there were two levels to this conversation: the definition of a party and “that one of our goals in life is to teach people to party responsibly and safely.”
Palfrey said he believes that Harvard should have a curriculum for party-related topics such as how to throw one and how to drink.
In addition, House Masters present at the meeting agreed that the education of tutors should be uniform across the Houses, though creating that sense of uniformity in party forms poses more of a problem.
“In the past, masters have said that while they liked uniformity, the architecture required them to do things differently,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
While Quincy has a designated party suite, other Houses, such as Kirkland, have parties in different rooms and entryways on weekend nights.
Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke described the third-floor balcony suite in Quincy as a multipurpose party suite where tutors also host study breaks. She said that having this party suite usually worked well.
In Kirkland, on the other hand, there is no specific party suite.
“You can’t have a party in every suite, but you can have more than one party in the same entryway,” said Kirkland House Master Verena A. Conley.
This conversation about party forms and policies will be continued at the new committee established to review and modify the alcohol policy.

Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64 confirmed that psychology professor Marc D. Hauser will not be teaching next academic year.
The Psychology Department faculty voted in February to deny Hauser permission to teach, according to Carey.
Hauser is currently on a one-year leave of absence following a University investigation that found him responsible for scientific misconduct.
The Crimson reported earlier this week that according to the online 2010-2011 course catalogue, Hauser was expected to teach in the coming year. But administrators have since revealed the results of the Psychology Department’s February vote.
While Hauser’s leave of absence will end after this academic year, Carey declined to elaborate on what role Hauser will play this fall.
“The details are not worked out,” she said. “Harvard is currently exploring lots of possibilities.”
Carey said that the faculty vote does not preclude Hauser from conducting research at Harvard.
Other faculty members in the Psychology Department declined to comment for this story. Hauser also declined to comment.
Following the department vote, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith barred Hauser from teaching across FAS in the coming academic year, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
“Dean Smith supported this decision and, in that light, he will not condone Professor Hauser teaching in other FAS departments or Schools,” Neal wrote in an emailed statement.
Hauser canceled his course in cognitive evolution last fall at the Extension school the night before it was scheduled to begin.
At the time, Hauser wrote in an email to The Crimson he was “deeply disappointed” about the cancelation, and he would look forward to teaching in the fall of 2011 at the College and the Extension school.
The Psychology Department faculty vote is only effective for the next academic year, according to Neal.
Carey declined to speculate about plans for Hauser’s role beyond the 2011-2012 academic year.
Hauser—whose research focuses on cognitive function in primates—was found last August to be “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct by an internal University investigation, leading to the correction or retraction of three published studies.
In a letter to the Faculty on Aug. 20. Smith wrote that Hauser would face “appropriate sanctions,” which could include “involuntary leave, the imposition of additional oversight on a faculty member’s research lab, and appropriately severe restrictions on a faculty member’s ability to apply for research grants, to admit graduate students, and to supervise undergraduate research.”
After concluding its internal investigation, the case was sent to the federal Office of Research Integrity to conduct an independent investigation.
Carey said the faculty’s decision was not related to the federal investigation, which has not made public its results.

Timothy B. Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, dispelled Hollywood conceptions of space in a talk last night about his work identifying asteroids whose trajectory may pass near earth.
Spahr lectured at the CfA, which opened its doors to the public for its monthly “Observatory Night.” The event included an hour-long lecture by Spahr and an opportunity to use the Center’s high-powered telescope to view Saturn, an Iridium satellite flare, and the International Space Station.
Central to Spahr’s lecture was a survey of how far the Minor Planet Center, which identifies asteroids and their trajectories, has come in the past two decades with the aid of a supercomputer, observatories around the world, and even amateur astronomers.
In 2008, Spahr, along with the help of his four-person team, accurately predicted where a two-meter-wide asteroid would strike within 20 kilometers of the actual impact site.
“The good news is that nearly 100 percent of asteroids one mile across are known and tracked by us,” Spahr said. “I don’t want people to get the idea that I’m running around screaming that asteroids are going to hit.”
Spahr also dispelled some myths about the possibility of a doomsday scenario à la “Armageddon” or “Deep Impact.”
“If you’ve seen ‘Armageddon,’ they say that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit and that it’s coming out of nowhere,” Spahr said. “Well, we found the last asteroid the size of Texas 211 years ago. It’s nice for movies but totally improbable.”
Spahr also added that cinematic solutions to averting calamity are fictitious.
“You really don’t want to nuke an asteroid,” Spahr said. “Even though it’d be fun, it’s much more effective to just put a heavy object next to the asteroid and drag it away from its predicted trajectory. I think the desire to nuke them stems from the end of the Cold War. They didn’t know what to do with all of the leftover nukes, so they started thinking about nuking asteroids.”
Christine E. Pulliam, who works as a public affairs specialist for the CfA, summed up Spahr’s work and highlighted its importance.
“He’s really one of the unsung heroes of the astronomical world,” Pulliam said. “He’s seen it all—the ‘Oh my God, the asteroids are coming!’—and he never panics.”
Polly S. Stevens, who is taking a course on near-Earth objects through the Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement, said she generally felt comforted by the lecture, but thinks that it’s more guesswork than is let on.
“There’s a big divide between cautious scientists and people saying asteroids are going to bombard us,” Stevens said. “However, [Spahr] didn’t really talk about how different-sized asteroids would affect us.”
Jim Brookshire, whose son studies at MIT and paid for his transportation from Virginia to Cambridge as a birthday present, said the lecture made him feel safer about the possible threat of apocalypse by asteroid.
“I like to think that I help people sleep at night,” Spahr said. “But I don’t reduce the probability of an asteroid hitting, I just tell you that it’s not likely.”

The splash page on the entrance to President Obama’s 2012 election campaign website asks its viewers, “Are you in?” Titled barackobama.com, the online network created by Chris R. Hughes ’06 is a portal through which millions of people have connected with the presidential campaign in 2008 and continue to engage for the upcoming contest in 2012.
Last night, during an event titled “A Conversation with Chris Hughes,” students interested in entrepreneurship and social networking engaged with Hughes at the talk, which was sponsored by the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard and the Quincy House Entrepreneurship Center.
Hughes, also a co-founder of Facebook and a social entrepreneur, discussed his past projects and his new endeavor Jumo, a social networking site that connects individuals with non-profit organizations.
According to Hughes, the word “jumo” comes from a West African language and means “together in concert.”
Jumo’s functions include allowing users to find information about non-profits’ missions, locations, and how to volunteer, Hughes said.
Individuals can also make online donations.
“We want to create a world where it is not possible to say, ‘I care, but I can’t find anything meaningful,’” Hughes said.
A self-described idealist, Hughes said he is committed to empowering hundreds of thousands of people to effect change.
“I saw this as an opportunity to work at a platform that would empower tens of thousands of organizations around the country,” said Joshua Hendler, chief technology officer of Jumo.
During the question and answer period, students inquired about Hughes’ choice to leave Facebook and his work on barackobama.com, but were especially interested in the entrepreneurial aspect of his work.
“It’s hardcore,” Kenny Yu ’14 said. “It’s really hard to have a unique idea and to deal with competitors. It takes a lot of focus.”
Tuan A. Ho ’09, a non-resident entrepreneurship tutor in Quincy House, said that there has been a growing interest in entrepreneurship among Harvard students.
Hughes also encouraged students to become involved in entrepreneurship.
“I think college may be the only moment in American society where you get to live and think and reflect,” he said. “I know it sounds crazy, but it’s extremely valuable for entrepreneurship.”

Harvard Facilities Maintenance Operations, an in-house contractor for building and landscape upkeep, said it plans to continue employing 20 janitors, who are all union members, when it takes over the janitorial contract for the Harvard School of Public Health from ABM Industries.
“FMO has offered all 20 of the affected workers Harvard staff positions, pending a standard personnel review,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an emailed statement.
Service Employees International Union, the union representing University janitorial workers, applauded the FMO’s choice and make good on their promise.
SEIU leaders had been concerned that the FMO would not keep union workers in their current jobs when the contract turned over. The FMO is not a unionized contractor, and thus is not required to follow the mandate that union workers keep their jobs for a certain amount of time after a contract transfer.
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, said that though he was uncertain of the specifics of the FMO transition, he was pleased with this initial decision.
“We are happy they decided to keep those workers employed,” he said. “It was the right move.”
Langley said that a failure to rehire the union workers would ultimately hurt the University.
“If they hired new workers, they would have to train them for what the [fired workers] already knew,” Langley said. “It would be a lose-lose for everybody.”
Langley added that SEIU will remain wary until the FMO implements the contract.
“We just want to make sure the FMO does what it says it will,” Langley said.
SEIU is particularly interested in this case because it believes that the FMO will be taking over many of the other janitorial contracts within the University in the near future, and that this takeover may serve as an example for future contract changes.
“I think the FMO is going to be picking up a lot of contracts in the next couple of years,” Langley said. “This one is pretty important.”
The University did not confirm Langley’s suspicion that the FMO might take over more contracts in the future.
“I am not aware of any other schools that currently plan to make a similar shift,” Galvin wrote.
Galvin added that the University will negotiate the new contract through SEIU.
“Those positions will continue to be covered by the existing contract with SEIU Local 615, with which the University has a well-established relationship,” he wrote.

WOBURN, Mass.—Jabrai Jordan Copney has been found guilty of murdering Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland House in 2009 and has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
On its third day of deliberations at the end of a three-week trial, the jury announced a conviction on a charge of first-degree murder Friday for Copney, 22.
The jury also found Copney guilty of possession of a firearm but not guilty of armed robbery.
“They took their time and they came to the right decision based on the evidence,” said Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85, the senior prosecutor in the case.
Prosecutors said during the trial that Copney, along with Jason Aquino and Blayn Jiggetts—both of whom made plea agreements and have been promised prison sentences of 18 to 20 years and 9 to 12 years, respectively—lured Cosby into the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway with the intent of stealing marijuana from him at gunpoint. Copney shot Cosby, prosecutors said, when the Cambridge resident refused to hand over the drugs to his assailants.
Denise Cosby, the mother of the 21-year-old murder victim, spoke passionately during the sentencing hearing following the verdict.
“Each day I get up, I ache with loneliness and sadness for the loss of my son,” she said.
“I hope you think about what you did to Justin each and every day for the rest of your life, as I do,” she said to Copney. “You’re despicable. You’re the scum of the earth. … May the rest of your life be a continuous hell on earth.”
The victim’s uncle, Gregory Daniel Cosby, echoed a similar sentiment, repeatedly referring to Copney as a “psychopath.”
“Jabrai, I pray that every day when you wake up, Justin will be on your mind. I hope that he will constantly remind you of your evil deeds and why you are spending the rest of your life behind bars,” he said.
Defense attorney John A. Amabile said that his client was “obviously deeply disappointed with the verdict and the fact that he’s now been sentenced to life in prison.”
However, Amabile said that Copney “took it like a man.”
Copney's mother wailed “No” when the murder verdict was announced and sobbed audibly throughout the brief court proceedings until the break before the sentencing.
The jury foreperson said that the jurors had found Copney guilty of felony murder, rather than deliberate premeditated murder. This interpretation applies to a killing which occurred during the commission or intended commission of a felony which is itself punishable by up to life in prison.
Bennett said that the jury must have based the felony murder verdict on the presumption that Copney intended to rob Cosby—one of the key points of contention in this case, since Amabile argued that Copney intended to buy drugs, not steal them.
However, the jury chose not to convict Copney of the armed robbery itself. Bennett attributed this to Amabile’s success in convincing the jury that Copney and his associates may not have succeeded in taking any marijuana from Cosby.
“I think that attorney Amabile did a fantastic job as a defense attorney,” Bennett said. “He cast some doubt on whether that marijuana was picked up.”
After hearing victim impact statements from the Cosby family, presiding judge John T. Lu quickly sentenced Copney to life in prison without parole, the mandatory sentence for a first-degree murder conviction.
Lu noted before the verdict was read that for a first-degree murder conviction, the defendant is entitled to "a full and automatic appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court. This is not the last word, what happens here today."
In addition to the upcoming appeal in Copney’s case and the pending sentencing hearings for Aquino and Jiggetts, former Harvard student Brittany J. Smith may still stand trial for her involvement in the killing.
Smith, Copney’s girlfriend who allegedly hid the gun after the crime and helped the killers flee to New York, has been charged with accessory after the fact of murder and five other counts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the NFL continues to deal with negotiations between owners and the Player’s Union, it calls for a look to the past when the game of football almost ended, forever.
In his latest book, “The Big Scrum: How Teddy Roosevelt Saved Football,” author John J. Miller explains that the movement to ban the sport evolved after   18 football-related deaths in 1905.
But luckily, one man who witnessed his first football game in 1876, came to the rescue of the sport, and revolutionized the way it would be played forever: President Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880. Roosevelt’s experience that day at the second-ever match-up between Harvard and Yale provided him with the belief that the game was good for the nation because it developed character in its players.
Roosevelt, who was President at the time of the rising progressive movement against the sport led by many including Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, brought the coaches of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton together. In this meeting, they made rule changes, such as adding the forward pass, which distinguished the sport from others at the time and helped lead to the creation of the NCAA.
So when Harvard students think and debate about the merits of our sports teams, it is important to remember the Crimson’s long-storied history that predates many generations but continues to make an impact today.

The Harvard softball team (26-14, 10-2 Ivy) took the field yesterday afternoon hoping to earn its fifth consecutive victory as it faced Boston University (24-12, 6-3 America East).
But in the end, it was the Terriers who came out on top at the BU Softball Field, defeating the Crimson, 5-3, and extending their own winning streak to five games.
Early errors hurt Harvard and allowed the host team to jump out on top from the opening pitch.
In the bottom of the first inning, Terrier Erica Casacci reached base on a fielding error by Crimson junior Whitney Shaw. Casacci safely stole second and went on to round the final two bases on passed balls by Harvard freshman catcher Allison Scott.
BU would never trail after Casacci’s first-inning run, as the Crimson would be plagued by similar mistakes throughout the afternoon.
“I think there were a lot of little things that we could have done better,” said junior pitcher Rachel Brown, who allowed an earned run in two innings of relief. “This game was definitely within our reach. We just needed to sharpen up our game.”
The Crimson had put together a complete performance a month ago, when it capitalized on eight hits and held the Terriers to two, coming out on top, 2-1, on the road.
Yesterday, the Crimson once again proved its offensive mettle, coming away with an advantage in hits (6-5).
But the eight runners that Harvard left on base put the Terriers in prime position to earn the non-conference victory.
“Today’s game came down to timely hits,” Brown said. “We outhit them, but our hits just didn’t come at opportune times.”
Crimson coach Jenny Allard felt that the team strayed from the style of play that has earned its current spot in first place in the Ivy League North Division.
“Consistent pitching performances, really strong defense, timely hits, and limiting the opposition has been our formula all year,” Allard said. “We didn’t do enough of that to overcome what they did today.”
After opening the game with a run, BU surged soon after to build up a 5-0 lead. With one out in the third inning, Casacci doubled to left field off of Harvard junior pitcher Mari Zumbro and was driven in by a single by teammate Megan Volpano.
A combination of three Terrier hurlers shut out the Crimson through four innings, and the BU bats went back to work in the bottom of the frame. With two outs and a runner on second base, freshman Jayme Mask stepped to the plate with Casacci looming on deck. Mask doubled down the left field line to bring home junior Kayla Kruper. She was brought home herself by Casacci’s second double of the matchup.
Following the exit of freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone—who took the loss—Harvard cycled through a number of relievers in an attempt to stifle the streaking home squad.
“We used four pitchers today,” Allard said. “They just adjusted to our changes more quickly than we did to theirs.”
In the final innings of the contest, Harvard went on a run and began to cut into the Terrier lead.
In the top of the sixth, junior Whitney Shaw reached base with a single off of BU’s Whitney Tuthill.
Harvard sophomore Jessica Ferri entered the game to pinch run for Shaw and was able to score after hits from classmates Megan Fazio and Olivia Piccione. Junior Jane Alexander kept the offensive streak going, driving in Fazio for the Crimson’s second run of a solid sixth inning.
“We were swinging at better pitches,” Allard said. “We were putting the ball in play and forcing more errors by their defense.”
Harvard’s offensive awakening continued in the top of the seventh inning, as Shaw doubled to bring in freshman Kasey Lange and reduce BU’s lead to two runs. But Tuthill closed the door on Harvard’s potential comeback, striking Fazio out swinging.
Members of the Crimson suggested that they will use yesterday’s defeat as a learning experience for this weekend’s Ivy contests against Yale.
“I think we will take away from today that we need to be on our ‘A’ game all the time,” Brown said. “We need to play like we can play—just good Harvard softball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior water polo co-captain Devan Kennifer started swimming at age three when her older sister Sarah pushed her into the pool—or so she claims.
“I contend that my sister pushed me off a three-meter diving board; she holds that it was totally my choice,” Kennifer recalls.
Her sister denies the allegations.
“I do not remember doing that,” Sarah Kennifer says. “We actually have some family videos of her going up there and jumping on her own.”
But regardless of how she started, it quickly became apparent that the water was where Kennifer belonged. She began her aquatic career as a swimmer before following her older sisters into water polo in the seventh grade.
“We all swam when we were younger,” Kennifer says of her and her sisters. “And after chasing the black line for so long, it was so much more exciting with a ball and a game involved.”
Water polo runs in the Kennifer bloodline—even if it is a first-generation phenomenon. Although neither parent played the sport, all three Kennifer daughters ended up playing collegiate water polo. Sarah ’02 also played for the Crimson, Katherine for Notre Dame until graduating in 2005, and now Devan for Harvard.
“We weren’t that family that was totally directed towards water polo,” Kennifer says. “We don’t have water polo stickers on all of our cars or anything, but it was really cool that we could play together on club teams and stuff. I remember a couple years ago my sister [Sarah] was playing with some club, and I got to hop in and play, which was great.”
The memory of the sister act sticks out for Sarah as well.
“We were on the same team, which was good, because I would never want to play against Devan,” Sarah recalls. “It was co-ed, and Devan was scoring and stealing it from guys that were probably twice her size and had five times the ego.”
Kennifer’s aggression in the water has led her to success with the Crimson as well. As of April 10—the last time team statistics were updated—she was leading the team on the scoreboard with 61 goals. Last year she also had a team-best 67 scores on the season, earning her a spot on the All-Northern Division first team and the Eastern Championship All-Tournament second team.
This year, Kennifer has helped lead the team to a 16-13 overall record and 3-4 conference mark while facing a schedule that has set Harvard against several top-ranked teams.
“Our team’s really learned to battle against schools that no one thought we could even be in there with,” Kennifer says.
The team hopes these big games will give the team an edge as they travel Bloomington, Indiana, for the Eastern Championships on April 29, and after that to the NCAA Championships—if it qualifies.
Her success has been closely tracked by her family, especially her sisters, who make it a point to interrogate her after her games.
“We always have to drag game details out of her,” Sarah said. “We ask how she did, and she sometimes claims she doesn’t even remember—she just remembers winning.”
“She’ll tell you if her team won or lost and how they played as a whole,” Katherine adds in an email. “But if you ask her how many goals she scored, she honestly doesn’t know.”
Kennifer’s success in life has by no means been limited to the pool.
“We shared a room growing up,” Katherine recalls. “And I remember she would be asleep within 10 seconds of her head hitting the pillow because she had been literally running around all day.  She still does 15 things before I even wake up.”
Here at Harvard, the premed neurobiology concentrator is going after an astrophysics secondary and a Spanish citation. Aside from her ambitious academic course load, she is also co-chair of the Eliot House House Committee, along with her roommate Victoria Migdal.
“She really wants to do what’s best for the house and the community,” Migdal says. “She interacts with everyone and the house ... She’s a great person to be around; she exudes a lot of energy ... and it’s infectious if you’re around her.”
“Ever since I can remember, she has been very comfortable in her own skin, projecting a great sense of humor that makes people flock to her,” Katherine agrees.
And even with all this, Devan seems to be ready to take on even more.
“I love Harvard so much, the optimal thing for me would be for me to graduate next year into the freshman class and do it all over,” she says. “Just because there’s so much to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s and men’s golf teams are looking to upset the rest of the Ancient Eight in an Ivy League Championship after having their best finishes of the season last weekend in their respective tournaments. This series is bound to be full of chips, drives, and putts in poor conditions.
The women are looking to win their first women’s golf Ivy League championship in four years, while the men are looking to win their very first Ivy League title since 1974.
The women’s tournament will take place at the Atlantic City Country Club. Meanwhile the men’s team is set to face off on the fairways of Galloway National Golf Club in Galloway, New Jersey on April 22 for their first round of play.
“We’re just going to go into this weekend with the same mentality that we had when we played in our last tournament,” freshman Bonnie Hu said. “Even though the weather isn’t looking so great this weekend, we’re just going to focus on the aspects of our game that we can control.”
“As a team we are confident going into this weekend but understand we have to manage our games wisely to be able to capitalize on opportunities because this course is the hardest we will be playing on this year,” freshman Seiji Liu said.
After facing rivals Yale and Princeton last weekend, the Crimson hopes to ride its first-place finish in the Century Intercollegiate into this coming weekend.
Harvard was faced with cold temperatures and strong winds in the Century and is expected to face similar conditions this weekend.
Rain and wind are set to be a factor on all three days of the series. After playing well in poor conditions on Saturday, the Crimson may have the edge it needs to pull out a victory over the top-ranked Bulldogs according to the current Golfstat rankings.
“We as a team have historically played well in poor conditions and feel it reflects on keeping a strong mindset and fighting out the rounds until the end,” Liu said.
Yale is atop the leader board as a team, but Columbia is looking to win its fourth consecutive Ivy League Championship this week.
The feat has only been accomplished one other time. The Tigers won four consecutive Ivy League championships from 1979 to 1982.
This weekend is also important in continuing Harvard’s season with the possibility of a NCAA tournament bid on the line for the victor.
While the golfers are competing for a team championship, they are also vying for individual honors, which are solely based upon this weekends result. The top-five finishers will automatically be placed on the All-Ivy team and the next five will be named to the All-Ivy second team.
The women’s team is in a comparable situation in looking to garner momentum going into this weekend.
After its second place finish last weekend at the Brown Bear Invitational, the Crimson is looking to finish strong in the 15th Ivy League Championship series.
“We’re all really excited about going into Ivy’s because of all the work we put in prior to this weekend and throughout the season,” Hu said.
Harvard has already faced all of this weekend’s competition. If last weekend was an indicator of what is to happen this weekend, things are looking up for the Crimson. The team finished second behind Princeton, who is also atop the Ivy League in women’s golf.
“The second place last weekend definitely helps because it shows us that we’re definitely capable of shooting low scores and competing successfully against the other ivy leagues,” Hu said.
Captain Mia Kabasakalis and Hu were among the top finishers in last weekend’s contest, with Kabasakalis taking fifth and Hu seventh. Hu finished the season ranked seventh in the individual Ivy League rankings.
Harvard has already received a bid for the NCAA regional tournament due to play earlier in the season but is looking to return to the top of the league after a title eluded it last year.
The Crimson won the league title in  2008 and 2009 and went undefeated in regular-season spring play. But Harvard fell to Penn and Yale at Baltusrol Golf Club. The men’s team finished fifth last year at Baltusrol after leading the league after the first round.
