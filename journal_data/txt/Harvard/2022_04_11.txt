After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something so distinct about the days where simply nothing is going right. It always starts with some initiating event that completely knocks us off our intended course. Every minor inconvenience encountered afterward builds the foundation for our frustration, leaving us to helplessly cope with the mess that has been left behind. Our attitudes, moods, and perspectives shift drastically. We complain, make excuses, and find someone or something to blame for our misery. Ultimately, we halfheartedly convince ourselves that all will be fine tomorrow, failing to resolve and reflect on our disappointment.
It amazes me how normalized this pattern of behavior is — I struggle with these tendencies myself, even unconsciously. After a disappointing grade on an exam, my brain automatically attempts to internalize how this poor result could be justified. Did I not get enough sleep to maximize my ability to focus while taking the test? Should I have slept one less hour and instead reviewed that cell transport lecture just one more time?
Or the question of imposter syndrome that is quite customary at Harvard: Am I just dumb?
Whenever confronted by a tough situation, I have to deliberately remind myself that none of these thoughts are rational. The truth is that I worked as hard as I possibly could — I went to office hours with questions on exam content, I created a review guide with concepts I was struggling with, and I maximized the educational resources available to me.
It is hard to admit, but sometimes, things just go wrong.
And while it stings at the moment, the long-lasting consequences of these difficult days are indispensable to our success in the future. We need the bad days to have the good ones. If our lives effortlessly effused perfection and flawlessness, we would never reflect and redirect ourselves in a meaningful way. Our lives would transform from their intended dynamic and ever-evolving nature to being monotonous and mind-numbing.
On my first Life Sciences 50 midterm of the fall semester, I scored short of the benchmark I had set for myself. I have always been an individual with high expectations for what I hope to accomplish: missing my goal disheartened me.
Without that discouraging midterm grade, however, I would not have adjusted my vision of what I wanted from my Harvard education in the way that did. In high school, I attributed high grades to success and to some degree, my self-worth. Over the course of my college experience so far, however, this notion has faded away. The numbers on my grading portal mean little if I am not reaping genuine appreciation and interest from the content I am learning. While the grades that will appear on my transcript upon graduation will carry the weight of my hard work throughout my time at Harvard, they will not define my academic journey at this University.
In the same vein, the time we spend complaining about trivial matters all becomes absurd when we consider everything we are so lucky to have — the good days that go overlooked.
Upon returning home to upstate New York during winter break, I reconnected with a few hometown friends and we all collectively shared our college experiences with one another. It amazed me that after just 30 minutes, we had all resorted to vocalizing what we disliked about our respective universities.
Every single one of us involved in that dialogue was incredibly privileged. We all attend private universities, thanks to financial aid and support from our parents. We have tremendous access to educational resources beyond measure — to this day, I am still stunned by the vast breadth of knowledge within reach in the world of higher education. We are lucky to have all three meals of the day at our disposal by virtue of unlimited meal plans and dining options just minutes away from our dorms. We should recognize the privilege of even having dorms to live in; many students across the globe elect to commute or take online classes simply because they cannot afford on-campus housing.
So why do we complain in the first place? And why do we let defeats bog us down?
After something unpleasant happens, we cannot stop pushing forward. It is time to chase down our next goal and set new directions for the future. This is our chance to reckon with all the talents, opportunities, and advantages we currently have. Recall that there have been good days in the past. Even if there are a slew of bad ones, the power rests in our hands to turn that trajectory back around.
Most importantly, you are not alone in coping with disappointment. Opening up to my classmates, mentors, and professors about my Harvard journey has made it clear that everyone is confronting battles of their own. We should draw on this universal experience and embolden one another to see the path forward.
So, when it all seems to go wrong, take a moment to pause. Remember who is rooting for you. Remember all of the people who inspired, energized, and motivated you to reach where you are now. Remember that they are humans too — people who make mistakes, engage in self-reflection, and move onwards.
Be there for your loved ones during their difficult times, and accordingly, be there for yourself. The good days are on their way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After decades of criticism for the lack of ethnic studies department, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will soon count University of California, Berkeley Professor Taeku Lee as the first scholar in a promised cluster hire of ethnic studies professors. We welcome Lee’s excellent and important scholarship as a valuable addition to the University, and we hope that his arrival signals not just the realization of a cluster hire but the roots of an eventual department of ethnic studies.
Currently, a Professor of Political Science and Law, Lee’s work covers themes of racial and ethnic politics in democracies. His work provides nuanced engagement with intellectually and practically important questions. How do ethnic politics and identity formation influence the way we view the world? How do they influence which facts we accept, and how in turn does that impact democracy in the U.S. and abroad?
These are issues that are deeply relevant to our education and to our future roles as citizens of a democracy. They are issues that point to Lee’s unique personal value as a scholar, which should not be overshadowed by the broader significance of his appointment. But these issues also point to the significance of ethnic studies as a field of study.
We sit at a point in history where Americans struggle to agree on the most basic facts; that instability ripples up through any movement, policy, or ideology which might aspire to claim basic facts as its now-fractured foundation.
Only the severest ideologue could pretend that race and identity are not, in practice, significant drivers of the adoption of beliefs. This is true across demographic groups: white Americans, as much as people of color, have an ethnic identity that affects their worldview. Building expertise in ethnic studies allows us to study the role and nature of identity formation in a fuller way and across broader diversity of identities.
Beliefs in the universality and centrality of white experience pervade so much of American history, and the effects persist. Inevitably, these currents affected the development of history, government, and social studies. It is impossible to understand our country without understanding how racialized people interact with the world around them, and the histories of the fields represented at Harvard render them necessary but not sufficient for that goal.
To fill the blindspots of more established fields and correct their implicit assumptions, we need an ethnic studies department. To give people of color the tools for understanding their own oppression and historical situation, we need an ethnic studies department.
This “cluster” hire is an excellent first step. The work is being done — qualified individuals are being hired and the menu of relevant undergraduate classes will continue to expand. Ultimately, though, we struggle to understand the desire to stop at a cluster. What is a department, after all, but a cluster of faculty who have been more explicitly given the tools and institutions they need to drive their field forward?
The hiring of Taeku Lee and the promise of more ethnic studies professors to come marks an important first step in the long-needed expansion of the studies of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration at the college. We hope the University makes its future hires with an eye toward its own junior faculty too often overlooked, and we cannot wait to see what all these talented individuals bring to our community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair affirmed her office’s support for the newly-ratified Harvard Undergraduate Association in an interview Wednesday — one week after students voted overwhelmingly to dissolve the 40-year-old Undergraduate Council in favor of the new student government.
“We fully support the will of the students and will support the new organization and their goals,” O’Dair said. “What we’re focusing on is how we move forward to help them build a new, productive organization that represents student voice.”
Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason Meier said he and Assistant Dean Kate T. Colleran offered advice to the Citizens’ Assembly — a randomly-selected group of undergraduates who drafted the HUA constitution — during their deliberation process, but left final decisions to the students.
“Ultimately, those decisions are their own, and I think that we like to think of ourselves as in partnership,” he said. “Dean Colleran and myself will continue to be in strong partnership with the co-presidents and all of the projects that come out of the new committees within the HUA.”
“That support, I think, will only continue to grow as the HUA takes shape in the next few months,” Meier added.
After fulfilling his signature campaign promise to dissolve and replace the UC, Michael Y. Cheng ’22 resigned as president of the body on Tuesday, leaving the transition to the HUA in the hands of his former vice president, Emmett E. de Kanter ’24.
Following ratification of the HUA constitution, students expressed concerns that club funding — a staple UC function — would fall to the wayside during the transition. Meier said the DSO will work with de Kanter and his new vice president, Christopher T. Cantwell ’22-’23, to ensure the continuity of club funding.
“Emmett and the new vice president Chris are very much committed to honoring what is being requested for club funding,” he said. “We’re just here to continue to support them in wrapping up this chapter of the UC.”
Over the summer, the DSO will advise the HUA’s new Finance Committee, which will be responsible for ensuring the fair distribution of club funding in future semesters, Meier added.
“Following the election of new leadership, we're going to have to figure out what these new financial policies and procedures look like so that they are in alignment with best practice and how to effectively do this for all of our student organization community,” Meier said.
Meier also confirmed the UC will carry out its summer storage program before the HUA takes over at the end of the spring semester.
“The UC is continuing to do their own work in helping create storage opportunities, and this work was in place before the vote on the HUA occurred,” Meier said. “We fully expect the UC to carry this through as one of their final full projects before the end of the year.”
Before the pandemic, select upperclassman houses also offered space for students to store their belongings during the summer months. Associate Dean of Students Lauren Brandt said this free on-campus storage “was not the norm for students.”
“What has happened is that transition has also been conflated with the pandemic in a way that is probably not entirely true to what was happening,” Brandt said. “Many of the houses have taken those spaces and turned them into programmatic spaces for their community, and therefore it's not appropriate to use them for summer storage anymore.”
“We've also set up supports with Collegeboxes, which is a discounted service that students can take advantage of to store their items,” she added. “There are existing supports in place, just different from what was previously offered.”
Correction: April 11, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Jason Meier’s title. He is the College's Associate Dean for Student Engagement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a year after Harvard’s contract with its police union expired, the two sides are set to enter federal mediation in their negotiations over a new contract.
Harvard police officers have been working without a contract since December 2020, when the school’s contract with the Harvard University Police Association expired. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed last week the two sides will begin meeting with a mediator, with the first session scheduled for April 27.
Martin Callaghan, a commissioner at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, will mediate the discussions.
The president of the Harvard University Police Association, Michael A. Arsenault, declined to comment.
Callaghan wrote in an email that he will meet privately with both sides in addition to joint mediation sessions, though he said all discussions “are totally confidential.”
“I may offer procedural or substantive recommendations, explore alternatives, engage in shuttle diplomacy, information-sharing where appropriate, and rephrasing proposals so that both sides fully comprehend each other’s position,” Callaghan wrote.
In the interim between contracts, most of the previous agreement’s terms have remained in effect.
As special Massachusetts State Police officers, HUPD officers are prohibited by law from going on strike or halting labor.
In December 2020, the HUPA and University met in arbitration to discuss a work schedule change that the union alleged violated its contract with the school. The University had notified HUPA the previous May that it would increase the number of consecutive days that officers work due to financial strain caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The negotiations will determine the first new collective bargaining agreement under HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay, who took over the department last July. It also marks the first contract negotiations for Arsenault and new HUPA leadership.
“While FMCS mediators bring their experience and specific skill set to the process, I have no power to impose an agreement,” Callaghan wrote. “The parties determine their own outcomes and solutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow on Friday pledged to listen to feedback on a set of proposed changes to University-wide harassment policies, adding that he hopes the procedures will be approved by the school’s top governing board.
The proposed policy changes — produced by a set of working groups first convened last January — include the first University-wide non-discrimination and anti-bullying procedures, as well as an updated definition of consent that would require “active, mutual agreement.”
Before they can be implemented, the policies will be open to feedback from Harvard affiliates through September. Once the comment period closes, the deans of Harvard’s 12 schools will convene to edit the policies before recommending finalized versions to the Harvard Corporation — the school’s highest governing body.
Bacow declined to say what he expects from the comment period.
“I make a point of waiting to listen to see what comes back from the community, and try and not prejudge things,” he said. “I don’t think that’s productive. If you’re sincere about wanting comment from the community, you have to be prepared to listen.”
Bacow said he does not think the Corporation will conduct a separate review of the policies after receiving a recommendation from the deans.
“People will bring different perspectives to it,” Bacow said of the 13-member Corporation. “I’m sure that they’ll ask a number of questions, but I would hope that by the time we have taken a recommendation to the Corporation, that the Corporation will feel comfortable that we’ve anticipated any significant issues — but you never know.”
Bacow said he hopes a broad consensus over the policies will emerge before they are presented to the Corporation.
“It’s not just those who might engage most actively around that particular issue that need to be heard,” Bacow said. “Part of our responsibility is to make sure that we’ve thought about some things that perhaps others haven’t.”
The draft policies mark the latest in the University’s efforts to improve its institutional culture. An external review released in January 2021 said a “permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” at Harvard enabled a prominent Government professor to sexually harass female students and colleagues over 30 years. The report recommended that Harvard create a centralized personnel database and standardized vetting procedures.
Bacow said last year the University is working to form a centralized system to access personnel records — but no changes have been announced. Still, he said Friday he was “comfortable” with Harvard’s progress.
“We are still in the process of finalizing things,” Bacow said. “This is a tremendously decentralized place, and so we’ve had to deal with a variety of practices that exist in different schools. But I’m comfortable with where we’re at in terms of moving that towards a consistent set of processes and policies across the University.”
Bacow declined to provide a timeline for the completion of the centralized vetting system, noting that many University initiatives have been delayed by Covid-19.
“Hard to say exactly, but people are working hard on it,” Bacow said of the University’s progress toward creating a centralized system. “As I said, I’m comfortable with where we’re at. It’s not as if it’s being ignored — far from it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview last week the FAS has been hosting informational sessions about upcoming changes to the tenure review process for tenure-track faculty.
Last month, Gay sent a plan to faculty outlining how the FAS will implement recommendations of a report published in October by a committee that examined Harvard’s tenure review procedures.
The changes outlined in the plan are directed at improving communication and feedback between candidates, deans, and review committees, offering more guidance for tenure-track faculty, and spurring more participation from tenured faculty. Most changes will go into effect on July 1.
Gay said Wednesday the FAS Office for Faculty Affairs has gathered tenure-track faculty by division to discuss implementation of changes to the tenure process and address any questions.
The FAS hosted an information session for “demystifying” the role of the Committee on Appointments and Promotions in the tenure review process, according to Gay.
“So far, the response has been very positive,” she said. “I think everyone who’s had the opportunity to review the report that was generated by the Tenure Track Review Committee has come away deeply impressed, and, honestly, in some ways, even inspired by the opportunities there are for strengthening our practices and procedures.”
She added there will be informational sessions targeted at tenured faculty and departmental administrators in the coming months.
Gay also said Wednesday the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage has put together a search advisory committee to support the search for a curator.
The task force was originally launched in September 2020, charged with developing guidelines to evolve the visual culture and imagery of the FAS. In a final report issued last year, the task force recommended updating portraits in Annenberg Hall and expanding Harvard’s tour program using digital content.
The search advisory committee will be chaired by Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey. It will include faculty and other administrators, including the curator of the Harvard Art Museum.
“The hope is that before the semester is over, we’ll have at least launched the search, which means posting the job description and getting all of the outreach so that we can build a really strong diverse pool of candidates,” she said.
Gay said she anticipates the search will take several months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students filled Tercentenary Theatre on Sunday to party and dance to rapper Swae Lee, who headlined Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor spring concert, held in-person for the first time in three years.
Yardfest was canceled due to Covid-19 in 2020 and held virtually in 2021 before making its return to Harvard Yard on Sunday with pre-parties, drinking games, and a handful of ambulance transports.
The concert, hosted by the Harvard College Events Board, featured Dutch DJ Sam Feldt — the mystery “celebrity opener” advertised in Yardfest promotional materials — and two acts from student performers, in addition to rapper Swae Lee.
“I wasn’t expecting it to be this lit, but they definitely put on a good show,” Ali K. Dabaja ’24 said after the performance.
Swae Lee took the stage as students chanted his name, opening with the song “No Type” by Rae Sremmurd — a hip-hop duo featuring Swae Lee and his brother, Slim Jxmmi. His set included some of the pair’s most popular songs, including “Black Beatles” with Gucci Mane, “Come Get Her,” and “This Could Be Us.”
“I’m your guys’ professor — teaching a course on getting lit,” Swae Lee told the Harvard Yard crowd in between songs.
Swae Lee performed several his own songs, including “Sativa” with Jhené Aiko, “Unforgettable” with French Montana, and “Sunflower” with Post Malone.
“I’m the new king on campus,” he told students.
Sam Feldt took the stage in the late afternoon, playing remixed renditions of popular songs, including “Something Just Like This” by Coldplay and The Chainsmokers, Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now,” and David Guetta’s “Titanium,” featuring Sia. Feldt closed out his act with his latest single, “Follow Me,” with Rita Ora.
Acts performed by the student bands Charles Revival and Yard Bops kicked off the concert just after 4:30 p.m. The two groups won the “Battle for Yardfest” competition held at Sanders Theatre last month.
Isha Agarwal ’24, director of the College Events Board’s Arts and Entertainment Committee, said students were excited to feel part of “this big Harvard tradition.”
“A lot of people were definitely really excited to come back to Yardfest, especially two years off and doing virtual shows,” Agarwal said.
The College limited Yardfest to Harvard ID holders and prohibited re-entry into the event, restrictions that were consistent with the last in-person Yardfest held in 2019. CrimsonEMS, Securitas, and the Harvard University Police Department were present around the Yard.
Throughout the event, students enjoyed a barbeque dinner in the Yard as well as games such as Jenga and cornhole.
Prior to the concert, students celebrated at “block parties” held by undergraduate houses. The parties included obstacle courses, bouncy houses, and carnival fare.
At the River Central block party in Lowell House’s courtyard, Michael Y. Zhao ’25 described the party as “amazing.”
“We have people coming in from all sorts of different houses, different neighborhoods, you got first-years — everyone from all classes coming together,” Zhao said.
Yousuf “Amiel” Bakshi ’23, co-chair of Mather’s House Committee, said he was “really happy and really excited” about the River East block party turnout.
“A lot of this was just trying things out and seeing basically what can work, what doesn’t work, because there’s no institutional memory anymore,” Bakshi said. “But it seems like everything has been a success so far, and people are enjoying themselves.”
David S. Aley ’23-’24, a Crimson Sports editor who was attending his first Yardfest, said it was “great to see Harvard coming together” at the event.
“This is a weekend that has been three years in the making, and it’s great to see Harvard traditions coming back to life,” he said.

Spring has arrived in Boston! For almost all of us, this is the first time we can explore t he city during this season because let’s be honest, we have been postponing outings for years. Here are Flyby’s fun suggestions to escape the Harvard bubble.
Lunch on the Boston Common
With the sun shining brighter and the temperatures getting warmer, why not have a picnic in the oldest city park in the United States? You can bring your own food or purchase from one of the many food stands in the park. With the beautiful Massachusetts State House building shining in the background and families with children strolling around, you’re bound to feel relaxed and re-energized to get through these last few weeks of the semester.
Attend an Outdoor Concert
Now that you can stand outside for more than ten minutes without freezing your tail off, enjoy some live music at an outdoor concert. From the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra to a Coffeehouse Concert with Thea Hopkins, this wide variety of options means that you can probably find at least one event that floats your boat. Many of these performances are free, and others start as low as $5.
Take Me Out to the Ball Game
In Boston, April means the start of the Red Sox season. Grab a buddy or two and spend some quality time together at one of the most iconic landmarks of the city. Even if you couldn’t explain how baseball works if your life depended on it (do they score touchdowns?), at least this is an opportunity to look #cuteandsporty in a red jersey.
Shop around Faneuil Hall Marketplace
With a plethora of food options inside Quincy Market, street performers outside, and souvenir vendors along the perimeter, Faneuil Hall Marketplace is a calming place to spend a clear spring day. It is ideal for both hanging out with a friend or people-watching by yourself. The marketplace is also within walking distance from other iconic locations such as the New England Aquarium, Paul Revere House, and Old State House.
Harborwalk
Explore the beautiful Seaport District by walking along the gorgeous Boston Harborwalk. Since the trail is 43-miles long, you could even walk to the John F. Kennedy Museum and Southern Dorchester. Don’t forget to bring a jacket in case it gets colder!
Make the most of the remaining few weeks and get to know the iconic city of Boston. It’s the second to last month of the school year, so it’s about time that you leave the bubble!

Yardfest featured star rapper Swae Lee, DJ Sam Feldt, and student performers who opened the concert. Swae Lee took the stage just after 7 p.m., igniting the crowd with hit songs and on-stage banter.
Swae Lee told the crowd of students at Yardfest that he was their “professor,” since he was “teaching a course on getting lit.”
Hundreds of students took a break from their studies to enjoy the outdoor concert, waving their hands as they danced the day away. It was most students' first time experiencing Yardfest.
Anoushka Chander ’25 — a vocalist for the student band Charles Revival — sang to the crowd in an opening set. Charles Revival and Yard Bops kicked off the concert just after 4:30 p.m. after the two groups won the “Battle for Yardfest” competition last month.
A student sat on his friend’s shoulders to show his love for performers with a hand heart.
After taking the stage around 7 p.m. Swae Lee bantered with students in the crowd about college life and performed hits like “Black Beatles” and “Come Get Her.” Midway through, he crowned himself “the new king on campus.”
Toussaint J. Miller ’25 — a member of Charles Revival — riffed on the trumpet at the start of the student sets around 4:30 p.m.
DJ Sam Feldt played pop remixes.
