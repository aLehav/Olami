After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Khalid can’t buy a beer. He can’t rent a car. In Boston, he can’t even buy a pack of cigarettes. There are a lot of things the 20-year old R&B artist cannot do, but his Sunday evening set at Boston Calling proved that he definitely can, in the words of his “Homemade Dynamite - REMIX” partner Lorde, “murder a stage.” The Red Stage, to be exact, where Khalid did not enter so much as ascend to place, rising from out of sight to a perch high above the cheering mass of people before him. The audience’s voices drowned out the first line of “8TEEN,” but he smiled and kept singing as retro, neon graphics from the video game “Dance Dance Revolution” lit up the stage behind him. Khalid is far from a one-trick pony and yet, for all his versatility, nothing topped his most upbeat numbers. It was clearest in those moments that Khalid, his grin a permanent fixture upon his face, was having the time of his life on that stage.
After “8TEEN,” Khalid moved into “Winter,” barely able to contain his excitement as he jumped up and down to the pre-chorus lines “I'm back to life in my lonely / City of El Paso.” On “Paso” he broke—the city name lost in a laugh—and lunged into the chorus without a care, before descending from his platform to the main part of the stage, joining his dancers in a vibrant, ‘80s style performance of hit single “American Teen.” The word “hit” loses its significance with an artist like Khalid, who became so popular so quickly that the opening to each and every song provoked frenzy from the audience upon recognition. They weren’t always easy to figure out from the get-go—the live band gave a jagged feel to Khalid’s smooth vocals and style, amping up the drum kit and electric guitar—but the music festival’s crowd chimed in on every line.
“This song is some sad shit, is that alright?” asked Khalid to expected screams of approval. The song that followed was “Coaster,” a track about how hard it is to move on from the end of a relationship. The lines “Moving on seems harder to do / When the one that you love moves faster than you” show how he embraces the trials of post-millennial youth, in all its sadness and loneliness, just as passionately as he does the tropes. He then explored desperation and longing in the song “Another Sad Love Song” and paused. “Hey, so this next song is super fucking special to me cause it’s the first song I ever wrote,” he said, telling all the dreamers in the crowd to follow them before taking a seat to perform the song “Saved.” The image of an iPhone loomed over him, typing and deleting messages to send after an unanswered “Hey” as he sang “So I'll keep your number saved / 'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you.”
For many, these melancholy tunes are the bread-and-butter of Khalid’s music, and why wouldn’t they be? They’re enthralling. Khalid may be young, but his lyrics—he has songwriting credits for every track on his album “American Teen”—are palpably genuine, even insightful. Just as he wrapped up the heavenly vocals of “Angels,” he switched gears completely and jumped into what is arguably his most popular song: “Young Dumb & Broke.” In an instant, swaying bodies turned to bopping heads as each and every person in the crowd jammed out to the ubiquitous single. Faced with the choice of opening or closing with it, or throwing the song somewhere in the middle, Khalid did none of the three. Instead, he placed it carefully at the end of his row of softer songs, the perfect piece to bring up the mood.
He kept the energy up with instrumentally tricked-out solo versions of tracks with Fifth Harmony member Normani (“Love Lies”) and Calvin Harris (“Rollin”). Khalid’s chorus on the latter is the perfect example of what makes his upbeat numbers so special. He crooned “I've been rollin' on the freeway / I've been riding 85 / I've been thinking way too much - And I'm way too gone to drive,” as cheery and happy-to-be-there at the end of his set as he was at the beginning. As lovely as his slower tracks are, his livelier tunes are more than that—they are infectious. From the dancing to the neon displays to the band, Khalid exudes so much joy it is impossible not to dance or sing or do something just to capture a little piece of it. It is something for which Khalid should be very, very proud—even if he can’t buy a drink to celebrate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well before he took the stage, it was clear that Eminem’s headlining performance was going to be a spectacle. As one of the best-selling artists of all time, he has both the money and the clout to put on a show for the ages, and it seemed that many of those attending the last night of Boston Calling 2018 expected him to do just that. Despite the Detroit rapper’s fame and talent, however, by the end of the show, the non-musical had partially upstaged him. In the end, Eminem seemed small compared to the excess with which he had surrounded himself.
All Sunday long, fans displaying every conceivable kind of Eminem merch were present, milling around Harvard’s Athletic Complex just waiting for him to start his set. Dozens of people in Eminem hoodies and other branded gear were in the audience—some likely there only to secure a good spot for his performance—during Thundercat’s show, which was on the same stage four hours before the rapper was scheduled to appear.
This tactic proved necessary, as by the time Eminem actually performed, the crowd had exploded, dwarfing those for every other artist at the festival. Furthermore, at other shows, only the most committed fans could be found dancing and singing along to every song near the front of the stage. Even at the back of Eminem’s audience, however, one was still likely to be surrounded by those very invested in his performance.
Eminem was in fine form, blowing through the almost 30 songs in his set, including covers of Dr. Dre and Drake. His staccato flow and lyrical prowess kept the crowd enthralled as he and longtime associate Royce da 5’9” performed tracks from “The Slim Shady LP,” the 1999 album that made him famous, all the way through last year’s “Revival.” Royce and Eminem have previously released music as Bad Meets Evil, and tonight they performed “Fast Lane,” the lead single off of their 2011 collaboration “Hell: The Sequel.” With the exception of a few songs like “Stan” and “Lose Yourself,” the music was hardly the most memorable part of the evening—so much else was happening onstage, namely a mass of inessential elements that unnecessarily distracted from the show.
Royce wasn’t the only person to join Eminem on stage: Skylar Grey, the singer-songwriter who co-wrote “Love the Way You Lie,” Eminem’s hit collaboration with Rihanna, joined them for “Walk on Water” and “Stan,” to replace Beyoncé and Dido, respectively. Even without Grey or Royce, Eminem would have had a full stage, as he was flanked by two drummers with full kits. Between them sat roughly a dozen musicians with string instruments, and on all sides, various DJs, keyboardists, guitarists, and others stood in the shadows.
Behind this crowd of people onstage hung a massive screen, depicting an industrial landscape and a factory in the foreground, with screens on two towers on either side, adding depth to the animation. Throughout the course of the show, the factory and its surroundings changed, as the factory was gradually destroyed, overgrown, and turned into snow-covered ruins. During Eminem’s performance of “The Monster,” King Kong appears briefly before realizing the  building he hoped to climb was destroyed before he got there. The shifting backdrop constantly drew the eye away from the actual performance, with the sole purpose of following the story it depicted. To go with the Rust Belt aesthetic, a massive tower stood center stage, an anvil inscribed with Detroit’s 313 area code hanging from its top.
Amidst all this, Eminem and Royce kept their audience entertained with plenty of banter and crowd work. Most notably, he referenced the rumored romance between he and fellow rapper Nicki Minaj. Minaj had dismissed the possibility, saying her claim on Instagram that they were dating was joke, and Eminem may well have be teasing the audience when he said, “Shout out to my bae Nicki Minaj.” Moments later, however, he seemed more sincere when he asked, “Boston, how many of you want me to date Nicki Minaj?” When the audience responded with roars, he replied, “Well, goddamn it, me too,” then told Minaj to text him later. Later, in response to the shockingly graphic lyrics in “Fast Lane” about his desire to sleep with her, the audience laughed and cheered. More than almost any individual song, Eminem’s shout out to Minaj got the largest crowd response of the evening.
With so much stimulation already onstage, fans needn’t have bothered downloading Eminem’s augmented-reality app, “Eminem Augmented,” and indeed it appeared that few had—with good reason: They were hardly missing out. Among other features, the app is supposed to add effects to specific songs at live performances, and prompt for users to use specific features of the app  flashed on screens tonight. The app, sadly, was glitchy, consistently misplacing where the stage was meant to be, and on a tiny phone screen in the midst of a jostling crowd, the effect of a robot (a giant version of Eminem himself) or any of the other animations, was lost. Instead, the app essentially forced those who wished to use it to watch their phones, instead of the performance.
As the show moved towards a close, the effects got bigger. At one point, bursts of flame shot out of the back of the stage, and one couldn’t help but spare a thought for the poor, cellist who had worked hard only to end up trapped between a jet of fire and tens of thousands of rabid Eminem fans. For an encore, Eminem played his iconic track “Lose Yourself,” from the 2002 film “8 Mile,” in which he starred. As he rapped, the ruined factory was replaced with a beautiful, revitalized cityscape, likely that of Detroit, symbolizing hope for a reversal of urban decay. At the end, fireworks erupted from the top of the stage, filling the area with smoke, and, with a bang, Eminem departed.
All of these extraneous touches—the set, the effects, the app, the personal drama—were entertaining, to be sure, but they distracted from the core of the show: the music. The stage seemed like a monument to Eminem’s success, but monuments are generally built after one’s death. After last year’s lackluster  “Revival,” perhaps Eminem should be focusing on going back to the basics, instead of wasting his efforts on these nice, but far from crucial, pieces. His performance was, to be fair, excellent, his energy consistently high, but his show was so overstuffed it barely registered. In the end, Eminem the man seemed dwarfed by the edifice he had built around himself.
