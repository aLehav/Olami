After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday night, Nigerian American writer Tope Folarin gave a talk at the Harvard Book Store about his award-winning short story “Miracle.” Harvard holds a special place in Folarin’s heart—“Miracle” was first published in the 109th issue of Transition, a publication of Harvard’s Hutchins Center that addresses diaspora and other racial issues. A year after its initial publication, “Miracle” won the 2013 Caine Prize for African Writing, an award given annually for a short story by an African writer. Dressed in a crimson-colored sweater, light-washed blue jeans, and a pair of black-rimmed rectangular glasses, however, Folarin seemed more like an eager student. “I’m a literary hustler,” he said to the audience. This unassuming and earnest quality yielded Folarin, a graduate of Morehouse College who also studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, a powerful sincerity as he discussed “Miracle” and his own personal story.
Folarin, a former employee of Google’s Public Policy team, began by reading the opening of “Miracle.” The excerpt delved into the delicate balance between faith and identity for an African immigrant family. They are desperate for a miracle, whether from jobs, good grades, green cards, or American passports, and they have come to a renowned pastor for help. Folarin’s rich voice was sincere and poignant, as if he himself was a character in the story. Folarin ended the reading as the protagonist begins to question the pastor’s ability to grant a miracle: “We haven’t yet received what we came here for.”
The doubt at the end of the reading served as a perfect segue to Folarin’s personal struggles with Christianity as a child of an immigrant family. Labelling “Miracle” a spiritual autobiography, he went onto discuss his evolving relationship with Christianity ever since he grew up under an extremely religious father. “My father was so religious that when we were in Utah, he was scared that we were being corrupted. He cut us off from society,” Folarin said. When he left for college, Folarin said, he ran into a massive crisis of faith. He realized that his father was Christian because of his upbringing, which had been largely shaped by British colonization. Christianity, Folarin said, was essentially a worldview that had been forced upon him.
At the same time, Folarin spoke about how Christianity was, in his view, a sociopolitical entity. “What [immigrant families] are asserting is that they are the chosen people—that they’re more righteous than the corrupt Americans around them, that they’re doing Christianity better than white people,” Folarin said. “Every group of disenfranchised people can assume that they’re [the chosen people] and derive power.” Folarin’s crises was only resolved when he realized that faith had to be earned, not inherited.
After a thorough discussion of his struggles with faith and identity, Folarin opened up the talk to questions from the audience. Many of the questions addressed his identity as an African writer, to which Folarin responded with a personal anecdote of memorizing 2Pac and wearing Michael Jackson shirts to be “more African.” But he maintained a serious tone as he said that he eventually became sick of constantly questioning who he was. “All I care about is being a good writer,” he said.
He also addressed the hurdles that he had to confront before becoming a writer. Joking about himself as a nerd who read a lot in high school, he revealed how he had to ignore his desire to be creative and write because of his father, who wanted him to pursue a job with a stable income like a doctor or lawyer. He only overcame this hurdle of “enduring desire to please my father with my unquenchable desire to create something” when he won the Caine Prize.
Folarin ended the discussion with dialogue around the Caine Prize and the future of African writing. He defended the prize as important, especially when it can celebrate the less-heard voices of the African diaspora. And Folarin seems to be just doing that in “Miracle”—insisting that the issues of faith that children of immigrant families face be heard.

The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of  “Raised in Captivity,” running through Saturday at the Loeb Ex, can be classified as absurdist realism. The two words— “absurdist” and “realism”—create a paradox, and indeed, though the play’s characters  struggle with realistic, universal problems, they are the victims of the oddest circumstances. The play walks the fine line between lunacy and rationality. The result is a production that hovers above reality—sharp, darkly humorous, but intellectually abstract. “Raised in Captivity” runs the risk of being potentially inaccessible, but deft staging decisions by director Lily R. Glimcher ’14 ground the play, making it an amusing, worthwhile experience accentuated by spectacular work on the part of the cast.
After their mother dies of an improbable accident with a showerhead, twins Bernadette (Susanna B. Wolk ’14) and Sebastian (Teis D. Jorgensen ’14) reunite after years of separation. The after effects of their mother’s death set in motion a sequence of events that irrevocably change the path of each siblings’ lives. They are forced to confront their broken relationship as well as the progression of things around them after years of blissful, ignorant stasis.
A major theme of the show is the interplay between the internal mind and external world; it’s a difficult concept to portray visually, but Glimcher and co-set designer Daniel J. Prosky ’16 imagine an area of space that flows seamlessly between these two worlds. The stage consists of large, black geometric pieces strategically placed to create different height levels. The rigid lines of the set pieces—in addition to the fact that each piece does not seem to represent any recognizable object—ensure the expansiveness of the play’s visual environment. At one moment, the blocks function as a tangible sofa, and the next, they seamlessly transform into the inner-landscape of a character’s thoughts. This fluidity lends the play a sense of continuity.
Glimcher’s blocking, as well as the lighting designed by Garrett C. Allen ’16 and Max R. McGillivray ’16, at times accents the differences between the physical exterior and mental interior and other times blurs the two thematic elements. When Sebastian is cut in the throat after an ill-advised foray with prostitute, Roger (Eli Wilson Pelton ’16), Sebastian’s dead mother, Miranda (Dorothy C. Donelan ’14), comes to him in his delirium. She enters from the side with blue light shining on her while Sebastian is bathed in yellow light. She is at a sizeable distance, kept to the very side of the stage, until the separation between the two is broken. She comes to Sebastian, invading his designated space, and the two lights mesh together. The question is presented to the audience: is it a hallucination or a soul from the afterlife? Realistically, the audience is inclined to believe the former, but Gilmcher does her best to make the answer as unclear as possible. Gilmcher allows room for interpretation, and this flexibility serves the play well.
Vivacious and deeply committed, Donelan, who in addition to playing Sebastian’s mother also portrays Sebastian’s psychiatrist Hilary, shines the brightest among a very talented group of actors. Hilary is a unique character because she doesn’t quite fit in the landscape of the play. In a group of strange, deeply troubled characters, she emerges as the most zealous of the bunch. She is deeply self-destructive and at one point has a fit of self-hating guilt, but is still inherently pathetic in her quest for some misguided redemption. Donelan plays her with a self-awareness while still retaining a sense of desperation that makes Hilary both a tragic and comedic character. When Sebastian informs Hilary that he will no longer be going to see her, Donlan’s transformation from a soft-spoken, reserved psychiatrist to an unhinged women begging her former client not to leave is nothing short of spectacular.
The whole cast puts up an exceptional performance, with impressive shifts between comedic and dramatic. Wolk portrays Bernadette with the right amount of neuroticism and rationalism, and Andrew J. Boyd ’14, plays Kip, Bernadette’s husband, with a fitting air of dopiness and idealism. Jorgenson adeptly shows the multiple sides of Sebastian, who closes himself off from the world while at the same time hoping for love, especially when he interacts with Dylan—an ex-convict played by Pelton—with heartbreaking humanity.
Full of twists and turns, “Raised in Captivity” will cause emotional whiplash at first viewing. It may not be the easiest play to swallow, but the excellent performances of the actors and superb lighting and set design are on point. Glimcher does a tremendous job of creating a production that leaves cause for reflection long after the lights dim.

For Stella F. Chen ’15, music is more than entertainment—it is a passion. Chen, a joint concentrator in music and math, is also enrolled in a five year, dual-degree program with the New England Conservatory. At Harvard, Chen, a violinist, is involved with many musical groups, including the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, the Brattle Street Chamber Players and the Dunster House Opera. Chen is also active on an international scale, having performed in competitions and recitals worldwide—she will perform at the Louvre next year.
The Harvard Crimson: What drew you to music and to the violin?
 
Stella Chen: For a long time, I played the violin because it was one of the things that my parents enrolled me in as a kid. But there is a reason why I continued to do it over other activities—I really feel that I can communicate by playing music. It is much more comfortable for me to emote on the violin. It is satisfying for me in both an emotional and intellectual way, and I really couldn’t describe why or how, but it is the biggest passion in my life right now. 
  
THC: Can you describe your musical experience prior to Harvard?
 
SC: As a child, I participated in many solo competitions abroad, and I feel lucky because I got the chance to play in places such as Wales and France, which I otherwise might not have visited as a child. It’s interesting because most people that I’ve met are familiar with doing youth orchestras and such, but I never got the chance to do that when I was younger. I took a gap year to attend Julliard, and it was the first time that I played in a full orchestra, which was exciting.
 
THC: What was that transition like?
SC: I’ve found that musicians sometimes do not prefer orchestral playing because they may feel that there isn’t as high of a standard, or they may feel like they are one of the masses—but I have definitely enjoyed my time with the orchestra. Here at Harvard, my experience has been no different. I have a lot of fun, and our conductor creates a good atmosphere.
 
THC: Who are your most important musical influences?
 
SC: Some of my favorite compositions come from Beethoven and Schubert. That said, whatever piece I may be playing at any given point will be my favorite piece for the time being. In terms of performers, my hero is David Oistrak—there is something about the way in which he plays and interprets music that blows me away. And of course, one of my major mentors and idols has been Itzhak Perlman. I first joined his music camp when I was 14, and he’s been a big role model and guide ever since.
 
THC: What are some projects and concerts with which you are currently involved?
 
SC: This Friday is the Brattle Street Chamber Players concert. One of my co-presidents and friends, George Myers, is composing a piece for it—we always commission an undergraduate piece—and we are hard at work on that. The next weekend [Saturday, Nov. 18th], I will be playing the Beethoven Triple Concerto with the Mozart Society Orchestra.
 
THC: Do you personally compose music?
 
SC: I am not brave enough. I think there is a certain confidence that you have to have in order to write your own music. I don’t think I have the confidence or the musical theory background to compose in the near future.
 
THC: Any post-graduate plans for music?
 
SC: I have no idea, and it’s really scary—but I love music, and I will definitely keep doing that as long as it makes me happy.

Prostitution, betrayal, and suffering are the depressing topics that Amy Tan, bestselling author of “The Joy Luck Club,” weaves together in her latest novel “The Valley of Amazement.” Through the separate journeys of Violet Minturn and her mother, Lucia, that span more than 40 years and two continents but inevitably converge on each other, Tan explores the profound connections between mothers and daughters.
Violet grows up as the privileged daughter of an American madam who owns a first-class brothel in Shanghai. For most of the novel, she struggles to discover her true self. When she is a young woman, fate cruelly pulls her into the same business as her mother. After she is deceived and separated from her mother, Violet is forced to become a courtesan. This newfound life, however, changes her from a spoiled child to a woman who excels in deception. In her new role as the mistress of a rich Chinese businessmen, she learns how to be respectful, refined, and cultured. She learns how to think on her feet and use her cunning mind to get her way. More importantly, she gains persistence and a curious mind. Despite Violet’s wonderful character development, though, “The Valley of Amazement” is an exhausting read, full of unnecessary sex scenes, contrived motifs and metaphors, and gaps in characterization that leave the reader confused.
There is a lot of sex in the novel, as one would expect from a plot centered on prostitution. But rather than serving a necessary narrative purpose, the excessive sex scenes are often strangely written and ambiguous in intent. At one point, Perpetual, one of Violet’s lovers, exclaims, “See what you do to me? My sword is sharp. It’s already risen out of its scabbard and wants to drive its mighty self all the way inside you, with your rump as its pommel.” Another very odd-sounding sexual metaphor comes from Violet: “I could now understand him perfectly because his bold knight coming through my gates had united our minds as well.” It seems as if Tan read too much medieval fiction in her childhood for her own good. These descriptions may be unique, but they are not entirely effective and are in fact often distracting from the main narrative.
Tan’s character names are similarly contrived, trying too hard to force metaphoric meaning upon the reader. Violet’s friends include the likes of Golden Dove, Little Duck, Magic Gourd, and Puffy Cloud. Rather than making a metaphorical point, Tan’s inclusion of an unnecessary plethora of minor characters, most with distracting names, actually hinders the text’s progression as one has to constantly flip back to remember the roles each character plays.
While Tan successfully develops the characters of Violet and Lucia, there are some glaring gaps in characterization. When Violet’s daughter, Flora, gets taken away, her grief is described in a couple of paragraphs, and Violet seems to get over it as fast as one would get over losing a shoe. In fact, instead of grieving like any parent would naturally do, Violet “kisses Little Flora’s face in a photograph,” and she feels all better. It is unexpected and uncharacteristic that Violet, who profoundly loves her daughter, does not shed a single tear over her loss.
Tan also includes Lucia’s new voice near the end of the novel, which unfortunately breaks the flow of Violet’s narration. Although this section is clearly intended to draw parallels between Lucia’s past mistakes and Violet’s current life, it becomes an unnecessary distraction that not only lengthens the book by an extra hundred pages, but also suffers from an extremely repetitive plot: girl falls in love with guy, guy makes and breaks promises, and girl becomes heartbroken and bitter. Furthermore, Lucia’s narrative is delivered in the same voice as Violet’s narrative, diminishing the purpose of adding an extra perspective.
“The Valley of Amazement” does have its moments of triumph. Violet’s character growth is superbly displayed as she transforms from a needy and self-centered girl to a shrewd woman who excels in deception and illusion, a transformation propelled by her unfortunate circumstances. The plotline is decently well crafted, with adequate twists to keep the reader intrigued and become emotionally attached to the characters. There are moments when the novel makes you cringe, cry, or rejoice. Yet overall, the novel is too long for its own good due to the similar plotlines in both narratives. Worst of all, after reading nearly 600 pages of broken relationships, sexual violence, and prostitution, the dull ending is unfulfilling for both the characters and the reader. “The Valley of Amazement” is too repetitive to be an enjoyable read.

Painting exhibits tend to be strictly visual: the onlooker regards a painting and hopes to derive some meaning from its aesthetic features and color values alone. Elise Adibi, however, believes that viewing art should not be so one-dimensional—the viewer should be able to use multiple senses to interact with the piece. For her upcoming exhibit, which opens Wednesday at Byerly Hall, the artist and fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study infused her paints with an array of aromatherapy fragrances and plant oils to add an olfactory element. All of her installations use organic materials such as rabbit-skin glue, mineral graphite paint, and even her own urine, which she uses to oxidize slabs of copper and make metabolic designs.
 
Visually, her paintings vary between two different styles: grid paintings and gestural paintings. The grid paintings are done with small rectangles that vary in size; each gestural, or metabolic, painting makes use of vibrant colors and swirls of texture. “They’re like living paintings,” says Alexandra L.M. Thornton ’15, one of Adibi’s research assistants.
 
Adibi’s main focus in this exhibit was to create intersensory art that relies on both sight and smell exploration. “Living in New York for 18 years [and] being scent-deprived makes you more aware,” she says. When Adibi moved to L.A. in late December of last year, she became intrigued by plant aromas. “In L.A., spring begins halfway through January and so by February, the whole city smells like jasmine,” she says. “It rains for a couple of days, which brings out different scents like eucalyptus.” 
 
However, it wasn’t until she moved to Pittsburgh last spring that she conceived the idea of using plant oils in her paintings. “I don’t know how the idea came, but it came. As soon as I got the idea it opened up a whole new way of making paints because there’s so many possibilities of combining color and smell, but then also the plant oils interact with the oil paint in very unpredictable ways,” she says.
 
While in Pittsburgh, Adibi was asked to participate in an exhibit at the Andy Warhol Museum. Warhol himself oxidized copper paintings with urine as part of his societal commentary on naturalistic art, and it is he who inspired Adibi to follow suit, she says. “I put down layers of copper,” she says. “Then I’d spray it [with urine] and brush it. Then I’d put more layers of copper on. It’s all about the process.”
 
Her creative processes, however, can face obstacles and frustration. “I do throw a lot of paintings away,” Adibi says. “I think that’s an important part of the process—you can’t always make it work. Sometimes you just need to make it, and it needs to fail, but you still have the experience of making it.” Thus, Adibi looks outward for support and critical opinions on her work. In particular, her undergraduate research assistants play an intricate role in developing the exhibit and providing artistic feedback. “My research partners help me determine when a painting is complete,” Adibi says. “Sometimes I have to stand back and let somebody else get involved.”
 
The relationship between artist and student works in both directions—Adibi’s research assistants consider themselves fortunate to have the chance to work with her. “The opportunity to engage with an actual working artist is an enriching and fulfilling experience,” Thornton says.

In theory, “Last Vegas” should work. It has four acting heavyweights in Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Kevin Kline, and Morgan Freeman; the volatile, raunchy locale of Las Vegas; and the priceless opportunity to the mix the two together. Despite the mouth-watering potential of the combination, “Last Vegas” ultimately falls flat, saturated with clichés and expected plot devices. While the film is certainly an amusing viewing, it’s not particularly memorable. The film has charm in spades, mostly due to the likeability of its seasoned actors, but it cannot overcome the simple fact that it is just not that funny.
 
After Billy (Douglas) gets engaged to his 30-something girlfriend, Lisa (Bre Blair), he invites his lifelong friends for his bachelor party in Las Vegas as a last hurrah. Each member of the aged wolfpack is going through his own crisis: Paddy (De Niro) cannot move on with his life after the death of his wife, Sam (Kline) is unsatisfied in his retirement in Florida, and Archie (Freeman) cannot be independent under the watchful eye of his son, Ezra (Michael Ealy). In Las Vegas, old rivalries open up and tensions come to a head.
 
The film’s major flaw lies in its staleness and the predictability of its script. Every known witticism concerning the elderly—including the jiggling women attempting water aerobics, Viagra jokes, and continuous mentions of the prostate—is stuffed into the narrative without precision or care. Each storyline plods from point A to B without any viable, lasting roadblocks, and as a result the characters slip too easily into the clichéd party-film framework. The film neither takes advantage of the oddity of a 70-year-old bachelor party nor the eccentricities of the city, instead putting its characters in rote, tired situations such as a bikini contest, sneaking into the hottest club, and attempting to throw the biggest party of the year (or at least the weekend).
 
While the film follows the shenanigans of the quartet, at the core of the film is a story of a group of men that must accept, embrace, and work with the sobering realities of their old age. With multiple emotional highs and lows, “Last Vegas” never strikes a balance between the sentimentality of its underlying theme and the inherent raunchiness of its premise. The pacing is off, and the consequence is that each character’s emotional climax fails to resonate. After the group happens upon a high-flying penthouse after Archie wins big in the casino, Paddy explodes unprovoked into a vitriolic attack on Billy for a past grievance. The shift from the jovial humor of the previous scene causes tonal whiplash without any logical reason. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman seems to be playing it by the numbers instead of letting scenes develop naturally, using messy, clunky tropes instead of good sense.
 
The film largely stays afloat due to the delightful chemistry between its stars. Though the material is derivative, the four Oscar winners certainly look like they are having a good time. The camaraderie and loyalty is believable, and it is no surprise that it is in the dramatic scenes, where the actors interact one on one, that the movie finds its stride. In one of the more poignant scenes, Paddy asks Billy whether he is really in love with his fiancée. It’s a moment that encompasses the enormity and impact of a decades-long friendship. Though the men acquit themselves tremendously in their roles, Mary Steenburgen shines as Diana, a tax-return lawyer turned lounge singer. In one of film’s best scenes, Diana is introduced as she coos into the microphone, a woman full of magnetism and charisma, as the group flocks toward her in awe like moths to a flame. There is a classic Hollywood feel to the scene, and it teases the makings of another film with more heart and class.
 
It is not that “Last Vegas” is terribly bad, but rather that it is simply boring. What is left after the credits roll is an unsettling feel of what could have been. The film does not make use of its cast’s wide array of talents, making the disappointment all the greater. It is an unquestionable pleasure to see Hollywood legends together on the same screen, but there is, unfortunately, not much more to see than that in “Last Vegas.”

A downtown road. No trees. Evening.
Directed by Judy Hegarty Lovett, the Gare St Lazare Players’ 60th anniversary production of “Waiting for Godot,” which played through Sunday at the ArtsEmerson Paramount Center mainstage, met the audience like an old friend. Given the unyielding notoriety of the playwright Samuel Beckett in not allowing any changes to the mise-en-scène of the play, the Gare St Lazare Players were as precise as a clock whose methodical unwinding of the absurdist masterpiece greatly contrasts with the contents of the play. In general, when staging classic plays directors strive to add an original interpretation to the body of already existing productions. However, in the Gare St Lazare Players’ “Waiting for Godot,” Lovett made sure that dramatic finesse had the upper hand over directorial innovation so that the modernism of Beckett's text shone through with its dazzling account of existentialist yet fundamentally comic human inertia.
The centerpiece of Ferdia Murphy's minimally elegant set design is a large, round, ashen platform slightly tilted towards the audience, one of the very few hints that illustrate Lovett's vision for “Godot.” A backdrop featuring a giant full moon seems to mirror this platform, while the lower branches of a willow are just visible overhead. The proximity of two large circles to one another creates recalls the dialectic between the actors and the audience: the fourth wall easily crumbles when the tilt of the stage reinforces the characters’ outwardly directed lines. It is true that such lines in “Godot” are often overtly addressed to the audience, sometimes as Beckett’s text explicitly states, but the nature of the comedic effect––silly, unknowing, acerbic––or the chilling effect really depends on the formal elements of the staging, and from Murphy's bare set and light designer Sinéad Mckenna's almost natural moonlight, the world of “Godot” easily slid into ours.
Needless to say, the quality of acting was superb; however, Lovett resorted to a couple of unconventional dramatic choices that left a different Beckettian flavor on one's lips. To begin with, when Vladimir (Conor Lovett) and Estragon (Gary Lydon) contemplate hanging themselves from the willow in lieu of waiting, the playwright reveals that Vladimir is supposed to be the heavier one. This is not the case in Lovett's production—Estragon was more corpulent than the thin and tall Vladimir. Likewise, through delicate emotional gradients, Lydon gave depth to a character who is often thought to be the stereotypical embodiment of the working-class man, one for whom sheer physicality is the most significant attribute. On the other hand, Conor Lovett reduced the traditionally more pensive and intellectual Vladimir to a childlike caricature who skips and bounces when not delivering one of his signature existentialist monologues. Although the actor’s mannerisms made one think that Vladimir's monologues were toned down to an elementary school audience, his naive know-it-all attitude struck a unique balance with the sculpted acting of Lydon. Lydon’s emotional depth was even more pronounced when Pozzo (Gavan O'Herlihy) and Lucky (Tadhg Murphy) arrived onstage.
While portraying the boisterous and imperious master of Lucky, O'Herlihy as Pozzo devolved into exaggerated highs and lows that were not too out of place given the turbulent gestures of the character himself. However, his gestures were clearly out of sync, and he did not seem to be communicating with other actors on stage. This discontinuity makes one think that he could have had his own one-man show without changing a single aspect of his performance. Finally, Tadhg Murphy's Lucky—arguably the character that Lovett takes most directorial liberties in re-interpreting—briefly outshone all of the three more elderly actors by delivering a gem of a monologue as a robot-like human The otherwise silent role of Lucky still maintained a mechanical coherence, as Murphy gave a machine-like edge to his movement even as he slumped under the weight of Pozzo's bags.
The overall effect of Gare St Lazare Players' “Waiting for Godot” was nothing less than impressive. A little bit discordant at a first glance, the play revealed itself as one that has gracefully aged­­, with still enough room for original interpretation. It really was like an old friend, unchanged but witty as ever after 10 (or sixty in the case of “Godot”) years––though of course, with a couple more creases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a sunny October Thursday afternoon, and the Science Center Plaza is alive. Students perch on rocks, wooden benches, beanbags, and oversized Tetris pieces as they chow down on delicacies from nearby food trucks. The sky is bright, but the smiles of students’ faces on the adjacent lawn outshine even the sun. Why? They’re at pet therapy, of course.
Until November, a traveling farm called Animal Craze delighted Harvard students and passersby alike every Thursday at noon as part of the Common Spaces initiative. The petting zoo’s draw couldn’t have been clearer: Everyone loves baby animals. We do, too. But we also encourage zoo attendees to look beneath the surface of the institution to examine how it reflects on Harvard’s approach to student mental health.
On the one hand, animals have the well-documented potential to alleviate stress—that’s why universities have looked to dogs to calm their students during the hustle and bustle of the academic year. Given how many Harvard students struggle to maintain good mental health among the stresses of life at school, the petting zoo undoubtedly represents a step forward. Substantive change to Harvard’s mental health system—though sorely needed and obviously more important than baby pigs and bunnies—cannot come all at once. Rather, it begins with small but deliberate steps like these.
While we need to continue to engage in a discussion about the effectiveness of University Health Services, Student Mental Health Liaisons, and other large-scale mental health institutions on campus, we cannot overlook the importance of small steps like the petting zoo. Good mental health on campus is, of course, tied to the availability of resources such as counselors and therapists, and we should not abandon efforts to improve their accessibility. Yet, the individuals behind the Common Spaces Initiative were correct in recognizing that small, otherwise insignificant improvements in quality of life, such as a petting zoo, can go far to make life as a Harvard student more manageable. In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, one administration official behind the petting zoo said, “In many of our Common Spaces focus groups, students told us that when they leave their homes and come to this highly stressful environment they can feel lonely…and that a petting zoo at the plaza might help.” We applaud the Common Spaces initiatives for seeking student input, and for taking unorthodox measures to improve our experience.
The Science Center Plaza petting zoo has brought some joy to the Harvard and Cambridge communities, and we see the installation as a modest but important move toward alleviating student stress. Still, we look forward to substantial improvements in the accessibility of traditional mental health resources as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week was an exciting one in Boston with the election of Martin J. Walsh to serve as the 54th mayor.  But even with all the Boston news buzzing around me, my attention the past week has still primarily focused on the mayoral election at home in New York City. Last Tuesday, Democrat Bill de Blasio was elected mayor, unsurprisingly beating out Republican Joe Lhota with a landslide vote share of 74 percent. Like the rest of New York, I was positive that de Blasio had the election in the bag. But even though I knew it was coming, I still felt a crushing anxiety and unease when I heard the news that it was official. Quite frankly, I am deeply afraid about what de Blasio’selection as mayor will mean for NYC.
Full disclaimer: I am a democrat and I was not supporting Joe Lhota in this election. But I wasn’t supporting de Blasio either. I understand why he’s a popular choice—he’s charismatic, he has a few excellent ideas, and he has experience as public advocate. I think that his innovative plan to tax the wealthy in order to pay for universal prekindergarten is an outstanding one that he has been passionate about throughout the election. On Monday, this plan received some critical support from the legislature. I also do believe that some of his criticism of Bloomberg is valid. As much as I love Bloomberg (yes, I’m one of those), it is time for him to go.
But I believe the negatives of Bill de Blasio greatly outweigh the positives. Behind his dazzling rhetoric, he lacks two critical qualities it takes to be a good mayor: the ability to follow through on his goals and executive decisiveness. His ideas aside (some of which are very bad), de Blasio will be a failure of a mayor because his character as a leader is fundamentally flawed.
De Blasio has constantly promised change and to end the “tale of two cities” for New York City if elected mayor. But he has shown from past experience that he constantly fails to deliver on his promises. While serving as a New York City Council member representing the 39th District in Brooklyn in 2003, de Blasio often supported affordable housing projects. Wonderful, you might say. More affordable housing is desperately needed in New York. And yet, although he supported projects, most of them fell through. In a revealing October New York Times article, civic advocates expressed that time and time again, “projects supported by Mr. de Blasio in the name of building homes for working-and middle-class New Yorkers failed to deliver as promised.” In his time as councilman, only 530 units of affordable housing were built in his district. In contrast, some districts in Brooklyn had thousands built. For a man who ran a lot of his campaign on understanding the affordable housing debacle in New York City, this should raise some alarm bells. I find it hard to believe he will, as he promises, create 200,000 units of affordable housing within the next 10 years.
There are also multiple reports of de Blasio’s irritating inability to not make up his mind and of his tendency to flip-flop. Personally, I want a mayor who knows how to act and who can act quickly, especially in emergency situations. This will likely not happen with de Blasio.It’s often hard to understand where he really stands. He has touted his achievements in creating the “Worst Landlords” list to hold New York City landlords accountable for bad behavior and yet accepted campaign donations from many of those same landlords. Throughout the election, he blasted Bloomberg and Quinn for their role in overturning term limits but he once supported a very similar proposal in 2005, which pushed for longer terms for the city council. In September, he came under fire for changing his stance on the New York City Board of Health’s controversial decision to require parents to sign a consent form before allowing children to undergo the ultra-Orthodox ritual of metzitahb’pheh. Previously, in May, de Blasio criticized Bloomberg for trying to impose consent forms on parents and promised to meet with religious leaders to try and change the policy. By the end of September, de Blasio backtracked in a typical way, claiming that he would now support the consent forms until his administration could come up with a different approach. The list goes on.
Overall, de Blasiois overly deliberative and inefficient. In an article about de Blasio’s role in the 2000 Clinton senate race, old employees bemoaned his achingly difficult leadership style. By the end of the race, his role had been extremely diminished because of his frustrating tendency to delay. Throughout the article, de Blasio just sounds extremely, well, lame. One sentence in particular sums him up: “Mr. de Blasio emphasized teamwork, tossing around a Nerf toy shaped like a buffalo that he picked up in upstate New York, and invoking sports terms.”
Once the glamor fades and the rhetoric proves to be empty, de Blasio is going to have to prove that behind that affable smile, he can actually get things done. His past record shows otherwise. For people afraid of his ideas and policies, I wouldn’t worry too much. They probably won’t ever get off the ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This piece was supposed to be titled, “How to Save the Humanities.” The humanities are in the midst of a “crisis”—this much is clear. Funding for the arts and humanities is plummeting, and the sciences and social sciences seem to have taken the place of standard-bearers for human knowledge and achievement.
First of all, is this a problem? Research on ancient Cypriot pottery can’t possibly improve the state of humanity more than cancer drug development, right? Advances in computing technology, materials engineering, neuroscience, economic policy, and social psychology surely must be of greater import than discussing the historical implications of eighteenth century English shopkeeping practices.
And they are, if maximizing human longevity and economic growth are society’s primary objectives. In an age of metrics, these and others such as carbon emissions can be measured, and society can thus try to value the return on the investment that is education based on how increasing dollars spent in field X changes relevant metric Y. But for the things that can’t be similarly quantified, it is also harder to be similarly accountable. For one, it is not easy to put into numbers how reading literature or studying history can help us know ourselves and each other better. There is no statistical analysis to be done on “the human condition.”
But that is society, and we are individuals. After all, economics tells us we are self-interested rational actors who don’t actually care about the rest of society. Maybe we just end up studying whatever we like? From the standpoint of college students, it is an easy decision. I suspect that sophomores who are going through concentration crises may scoff at this statement, but on the aggregate, the numbers don’t lie. Over 50 percent of the Harvard freshmen who come in expecting to concentrate in the humanities end up choosing another path. It’s fair to say that this half is not replaced by students who leave engineering for English.
Here’s another number: The income a student going into investment banking or tech can potentially make in their first year? Over $100,000. Trust me, it’s hard to make six figures sitting in a library thinking about Kantian metaethics, and tuition at most colleges is rising faster than inflation. In a post-2008 financial crisis world of global economic uncertainty and growing foreign might (see: China) there is much incentive—pressure, even—to place greater value on the income that one can reap from their major.
A less cynical take might be that in a world of globalized information, we have the tools to ask big questions and solve big problems, and we ambitious millennials want to have a visible impact on the world. The sciences and social sciences seem to be good for synthesizing data—we can discover and invent new things that we can be sure will help people live better. The benefits of studying how Buddhism spread across Asia seem less immediate.
Now, quantitative and scientifically rigorous fields are on the rise both at Harvard and other colleges, and mathematical and statistical coursework is becoming common for even the social sciences. The average student is taking more STEM classes. The arts and humanities are themselves occasionally employing quantitative methods. I don’t think that a future in which the arts and humanities are increasingly comprised of a minority of nerds who are extremely talented and interested in those fields, not unlike those who took math and science courses fifty or a hundred years ago, is impossible. The superstars who carry the mantle of the humanities will do so with extraordinary skill at the most elite and well-funded of institutions, but the subtleties of reading Shakespeare will be lost on most.
The weird thing is, most jobs don’t actually require high-level math and science knowledge, and it is not obvious to me that STEM majors actually teach critical and analytical thinking better than the arts and humanities. Much of it is likely job signaling. Being a better organic chemist may or may not make one a better doctor, and acing that econometrics final may or may not make one a better investment banker. But then again, it would be harder to argue that English majors are better humans than biology majors.
President Drew G. Faust argues that the valuation of education is itself meaningless, that knowledge must be pursued for its own sake, rather than its applications. Maybe, but a capitalist world does not tend to think in this way. The changes we are undergoing seem to be irreversible, at least in the short term. Perhaps we will reach a point where society feels that understanding cross-cultural dynamics and national histories is more valuable than understanding how many genes contribute to a certain type of cancer, and that to move humanity forward in directions that cannot be quantified, the arts and humanities are critical. Maybe it will be too late by then. Lots of maybes.
Whatever the case, with the increasing commoditization of education, it is clear that we cannot save the humanities as we know them. But maybe we should. With the loss of these fields, we may be losing more than we think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Thanksgiving approaches, most Harvard students are emerging from midterm season—a time where professors conveniently schedule midterm exams and essays within the same, short span of a few weeks. Dining halls are packed well past midnight. Coffee carafes are pumped without mercy until they choke and sputter. If one were to take a stroll on Mt. Auburn early on a Friday evening, he might be surprised at the relative quietness. It’s true that we Harvard students enjoy having a good time. But let’s be real—most of us take our midterms seriously.
Midterm season can also be characterized by a certain way that Harvard students have of interacting with each other. It is during this time that the seeds of a game I like to call, “Who Has It Worse?” are planted. No student realizes that he or she is a player of this game, but deep down we all have the desire to win. We all want to disclose to the people around us how much studying or writing we have to do, how much time we have to spend planning this or that, how frustrating it is that our extracurricular activities prevent us from starting our work until 11 p.m. Let me be clear: This is completely natural. In fact, I would say that when faced with serious stresses, it is healthy to communicate how we are feeling to those with whom we are close.
But therein lies the problem. Allow me to explain. When students talk about their massive amount of responsibilities over the course of a few weeks, they don’t tell the entire story. Taking a turn in the game of “Who Has It Worse?” involves more than simply listing off a number of obligations. There is a certain method to it—an unspoken, understood cadence that one adopts. The idea is that players simultaneously express concern about and dismiss everything they have going on. They do this by being self-deprecating—appearing to shrug off the responsibility because they are doomed to fail at it anyway. For instance, a student might go through his list with a sigh, claiming that he or she is completely unprepared for that test tomorrow and will receive a bad grade for sure. But of course, the listener knows that the claim is total BS. He understands that there is a good chance the student is doing fine in that class, knows the material better than he claims or thinks he does, and will do fine on the test—AND, the listener recognizes that in the back of the student’s mind, he knows it is BS as well.
These are the assumptions dictated by the rules of the game. But that’s all they are: assumptions. While the listener might think that the student complaining truly has a handle on everything and knows it, the reality is that the student could be extremely stressed out and worried. The problem is that when that student expresses his concerns in the context of the game, he is not communicating his true feelings in a healthy way. Thus begins a negative cycle: The listener believes that all the players around him actually have a handle on all they have to do, and they’re complaining is just a facade. This makes the listener feel stressed out and inadequate. He responds by becoming a player in the game himself—expressing everything he has to do in a way that makes everybody else believe that he is actually confident in all of his work. This in turn makes everybody else feel inadequate, and the cycle continues.
It would be easy for somebody to offer the student body a quick and simple solution to this issue: If everybody always said how they truly felt, then there would be no ambiguity. In my opinion, however, that is neither a fair nor realistic thing to ask of people. Instead, the goal should be to help students realize that this place can be really difficult sometimes. Everybody goes through his or her period—sometimes periods—of struggle. So instead of asking the players to make a change in their behavior, this responsibility should fall to the listeners. The listeners are the fuel for the game for they make the initial key assumption that the player is not actually as stressed or worried as he says. Imagine if they did not make that assumption. The listeners are the ones in a position to end the cycle by helping their friends realize that they are not the only ones struggling with schoolwork. We will each be listeners a number of times over the course of our Harvard career. The question is, when we are, will we succumb to the rules of the “who has it worse?” game and participate in it, or will we recognize when the game is being played and stop it?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past four years, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has only beaten Princeton twice. The first was a 3-0 sweep in Princeton, N.J. on Oct. 19 and the second was on Friday night at the Malkin Athletic Center, again in straight sets. The win was Harvard’s sixth straight at home.
“Last time, we shut them down,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “It was our goal to so the same in our house this weekend.”
While the Crimson (13-8, 8-4 Ivy) steadily held the lead throughout the entire first and second sets to take them 25-19 and 25-18, respectively, winning the third didn’t come quite as easily.
The Tigers (9-13, 5-7 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead, but the tides began to turn as a kill by Harvard sophomore Kathleen Wallace set the Crimson on a five-point streak.
“We stuck to our system and our outsides were just on fire,” Doyle said. “We just played steady and effectively blew them out.”
Wallace and freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst led the team in kills, with 10 apiece. Just behind them was freshman setter Corinne Bain, who proved just as formidable from the backcourt as she is as the net, chipping in seven kills. Bain had her twelfth double-double of the season, with 20 assists and 15 digs. Bain split duties at the net with sophomore Hannah Schmidt, who had 14 sets on the night.
“Our setting is a pretty strong setting combination we have between Hannah and Cori,” Wallace said. “They’re very good at making strong decisions because they keep our opponent guessing in terms of who will be set next.”
The two teams continued to trade the lead 10 times until Harvard sealed the deal under Weghorst’s serve. A block by junior Caroline Walters and senior Erin Cooney brought the game to match point, and a service ace by Weghorst gave the Crimson the ‘W’.
Harvard effectively used blocking systems at the net to shut down two of the Ivy League’s top three leaders in kills per set—Princeton’s Kendall Peterkin and Cara Mattaliano. The Tigers attack unit hit at just .149 while the Crimson held an advantage with a .330 hitting percentage.
“I think our team is a very strong blocking team, but we are especially good in the middle,” Wallace said. “[Sophomore Caroline] Holte and Walters are forces to be reckoned with in our team.”

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team seemingly played two separate games against St. Lawrence in a 3-2 win Friday. The first, which lasted through the first 20 minutes of the game, saw a powerful Crimson (4-1-0, 4-1-0 ECAC) offensive line make quick work of its opponent, scoring three unanswered goals. The second, which lasted the second and third periods, saw an increasingly physical St. Lawrence (4-7-0, 3-2-0 ECAC) offense turn a potential blowout loss into a nail-biter.
“We made [the game] a little bit more exciting than it needed to be,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “But we came off with the win, and I am proud of what the team put up today.”
Friday’s game was not only a crucial one in terms of early-season ECAC standings with both teams heading into the game with a 3-1-0 conference record, but also pitted a prolific St. Lawrence offense against a sturdy Harvard defense. The Saints had averaged four goals per game over its four most recent games, while the Crimson had allowed only one goal per game through the first five games of its season. While three early goals gave the Crimson a comfortable lead, its defense had to dig deep to halt a late offensive surge from St. Lawrence.
The intensity of the game was evident in the eleven penalties called, the most for any game Harvard had played so far in the season. Whereas only one infraction occurred in the first period, ten penalties were called over the next two, with six different skaters being temporarily sent off the ice in the final period alone. Amidst the physicality, sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer spearheaded the defensive efforts for the Crimson, saving 26 shots against a St. Lawrence offense that outshot Harvard, 28-20.
“I think [St. Lawrence’s] plan was to try to play a physical game with us ,” Crowell said. “We are a pretty fast team, so other teams scout us and try to bring us down that way.”
“When we did give up scoring opportunities, [Maschmeyer] kept us in the game and kept it really close. If it wasn’t for the way she played on Friday, the confidence with which she played and her ability to block shots that most goalies would not be able to reach, it would have been a totally different story coming out of St. Lawrence.”
The Crimson offense also displayed its talents, scoring three quick goals that eventually proved to be crucial in sealing the victory. Junior forward Samantha Reber opened up the gates for Harvard 4:26 into the first period, finding the back of the net from the right side on an assist from sophomore Dylanne Crugnale. Exactly six minutes later, it was junior Sarah Edney’s turn as she notched her third goal of the year on a swift two-on-one play with sophomore Jessica Harvey. At 17:46, freshman Sydney Daniels finished the Crimson streak in the midst of a scrum, sending the puck past St. Lawrence goalie Carmen MacDoland for her first collegiate score.
The Saints quickly responded, mounting an offensive surge that resulted in two goals shortly into each of the following two periods. Meanwhile, the Crimson offense seemed to have cooled down considerably towards the end of the game.
“You are not going to get away with sitting on three goals and not trying as hard for the rest of the game,” Crowell said. “We learned that in the second and the third [periods]—we are still trying to put together 60 minutes of hockey.”
“[St. Lawrence’s] goal in the second period was a wake-up call, and our players played hard to settle down and seal the game in the third. Thankfully, we kept it a back-and-forth game and I am glad we were able to come out with a win.”
With its weekend games against St. Lawrence and Clarkson, the Crimson has wrapped up a long string of away games, which included back-to-back weekend trips to upstate New York. Harvard will now begin an even longer homestand, playing six consecutive games in Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“Every meet is a learning opportunity,” Crowell said. “We are still in the process of learning how to play together for a whole game and really become one cohesive team on the ice. So to pick up this crucial win [on the road] gives us a lot of confidence, something that we can use as a springboard next week against Colgate and Cornell.”

Though temperatures are dropping outside, Harvard women’s hockey sophomoe goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer and the rest of the squad’s defenders are only continuing to heat up. Fueled by defensive intensity, the Crimson (6-1), skated to a 2-0 victory Saturday afternoon against Clarkson (8-3-2).
“The defense has been getting better and better every game,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “Clarkson is a difficult team; they put a ton of pressure on our defense. But we were picking up sticks, doing the little things right and clearing pucks away for Emerance.”
Rock solid defense has been a staple of Harvard’s performance this year. The Clarkson victory marks the Crimson’s third shutout of the season. Maschmeyer made 36 saves in the match, keeping the Clarkson offense under control for 50 minutes of play.
“It definitely starts with Emerance.” Crowell said. “She made some really exceptional saves. She’s very athletic, and came up with some big ones that really held us in there this game.”
A solid defensive performance gave the offense the confidence it needed to take control of the match on the other side of the ice.
“Our goalie played an incredible game,” freshman defender Briana Mastel said. “She was on fire. We all trusted each other, so we knew we would pull through.”
One of the top offenses in the country, Clarkson’s attack was difficult to keep under control. Maschmeyer recorded multiple back-to-back saves in the showing, and her blue-liners played a big role in keeping the Knights off the scoreboard.
Harvard took the lead early in the game as sophomore forward Mary Parker posted the first goal halfway into the first period.  Sophomore forward Dylanne Crugnale and junior defenseman Sarah Edney supplied the assist for Parker, who skated through the Knights defense to find the back of the net for the first time this season.
“It was a great top-shelf goal,” Briana Mastel said. “Mary was in perfect position, very close to the goal but she was able to put it top corner. It got us pretty pumped up, to come out and take the lead.  It was definitely a good position to be in.”
Parker was not done quite yet.  With a little help from her sister, senior defender Elizabeth Parker, Mary went on to notch her second goal of the season, posting her first multi-goal performance of the year.
The play came with eight minutes left in the second period, after Elizabeth launched a powerful backhand at the net, which rebounded off the pipe into her younger sister’s reach.  Mary managed to slice the puck into the net, beating the Knight’s goaltender Erica Howe a second time.
“It’s not just the finish,” Crowell said. “The people that set up these plays were in the right spot too.  Dylanne on the power play had a great pass to Mary, and she buried that really easily, and a nice little pass from her sister finished the second one.”
While the first goal was important in giving the Crimson the initial jump, it was the second shot that sealed the deal for Harvard, putting them in the driver’s seat of the match.
“We got our two goals, which was great,” Mastel said. “From that point on it was about playing defense and making sure we didn’t let Clarkson back in the game, which I thought we did really well.”
Clarkson featured a sister act of its own, as sophomore and senior forwards Cayley and Carley Mercer led the Knights offense. The two accounted for almost one third of the total of 36 shots taken by Clarkson.
With the Cornell game just around the corner, Harvard will be drawing from this weekend’s experience in the coming days to prepare for this rivalry game.
“Every game we get a little better, and in this one, I thought, as a team we did a lot of the little things right,” Crowell said.  “We’re building confidence in a young team, and focusing on all of the little things and what it takes to keep going against a tough team.  We’re learning how to be in tight situations and come away with the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 17 Harvard men’s water polo team (17-12, 11-1 ECAC) went into this weekend’s CWPA Northern Division Championships with a 6-game win streak extending back to Oct. 26. Momentum from the prior victories helped the Crimson prevail over MIT on Saturday, but was not enough as No. 18 St. Francis took the championship title on Sunday afternoon.
St. Francis 12, Harvard 4.
From the beginning, the championship game was tense.
Solid defensive play from both sides of the pool kept goals in the first half to a minimum. The first six shots from the opening minutes were all blocked by goalies, and for a majority of the first quarter, the score was even at 0-0. Just shy of a minute left, however, freshman Dan Stevens managed to find an opening and the Crimson went up 1-0.
The second quarter, a repeat of the first, saw only one successful goal throughout the entire frame, this time from Andras Kovacs of St. Francis. A short scramble for the ball near the Harvard goalpost two minutes into the frame produced cheers from the crowd, but did not produce any decisive shots as the Crimson eventually regained possession. It wasn’t until nearly halfway through that Kovacs launched the single goal from five meters; for the rest of that quarter, defensive play from both ends kept the score tied at 1-1.
“I thought we played a great first half, and…their goalie is very good, probably one of the best goalies in the country,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “He does a very good job in there, and it allows them to do some [more] things defensively.”
The second half of the game, however, resembled nothing of the first as St. Francis scored two goals within the opening minute. Sophomore Ben Zepfel of the Crimson responded with a goal of his own merely 15 seconds later, but Bosko Stankovic of St. Francis made a goal yet again at 6:28, his second on the night. In less than two minutes, the cumulative score tripled from what it was before halftime. By the end of the third frame, the board would stand at 7-3.
Aggressive gameplay from St. Francis for the rest of the game led the Terriers through to the championship. Besides a goal early in the fourth quarter by sophomore Noah Harrison, the Crimson could not capitalize on any of its offensive runs. The five shots made by St. Francis that ended inside the Crimson goalpost were not met with an equivalent response. Final score: St. Francis, 12-4.
“We got stops the first half, but we didn’t get stops the second half; it’s just as simple as that, I think,” Minnis said. “There’s just luck involved in everything, and I think they got a couple of balls that got over us when we were in pretty good defensive position…that was the difference. Then we’re playing catch up and doing different things defensively, and it kind of stalled out on offense a little.”
Harvard 9, MIT 6
The semi-final game against MIT largely resembled the championship match against St. Francis as the first half featured solid defensive play. It was the Crimson, however, that would run with the 3-2 halftime lead as soon as the second half began.
Coming off of a second quarter that only had one successful goal combined, the Crimson came out firing. Two shots from MIT that made it into Harvard goalpost provoked responses from Stevens and freshman Joey Colton, who both pushed the Crimson back to a 5-4 lead. For the remainder of the third and about halfway through the fourth, four goals by Stevens, Colton, and Harrison went unanswered. Only two shots slipped through the Harvard defense, and the substantial lead halfway through the fourth was enough to give Harvard a place in the finals.
“It started on the defensive end,” Minnis said. “That was something we talked about at halftime. We just got to get stops and everything else is going to happen. This was their second game of the day, we knew they were going to be tired, we wanted to get a stop and just motor down the pool and that’s what we did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard field hockey challenged Columbia in New York on Sunday afternoon, the Crimson struggled mightily for the first 64 minutes of the contest, but came back with a vengeance to finish off the season on a high note.
The Lions led for the vast majority of the match, seizing an early lead and holding on until there were just over five minutes left. From there, however, sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson refused to go down quietly, seizing control of the game for Harvard, and helping the team earn a 2-1 win.
Following a two-on-one opportunity, junior forward Catriona McDonald passed the ball to the center to Jacobson, who beat Columbia goalkeeper Kimberly Pianucci with a shot into the left corner of the net to tie the score.
The game proceeded to finish regulation 1-1. Just two minutes into overtime, Jacobson found the back of the net again, this time assisted by freshman forward Marissa Balleza, finishing the Crimson’s season with a win on a single shot.
“We worked in practice this week on finishing our opportunities,” senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield said. “[Jacobson] got those opportunities from some great work by other players, like Cat McDonald, Caitlin Rea, and Marissa Balleza, and she did a tremendous job of finishing them.”
Balleza is Harvard’s leading scorer this season and will now finish the year tied with the most assists as well. Jacobson’s two goals brought her season total to six, tied for the second most on the Crimson’s roster. She also scored and notched an assist in the team’s last game, marking an impressive end to her sophomore season.
Columbia (6-11, 2-5) took the lead 23 minutes into the game, as junior back Lauren Skudalski got the ball off of a rebound from a save made by Hatfield, and put it in the back of the net. Hatfield finished with five saves for Harvard (8-9, 2-5 Ivy), only allowing the one goal.
Both of these teams have struggled this season, posting a combined 3-9 Ancient Eight record coming into the match. They will finish the season tied for sixth and seventh place in the conference.
Early in the contest, it looked like the Lions might jump out to an even bigger advantage than it did. By the time the first half came to a close, Columbia had been awarded 11 penalty corners while the Crimson had received just three.
However, the Lions proved mostly unable to capitalize on those opportunities. The team took 10 shots in the first half, but only four of them actually made it to Hatfield. On the other hand, Harvard took five shots in the half and each was stopped by Pianucci or Columbia defenders.
It was a similar story in the second half, though more in favor of the Crimson. Coming out of the break, Harvard managed to take seven shots, all on net, including the score by Jacobson. The Lions only managed to tally two shots on goal in the second period out of a total of four attempts.
“In the second half, we committed to really going for it and playing our style of hockey,” Hatfield said. “We went out with confidence that we could win the game and we did a great job of being resilient.”
Overall, the Crimson finished with 10 of its 13 shots making it to or past the goalkeeper, while Columbia only went 6-for-14. This was a major difference in the match, as Pianucci was forced to make 10 saves while Hatfield only had to make five to secure the victory.
It was an important win for Harvard as it helped the team to finish the season with a victory and a record just below .500. Last season, the Crimson finished with a 3-13 record, and the team has not had a winning record since 2004. Many of the key players this year have been underclassmen, however, so Harvard will look to continue to improve in the upcoming seasons.
“From last year we made a huge jump on our fitness, competitiveness and I am very happy that the hard work that everyone has put in paid off with wins this year,” Crimson coach Tjerk Van Herwaarden said. “We will continue to grow and work hard to have another improved season next year."

It’s happened to everyone. You can remember your name, your dorm, your hometown, but you just cannot for the life of you recall that “interesting” fact you were asked to tell.
Well fear not, students, those days have passed! I know that you all have interesting things to say for yourselves, but this group sharing setting just makes things awkward. Do you go out there and brag about that worldwide Intel science competition you won? Do you tell them that your family called you Cousin It until you were 12 for undisclosed reasons? Do you show them that weird small sixth toe on your left foot?
No. Please do none of those things. I especially do not want to see your toe. Instead of searching your inner soul for ideas, you can turn to this list of fun and interesting facts that will amaze and surprise any group of Harvard students.
Here are some crowd pleasers:
1. Sometimes I forget how to spell my middle name.
2. I was bald until I was four.
3. I accidentally cut my friend's pinkie in half in second grade.
4. When I was seven I watched my brother fall into the sting ray tank at the aquarium.
5. Lady Gaga’s sister’s babysitter once babysat my best camp friend.
6. I once ate SOMETHING thinking it was SOMETHING.
7. Whenever I hear the song "Wagon Wheel" I start uncontrollably bawling.
8. I was hypnotized when I was 15 and now whenever “Who Let the Dogs Out” comes on I can’t stop barking.
9. I once swallowed four dimes on a bet but I’ve only found three.
10. I have the same hair color as my dog.
11. I was arrested on Halloween because the sword from my pirate costume was deemed a dangerous weapon.
12. For a year of my life when people asked me how old I was I would answer in dog years.
13. I enjoy the taste of stale bread.
14. When I was younger I used to enjoy sprinkling salt on slugs and watching them die.
15. I can recite the alphabet backwards.
16. I got lost in the mall when I was eight—I survived for a week eating Cinnabons™.
17. I-ay only-ay oke-spay in-ay ig-pay atin-lay en-whay I-ay as-way elve-tway.
18. When I finally realized I wasn’t going to Hogwarts I cried for four days straight.
19. I pee my pants on average once a week from laughter.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight.
In 2004, Cornell started storing 212 units of horse semen in a cryogenic tank for Fox Run Farm LLC (do we even want to know how much is in a “unit?”). According to The Cornell Daily Sun, however, it turns out the tank was actually defective, and after nine years of litigation, Cornell now owes the horse's owner $212,000. Do the math: One equine ejaculation is worth $1,000.
Meanwhile over in Providence, Brown students have caused a stir by protesting (shocker) R. Kelly’s visit—of course, the R. stands for Ray, as in Raymond W. Kelly HKS '84, the current police commissioner for New York City. On October 29, students protested the comissioner's involvement with the Big Apple’s controversial stop and frisk policy, the Brown Daily Herald reported, by shouting over the commissioner as he attempted to make a speech, effectively ending the event. In response, Brown University president Christina H. Paxson formed a review committee which is now being called the “Committee on the Events of October 29th.” Could that be any more foreboding?
 In other Brown news, the Brown Daily Herald asked about masturbation habits in their recent student poll (in case you were wondering, a fifth of Brown students don’t masturbate at all). How’s The Crimson’s freshman survey looking now?
And down at University of Pennsylvania, emails allegedly sent over the listservs of a few "underground" fraternities were leaked recently on Penn's Under the Button blog.
Some highlights:
 1. A picture of a receipt for 174 bottles of vodka
2. Advice on how to engage with women: “Agreed that biggest issue is girls. need more girl swag, gotta get the bitches to anchor down in our new chill pad”
3. Encouragement to disparage others: “If you have to make up scandolus [sic] rumors do it. I suggest going with something believable like oz [another underground fraternity] had a hep c outbreak last year”

Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act website, there has been a lot of criticism about its workability. Some active internet commenters have been pretty outspoken about how they think it's the worst site in the history of the interwebz.
Harvard students beg to differ. Students spend hours trying to traverse the mazes that are Harvard University's various online portals. To name just a few of these nearly impossible to navigate websites:
 
Advising Network PortalJust getting to the Advising Network Portal is a trial in itself. First you have to actually find the Advising Programs Office website–easy enough, you may think—but then you have to locate the elusive blue button that reads “Advising Network Portal.” Once you have finally plugged in your Harvard ID and password information, a not-so-attractive photo of yourself will greet you. Congratulations. You found the Portal. Now you’re there; good luck finding the information you’re actually looking for.
Student Planning PortalSophomores sit in front of their computers for what seems like days in a fruitless attempt to locate their future concentrations—among just 48—and the requirements thereof. Students can choose from a menu including such options as “Create Planning Worksheet,” “Plan of Study,” Browse Courses,” Print and Publish,” and most importantly receive “Help.” The last tab may be the most useful.
The Obama administration finally apologized on October 29 for the inconveniences of the ACA site and promised to get the site running smoothly as soon as possible. Harvard, when will you do the same?
Courses of InstructionWith the creation of the CS50 Course catalogue, this “Courses of Instruction” section of the FAS website seems fairly pointless. Scanning through a list of 80 or so possible broad course categories, General Education requirements, Core Curriculum, House Seminars, and Graduate Seminars can prove frustrating to say the least.
Crimson CashThink of all those times you're in desperate need of candy from the vending machine and have to fill out your entire address and the number from the back of your ID just for a little sugary gratification. Why is this a thing?
