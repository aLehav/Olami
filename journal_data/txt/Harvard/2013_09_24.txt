After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On Thursday night, writer Margaret Atwood returned to Cambridge to give a talk about her new book, “MaddAddam.” Cambridge holds a special allure for Atwood; it is where she set her renowned novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” and also where she earned an M.A. in English from Radcliffe College in 1962. With a purse slung over her shoulder and a quietly melodic voice, Atwood addressed her fans with chutzpah and humor. “I’m glad to be back in the scene of my youthful indiscretions,” she said. She rode the wave of laughter that followed before admitting that her “youthful indiscretions” mainly included eating too many ice creams.
 
An author of over 50 volumes of poetry, short stories, children’s stories, and novels, Atwood began her talk by singing one of the hymns she wrote into her latest series, a trilogy that includes “Oryx and Crake” and “The Year of the Flood” and ends with “MaddAddam.” The hymn was meant to celebrate Mole Day, a fictional children’s holiday in “The Year of the Flood,” and Atwood carried the tune well, carefully hitting all of the notes. The rest of the talk proceeded as whimsically as the beginning, with Atwood demonstrating her impressive awareness of current science, social media, and odd factoids.
 
Despite her age, the 73-year-old Atwood has successfully kept current and navigated her way through the changing relationship writers have with their readers. She “crowd-sourced” the room for a pair of reading glasses and mentioned developments in scientific research such as a recent study that proposed putting purring cats on the heads of people with migraines might alleviate some of the pain. She has an active and appreciative Twitter following, and she tweets to thank bookstores for their support, to campaign to “Save Ontario’s bees!” and to confess to “eating a preparatory spinach salad RIGHT NOW.” She described her online presence and willingness to speak at so many events as a form of generosity that makes both the recipients of her literary attention and herself happier in the long run.
 
It is astonishing to remember, while listening to Atwood’s charming and eccentric talk, that she creates such harrowing and realistic dystopias in her novels. Her work is often classified as science fiction, and much of it takes place in the future, at times when humans have managed to ruin themselves and their society through bad governance or a deadly disease of some sort. Perhaps most interesting is that many of these horrifying futures are set in New England. “I find the Boston area very convenient for dystopias,” Atwood said. “I think it’s a thing people toss around so lightly—the saying ‘It could never happen here.’” 
 
Atwood even confessed to having a small library devoted to the Black Death in her home. When an audience member questioned how she is able to imagine incredibly dreary and hauntingly real dystopias, she mentioned that she found much of her inspiration from reading newspapers and Twitter feeds. “I think what you’re really asking is how I get through the day,” she said.
 
Many of her stories focus on the survivors of catastrophic events, and their worlds feel claustrophobic and immediate. Her knowledge, referred to during the talk, of obscure skills like knowing how to skin and barbeque small rodents and what to do in case one finds oneself in a desert or the open sea, creates a realistic and engrossing experience for her readers. She writes, she said, for an audience who think the way she does: that the apocalypse might be just around the corner, but the only thing humans can do is get through the day and take pleasure in personal interactions. “To be a writer, you have to assume a future reader,” Atwood said. Her stories go a step farther—not only assuming a future reader, but also trusting there will be someone left to tell the story.

"Work Bitch"
Britney Spears

The Queen of Pop has released her second single this year, “Work Bitch,” which has quickly climbed the charts. Continuing with pop’s current trend of integrating themes from EDM, the tune carries a strong beat to support Britney’s vocals, but her generally stellar pipes fail to achieve their usual impact. Britney’s unexplained attempt at a British accent and mostly spoken lyrics really detract from the potential impact of the piece, giving the song a half-hearted tone. “Work Bitch” advocates the American dream: achievement requires hard work, creativity, and effort. In an ironic twist, Britney’s new single has good things going for it but doesn’t put in the effort to stand out in comparison to her previous work.
 
 
"Rough Water ft. Jason Mraz"
Travie McCoy
It’s been a few years since McCoy’s released his own music, and “Rough Water” carries his style into the new decade quite well. “Rough Water” has a driving beat and use of guitar that comes across as extremely similar to his past hit, “Billionaire.” However, “Rough Water” demonstrates extremely crisp vocals and a momentous background beat (if you ignore the weird spoken interlude in the middle) that makes it a far more refined and polished song than “Billionaire.” “Rough Water” is a perfect start to McCoy’s upcoming sophomore run at creating a solo album: its smooth execution and killer rhythms aren’t uncommon in the Top 40, but in combination with McCoy and Mraz’s great vocals it ought to become a successful hit.
"The Fox"
Ylvis 
“The Fox,”—known for its irreverent “what does the fox say?” chorus—has become the latest inexplicably popular viral music video, with 40 million views and counting.  What sets it apart from other sudden hits like “Gangnam Style” and “Numa Numa” is its use of the English language (despite Ylvis being a Norwegian group) and its intentional creation as a work of comedy. “What Does the Fox Say” asks the question on no one’s mind: what the sound of a fox is. It’s definitely not trying to be anything deep, but its wacky lyrics and suave musical production it will either leave you laughing and dancing or viciously hating it.

After a long day on the work grind, curl up on the couch with a glass of wine and consider unwinding to the smooth tunes of Drake. Yes, Drake. The rapper who helped coin the phrase of our generation, “YOLO,” and who has an uncanny ability to rhyme “record” with “record” has put out an album of dense, emotional tracks that show he has a soul. Though punctuated with obnoxious, monotonous drunk anthems, “Nothing Was The Same” is a nostalgic, slightly depressing call to maturity.
The party songs, many of which have already been released as singles, are “Started From the Bottom,” “Wu-Tang Forever,” and “Worst Behavior.” Their placement in the tracklist is impressive in its consistent derailment of the album’s momentum. Such sophisticated lyricism as “And like a potluck, you need to come with it” or the occasional sage advice, “Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?” are spaced perfectly to interrupt the flow of the album and confuse the listener.
But this album, despite the poorly placed moments of bombast, is an evolution for the rapper toward something much more emotionally complex. Since his debut album “Thank Me Later,” Drake’s gone mainstream with some overplayed radio favorites (“Forever” and “Take Care” to name a couple). Not to say that mainstream Drake is bad, but mainstream Drake is bad. In this respect, however, “Nothing Was The Same” lives up to its name as Drake turns his attention from party anthems to soul-searching tunes. It seems Drake has begun collaborating with the Weeknd again, according to his Instagram, and “Nothing Was The Same” has undertones of emotional exploration and musical experimentation that could be related to this renewed partnership.
Though “indie Drake” sounds impossible, this album has a rich, contradictory tone. From the slow-grind, post-break up vibes of “From Time” to the Daft Punk-esque grooves of “Hold on, We’re Going Home,” this album is a rollercoaster ride of emotions.
But maybe that’s the point. “Nothing Was The Same” is a cry to the past—a desperate and confused plea to lost loves and missed opportunities. While Drake can’t let go of his ego, name-dropping designers in nearly every song, he’s reaching to a darker, more sensitive side with this album.
Drake’s never been this honest, and frankly, it’s refreshing. “HYFR” from the last album had enough egotism for a career, and the rapper is finally rapping on topics other than being a rapper. On the intimate “From Time,” Drake opens up about his long-estranged father (“I’ve been dealing with my dad, speakin’ of lack of patience / Just me and my old man gettin’ back to basics”) and every relationship in between (“Darling you, you give but you cannot take love”), showing a more human side to the fame.
The rapping is clean, and Drake’s delivery is impressive. Drake tends toward clichés, and some lines seems as useless as they are silly. Even when he spits, “I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is,” on “Connect,” his precision of delivery makes up for the subpar similes. Drake particularly holds his ground in “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2”—which features Jay Z and stands as one of the highlights of this record—when he says: “Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now / I’m holding all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now.”
Along with Drake’s delivery, the record’s production is prime. The jazzy piano in “From Time” perfectly complements the song’s nostalgic tone and is echoed in “Wu-Tang Forever,” which samples Zodiac’s “Loss Config,” creating a cohesive, sophisticated feel. Even “Worst Behavior,” featuring some of the lamest lyrics on the record (“Who’s hot, who not / Tell me who rock”), has a sick beat and impressive production from DJ Dahi.
“Nothing Was The Same” is a raw portrayal of Drake he’s never shown before, despite the obnoxious insertion of a few crowd-pleasing hits. The more mainstream fans will be shouting “Started From the Bottom” all night long, while the mellower crowd will appreciate the curl-up-on-the-couch ease of the majority of this album—while having to skip over those few bombastic tracks. If the final song on the deluxe edition, “All Me,” is any indication, Drake is here to stay, as he likes to emphasize—a lot. But rest assured, the rapper has a soft side.

A sizable portion of the Harvard student population already spends a good amount of time with its eyes glued on Bryan Cranston. But if you can stand to tear yourself away from his pixelated image and accept standing-room-only tickets, the beloved star of “Breaking Bad” will make “All the Way” worth your while. The show, playing at the American Repertory Theater through October 12 and directed by Bill Rauch, chronicles Lyndon Johnson’s first year as president. The play provides a thoughtful, thorough treatment of a year in American politics, but it is Cranston’s wrecking ball of a performance as LBJ that earns it a “can’t miss” status.
The trajectory of “All the Way” is straightforward: act one charts the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, act two focuses on LBJ’s quest to secure reelection. Closed cases? Emphatically so, but LBJ’s tortuous paths to victory are no less fascinating for our knowing how things will play out. “All the Way” manages to build suspense by focusing on the how instead of the why. The play plumbs the fraught circumstances that prefigured historical marquee moments, bringing to light nuances that are typically excluded from APUS History textbooks. It also interweaves various issues with an adroitness that hammers home how interconnected all political decisions are.
And yet, “All the Way” is an unabashed vehicle for Cranston. Cranston has the advantage of performing for an audience primed to adore him, but this luxury, far from making him complacent, seems to have bestowed a confidence that enables Cranston to attack his role with special fervor. He disappears into LBJ, adopting a cadence and a physicality that betray no whisper of Walter White, Cranston’s character on “Breaking Bad.” His Johnson is a veritable force of nature, a first rate wheeler-dealer, gifted storyteller, and indefatigable shape-shifter who plays the Southern good ol’ boy and the hardened politician with equal aplomb.
“What does Lyndon Johnson really want?” one associate, questioning LBJ’s loyalties, wonders aloud. It’s a difficult question to answer, but whatever he wants, he knows just how to get it. Cranston’s delivery changes with each friend, foe, and family member LBJ encounters, illustrating the president’s legendary ability to adapt to his audience. Yet Cranston is careful to retain a basic constancy of character that prevents his portrayal edging into the territory of lampoon. The audience is treated to a parade of distinctly flavored Johnsons, but they are all definitively LBJ. And when Johnson breaks the fourth wall, imparting snatches of political wisdom to the audience, Cranston’s gruffer tone and stalwart stare make blisteringly clear the ambition and cunning that are at the root of his protean nature. “You know how to win a campaign?” he snarls. “By not losing it.”
The other actors on stage are predictably pummeled by Cranston. But they take their annihilation in stride, delivering performances that are the theatrical equivalent of protein bars (plain but effective) and never once attempting to steal the show. One notable exception is Eric Lenox Abrams, playing an infuriated civil rights advocate who upstages Martin Luther King during a sermon. Abrams briefly takes over the play, with an electrifying and brilliantly acted speech in which he holds a microscope to LBJ’s civil rights failures and activates a solemn pulse that pounds, soft but steady, through the remainder of the play.
“All the Way” is further elevated by Christopher Acebo’s well-designed and cleverly utilized set. At the opening of act one, a large turquoise chair is framed by a semicircular amphitheater of congressional pews. Additional props shuttle onstage and off, but these key pieces remain for the duration of the play. The amphitheater is populated by an ever-changing coterie of observers who train critical eyes on LBJ. Johnson’s chair also serves a symbolic purpose; it remains even when Cranston is absent, alluding to the president’s political omniscience as well as, perhaps, to his inability to always make good on the promises he issues from it. When Martin Luther King (Brandon J. Dirden) occupies the chair during a scene that deals with the president’s imperfect allegiance to the Civil Rights Movement, Johnson’s failures in this arena are made clear.
“All the Way” clocks in at just over three hours, but excepting a lugubrious final lap heavy with exposition and short on shining moments for Cranston, this is a play that makes you feel time is no object. Those willing to stand (or sneak in a Crazy Creek) will find themselves standing just a little longer after the show to give “All the Way” the upright ovation it deserves.

“American Gestures”—an exhibition that opened on Saturday at the Museum of Fine Arts and is composed of Abstract Expressionist drawings, prints, paintings, and sculptures from the late 1940s to 1970s—is an opportunity for the public to appreciate the scope of the MFA’s expanding collection. Many of the pieces are new to the MFA and will be exhibited for the first time.
“This exhibition will let the New England community know that we have a collection of Abstract Expressionist artworks,” says Clifford S. Ackley, the curator of “American Gestures” and the Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Curator of Prints and Drawing. “We have been collecting Abstract Expressionist artworks for 40 years…. We wanted people to know that we have these works. Many of these works have not been frequently exhibited, or ever,” he says.   The exhibition was created by the MFA Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, of which Ackley is chair. The exhibition displays works by Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, David Smith, Mark Tobey, Alfred Leslie, Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and a number of others.
Although Abstract Expressionism is thought of as having spanned from the 1940s to 1950s, the exhibition will go beyond that time period to include works like Robert Motherwell’s, whose paintings and prints were influenced by the movement.   According to Ackley, the movement was not a spontaneous artistic phase but was actually had a precedent in the work of European surrealists in New York during World War II. These writers primarily created fiction and drawings.  The exhibition’s artworks are arranged in such a way that they invite comparisons with one another.
“There are a lot of interesting juxtapositions going on in the exhibition. For example, there is a David Smith drawing about de Kooning, and next to that is a lithograph by de Kooning from 1960. It is all about the visual relationships,” he says.   The name of the exhibition, “American Gestures,” alludes to the importance of Abstract Expressionism to America. “It was the first American contemporary style that invaded Europe. It was recognized as particularly an original American phenomenon that quickly became an international style,” Ackley says.  Ackley predicts that the show will likely elicit strong positive and negative reactions from the audience.
The works in this school of art can appear random and done without much thought, but Ackley disagrees with that interpretation. “It [the movement] is not an accident, it really is a style,” he says. “The movement is irritating to some people because it is messy and spontaneous, and people say ‘I can do it,’ but I think the exhibition encourages you to take it seriously as a style.”   The exhibition will be on display through June 1. There will be a gallery talk entitled “American Gestures: Abstract Expressionism” on October 20 at the Sharf Visitor Center.

Promoting a culture to an audience of both natives and foreigners simultaneously is a tricky challenge. Cambridge READS, however, seemed to stumble upon a solution: an interaction of two arts, in this case lively dancing paired with a talk by a best-selling author. The writer is Edwidge Danticat, whose latest book, “Claire of the Sea Light,” gives readers a poignant glimpse into the world of a young Haitian girl who disappears on her seventh birthday. Danticat’s reading followed an energetic performance of a trio of Haitian dances by the Jean Appolon Expressions dance company. Combining dance, music, and literature, the presentation on Haitian culture, hosted by Cambridge READS in Sanders Theatre on Wednesday night, drew a diverse crowd, from local Cambridge residents and Harvard students to an MIT linguistics professor and University President Drew G. Faust.
 
Both Danticat and Appolon immigrated from Haiti, a place that has deeply influenced their artistic pursuits and from which they still draw inspiration. Danticat came to New York when she was 12 in hope of a better future, while Appolon came to America in 1993 at age 16, after his father was killed in Haiti.
 
During the talk, Danticat fondly recalled her childhood in Haiti. Besides the many stories her grandmother, mother, aunts, and extended family members told her, what she remembers most vividly is the radio, which played an integral role in her and other Haitians’ lives. In her latest book, Danticat said, she combines three powerful influences in her life: writing, radio, and Haiti. “I always had this dream of writing a novel about the radio because I love the radio and the radio in Haiti is so important,” she said. “So [I wanted] every chapter of the novel [to be] an episode of this radio show.”
 
Appolon’s immigrant experience has given him a mission for his dancing. “It makes my dancing stronger because I have a voice to talk about something very important that a lot of people don’t understand,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. Because of this, he has to strike a balance between communicating to two different groups—the Haitian audience that understands the culture and the foreign crowd that is newly exposed to the material.
 
Appolon says that he has struggled to change the general perception of Haitian dance as “voodoo-ish” and crude by highlighting its power and beauty. According to Appolon, elements of traditional Haitian dancing are in fact found in many different types of dances. “I have learned many forms of dance because I graduated from Joffrey American Ballet School,” he says. “I really see a lot of strong movements I have learned in those dances...in traditional Haitian dancing.”
 
Driven by his vision of promoting Haitian culture through folkloric dance, Appolon established the Jean Appolon Expressions dance company in 2006. He operates a small dance company in Boston and Cambridge that gives performances at social functions and holds dance classes and workshops. While Appolon is glad his dance company is celebrated for its unique mission of spreading Haitian dancing, he also wishes more people would join him in his mission. “I’m hoping there can be more companies like myself...more young Haitian-Americans who try to do the same work or do more,” he says. “There are so many young people who are so afraid of saying that they are Haitian. They are very embarrassed by it. So I’m hoping that the work I am doing will [make them] feel proud to be Haitian.”

Kyle Abraham’s choreography stands at the crossroads of his classical training in music and the hip-hop rhythms of his childhood in Pittsburgh. Trained at SUNY Purchase and the NYU Tisch School for the Arts, he went on to found the dance company Abraham.In.Motion. He has created avant-garde works for clients like the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and has performed at dance festivals across the United States. In 2012 Abraham was named a Resident Commission Artist 2012-2014 for New York Live Arts, where he will work with other accomplished artists to create work that will premiere at the end of his time there. He is currently touring his work “Pavement,” and stopped by Cambridge on Thursday to teach a master class at the Harvard Dance Center.
The Harvard Crimson: Let’s start with the basics—what first got you interested in choreography?
Kyle Abraham: I started dancing in my room…. I wanted to find out more about my movements. I wanted to elaborate on whatever it was that I was doing there. [I was] dancing in my room and then I got curious about learning more about it.
THC: What was your inspiration for  “Pavement?”
KA:[I was] looking at what world a black person lives in and looking at the goals of the community. I’m thinking, generally thinking, about my hometown—about what I was in 1981, my freshman year of high school, thinking about the change of laws and the impact on the community, and about a lot of jazz legends, their work, and about the changes that had happened by 1981…. A lot of those [old jazz bars and venues] were already boarded up and dilapidated. I’m looking at those buildings, thinking about society and how we all feel about it.
THC: And how do you express those feelings through choreography?
KA: I guess it’s hard work...whatever the decision is, how to show it to people that aren’t necessarily dancers, how to get people to think about more than themselves. It’s more interesting to hear people from all walks of life…. As dance-makers we’re always struggling to find how movement correlates to the client’s voice.
 
THC: What are your favorite works that you’ve choreographed?
 
KA: “Pavement” is one of my favorites, [but] I feel emotionally connected with other work, [like] “A Radio Show,” [which is about] both my family and our history, and also urban radio and the demise of the first urban radio stations. It’s very nostalgic, in a lot of ways, and is obviously a very emotional subject.
 
THC: What challenges do you face in your choreography?
KA: What comes into conversation on a learning [basis] are fundamental issues with dyslexia that [find their] way into me taking classwork…. I have a hard time doing it slow in class, because when the teachers break down the material very slowly, I just can’t do it…. If they go through it very quickly, that’s the only way it will work for me…. I’ll figure it out, and then I’ll do it.

In the 1930s, the man who would become the Poet Laureate to the Library of Congress applied to The Harvard Advocate—and was rejected.
“I wasn’t a very good writer then;  perhaps I should have been turned down,” Robert Lowell said in an interview with the Paris Review in 1961. Though the rejection must have stung at the time, it did not deter Lowell from a career in poetry.
But the Advocate, the oldest continually published college literary magazine in the country, has had a history of publishing famous Harvard wordsmiths, from T.S. Eliot to John Ashbery. Other student-organized institutions here have trained their shares of notable writers—John Updike was a member of a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, David Sanger wrote for The Crimson, and E.E. Cummings helped to found the Harvard Monthly.
At Harvard today, student life is very much focused on extracurriculars, and to some students, these activities are just as important as—or even more important than—their classes. In the hypersocial setting of undergraduate life at Harvard, creative writing’s careful introspection and editing play out in ways beyond the often-solitary acts of producing original works. The Harvard students today who work together in writing classes and student-run publications are participating in a long and illustrious literary tradition at the College.
In the absence of a perfect formula for fostering future Pulitzer winners, the writing scene at Harvard is multi-faceted, varied, and as often as not, a collective rather than a solo pursuit.
THE ALLURE OF THE WRITING WORKSHOP
“Harvard is a great place to be a writer,” says Stephen L. Burt, director of undergraduate studies in the English Department. In his office on the second floor of the Barker Center, the massive bookshelves stretch from floor to ceiling. He is said by his students to be one of the most exuberant and engaging professors at Harvard, and from the way he talks about the English Department, he certainly displays the same enthusiasm for which he is known.
According to Burt, between 120 and 150 students take one of the 14 writing workshops offered by the English Department each semester. Less than half of enrollees are English concentrators, a dynamic that Burt says is maintained purposefully so that workshop participants can share feedback from many different perspectives. Admission to one of these coveted writing workshops is based on an application that includes a writing sample and personal statement.
“One of the many things I think we do right is to make the creative writing courses selective,” Burt says. Without this discretion, he explains, it would be more difficult to ensure accurate and careful grading necessary in order to offer the class for credit. Currently, courses are offered in playwriting, screenwriting, poetry, fiction, and nonfiction.
Burt says that the department promotes creative writing as an academic pursuit, but at the same time the professors realize how important out-of-class writing can be to a writer’s development. Professors are aware of the student publications, and there is no notion that academic workshops take precedent over publications like the Advocate.
Amy C. Robinson ’15, an English concentrator, is taking her third creative writing workshop in the department. She says the structure and rigor of the workshops have made these classes her favorites at Harvard so far.
But the application required to get into the classes can be a source of frustration for some students. Dennis A. Sun ’15, a Crimson designer, is one student who, after applying to a fiction-writing workshop two semesters in a row without success, decided to do something about it. Last year, Sun founded the Harvard College Writers’ Workshop with a few of his friends.
“The reason we started the workshop was to fill this hole in the creative writing community at Harvard,” Sun says. Sun had read on the English Department's website to work on his writing and then apply again the next semester, but he felt he lacked the peer input he needed to improve, a sentiment that was echoed by a few of his friends. The workshops he designed are meant to introduce students to creative writing in a more relaxed atmosphere. “We’re trying to make writing more accessible for students. The Advocate can be a very daunting place when you’re just starting to figure out how to use language in the artistic sense.”
The group started to have organized workshops led by a student moderator last semester, along with all-night writing events, and though Sun—a human developmental and regenerative biology concentrator—plans to pursue scientific research after college, he regards the Writers’ Workshop as very significant to his time as an undergraduate. “Being able to read other people’s writing is really rewarding—you get to see how people your age handle the same problems you’re struggling with in writing,” Sun says.
Since starting the group last fall, Sun has taken a writing workshop through the English Department and agrees that the level of rigor he found there made his application process worth the hassle. However, he still sees value in the Writers’ Workshop he helped to form as a way for students to get their feet wet with writing.
PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
Many students who end up taking advantage of the writing workshops Harvard has to offer also spend their extracurricular time perfecting their writing skills. Robinson’s interest in writing translates outside the classroom as well; last semester she was co-president of Tuesday Magazine, Harvard’s general interest student publication. In that position, she edited her peers’ work, publicized for submissions, and scraped together money to be able to print their publication. Robinson says that sometimes Tuesday was more stressful—and took up more of her time—than some of her academic courses.
Looking forward to her plans after graduating, Robinson thinks that the experience she gained in working for Tuesday has prepared her for a career as writer or editor at a magazine.
Liza M. Batkin ’15, who writes and edits for the Advocate, decided not to pursue creative writing as a part of her concentration. Instead, she says that she feels more at home with the type of critical writing she found in the Literature Department. “I found that writing an essay itself could be a creative act,” Batkin says.
Being a part of a literary magazine has provided her with an additional group of critical thinkers, and she spent her summer working for N+1, a literary journal based in New York that was founded in part by Advocate alumni.
“Sometimes it feels like creative production and academic pursuit are not in tune with each other,” Batkin says about academic life at Harvard. But, she says, with outlets outside of class, one can stay engaged in literary critique without going straight into academia after graduation.
Zoe K. Hitzig ’15—a Crimson Arts writer who is also the publisher of the Advocate—also values the skills she is learning as a student publisher of a major literary magazine. Though it is at times hard to balance studying for a test and making sure that a publication comes out on time, she’s not sorry that she chose to take on a leadership position. “A lot of members on the Exec board [of the Advocate] approach their positions as semi-professional,” Hitzig says. “There’s definitely a sense of responsibility...that puts the Advocate above academics in some sense.”
WORKSHOPS AS COLLABORATION
In addition to the pre-professional experience of working for the Advocate, Hitzig spoke highly of the community she has found there and mentioned that student editors often circulate their own writing, hoping for feedback and an intellectual conversation about the craft.
The Advocate has even started running student-led workshops for writers, whether they are members of the publication or not. Over Wintersession, Hitzig says, many students showed up to participate in workshops designed to reflect the varied academic pursuits of Advocate members.
Unlike Harvard’s writing workshops, the Advocate had poets edit with fiction writers, a unique dynamic that Hitzig says helps to integrate different literary forms in a way that was very valuable for those who attended. The workshops were so successful that the students hosted another round over the summer, and they were able to reach out to the community of Harvard researchers in the math and science departments who were on campus for the summer, people who Hitzig says wouldn’t otherwise be encouraged to write in their free time.
“People learn so much through their peers here, whether you’re formally part of an institution or not,” Hitzig says, pointing out that even if students are not part of a publication, it is still possible for them to be inspired by the kind of work that fellow writers are interested in studying.
Satire V takes the collaborative essence of a writing workshop to the extreme. Opening a copy of the comedic publication, you won’t find any individual bylines. Instead, students writing for the group come up with topic ideas collectively, edit over an email list, and then publish the humor pieces anonymously online. Alicia V. Mergenthaler ’15, one of two editors-in-chief, likes that articles for Satire V undergo so much editing.
“This fully collaborative process is really great,” Mergenthaler says. “Usually the piece is edited before it gets to the editors.”
Mergenthaler has been writing and editing for Satire V for three years and studies economics. Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, the current president of the publication, studies history. Both see their participation in “Satire V” as an opportunity to parody serious communications like a Harvard University Police Department alert email, a letter from the Dean, and the Crimson.
GOING IT ALONE
On the Office of Student Life website, there are over 15 writing-related groups, and these are only the officially recognized ones; that number does not include organizations like The Crimson that sustain themselves independently from the College. But even with the plethora of ways to get involved in writing with other students, there are those who choose to approach creative writing in a more individual setting.
“I personally never enjoyed creative writing classes,” Riley K. Carney ’15 says. “I like getting feedback when [I’m] ready for it.” Starting at age 15, Carney has published five books in her fantasy series.
For that reason, Carney decided not to add creative writing courses to her academic schedule, preferring to take her own time to produce stories. She is working on her next novel, a departure from her usual work that she describes as “a political thriller with a hint of mystical noir.” Even though she is constantly creating fiction, Carney chose to study government at Harvard, and she says she plans to write a thesis.
“You have to find a daily balance,” she says. “If I want to write, I have to write.” She blocks out mornings to work on fiction and will produce anywhere from 300 words to five pages in one day. This time commitment is something that other student writers find challenging. Hitzig says that dividing her time between academics and her work at the Advocate is not always easy.
For some, writing is a very individual craft—even after countless edits and critiques, the greatest sense of achievement might arise from quietly perfecting a poem or successfully helping a character to reach her goal. Others find the workshop environment necessary to jumpstart the creative process. “I don’t think I’d be able to motivate myself to write without a class,” Robinson says.
Whether writing is a social or solitary pursuit, Harvard provides environments primed for both dispositions in the hopes that the next Thoreau, Cummings, or Updike will emerge from its halls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I’ll remind you that House Republicans have now voted to defund Obamacare over 40 times knowing full well that the Democratic Senate would never accede. Not to mention that the man whose name is on the bill probably wouldn’t be keen on defunding his one (and basically only) achievement.
Granted, some insanities are worse than others. Casual conspiracy theorists are a tolerable mainstay of nearly every Thanksgiving dinner after all. It’s less amusing when loony Uncle Bobby is elected to Congress (Louie Gohmert, I’m looking at you).
The cause célèbre for congressional Republicans is a courageous and noble crusade against expanded healthcare coverage for Americans. Under the banner of fiscal conservatism, Republicans have committed to the solemn task of threatening to shut down the government and default on the debt.
“It only takes one with passion—look at Rosa Parks, Lech Walesa, Martin Luther King,” Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, actually said, deftly equating the struggles for civil rights, worker solidarity, and bankrupting the poor and disenfranchised.
In the other chamber, the fight is being led by Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican wunderkind and tea partier extraordinaire, who is promising to “fight at every step to stop the biggest job killer in America.” Obamacare might be the biggest job killer in America if you excluded Ted Cruz’s Congress, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will slash economic growth by 1.5 percent because of its ill-thought-out fiscal policies. Remember the halcyon days when sequestration was an impossibly idiotic bargaining chip looming on the distant future instead of the norm?
I note in passing that Cruz is also the man who thinks the United Nations will use a secretive Agenda 21 to destroy private property, endorses states forming a compact to nullify Obamacare, and made an entire campaign ad about a successful execution.
The campaign to sabotage, defund, or maim the upcoming healthcare implementation on October 1 has devolved to Batman-level villainy. Governors refuse to bring more dollars into states through Medicaid expansions. Some states are imposing laws that restrict outreach and education about the law.
Best of all, a Koch-funded enterprise, un-ironically named Generation Opportunity, is aimed at discouraging young Americans from signing up for health insurance (and thus incurring a tax penalty) through ads featuring a creepy Uncle Sam who apparently will be federally mandated to lurk under exam tables if Obamacare succeeds.
In keeping with the people-first theme, Republicans also voted on Thursday to cut the food stamps program by $40 billion over the next 10 years.
"This bill is designed to give people a hand when they need it most,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said as he passed a bill designed to give people a finger when they need a hand most.
“Most people don't choose to be on food stamps. Most people want a job,” he continued. Unfortunately, people who want jobs but can’t find one still want food.
But never mind that 92 percent of food stamps recipients are children, the elderly, the disabled, or adults who are already working—the program must be cut to punish the freeloaders in the same way that the Pentagon’s funding would be slashed in the case of collateral damage.
Congressman Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, even justified the cuts in biblical terms, quoting Thessalonians 3:10 and writing, “If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.” Interestingly, the exact verse was a favorite of Vladimir Lenin’s, who called it “the practical commandment of socialism.” And we all know how that ended.
It takes quite some chutzpah: Republicans enact (blackmail, if we are being honest) counterproductive fiscal policies that keep people out of work, then blame the people who are out of work for the country’s economic woes. Oh, and then take food from 3.8 million people.
But we haven’t even started the true negotiations yet.
Now there is a whole array of guns for congressional conservatives to point at the government’s head, from forcing a government shutdown this October to a potentially ruinous default on America’s debt unless their demands are met. Like defunding Obamacare and requiring that the Keystone XL pipeline be built.
Yet these people are actually elected officials—amazingly, a sizable portion of the country agrees with this party.
To paraphrase Baudelaire, the finest trick the Republicans ever pulled was convincing the country that the greatest threats to the nation are people receiving food and healthcare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the summer, I had the opportunity to sit in on a new summer Spanish program at Harvard Medical School which addressed a fundamental need in healthcare: the ability to communicate with patients. Run by AES World Languages and Cultures Institute (where I was interning), the classes were tailored to the medical field, so vocabulary was health-related and grammar exercises featured hospital vocabulary. The goal was to teach doctors to hold basic, health-related conversations in Spanish with patients directly, without relying on an interpreter. I came to realize that teaching languages in medical schools is an important piece of providing widespread access to healthcare, and one that could act as a vital supplement to the policies already in place regarding medical interpreting.
Medical interpreting is undoubtedly most vital in emergency situations: The need for medical care is urgent, time is vital, and the lack of communication could be fatal. The U.S. has legislation in place to address this need—healthcare providers that receive federal funding are required to provide interpreters so that a language barrier won’t get in the way of basic medical treatment.
A few weeks ago I experienced firsthand what an emergency situation feels like with a language barrier. My mother fell down the stairs while we were in Germany and (we found out later) fractured a vertebra in her neck. I suddenly realized I didn’t know how to call an ambulance and wouldn’t be able to say more than our address if I could somehow get someone on the phone. We were incredibly fortunate that my aunt (whom we were visiting) lives nearby and has an extensive medical vocabulary in German. Even so, the inability to communicate in a high-stress, high-stakes situation renders you stricken and powerless in a unique and terrifying way. Language service in emergency situations is invaluable, and the U.S. is right to focus its attention first and foremost on interpreting in a hospital setting.
However, the need for language services in healthcare does not stop with trips to the ER. Over 20 percent of Americans speak a language other than English at home, and 8.7 percent speak English “less than well,” according to the 2011 U.S. Census Bureau survey. There is a wide variety of medical services one is likely to need, and with a shortage of interpreters and a broad mix of languages spoken there is ample opportunity for non-native speakers to fall through the cracks. Often, even if a patient speaks enough English not to require an interpreter, having one could still help because of the nuances in language on both ends: Doctors need detailed descriptions of symptoms, and patients need to understand diagnoses and follow medical advice exactly. I have seen non-native English speakers I know leave the doctor’s office confused about their diagnosis, or come home from physical therapy in a great deal of pain because they couldn’t adequately communicate what was wrong.
There is also the matter of insurance coverage—many people struggle with instructions on forms or have difficulty making themselves understood to representatives over the phone. Dealing with medical records and paperwork can be complicated, and miscommunications can cause serious problems down the line.  Some states have instituted policies that make this process easier. For example, California requires insurance companies to provide patients with translations of important paperwork, and some states have instituted a mechanism that allows federal aid to pay for language services. These policies make a huge impact on the accessibility of healthcare and will hopefully spread to a larger number of states.
Legislative steps, however, often take time to implement and have logistical complications with altering a system that is already in place. As of now, most states do not have these measures, so acquiring translated documents and getting funding for interpreting are not options for the majority of Americans. Training doctors in foreign languages directly—even if it is conversational and health-related rather than terminology-oriented—cuts out the middle man and makes a non-native English speaker’s experience slightly easier (and less costly).
Learning languages is a sound business strategy for doctors, as well. In the setting of a private practice where patients choose whom to see, it is a good way to make your services useful to a larger number of people. If there is only one doctor in a given town who speaks Haitian Creole, he is very likely to get referrals from within the Haitian community. I know that in my hometown, for example, the Russian-speaking community is fairly close-knit, and most Russian speakers I know could recommend a Russian-speaking person for just about any service, be it a haircut or SAT prep. Doctors with experience in a foreign language are able to expand their practices and better meet the needs of their communities.
Teaching medical students the basics of languages with large communities of speakers is a relatively simple proposition. It doesn’t require a large-scale system overhaul, and it can be implemented at the local level in languages that are regionally important. By simply instituting a language requirement in medical schools (or offering courses run by outside organizations, as with AES), we can increase patient trust, improve the quality of care, and play a role in integrating immigrant communities that are often isolated by a removable language barrier.

It is no secret that Catholicism has been struggling to maintain its traditional relevance in the United States and parts of Europe. The number of Europeans identifying as Catholics has been decreasing since 1975 and despite the fact that America still remains far more religious than its European counterparts, approximately a third of Americans raised Catholic no longer identify as such. Even in the Catholic bastions of Latin America the percentage of Catholics is declining as well. Perhaps this decline in Catholic affiliation can be attributed to Pope Benedict XVI’s vision of a “leaner, smaller, purer church,” his efforts to maintain strict positions on homosexuality, or the persistent specter of sex abuse in the Church. However, Benedict’s successor Pope Francis I seems intent on reversing the Vatican’s insular and non-conciliatory past and intent on making the positive values of Catholicism more accessible to the changing global demographics. We welcome Pope Francis’s new approach to the papacy and hope that his sentiments come to be shared by the rest of the Church hierarchy.
Pope Francis made headlines in July when he publicly told reporters, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?” Last week Pope Francis reiterated his belief that the Church has become too “obsessed” with the Church’s non-fundamental dogma such as abortion, gay marriage, and contraception. When Pope Francis said that “the teaching of the Church, for that matter, is clear and I am a son of the Church,” he made it apparent that the Church wasn’t going to change basic positions on controversial issues any time soon. He did, however, assert that “the dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent” and that instead of remaining “obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently,” the Catholic Church should focus its efforts on fostering a “home of all, not a small chapel that can hold only a small group of selected people.” Additionally, Pope Francis indirectly suggested that women should claim a larger role in the Church, acknowledging that “the feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions.”
We understand the constraints on the Pope’s ability and personal religious desire to change Church doctrine to become more conciliatory to marginalized groups, such as the gay community and women. Because of these challenges we commend his push toward openness all the more so. Hopefully, as the Pope makes it clear that controversial issues such as gay marriage and abortion are less important to Church teachings than Jesus’s foundational teachings of kindness and goodness, the Catholic Church will be seen as less as a warden of obscure doctrine and more as a positive force for the promotion of brotherly love and compassion for the less fortunate.

As you walk around campus today, you will see Divest Harvard’s posters.
Over the past year, Divest Harvard has mobilized an activist campaign on campus. The movement’s goal is to divest Harvard’s endowment from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies. Why? Because climate change is an issue that defines our generation’s future. The fossil fuel industry’s business model depends upon continuing to extract fossil fuel deposits—the major contributor to climate change—while avoiding accountability for the consequences of its products or of its extraction methods. Our generation and those that follow will pay the price as the industry uses its political clout to block national climate legislation. Divestment would demonstrate that we do not support an industry whose business model corrupts our government and threatens our future.
Over the past year, Divest Harvard has given students at Harvard University the ability to vote on a series of referenda calling for divestment. In these elections, 72 percent of College students and 67 percent of Harvard Law students supported the measure. In addition, over 170 faculty and over 540 alumni have raised their voices for divestment. Unfortunately, the leaders of the University have brushed aside these voices. President Faust says that divestment is only used in “extraordinarily rare circumstances.” Nannerl Keohane, a trustee serving on the Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, told us in our meeting with the CCSR that we should encourage fossil fuel companies to change instead of divesting. She went so far as to suggest that we should “thank BP” for their efforts in developing renewable energy.
Today we say to President Faust: Climate change is an “extraordinarily rare circumstance,” and it demands the extraordinary action of divestment. To Dr. Keohane: BP sold its wind farms six days before you advised thanking them and exited the solar industry two years ago. As long as BP and similar companies continue to focus on fossil fuel extraction despite what we know about climate change, we should not be thanking them.
Today we say: We must divest.
Divestment is a tactic that can effect meaningful change. The goals of the movement are twofold. First, we are highlighting the destructive and deeply irresponsible practices of the fossil fuel industry. If an industry refuses to support the future of life on Earth, then we must refuse to support the industry. Second, divestment sends a strong political message that climate change is a crisis that needs to be addressed today; it creates the public platform necessary to hold politicians accountable to the voices of their constituents.
In many cases, it would make sense to use the power of shareholder advocacy to change the actions of a company. If a certain company treats its workers unfairly, shareholders should appeal to the company to change its ways. In this case, we are asking companies to change their fundamental business model. Shareholder pressure will not be enough. If companies will not stop willingly, we have no choice but to divest.
Divestment is the best way for conscientious shareholders like Harvard to send the message that our society must no longer support a fossil fuel addiction. We've realized that we cannot rely on fossil fuel energy without causing irreversible climate change. Yet the entrenched power of the fossil fuel industry has left us with no way out. Fossil fuel lobbies block almost all legislation aimed at breaking our dependence on fossil fuels, delaying the transition to a low-carbon energy economy. We are left with few affordable and widespread alternatives to fossil fuels despite almost universal agreement that we must slash our carbon emissions in order to combat climate change. Harvard cannot be complicit in this industry’s practices.
The fossil fuel industry’s culture of political hostage-taking, obstructionism, lack of accountability, and unacceptable climate destruction has continued for far too long. Our generation needs and deserves real dialogue from our leaders, and Harvard needs to be at the forefront of this dialogue.
This semester, Divest Harvard is calling on President Faust to appear alongside other trustees, students, alumni, and faculty in a public forum on divestment to discuss Harvard’s role in pushing for the political solutions we need to combat climate change. Our future is at stake, and our community deserves the opportunity to ask questions and to hear real answers about the opportunities divestment would grant us.
Our campaign continues to grow day by day, and our call to action is urgent. We call upon students, faculty, and alumni to join us in building a powerful movement against the fossil fuel industry.

Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis on Monday morning confirmed reports that he will resign from his position within 60 days, but said he has yet to decide if he will then accept a fellowship at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
“It is time to go,” Davis said at a press conference at the Boston Police Department headquarters, which was attended by about 30 journalists. He pointed to the fact that his seven-year tenure at the department has been double the average duration of police commissioners’ terms nationwide.
Davis also remarked that his decision is connected to Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s announcement that he will not run for a sixth term in office.
“When the Mayor leaves, you have to reassess,” Davis said. “That is what I’m doing.”
In regard to his future plans, Davis said that he is currently holding multiple offers, and that it will take him a “couple of months” to eventually come to a decision. However, Davis affirmed that he is “heavily leaning” toward accepting the position at the IOP.
“I have always wanted to have a connection with Harvard University,” Davis said. “I am very proud to say that I’ve been offered a fellowship.”
Further specifications on what the fellowship would include and what his focus would be at the University were not disclosed, but the IOP confirmed that Davis has been offered a position.
“We are pleased Commissioner Davis is considering further engagement with Harvard’s Institute of Politics and would welcome his participation,” wrote Esten Perez, communications director for the IOP, in an email to The Crimson.
Davis declined to comment on rumors that he might be lined up as a possible successor to Janet Napolitano, who stepped down as Secretary of Homeland Security in September to become president of the University of California system. Since Napolitano’s departure, Rand Beers has led the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as acting secretary.
Davis’s tenure as police commissioner has not been without controversy. The Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers has accused Davis of racial favoritism in assigning promotions to the department officers, criticizing the underrepresentation of minority officers in recent rounds of promotions, as well as the absence of minority officers at the levels of district heads. The group called on Davis to resign through a vote of no-confidence in early August.
During Monday’s press conference, Davis defended his track record on diversity and affirmed that his decision to leave has nothing to do with those accusations. Davis also said that he leaves the department “with success.”
“I am proud of my record. Diversity is one of the most controversial issues in our society,” Davis said. “I hope my successors will keep diversity high in their list of priorities.”
Davis cited the murder of 22-year-old Mission Hill resident Rebecca Payne in 2008 and last April’s Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent manhunt as some of the most difficult moments of his tenure as commissioner.
Boston mayoral candidate Daniel F. Conley, who was also present at the press conference, spoke in praise of Davis’s leadership in the face of such situations.
“[Davis] is one of the top police managers in the country,” Conley said. “The next commissioner will have very big shoes to fill.”

Just a few swipes across a smartphone touch screen will now give students answers to their dining hall-related questions. Thanks to a new update to the Harvard Mobile smartphone app, the dining section now includes comprehensive nutritional data and updated hours for all of Harvard University Dining Services’ dishes and dining halls.
"We make every effort to make information readily available," said Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications. "For those individuals interested in this information, [the app] provides one more great and easy way to access it."
HUDS used to display nutritional information directly on food labels in the servery, but stopped doing so in 2008 when students and parents raised concerns that public display of nutritional information might instigate or exacerbate eating disorders. At the time, students could still look up nutritional information on the HUDS website or at kiosks in the dining halls. Martin said that including nutritional data in the app makes the information more easily accessible to students who want it without making calories or serving size a focal point of the dining experience.
"I think it’s great that HUDS is using technology and taking into account student input to improve the dining experience," Matt P. Abrams ’15 said.
Although most students interviewed for this article were unaware about the changes to the app, they expressed enthusiasm for the adjustments.
"It sounds pretty cool. I wouldn’t necessarily use the nutritional information part, but I would use the dining times," Susan Arias ’14 said.
The Harvard Mobile app used to display expected opening and closing times for all of Harvard’s dining halls based on a general daily schedule, but it now features more customized timing information that reflects date-specific closings.
"For example, if a House is going to be closed for the holiday break or for a private event, the app will show that dining hall is not open," Martin said.
Harvard Mobile was launched in the fall of 2010 as a University-wide initiative and included a course catalog, directory, campus map, event calendar, news center, and student dining portal. Links to track shuttle routes and access library information were added in October and November of that year, respectively.
Originally designed only for the iPhone, Harvard Mobile was updated in January 2013 to Harvard Mobile 2.0, which has a new look, more features, and Android compatibility.
"It’s a great tool for the University as a whole," Martin said. "We’re glad to be part of it."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Allston Task Force requested an extension to submit comments on Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston at a packed HATF meeting Monday night.
The formal deadline for comments on the IMP that the University filed with the city of Boston in July is Tuesday, Sept. 24. The task force agreed to submit a finalized report of IMP comments and a prioritized list of community benefits to the Boston Redevelopment Authority by Oct. 2.
Task force member Tim McHale sent out a 30-page report over an Allston-Brighton email list Monday morning, laying out the task force’s comments on the IMP as well as a proposal of a community benefits package focusing on housing, education, employment, and open space. As the meeting began, some task force members expressed excitement about the possibility of submitting the recommendations. However, as the night progressed, an increasing number of task force and community members began advocating for an extension.
Some members of the task force said they believed the language in the report needed to be clarified before submission.
"It’s very hard to tell what we support and don’t support and what we want the BRA to do," task force member Harry E. Mattison said.
Task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said that the report’s vague language pertaining to future negotiations between the University and the community "makes the document effectively useless."
Not all task force members were so critical of the report.
"To have put this [document] together…in just 60 days is a phenomenal task," said task force member Bruce E. Houghton, though he acknowledged that the report would benefit from more time.
The task force members agreed that a clearer internal consensus among themselves would help them clarify the language of their recommendations. Proposals to be finalized include the mitigation of increased traffic, opposition to particular building plans, and the promise of a community voice in Harvard’s future developments.
Associate Vice President for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey emphasized the need to keep the comment process on schedule, noting that the IMP finalizes only the zoning plans for Harvard’s development proposals, but leaves room for future discussions of specifics.
"We feel this discussion would not benefit from three or four weeks of delay," Casey said. "The zoning aspects are in place."
Ray V. Mellone, chairman of the task force, said that he was opposed to requesting an extension to the comment period, saying that it would appear to the community and the city as if the task force were "foot-dragging."
Despite Mellone’s objection, Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the BRA, granted a nine-day extension.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
European human rights scholars and Harvard professors met Monday at Harvard Law School’s Milstein Conference Center to discuss the divergent European and American perspectives on human rights.
Entitled "Divided by a Common Heritage: Human Rights in Europe and the United States," the conference featured a number of international speakers who talked about the fundamental differences that separate two entities’ outlooks on the issue.
Addressing the seemingly paradoxical title of the conference, Law School Lecturer and organizer of the event Mindy J. Roseman explained that the name was borrowed from Winston Churchill, who coined the phrase, "Two nations divided by a common language."
Speaking at the event’s introductory panel, "Does Context Matter? How and Why Europe and the U.S. Differ on Human Rights," former Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe Maud de Boer-Buquicchio said that she thought the First Amendment offered more protection to free speech than did the European Convention on Human Rights, which includes more limitations to speech.
Law School professor emeritus Frank I. Michelman offered a contrasting view of the difference with a metaphor.
"In the cathedral of American constitutional law, human rights occupy the place of a flying buttress," Michelman said.
He added that Constitutional rights, not human rights, take precedence in our domestic courts, unlike in Europe where human rights can be used directly in judicial arguments.
The conference included several other panels, each focusing on different aspects of human rights.
Leading a panel on racial discrimination, Sonja Licht, director of the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence in Serbia, said that ethnic minorities in Europe, including immigrants from the Middle East and the Roma people of Central and Eastern Europe, currently face serious discrimination and violence.
"Interestingly enough, Roma women face even more discrimination," she said. "They are kind of the lowest on the food chain."
Licht also added that anti-Semitism still remains a serious problem throughout Europe, something she said she has experienced personally. "One of the most famous fascist websites names me as the second most dangerous Jew in Serbia," she said.
A separate panel at the conference focused on privacy in the age of technology.
Georgetown Law School professor Julie E. Cohen ’86 said that the "unaccountable power" of technology could prove dangerous to modern human rights.
"We shouldn’t be worried about an Orwellian type of surveillance; we should be worried about a Western, democratic form of surveillance, which is seen as more efficient and as innovation," she said.
Luise Druke, a visiting scholar in the audience, said she found the discussion on human rights and cyberspace one of the most interesting topics of the day. "On one hand [the Internet] may help to diffuse power, but on the other hand it might help to control it," she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard community linked hands and joined voices to the Kenyan national anthem on the steps of Memorial Church Monday night in memory of those affected by Saturday’s shooting in Nairobi.
The vigil, hosted by the Harvard African Student Association, drew about 30 people who commemorated friends, family, and fellow Kenyans lost or injured when masked gunmen opened fire against civilians at the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, a little after noon on Saturday. The militant Somali group al-Shabab has assumed responsibility for the violence, which claimed the lives of dozens of civilians, including Elif Yavuz, a 2013 graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health, and Mbugua Mwangi, the nephew of Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta.
"Thank you for coming to support us, " said Edwin Magema ’15, a member of HASA and a Kenyan native. "As Kenyans, as Africans, united with one another."
Many of the attendees knew individuals involved in the attack, while others had ties to Nairobi and attended the vigil in solidarity with their community members back home. Some students also attended an additional vigil at Adams House.
"We stand with Kenya," said Prince Antwi ’14, another member of HASA. "In the words of Apostle Paul to the Corinthians: ‘We pray the God of all comfort may comfort those who have been afflicted.’"
News of the attack shocked the global community with its barbarity, especially in shopping center frequented for its energy and apparent safety. Still, many at the vigil expressed hope and gratitude that the Kenyan population will recover from the tragedy.
"I am really proud of how our people were able to respond," said Lorena O., who graduated from MIT in 2012 and requested that her name not be used in full. "Though the [shooters’] intention was to terrify us, it only made us stronger."
HASA has initiated a media campaign called "Harvard for Kenya," through which students can send video condolences to the Kenyan community. According to Princess Daisy M. A. Akita ’15, these videos will be sent to local media houses in Boston and spread throughout the Harvard community. Akita said that HASA hopes the distribution of these videos will spread the message of Kenya’s tragedy and encourage Kenyan rehabilitation.
"[We hope] that things will fall back into normality," said Magema.
As of Monday night, a military assault begun on Saturday has secured most of the mall, and most hostages have been evacuated from the complex, according to The New York Times.

Tuesday marks the first time in 20 years that Boston will vote on a mayoral ballot that does not include so-called "Mayor for Life" Thomas M. Menino. Instead, Bostonians will choose two of 12 candidates in the open preliminary elections to advance to a general election on Nov. 5.
Among these candidates is Boston City Councillor John R. Connolly ’95, a Democrat who has emerged as the front-runner by a narrow margin, according to the Suffolk University/Boston Herald mayoral poll.
The Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard College Republicans have not endorsed any candidates for the primary, according to leaders in both of the organizations.
In a race in which 11 of the 12 contenders are Democrats, many members of the John Connolly for Boston Mayor Campaign chose to advocate for Connolly largely because of his strong stance on educational policy, according to Lee Morrow ’15, a member of the communications team for the campaign committee. Connolly was formerly a teacher at the Boston Renaissance Charter School.
"[Connolly’s] going to be the education mayor," Morrow said, "He wants to give a good education to every student in Boston, and he’s pragmatic about it."
This characteristic has defined Connolly’s position on expanding charter schools, an issue which has been controversial in the city, especially among teachers’ unions.
"He wants to increase the cap on charter schools because studies have shown that would help, but he also wants to get strong teachers at public [non-charter] schools," Morrow said.
According government professor Paul E. Peterson, director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s program on education policy and governance, the expansion of charter schools is an issue of vital importance for Boston.
"Public school performance is low," Peterson said. "Recent studies have shown that the charter schools are way outperforming them."
Morrow says that education has been the number one concern of voters contacted by the committee, especially those in West Roxbury, from where Connolly hails and the Connolly campaign committee holds its office.
The committee has been canvassing, hosting debates, and compiling information about candidates’ platforms to reach voters in West Roxbury and elsewhere in Boston.
"It all depends on how many people get out [to vote] tomorrow," Morrow said. "We’ve got constant canvassing. It’s going to be a real shoe-leather campaign."
The committee also has been working with local Connolly supporters, who form a major portion of the canvassing committees for this campaign.
Though Marrow and the committee feel fairly confident that Connolly will advance to the general election, several factors make tomorrow’s exact results difficult to predict. Five African-American candidates are in the race, including one who would be the first female mayor of Boston. The race has also been noted in the media for being remarkably positive, with little to no smear campaigning.
Tomorrow’s ballot includes only one Republican candidate, David J. Wyatt, also a former teacher. In recent polls, Wyatt has lagged behind the 11 Democrats with only 0 to 1 percent, according to the Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll.
Many in Boston have had personal connections to the candidates, including Christopher J. Riley ’17, a West Roxbury residents who has deep ties to his Boston neighborhood.
Riley said that, like many in his neighborhood, he knows Connolly personally.
"I went to school with his son, and we played baseball together," Riley said.
Riley, a registered Republican, said he will be voting for Connolly tomorrow largely because of this personal connection.
"On a state level, I’m more concerned about character," Riley said.

Juliet N. Macchi ’12, a former Lowell House resident who loved art, film, and skydiving, was killed alongside her mother as a result of an automobile accident on Saturday night near Plymouth, Mass.
Macchi and her mother Susan Brightman Macchi had been driving home from a Red Sox game when their car experienced a head-on collision with another vehicle. Macchi’s mother died instantaneously, while Macchi died shortly after being transported to Jordan Hospital, according to police.
News of Macchi’s death was distributed to Lowell House residents Monday in an email from House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin.
“She had an ebullient spirit and a wonderful sense of humor,” the House Masters wrote. “She had a great talent for friendship; she was loyal, dependable, and loving. Her friends loved her very much and will miss her dearly.”
In their email, the House Masters also listed Macchi’s diverse array of interests during her time at Harvard. Macchi was a dedicated Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, they wrote, though she also found time to work as Dorm Crew chief and belly dance with Harvard’s Middle Eastern Dance Company.
In a phone interview, Eck recounted her time as Macchi’s professor for the course, United States in the World 32: “The World’s Religions in Multicultural America: Case Studies in Religious Pluralism.”
“She was someone who always seemed to have just a lovely, bright countenance, and I think that’s because she was someone who really did enjoy life,” Eck said.
Many of Macchi’s friends and acquaintances echoed this sentiment, also describing her as “free-spirited,” “creative,” “unique,” and “heavily involved” in many different activities during her time at the College.
Eck and one of Macchi’s friends, Breeanna Elliott ’15, also said that Macchi was very close to her mother.
Eck said that at the time of her death, Macchi had been working at a Dunkin’ Donuts location in Carver, Mass., and preparing to move with her mother to California to pursue her dream of working as a grip on a film set.
Macchi and her mother are survived by Macchi’s three older brothers, Matt, Mike, and Richard Macchi, as well as Macchi’s father.
Macchi’s death has been met with an outpouring of love and support from those who knew her. Almost 100 people have posted on her Facebook wall since the news of the accident broke, and a tribute in her honor is scheduled for Thursday at 8 p.m. in Lowell House Junior Common Room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 25, 2013, at 6:02 a.m.
The Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins franchise at the corner of Mass Ave. and Bow Street that was expected to close this week will now remain open.
The signs previously noting the location’s closing on the door and inside were no longer posted Tuesday morning, just days after the announcement of the imminent closure of the joint store.
The lease, which expired this year, was being resold by real estate company Colliers International, but now will remain in the hands of franchise owner David G. Carvalho, who also operates three other Harvard Square Dunkin’ Donuts locations within the Riverside Management Group.
Last week’s announcement of the store’s closing elicited a passionate response on Harvard’s campus. Christine A. Maroti ’14 said the unexpected news that the store will remain open “made her day.”
Maroti praised the tendency of the Bow Street Dunkin’ Donuts to provide cups made of styrofoam, rather than paper.
“I was really worried that I would have to go to the Eliot Dunkin’ Donuts to get my hot coffee, so now I’m really happy that I don’t,” she said.
Ron Friesen, a Harvard Extension School student, said he frequents the Bow Street location each day.
“I come here before class usually to read some of my pre-reading and to have a coffee and relax a bit after work,” Friesen said.
“I really appreciate this spot because it’s very close to where I need to be for my class, so I’m glad they’re staying open.”
This location is one of four Dunkin’ Donuts in Harvard Square, but the only one that includes a Baskin Robbins.
The storefront also gained fame after being featured in the 1997 film “Good Will Hunting” in a scene in which former Harvard undergraduate Matt Damon slammed a phone number against the window and asked, “How do you like them apples?”
“I’m absolutely thrilled. They’re really nice people in that store, and it’s a convenient location,” said patron Joe R. Mazur ‘15.  “If I can indulge a cheesy quote, I really like them apples.”

Harvard’s endowment surged to $32.7 billion during the last fiscal year, with an annual rate of return of 11.3% on its investments, University administrators announced Tuesday. Those returns, which apply to fiscal year 2013, mark vast improvement from the previous fiscal year, during which the endowment’s value declined slightly to $30.7 billion.
The $32.7 billion figure is still lower than the high-water mark of $36.9 billion that the endowment reached before the financial crisis of 2008, when it plummeted $11 billion. Similarly, the rate of return is not as high as it was in the early 2000’s. Even so, if this year’s rate of return were to persist for the foreseeable future, the endowment would break its previous record in just a few years.
“Thanks to this talented team we have made a strong recovery since the global economic downturn of 2008-2009, and our outperformance this year alone contributed about $600 million of additional value to the portfolio over and above the markets, net of all fees,” said Jane L. Mendillo, president and CEO of Harvard Management Company, in an HMC report released on Tuesday afternoon. HMC manages the University’s endowment, while the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—determines the proportion of the endowment that is distributed for University operations.
Mendillo’s report explained that the “endowment” refers to a collection of more than 12,000 funds, many of which are restricted by their benefactors to specific purposes. Its total value depends not only on investment returns, but also on the size of annual distributions to the University’s operating budget, as well as new donations.
During the last fiscal year, which ended on June 30 of this year, each of the endowment’s five asset classes saw positive returns, with public equities leading the pack at 16.3 percent. Interestingly, public equities were the only asset class to experience negative returns during the previous year. Within the public equities class, domestic and foreign equities did particularly well—each with returns exceeding 20 percent—while funds invested in emerging markets underperformed HMC’s internal benchmark, at 2.3 percent.
Although most peer Universities have yet to release endowment figures for FY 2013, Bowdoin, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology saw returns of 16 percent, 14.4 percent and 11.1 percent respectively. During a similar timeframe, the Standard and Poor’s 500 index, which tracks the stock market, gained approximately 18.5 percent.
According to Mendillo’s report, the team of investors prioritizes “growth, sufficient liquidity, and appropriate risk management” when managing Harvard’s endowment. In line with these aims, HMC, under Mendillo’s leadership since 2008, has made a series of changes to its policy portfolio, shifting toward increased portfolio allocation in equities, decreased allocation in fixed income, and renewed focus on natural resources to replace publicly-traded commodities.
Mendillo also noted that, in the past year, HMC has made key personnel changes, hiring Morgan Stanley executive Jake Xia as the new Chief Risk Officer and tapping Jameela Pedicini, a former manager at the United Nations, for the newly-created position of Vice President for Sustainable Investing.
“The HMC team produced strong results at a time when the revenue streams that have traditionally supported institutions of higher education have been under increasing pressure,” said University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 in a press release, adding that HMC beat its benchmark Policy Portfolio for the fourth consecutive year.

Intisar A. Rabb will join the Harvard Law School faculty as a tenured professor this spring, a rare tenure offer to a previously non-tenured hire at a school that tends to offer tenure to its own faculty members.
Rabb, currently an associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies and Law at New York University Law School, served as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School last fall, during which time she taught a survey course on Islamic law and a seminar on theories of statutory interpretation.
As a full-time faculty member, Rabb plans to teach Islamic law, comparative law, and advanced legislation. She will also be a faculty director of the Islamic Legal Studies Program.
Her ties to Harvard stem from 2010 when Rabb first collaborated with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society on a project aimed at strengthening academic discussions about Islamic law.
Rabb said that Islamic law often lacks “the information that specialists in the field can bring to the conversation and related comparative law understandings, media content production, or policy determinations.”
Law School professor of practice Urs Gasser, the executive director of the Berkman Center, worked with Rabb on the initative. “We have been exploring new ways together in which objective information on Islamic law, as well as a diverse range of scholarly opinions on this topic, can be made accessible online to a broader audience, including reporters and journalists,” he said.
While the project is still being developed and has not officially launched, Rabb and the Berkman Center will continue to work on the initiative after she joins the faculty. “I am excited by the prospects for collaboration on other research projects and programs with centers at Harvard and beyond on the many...areas [of] overlapping interest,” Rabb said.
Gasser said he was excited by Rabb’s appointment and looks forward to working with her in the future. “Professor Rabb is not only a leading expert in Islamic law, but also an innovative thinker, wonderful colleague, and great collaborator,” he said.
Law School professor Yochai Benkler, faculty co-director of the Berkman Center, said he first met Rabb during a series of workshops at Yale Law School. “She struck me then as brilliant, and her writings since then have more than confirmed this,” he said. “I'm really looking forward to having her here as a colleague.”
The announcement of Harvard Law’s newest faculty member comes as the Law School celebrates the 60th anniversary of its first female graduates. Rabb’s appointment brings the number of female tenured professors at the Law School to 18, with women still representing about a fifth of the faculty.

CLARIFICATION: Sept. 24, 2013
An earlier version of this article and its accompanying headline stated that Intisar A. Rabb represents a rare lateral hire for Harvard Law School. To clarify, while it is not uncommon for the Law School to hire tenured professors from other institutions, the Law School rarely offers tenure to previously non-tenured hires.

When Juliet N. Macchi ’12 first approached Alexis C. “AC” Gomez ’13 with an invitation to go skydiving, Gomez reacted with pure terror. But after Macchi insisted repeatedly that they make the jump together, Gomez eventually allayed her fears and agreed.
“I always thought of her as someone who was never really afraid to do things,” Gomez said. “She always wanted to take that chance. It was very much her mentality on life: even if something was scary, just jump, just go for it.” 
Macchi, a former resident of Lowell House and a concentrator in Visual and Environmental Studies, was killed alongside her mother Susan Brightman Macchi as a result of an automobile accident late Saturday night near Plymouth, Mass. Macchi was 23.
The women were making their way home from a Red Sox game when a vehicle collided with their car head-on. The crash instantaneously killed Brightman Macchi, and Macchi died shortly after being transported to nearby Jordan Hospital, police said. 
Friends and a professor all remembered Macchi as a free-spirited individual and artist who shied away from convention and indulged in her own unique passions. 
“Juliet was really an artist in life and in everything she did,” said Diana L. Eck, Lowell House master and Macchi’s former professor. 
Many who knew her recounted Juliet’s passion for the arts, especially as manifested in her senior thesis project. According to Eck, Macchi created for her project an installation piece consisting of a foam bridge and “literally thousands upon thousands of paper stars,” which she then affixed to the bridge using small pins. 
In describing the piece, Macchi’s friend Breeanna M. Elliott ’15 said that one of Macchi’s goals for the work was to intimate that “anyone can do art, and anyone can enjoy it.” 
Those who knew Macchi noted that the focus and dedication she applied to her thesis was characteristic of her work ethic in every activity in which she involved herself. 
“If she loved something, she was going to find a way to do it,” Gomez said. 
In particular, friends noted Macchi’s passion for skydiving, which was a defining part of her personality. According to her peers, Macchi spent almost every weekend jumping from planes.
In a speech she gave at Lowell House before her graduation, Macchi explained the reason she enjoyed skydiving so much.
“I want a chance to be swept along by events beyond my control,” she said. “To stop worrying about what was the right or the smart thing to do, and give myself a chance to breathe, to get to know more the person I've become.”
After graduation, Macchi attended the Burning Man festival in Nevada, before taking up a job as a shift manager at a Dunkin’ Donuts location in Carver, Mass. Macchi and her mother were preparing to move to California this month, where Macchi intended to work as a grip on a film set, according to an email from Eck and Lowell co-House master Dorothy A. Austin sent to Lowell House residents Monday.
A number of friends noted that Macchi’s love for her mother was one of her most distinctive traits. Eck said that part of Macchi’s dedication to Dorm Crew stemmed from a desire to treat her mother to a cruise.
Macchi’s peers said that she extended the same love and compassion to her friends during her time at Harvard. 
“Right from the start it was clear that Juliet was a special and unique person,” wrote Margaret “Maggie” E. Geoga ’12, Macchi’s roomate through all four years of college, in an email to The Crimson.  “She was always positive, always looking for a silver lining or a way to make a tough situation better. She was an incredibly loyal friend and an important support for all of us whenever we needed her.”
Macchi and Geoga were joined in their sophomore year in Lowell by Marina M. A. Connelly ’12, together forming a trio that Eck described as “inseparable.”
“She was loyal and dedicated to the causes she chose and people she loved with a formidable tenacity,” Connelly wrote in an email. “I will always love her.”
Macchi and her mother are survived by Macchi’s father and Macchi’s three older brothers, Matt, Mike, and Richard Macchi. A tribute in Macchi’s honor will be held Thursday at 8 p.m. in Lowell House Junior Common Room.

Harvard shuttles will resume weekend morning service to and from the Quad beginning this upcoming Saturday, reversing a 2009 cut that halted Quad shuttle service before noon on Saturdays and Sundays.
Currently, while shuttles depart from the Quad approximately every 10 minutes from 7:50 a.m. to 3:50 p.m. on weekdays, they do not begin running until after 12 p.m. on weekends. The Undergraduate Council and the Office of Student Life announced the new extended schedule, which will restore weekend service between 8 a.m. and noon, in a press release Tuesday.
In an interview Tuesday afternoon, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich called the service extension a “great collaboration” between the UC, the OSL, and Harvard’s transportation services.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a UC representative who has advocated for increased shuttle service, said Tuesday he did not know how frequently shuttles will run on weekend mornings under the new schedule.
The weekend morning service was eliminated at the start of the 2009-2010 academic year as a compromise after students protested a 2009 proposal—part of a proposed $77 million budget cut package for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—that would have significantly cut late-night weekday service.
Since the cut of the weekend morning service took effect four years ago, the UC has solicited student opinions on the shuttle service through multiple surveys. Following one such survey from November 2012, two UC representatives, Goffard and Tyler J. Cusick ’14, authored a report based on student responses. The report advised reinstating weekend morning shuttle service and increasing the frequency of early evening shuttle service on weekdays, among other recommendations.
Some students also requested the return of morning shuttle service at a November 2012 open town hall meeting that included representation from Harvard’s transportation services.
Many students responded enthusiastically to the news of additional shuttle service.
“I think it’s fantastic, because a lot of students who live in the Quad have meetings or rehearsals in the mornings on the weekends,” said Claire R. Leibowicz ’16, a Pforzheimer House resident. “Having a shuttle…makes it way more convenient to get to the River.”
Cabot House resident Doo Young Na ’14 said that many times during the winter, he had to push back his morning meetings because there was no shuttle service. “It makes better sense to have morning shuttles if the school expects us to be more productive,” Na said.
Goffard, a Currier House resident, said he was “extremely, extremely thrilled and elated” by the return of the weekend morning service. He added that he “definitely” hopes to continue working toward increasing the frequency of shuttle service on weekday evenings.

Panelists at Monday’s discussion about the recent Supreme Court decision against gene patenting agreed that although patenting might provide incentives to aspiring innovators, it often hinders scientific progress, especially when it concerns the DNA sequences that are found within human bodies.
Students and professionals alike gathered in Austin Hall at the Harvard Law School to listen to a panel of six participants, each with different backgrounds and perspectives on the recent case in which the Court ruled that Myriad Genetics, a biotechnology firm in Utah, could not legally patent genes found in human DNA.
The panelists addressed the question posted by moderator and Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow: “What exactly is patentable?”
Tania Simoncelli, a former science advisor to the American Civil Liberties Union who guided the organization’s response to the case, said that patenting genes led to a monopoly over procedures on medicinally significant sections of DNA. This has further stalled development and treatment forp atients with potentially risky genes, she said.
“Separating a gene from naturally occurring DNA is not an active invention, and so should not be patentable,” Simoncelli said, adding that human gene patents, which now cover almost a fourth of the entire human genome, prevent outside development.
Eric S. Lander, founding director ofthe Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard,agreed with Simoncelli, saying that the Court’s decision represented asignificant victory.
“The stuff that exists in the natural world is the fodder for human invention. Discovery of a gene might win you a Nobel Prize, but it isn’t a new invention,” he said.
Harvard Law School professor I. Glenn Cohen also noted this distinction, adding that “genetically engineered bacteria, because they are artificially created, are in fact patentable, whereas the Supreme Court has decided that naturally occurring genes are not.”
Not all panelists agreed that the Court’s decision was entirely positive. Claire Laporte, partner at Foley Hoag, a Boston-based law firm, opposed the Court’s decision because it has made it more difficult for patent lawyers to determine whether a gene sequence or construct was indeed patentable.
“It’s troubling that there is a ‘special sauce’ that you need to have to qualify something as patentable,” Laporte said. “It muddles the legal lines of what is acceptable and what is not.”
Lander added that the decision made the legal issues about patenting genes murkier, but praised the decision for the implications it would have on further research.
“The fundamental result of the decision is a precedent that allows all innovators to use naturally found sequences of DNA and construct something that is truly noteworthy,” Lander said.

Junior quarterback Conner Hempel had some big shoes to fill when he started against San Diego Saturday afternoon. But that didn’t mean he would prepare any differently.
“Honestly, having the opportunity to start and play at the college level, there’s no time for [nerves],” Hempel said. “My mindset didn’t change much. I know now that I have a bigger role than I did last year. But I prepared every game last year like I was going to be the starting quarterback so it’s just the same preparation as before.”
Although Colton Chapple ’13 graduated last year, Hempel didn’t think twice about replacing the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Instead, he remained calm and led his team to a 42-20 victory, totaling 383 offensive yards (345 passing) in the Crimson’s opener.
Hempel only played in three games last season, but he was used to leading a successful team when he arrived at Harvard. He started for the Ryle High School Raiders in Union, Ky., beginning his sophomore year and led the team to the state semifinals as a senior, when he tallied over 1,000 total yards.
Last season, the quarterback passed for 165 total yards in his few opportunities on the field, but the mentoring he received from Chapple prepared him for what was to come, and allowed him to understand how to lead the team while throwing four touchdown passes on Saturday.
“I learned a lot being his backup last year, having the opportunity to room with him his senior spring when I was going through spring ball, and we got to watch film together,” Hempel said. “I learned how he saw the defense, how he made checks, how he got us in the right play and I saw how he carried himself around the team and that has helped me a lot.”
Hempel has also learned how to lead his team off the field since being named a starter, making sure to approach each of his teammates differently.
“We have good chemistry on the team so I know how to get each guy going at practice,” Hempel said. “I think that verbal leadership is probably the biggest difference for me from last year.”
Being on the receiving end of two touchdown throws from Hempel Saturday, sophomore wide out Andrew Fischer recognizes how his quarterback has stepped up to lead the team.
“We’ve really come together and meshed as an offensive unit,” Fischer said after Saturday’s game. “He’s just a great offensive leader. I think that’s what makes our offense so strong: a strong leader at quarterback.”
Hempel doesn’t attribute his team’s victory last weekend to his own success though; instead he turns to his teammates to point out their accomplishments.
“Once I saw the numbers at the end of the game, it was eye opening for me,” said Hempel, who had a 73.5 percent completion rate. “I wasn’t thinking about [the numbers] during the game; I was trying to run our offense. Fortunately, the defense was giving us the look that we needed and we executed well. Our receivers did their job. Our offensive line did their job.”
As the Crimson looks forward to starting Ivy League play Saturday evening against Brown, the team’s performance in its first game serves as a learning opportunity as well as a look at the team’s potential.
“[The win over San Diego] definitely gives us a lot of confidence,” Hempel said. “There were question marks on our team, just like there is with any team for their first game. A lot of them got answered. The first game we kind of set the tone for how the rest of the season is going to be as far as what kind of team we’re going to be. We know now that we have a great team.”
The junior might not get nervous before his games, but he feels the pressure from the Crimson’s history to excel.
“If you’re confident and you’re ready for the game there’s no need to have nerves,” Hempel said. “There’s never been a bad quarterback here. There’s never been a quarterback here that hasn’t been excellent. I think that definitely brings pressure but I think pressure is a good thing. I think when players are pressured, it really brings out a reflection of their character. I’m excited to find out how I’ll react to that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second week of in-season competition, the Harvard sailing team continued to show off its strong boatmanship. The team participated in five highly competitive regattas throughout New England this past weekend.
“We could have done better [this weekend] in some regattas, but we did nicely in others,” junior Adam Brodheim said.
The Crimson earned four top-10 finishes and one 12th-place finish in its races at MIT, Boston University, King’s Point, Dartmouth, and Boston College.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY INVITATIONAL
In the final Charles River regatta of the weekend, Harvard finished third out of eight teams with 123 points. Only the Brown Bears and BU prevailed over the Crimson, scoring 46 and 109 points respectively.
Rookie Bennette Capozzi sailed with Brodheim; the twosome claimed third in the A division.
“Our starts definitely need a bit of work … the easiest way to win is to be first from the beginning,” Brodheim said.
B division freshmen William Bloxham and David Mened joined Capozzi and Brodheim at the Invitational, earning a fifth place title in the division with 71 points.
BOSON HARBOR INVITATIONAL
In Harvard’s weakest showing of the weekend the team’s 178-point total put it in 12th place out of the 17 teams competing in this regatta hosted by Boston College.
The freshmen duo of Matthew Mollerus and Victor Kamenker represented the Crimson’s A division. The pair ended the regatta with a first and second place finish.
Tufts ultimately finished on top, scoring a total of 68 points for the regatta.
18H MRS. HURST BOWL
At the first ever two-fleet regatta on Mascoma Lake, the women of the Harvard Sailing team finished eighth out of 16 teams.
Teammates Caitlin Watson and Kristina Jakobson finished in the top five in three races to place 11th in the division. Upperclassmen pair Morgan Russom and Ashleigh Inglish competed in the B division and ended the day in sixth-place with six top-five finishes.
The Crimson put up a total of 279 points. Fellow Ivy League schools Yale, Dartmouth and Brown finished in the top three spots.
64th NEVINS TROPHY
The Crimson, in its best race of the weekend, finished second out of 20 teams in his New York regatta hosted by Kings Point.
“We’re very pleased with the performance of our freshman Juan Perdomo…. We hadn’t seen him sail in a collegiate-style competition yet,” O’Connor said.
Perdomo won the C division despite his lack of experience in sailing 420s. He finished top-five in all ten races in which he competed.
“I’ve been working with coaches who have really been helping me with the technical aspect of the boat…. I’ve also been practicing with [sophomore] Marek Zaleksi,” Perdomo said.
O’Connor was pleased with sophomores Jake Bradt and Brian Drumm’s execution as well; the pair finished in third in the B Division.
Drumm was unable to compete in the Yale regatta the previous weekend, and Bradt was pleased with his season debut, titling him “one of [the team’s] most consistent players.”
Freshmen Julia Lord and her partner, junior Graham Slatterly sailed to 12th place in the A division.
The final results were close, with Stanford totaling 55 points, Harvard and College of Charleston both earning 69 points, and Brown putting up 70 points.
HATCH BROWN ROPHY
Harvard overcame the strong winds Saturday and finished 10th of the 17 teams who competed at this regatta hosted by MIT and Boston University. The three-division regatta took place on the Charles giving the Crimson the home advantage over a number of competitors.
In the A Division, junior Michael Drumm and senior Isabel Ruanne surprised head coach Michael O’Connor by performing below their potential as seen in previous regattas.
“They played well the weekend before at Yale,” he said.
In the B division, sophomores Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky, got third place in their division thanks to a first-place finish and three second-place finishes.
Sophomore Mareks Zaleski and freshman Emma Wheeler competed in the C division. The pair scored 167 points overall.
Boston College, Yale, and the U.S. Naval Academy finished top three in the regatta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with much tougher competition than at last weekend’s Doc Gimmler tournament, the Harvard men’s golf team finished 15th out of 16 schools at the Windon Memorial Classic in Lake Forest, Il.
“We had some pretty high expectations after last week, where we did very well; we destroyed the previous school record,” sophmore Rohan Ramnath said. “We played alright [at the Windon Memorial], [it] just was a much tougher golf course than last week’s and one of the strongest, if not the strongest, fields we will see all year.”
The Crimson finished the two-day tournament with a score of 899 (+60), a far cry from the four-under 860 by tournament host and winner Northwestern.
Coming into the final day three strokes behind second-round leader Kent State, Northwestern pulled out the victory with an even-par third round score, while the Golden Flashes faltered with a six-over 294 to finish three strokes behind the Wildcats.
On the individual side, tournament winner Chris O’Neill was the only competitor out of 87 to shoot all three rounds under par, finishing at an eight-under 208. O’Neill carried his Michigan team to third place, while teammate Brett McIntosh finished four strokes behind him and tied for third.
Filling out the podium for individual finishers was the Northwestern duo of Jack Perry and Matt Fitzpatrick, who had scores of 211 (-5) and 212 (-4), respectively. Fitzpatrick also tied for the lowest single-round score of the tournament, carding a six-under 66 in Sunday morning’s first round.
Further down the leaderboard but leading the Harvard golfers was Ramnath, who improved upon Sunday’s first- and second-round scores of 75 to finish the tournament on Monday with a third-round score of 73, good enough for a seven-over 223 and a tied for 31st finish. Ramnath had 17 pars and one bogey in his final round.
“It was a little frustrating for me today—I felt like I played pretty well and just couldn’t really capitalize on some chances I gave myself,” Ramnath said. “It was a mediocre kind of day and I was just plodding along…. I made a couple more puts today than I did yesterday so that’s why I scored a little bit better.”
The single upperclassman representing the Crimson this weekend, junior Akash Mirchandani scored five birdies in the final round on his way to a one-over 73 and a 40th-place finish with an eight-over 224.
Fresh off his first collegiate tournament at The Doc Gimmler last weekend and shooting from the first position for Harvard, freshman Robert Deng finished tied for 54th overall with an 11-over 227. Deng was relatively consistent over the weekend, shooting individual round scores of 75, 77, and 75.
“Overall, for myself, it’s been somewhat tough this weekend,” Deng said. “The conditions were really tough and it was getting highly difficult…. The pin [locations] were hard and the rough was cut slightly longer, so there was a bit of an added mental difficulty.”
The Crimson’s fourth and fifth scorers also struggled at the Knollwood Club. After shooting an even par second round, which was Harvard’s best single round score for the tournament, freshman Kendrick Vinar faded down the stretch, carding three double-bogeys and zero birdies on the day. He finished Monday with an 80 and the tournament with a 14-over 230 total.
Sophomore Un Cho didn’t fare much better, carding six double-bogeys on the weekend en route to a 236 (+20) score, which put him near the bottom of the leaderboard.
In contrast with the field at last weekend’s Doc Gimmler tournament, in which the Crimson finished behind Yale but ahead of Columbia and Princeton, Harvard was the only Ivy League representative at the Windon Memorial. The Crimson’s fall from second to second-to-last in the span of a week reflected the overall strength of the Windon Memorial field.
The team takes a brief break before heading to Philmont Country Club in Huntingdon Valley, PA to compete in the Temple Invitational on October 12-13. In order to move up the leaderboard going forward, though, Harvard will have to try to prevent its mistakes from compounding—the team shot 19 double-bogeys or worse over the weekend.
“Daily we work a lot on the process, and I think overall we did a good job of staying committed to our game plan,” Deng said. “Looking forward, we all have individual points to improve on—maybe chipping wasn’t on, maybe it was putting, or maybe the long [iron] game wasn’t on—we all have our own points that are [going to go] for us and against us in the upcoming weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a year marked by a 3rd-place finish in the Ivy League, the Harvard women’s tennis team opened the fall season this weekend at the 21st William & Mary Tribe Invitational with the addition of freshmen players Danielle Mirda, Monica Lin, Spencer Liang and June Lee.
Liang, who hails from Potomac, Md., paired up with sophomore Amy He to win matches against Wake Forest, 8-7, and Willam & Mary, 8-2, before falling to the University of South Carolina in the championship round of the Michelle O Doubles Flight. He and Liang fell to Ximena Silas-Luna and Meghan Blevins of USC, 8-1. Liang’s victory over Kimmy Guerin and Karen Forman of Wake Forest was the debut of her collegiate career, and her success in doubles was repeated by a fourth place finish in singles.
Other members of the team also opened their seasons with successes. Junior Sylvia Li and freshman Danielle Mirda finished third in their respective doubles flight with an 8-5 win over Dartmouth, while Monica Lin claimed fifth in singles play with a 2-1 record. Li, a veteran doubles player, held an 11-5 mark in doubles play in last season.
“I’m very pleased with the team, [and] we played a very strong tournament…. We gained solid preparation for the matches this fall,” Crimson head coach Traci Green said. Green, who has coached the team for the past six seasons, took the program from a 2-17 losing record in 2008 to consecutive third-place finishes in the Ivy League for the past two years.
The recent Tribe Invitational wasn’t held in the fashion of the typical collegiate tennis tournament. With more than seven teams in attendance and 14 flights of singles and doubles play combined, players on every team had opportunities to compete with schools all over the NCAA Division 1 rankings.
Harvard will experience a different format in next week’s All-American Championship, which features a prequalifying, qualifying, and main draw matches taking place from September 28th to October 6th.
“The All American is a very prestigious tournament, [and] we’re very fortunate to have four players invited. We’re taking it one day at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending time behind the Brett Favre that was Colton Chapple, junior quarterback Conner Hempel had his Aaron Rodgers coming out moment this weekend throwing for four scores and over 350 yards against San Diego to earn this week’s top honors as Athlete of the Week. However, given Harvard has the most varsity sports of any school in the country, you can bet your bottom dollar there were other impressive Crimson performances over the past week.
Brandy Machado, Women's Rugby
Women’s rugby began its tenure as Harvard’s newest varsity sport with a hard-fought loss to Quinnipiac. However, Crimson fans will always be appeased by slaughtering our oldest Connecticut-based rival and the team certainly accomplished that. Harvard brought the smackdown to Yale behind a dominant five try performance by senior co-captain Brandy Machado resulting in an emphatic 84-0 victory.
Norman Hayes, Football
Junior defensive back Norman Hayes was all over the field this weekend, logging time throughout the backfield and even playing some snaps at linebacker, as he kept the Torreros’ offense at bay. Hayes finished the game with a total of twelve tackles, including two for a loss, and also grabbed an interception to seal the game late in the fourth quarter.

At a time when it’s totally plausible that millions of people are wearing the same faux-vintage, turquoise choker that was featured prominently in the Urban Outfitters window display, finding one-of-a-kind pieces that are unique and fashion forward is important. Luckily the Cambridge Open Market (the collection of vendors on the Science Center Plaza), which will be open Fridays from 11:30am – 5:30pm through October, features plenty of wares from handcrafted-jewelry vendors. This past Friday, the market was abuzz with shoppers and designers alike, as both students and local residents descended upon the Plaza for some good old-fashioned retail therapy.
 This Roving Reporter took part in the fun and had the opportunity to meet some of the market's artists.
Erin Nelson, jewelry designer, Freebird Designs
Roving Reporter: What inspires you in the jewelry that you make?
Erin: Well, mostly the gemstones themselves. I don’t really start with an idea of what I want to make until I have the gems in my hand.
 
RR: Do you have a favorite gemstone?
Erin: I would say probably a stone called labradorite, which is a semi-precious stone, and it just has a lot of iridescent colors in it. So it looks different at different times of day and depending on what you wear, so it’s a little more interesting than the other stones.
RR: If you could pick only one of your pieces to wear, what would it be?
Erin: Probably one of the lockets. They have, on one side, a vintage postage stamp, usually a bird or butterfly, and on the other side an inspirational quote or reminder that you can have with you throughout the day.
Molly Kirkpatrick, vendor, SoWa Vintage Market
RR: How would describe your shop here?
Molly: An eclectic mix, they’re all vintage finds. We like art, and a little bit of everything to try to appeal to most people. We like things that are a little weird, things you don’t see every day.
RR: Do you have a favorite item that you sell here?
Molly: I love our art! I love paintings, I love Expressionism…
RR: If you could wear one piece of statement jewelry, what would it be?
Molly: Well, I have to say probably like a cool belly chain. A skinny gold one.
RR: Haven’t heard that one before! Exotic.
Heather DeSimone, jewelry designer, Leetie Lovendale
RR: How would you describe your product?
Heather: It’s actually not only vintage-inspired, but vintage-based because I cleaned out a warehouse of about 40,000 pounds of jewelry components that were made in the '60s or early '80s, so all the jewelry is new, but with old parts.
RR: How do you like having a shop here on the Plaza?
Heather: It’s been great! This market is very energetic and vibrant, lots of young people but also lots of older people as well, so it’s been a really great group of people. This is only my third market here, but it’s been very good.
RR: If you could pick one—just one—item of jewelry to wear, what would it be?
Heather: A pair of big, bold hoops!

Looking to take a break from procrastinating on your p-set? Look no further than "HUDS Haiku," a Tumblr page created by an anonymous member of the Class of 2014. Since its debut last spring, the page has received over 1,000 views and is beginning to pick up even more steam around campus this semester.
For Harvard undergrads (all of whom are familiar with the ups and downs of the HUDS dining experience), the poems are not only artistically riveting but are also rooted in keen observation. One particular gem, "Squicken," goes as follows: 
"Today it is squash.Tomorrow will be chicken.Then it will be both." 
Other poems, such as "HUDS," are more daring in their content and form: 
"HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDSHUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDSHUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS HUDS."
While many of the haikus are submitted by students and playfully poke fun at dining service meals, the "HUDS Haiku" creator, who wished to remain anonymous, notes that the site is intended as a celebration of HUDS and its work. 
"The purpose isn't to bash HUDS," he said. "While everyone can agree organic peanut butter would be a good adhesive, I don't post any of the poems that denigrate HUDS."
Anyone interested in contributing to "HUDS Haiku" is encouraged to submit his or her verse via the anonymous submission tool on the website.

As Yogurtland customers entered the Harvard Square location on Monday, they were encouraged to build mountains—mountains of froyo, that is. For those who may be worrying that all good things must come to an end, fear not: even if free froyo day is over, Harvard students will continue to enjoy their free three ounces of yogurt for a good while.
While the free froyo event only lasted until 6 p.m. on Monday, Eddie Barrios, Yogurtland Regional Operations Manager, said that Harvard students will continue to see Yogurtland deals and discounts. When they present their Harvard ID cards (on any normal day!) students receive three free ounces of yogurt. Accoding to Barrios, the offer will continue indefinitely throughout the semester.
"We want guests to try our product and see its quality," he said. "We at Yogurtland take pride in having the highest quality ingredients. We just want to tell everyone that we're here, and we're open. Come try us out."
Three ounces isn't a ton of yogurt, but we're not complaining; free is free. Plus, there's no daily limit, so you can always make multiple trips!

For once, the people walking around on campus wearing striped suits and gold watches are neither trying to punch a final club nor are they being recruited by a consulting firm. Rather, Harvard’s trying to recruit them—or their checkbooks—for the recently announced Harvard Campaign, its biggest, baddest, champagne-flutiest campaign yet. Not sure what the money will be going to? Well, luckily Harvard has broken it down into categories, and Flyby is here to explain exactly what (we think) they mean.
Flexible Funding to Foster Collaborations* and Initiatives: 10%
 These proceeds may go toward setting up intensely emotional group-bonding activities for professors collaborating* on research. In this category, funds have been further subdivided as follows: trust falls, trust dives, and trust tripping over expensive lab equipment, 40%; competitive group therapy, 30%; book clubs in which every meeting discusses a different edition of Greg Mankiw’s textbook, 20%; and scavenger hunts, 10%.
To further establish an environment in which professors feel safe and confident about sharing their work, the following mental health and wellbeing seminars will be offered:
10/2: Paranoia: What if All the Sections Are Secretly Discussing How I Had a Coffee-Stain on My Button-Down Last Monday?
11/14: Checking the Ego: Sometimes It’s Good to Have at Least One Item on the Syllabus That You Haven’t Personally Written
 
*Collaboration is permitted in writing work, but any written work you submit for evaluation must be the result of your own research and writing.
 
Capital Improvements: 20%
Money raised in this category will go toward training professors to sound more British, and therefore more intelligent, by providing workshops that instruct them to say “Capital!” whenever they hear a good idea. Future fundraising may go toward Bloody Hell Improvements, Cheerio Improvements, and most importantly, Tea and Crumpets Improvements.
 
Financial Aid and The Student Experience, 25%
After an extensive survey conducted by Harvard’s financial aid office, the college has found that the price of tuition may be matched, or exceeded, by certain other necessities. For instance, the typical costs for the first year of college break down accordingly: That stupid sticky stuff Yard-Ops says you have to use to hang up all of your posters, $400; the Scotch tape that you actually use to hang up your posters, $36,000; food purchased during the day, $300: Food purchased after three a.m. while intoxicated, $8,500,476. Fundraising for this category may cover these financial necessities.
 
Teaching and Research, 45%
Funds will be directed toward fundamental questions of teaching and research, such as “Why is it necessary to interact with stupid undergraduates who aren’t yet experts in the field of post-modern thermodynamics?” and “Does it count as teaching if I record all of my lectures, but then pause the tape to point out pertinent background information, such as how badass I sounded when I totally refuted my esteemed colleague’s entire argument?”
Brainstorming workshops for creating dramatic course titles may also be offered. Past attendees have come up with such enticing names as “Aluminum: The Metaphysical Physics of Physical Metals” and “Truth: The Essence of the Meaning of the Purpose of Life.”

With the rising—and often wildly over-priced—street values of textbooks, it is wise for Lamont Library staff to check the bags of all who wish to leave the sacred 24-hour institute of knowledge (and caffeinated beverages). But when leaving Lamont in the wee hours of the morning, there is nothing worse then finding yourself caught in a long line through security on the way out. With this in mind, here are a few DOs and DON'Ts for making the most of having your belongings searched:
Do: Obtain a Utility Bag
Think single zipper purse, tote, drawstring sports bag, or satchel. If you really have your act together, or are terrific at balancing books and writing utensils, you can opt to go bag-less.
Don’t: Bring the Super Backpack
Avoid using the 7-zippered, multi-compartmented, high-powered, obnoxiously large backpack that you take to class (hopefully only out of necessity). Seriously people, you’re going to a library, not on a week-long camping excursion.
Do: Be Courteous to Others In Line
Prepare your bag as you wait in line. Unzip, open, and arrange your books as necessary so that the security guard can check everything quickly and efficiently.
Don’t: Be the Guy Who Waits Until He Gets to the Counter to Take His Books Out of His Bag. 
We know who you are. We always get stuck behind you in line. We do not appreciate it.
Do: Untie Your Shoes Beforehand or Wear Shoes That You Can Slip In and Out of Easily
Oh wait, that’s Logan Airport. Never mind.
Do: Consider What You Have in Your Bag
Going to Lamont is the perfect occasion for cleaning out your backpack. Remove bulky items ahead of time that you will have to remove at the counter for the contents of your bag to be seen.
Don’t: Neglect to Consider What’s in Your Bag Ahead of Time
 Lamont’s security staff does not need to smell your sweaty gym clothes or be attacked by the feral cat that has taken up residence in your backpack, and neither do we.
If everybody does their part, the line out of Lamont will become tolerable for all of those who seek a quiet place to read, study, and do p-sets on late Harvard nights.
