After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Olivia Wilde, known for her roles on “House” and “Tron: Legacy,” made her feature film directorial debut with “Booksmart.” The film chronicles the journey of two overachieving best friends who are nearing the end of their high school careers. Molly (Beanie Feldstein) is the typical valedictorian and senior class president who spent her free time in the library, plans to attend Yale, and dreams of becoming the youngest Supreme Court Justice. On the last day of school, she confronts her slacker classmates on what colleges they’re attending and realizes that the slogan “work hard, play hard,” actually applies to her classmates, who managed to get into elite universities while still enjoying a social life in high school. This discovery inspires Molly and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) to set out on a journey of self-discovery and new adventure. On April 11, after a screening of the film, Wilde sat down with screenwriter Katherine Silberman, Dever, and Feldstein at the Brattle Theatre to field questions from the audience.
Silberman was the first to be attached to the “Booksmart” script after it remained on Blacklist — an annual survey of Hollywood’s favorite unproduced screenplays — for about 10 years prior to its production. She explained her reasoning behind getting involved with the film and what she found particularly special about it. “A new entry into the high school comedy canon and to tell a story about a real authentic female friendship in 2019, and what that means for this generation of young women,” she said.
Feldstein commented on her track record for female-led movies and on how “Booksmart” set the bar even higher for her. She said, “My previous projects such as ‘Lady Bird,’ set the bar extremely high for me in terms of working on films with other directors.” “Olivia was the best person for the job in terms of mentoring and hiring women for the job and I’ve been lucky to work with an amazing slate of female directors,” she said. “Olivia created a communicative and inclusive environment, which has given me an interest in directing.”
Dever also felt similarly about Wilde, who she saw as her role model. “I would often text Olivia and be like, ‘I was just listening to a song and had an idea for a music video’ and Olivia would encourage me to be brave and bold and tell me to go for it and direct one,” she said.
“Booksmart” wasn’t Wilde’s first directing project. In the past, she has directed shorts and music videos which helped influence how she directed the set. Noting that the film industry has been historically male-dominated, Wilde set out to change that narrative. “No matter what industry you’re in, whether it be directing or finance, you have the power to do that," Wilde said. "I wanted to do everything differently in whatever capacity available. Being in the driver’s seat allowed me to pair so many brilliant people in a way that was conducive to produce their best work.”
Wilde stated that one of her biggest influences as a fledgling director was her close friend Reed Morano, who is a cinematographer and director known for her work on “Kill Your Darlings” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Besides providing Wilde with the technical knowledge of how to direct and run a film crew, Reed also taught her to develop the courage to pitch on “Booksmart.” Wilde also mentioned her experiences with past directors such as Martin Scorsese, who taught her important lessons that she implemented on her set. “Scorsese has a no-script rule which I stole for my set since we only had 26 days to shoot the entire film and having the no-script rule meant that everyone had to be on top of their game and thankfully everyone was," Wilde said, adding “He also has a no-phone rule, but since we are a fairly young cast, I didn’t steal that rule.”
Wilde also explained how she managed to facilitate strong on-screen chemistry despite her tight production schedule. She said, “Something magical when we started shooting was that everyone gravitated towards each other, no one went to hang out in their trailers alone. It became like camp very very quickly and this informed the connections which made friendships that went deep.”
In an effort to foster organic friendships among the cast, Wilde sent them out on adventures in order to strengthen their connections. She said, “I wanted them to feel like old friends so I would send them on adventures together saying, ‘You need to go to the mall, go to the movies, have a wild night out, hang out at someone’s house,’ and they would send me pictures as proof, all of which contributed to the genuine interactions seen throughout the film.”
Dever and Feldstein spoke to the benefit of already going through high school before portraying teenagers as adults.
“I was 20 or 21 when we shot Booksmart, which is a few years after I graduated which allowed me to reflect on my time at high school,” Dever said.
Feldstein even visited her former high school before shooting, which got her excited for shooting the film. “Meeting the kids, I was so inspired since they’re all so smart and they knew words that I didn’t even know,” she said.
Wilde made sure to emphasize that she meant to naturally highlight the complexity of the teenage characters without sensationalizing any of their identities. The script mentioned that Amy’s character would be gay and it was something that Wilde treated in a way where it didn't affect the narrative. “It [her sexuality] didn’t make a difference — it might as well have said, ‘She has brown hair,’ since we wanted to make it as authentic and fluid as possible. ‘Booksmart’ portrayed Amy’s self discovery in a way that all adolescents experience it rather than isolating her experiences as something foreign,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dorothy and I are stepping down as Faculty Deans this June. So, on reflection, what does a faculty dean do? It is my hope that in briefly articulating this, I might shed light on a role that is mysterious to some of you, and perhaps entice some of you to think about this for yourselves.
First and perhaps obviously, you still do your own work. A faculty dean does not relinquish research, writing, and teaching and become the sultan of a small kingdom. No, our work is part of the deal. At least one and often both partners in the faculty dean role is an academic, with research and writing projects. I teach classes in Religion, General Education, and South Asian Studies. In Dorothy’s case – she was not only a teacher, but a preacher who married the joyful and consoled the bereaved. As for research, faculty deans lead major research projects, like Eliot House Faculty Dean Douglas A. Melton’s stem cell research. In my case, it’s the Pluralism Project that studies the changing religious and cultural landscape of the United States.
However, faculty deans do agree to live their lives and do their work in a new context – that of a diverse, exciting, and sometimes demanding community. Being a faculty dean is not an honorary position. It is actually a job that takes time and often involves making discerning judgments about how you spend your time. It is a position of leadership in a House community troubled by most of the issues of difference, diversity, and disparity that perplex our society today. That is a challenge, but also a very rewarding one.
Second, you are engaged with students. If your work is part of the deal, the well-being of students is the other part – and the primary part. That’s why you would want to do this. You would get to enjoy conversation with students – not primarily about your own work, but about theirs. In Lowell dining hall, I have found that my curiosity about students’ work is immeasurably rewarded. It is like going to a surprise dinner party: You don’t know who will be there and you join in conversations that are invariably interesting and sometimes critically important. Getting to know students, you will find that you are happy to go to their plays, concerts, and recitals. You might watch their basketball games and show up at dances where you don’t know the moves or the music. Of course, you can’t possibly do it all, but you do need to engage in some part of it, especially the parts that you love.
Third, you have a team. You don’t go it alone. At the helm, there is the close and confidential team of a senior staff – the resident dean, House administrator, two or three experienced tutors. How are things going? What are the rough spots for students? What’s ahead? Together, you do the critical work of assembling a team of resident tutors from diverse fields of study.
The tutors also choose to live their lives, as you do, in the context of community. There are monthly tutor meetings. What’s happening with students? What’s coming up in the House? Meetings might be particularly intense as College wide issues erupt: final clubs, a student arrest, the sexual assault report. How does our House community respond to issues that tear at race relations or to the fact that more than a quarter of our students are hurting because they have personally experienced sexual misconduct? What is the tutor’s role in conflicts? How do tutors moderate tough issues rather than escalate them? What effect does it have on House culture when a tutor — for any reason whatsoever — attacks a student? When litigation and intimidation enter into the community of relationships that are constitutive of a residential Houses?
Fourth, you have colleagues. As a faculty dean you would have a spectrum of collegial relations with other members of the faculty, not just those in your own department or school. You might invite some of them to become members of the Senior Common Room. They discuss things that are often not aired in their departments, but are important to students and to the College — sexual assault, race issues, the Harvard admissions suit. This circle of SCR members is part of the team too, as is the circle of other faculty deans.
Your colleagues are not all academics, but a range of people who work in and for the House: the superintendent, custodial workers, cooks, dining hall staff, and security staff. These are the people who make the House work on a daily basis, people you get to know as part of the family and whom you thank publicly for their work when the community gathers for special events. You are a critical bridge builder, not only across departments, schools, and generations, but also across different walks of life.
Fifth you are a steward of everything that belongs to the House. You become, in effect, the curator of House legend and history, art works and portraits, silver candlesticks and inscribed platters. If you are interested in history, this is not an odious job, but a fascinating one, especially today. At Lowell, many of our portraits were given to the House by the Lowell family after which the House was named. This includes many generations of Lowells whose lives and contributions we documented in a booklet entitled “Hanging Around Lowell House.” Not everything has to be preserved, but you would work with students to make the House feel welcoming to new generations from a wide diversity of backgrounds. How can you empower students to be appreciative of a history that is not theirs and agents of a future that is?
Sixth, you will discover your own implicit understanding of ritual. Every community acts itself out in ways that create a sense of identity: special dinners, festive celebrations, and weekly events. At Lowell, it’s Thursday tea, the ringing of the Lowell bells, high tables for seniors, dancing on the Weeks Footbridge at 6 a.m. on May Day with strawberries and champagne. Houses do it in their distinctive ways and we learn from one another at our monthly faculty deans meetings. The Drag Ball? Diwali? Dog-Sledding? Conversations with Kirkland? A wine seminar? A Life Seminar? Processions at Commencement, with bagpipes or ragtime bands or drummers?
This isn’t a list of “shoulds” and duties. If it suits your temperament, none of it is a task. It’s a lifestyle, engaged with people at many levels and in many contexts. It’s not about you, but about students. Above all, it is based on a deep belief in Harvard’s residential House system where the tree of learning and the tree of life grow together.
Diana L. Eck is the Faculty Dean of Lowell House and a Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies.

Harvard University Health Services will no longer see patients between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. Instead, patients will be directed to an urgent care line to speak to a tele-nurse, who can offer counsel and instructions if further steps are required. HUHS has piloted the tele-nurse system for a semester — a pilot that HUHS Director Paul J. Barriera said has convinced administrators of its viability as an in-person urgent care replacement. Furthermore, HUHS officials cited the fact that Urgent Care sees very few patients at night and many of these patients are sent to the emergency room anyway as reasons behind the decision.
Nevertheless, this change should not be written off as insignificant, especially for students who may not have as much experience navigating the healthcare system. HUHS should use this opportunity to reflect on how little many students may know about health insurance, personal health management, and the benefits they do and do not have access to. As many people on campus come from different backgrounds and have different levels of health literacy and access, we hope HUHS presents this change in services clearly and publicly.
Many students may have grown accustomed to solely relying on HUHS for their medical services. In the case that students find themselves needing to visit a non-Harvard medical provider during the night, it would serve them well to be knowledgeable on what to expect in terms of costs and patient rights. Accordingly, HUHS should step up and outline what students can expect in these settings, as well as what services different insurances might entitle them to. While tele-nurses may be able to provide information in the moment, students should feel like they are empowered with this knowledge in advance of any potential emergencies.
It’s also important to consider this service change in light of ongoing concerns about student substance use. For example, college may present students with their first experiences consuming alcohol. HUHS should take this opportunity to provide students with more information about what they should expect in the event that they end up at a non-Harvard medical facility for alcohol poisoning or other substance-related issues.
The emergency room may seem like a scary place to undergraduates, especially those with financial concerns, but we encourage students to not shy away from seeking necessary physical and mental health services. The University should make sure that all students feel comfortable and safe seeking medical services.
This change in HUHS policy serves as a good opportunity for the University and HUHS to think about healthcare literacy on our campus. While that may not (necessarily) entail reading Foucault or solving the world’s greatest math puzzle, this sort of education is an essential part of being a well-informed and empowered citizen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Judging from the common use of the word, “transparency” of processes is something we all admire. When it is easier to understand why a process produced the outcome it did, we are happier for it. “Fairness” of processes is something else we desire. Processes ought not to be biased in favor of some outcomes or of some people over others. But may these two objectives be in direct conflict? College admissions, a subject of perennial discussion at this time of the year, offer an illustration as to why the answer is sometimes in the affirmative.
On the one hand, consider a transparent admissions policy. This would be one that is objective or “meritocratic,” i.e. based on a composite score of one or more standardized examinations. A massive example is China’s gaokao, a two-day long series of tests taken by approximately 10 million Chinese students each year. The gaokao is the sole determinant for admission to almost every Chinese college, and high school students sometimes spend their entire final year of school in preparation for it; every Chinese teenager is well aware of the test and of the requisite score for a given institution. The Joint Entrance Examination to India’s most prestigious educational institutions, the Indian Institute of Technology, offers another example.
Such processes are both objective and transparent; it is clear why one gets in or does not. But are they fair? Opponents of such processes have argued that when outcomes hinge on the performance in a single test, those better able to prepare for the test (via private tutors, special classes, or simply attending better schools) are, ceteris paribus, advantaged. The socioeconomically better-off populations will be better able to exploit these conditions to gain admissions. Fairness includes the equality of opportunity to do well, and this is largely absent in such processes.
However, this is not always the case — perhaps a transparent system can be more “fair” when exercised at a considerably smaller scale. New York City’s Specialized High Schools Admissions Test is the sole metric by which eighth graders are evaluated for admission to eight of the city’s top public high schools. The specialized schools are dominated by an Asian population, and have been criticized for their lack of racial diversity. However, over half of their students, including the vast majority of Asian students, qualify for free or reduced-cost lunch, a standard measure of the concentration of low-income students in the American school system. (In fact, the specialized high schools are more economically diverse than academically comparable New York City schools that use a multifaceted admissions process.)
On the other hand, the American college admissions process actively tries — in principle — to create a fairer system. This is done by considering a more “holistic” process that takes into account not only a student’s performance on objective measures, but also background information and hurdles they have had to encounter. The problem here is that the system is no longer transparent. Students with perfect SAT scores, incredible GPAs, and extraordinary extracurriculars are sometimes denied admission at the expense of those with lower visible achievements.
The opacity creates two different sets of problems. First, it engenders and exacerbates anxiety in high school students who have the distinct feeling they are taking part in game to which they don’t know the rules. When there is a single test to study towards, one at least knows what one is attempting to achieve, but here, merely excellent curricular and extracurricular performances are not enough. And this creates deep resentments, leading to lawsuits of the form filed by Abigail N. Fisher or Edward Blum. The second problem it creates is bias, and even corruption, in the system, perhaps the most extreme manifestation of which has been the Operation Varsity Blues scandal that dominated the headlines a week ago. When human subjectivity is introduced into the selection process, personal biases, human error, and abuses of power are impossible to avoid.
It would appear that we are at somewhat of an impasse. Under the current system, which claims to have the explicit purpose of maximizing fairness, we see a complete lack of transparency. And, with the opacity comes undue stress and prejudice. However, an objective, transparent system seems to lead to a world in which all students are equal, but some students are more equal than others. Reconciling these two ideas is not easy, but it is certainly not impossible. If the current admissions system were to be more transparent, and individual students were aware of what criteria to focus on, we may see a system that is more appealing to everyone, and ultimately, even more fair.

Harvard is implementing a digital accessibility policy intended to make its websites and web-based applications more accessible to those with disabilities, the University announced Thursday.
The new policy will apply to any public-facing websites or applications within the University’s domain. The policy will go into effect for existing websites and any new digital content created or revised on or after Dec. 1, 2019.
The policy is meant to improve digital accessibility through means including captioning videos and formatting websites for screen reader compatibility, according to the policy’s associated FAQs.
This new policy comes on the heels of an ongoing lawsuit against Harvard alleging the school failed to close caption and provided inaccurate captions for its public online content — including YouTube, iTunes U, Harvard@Home, and the Extension School’s sites. The National Association of the Deaf and four of the organization’s members originally filed the suit in February 2015 in Massachusetts District Court.
The initial complaint argues that Harvard’s allegedly inaccessible content violates the 1973 United States Rehabilitation Act — a disability civil rights law prohibiting discrimination in institutions that receive federal financial assistance. It also says Harvard violated Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a statute that prohibits disability discrimination in places of public accommodation.
The lawsuit continues to move through federal court after a judge denied Harvard’s motions to dismiss and issue summary judgment. A similar lawsuit was filed against MIT in 2015, which is also ongoing.
University spokesperson Nate Herpich declined to comment on the ongoing litigation but said the school is committed to increasing accessibility in its online content, as evidenced by the new policy.
“Expanding access to knowledge and making online content accessible is of vital importance to Harvard, and the University remains committed to advancing these efforts,” Herpich wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard has been working for months to develop this Digital Accessibility Policy, and we are pleased to be able to announce it today.”
In April 2015 — two months after the NAD filed their lawsuit against Harvard — Harvard and MIT’s edX program, an online learning program founded in 2012, entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice that required the program to be digitally accessible and addressed alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The settlement was not connected to the NAD filing.
The new initiative also creates a University-wide Accessibility Steering Committee to recommend websites that are high priority for accessibility improvements. The policy designates several Digital Accessibility Liaisons to coordinate implementing accessible content across Harvard websites and applications, as well as a team within the Harvard University Information Technology system to provide training and information about the new policies to faculty and staff.

Night Market, a Harvard Square eatery offering a variety of street food-inspired Asian dishes, closed its doors on April 19.
Night Market’s departure marks the latest store to leave the Square, following a string of closings including Crema Cafe, Chipotle, and LF among others in recent months. Several stores have been forced to vacate after their buildings were sold to new owners, while others have struggled with attracting customers in an age of online shopping.
Denise Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that Night Market had trouble drawing patrons in recent months, and cited broader trends in the restaurant industry.
“[The closing] probably has a lot to do with not having enough customers. That’s just the beginning and end of many stories in the world of restaurants these days. It’s a very competitive market,” Jillson said.
Night Market was located in an underground space that opened onto Winthrop Street just off of JFK Street, one of the Square’s more heavily-trafficked routes.
Jillson noted that Night Market’s location was likely a factor in its decision to close.
“When you’re in a location like they are, which is a little bit outside of the heart of the Square, and there’s not a lot of signage... it makes it even more challenging,” she said.
Jillson added that Night Market’s managers had worked hard to draw customers even as they faced financial challenges.
“They did as much as they possibly could do. They tried very hard to increase their visibility and try exciting menus,” she said. “Sometimes it’s just not enough.”
Former Night Market employees did not respond to requests for comment, and the space already appears to have been vacated.
Avital Romoff ’20 said she was disappointed that she never had the opportunity to dine on Night Market’s street-inspired Asian fare.
“I was pretty upset because I had actually never gone to Night Market,” Romoff said. “A few of my friends told me it was one of the few places in the Square they really recommended. The day we were supposed to go I found out it had closed down.”
In a note on Night Market’s website, the Duck and Chicken Restaurant Group — which owned Night Market — encouraged patrons to visit the Parsnip Restaurant, its other establishment in the Square.

Government Professor Emeritus Martin L. Kilson, Jr., the first African American to receive full tenure at Harvard, died in hospice on April 24 of congestive heart failure at the age of 88.
 Kilson was a prominent scholar of African politics, and a key figure behind the development of African American studies as an academic discipline and a department at Harvard. He used a comparative approach to study the political perspectives of different ethnic groups in the United States, and co-edited a 1976 essay collection with Robert I. Rotberg that was the first published work to use the term “The African Diaspora.”
“His legacy consists of thinking openly and honestly about African matters, African American matters, and telling the truth like it is,” said Rotberg, who has known Kilson since the 1960s when they both worked at Harvard.”
Kilson earned his doctorate in political science from Harvard in 1959 after graduating from Lincoln University in 1953 as valedictorian. Lincoln University announced on April 16 that it would award Kilson with an honorary degree at its 2019 commencement ceremony.
After receiving his doctorate, Kilson conducted research in West Africa on a fellowship, and in 1962 he became the first African American faculty member to teach at Harvard College. He received full tenure in 1969.
Kilson published his first book, “Political Change in a West African State: Study of the Modernization Process in Sierra Leone,” in 1966 to significant scholarly attention. His second book on African politics, “New States in the Modern World” was published in 1975.
“His publications are important even today, especially his writings on Sierra Leone and Ghana,” Rotberg said.
Described as a “gentle, yet persuasive” teacher by The Crimson in 1964, Kilson actively engaged with his students, hosting them for home-cooked meals multiple times a month. Among his many mentees was public intellectual and Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West.
“He exposed me to an international dialogue about justice, about power, about structures and institutions,” West said in a 2017 video created by Brainwaves Video Anthology. “That relationship, which began when I was 17 years old in 1970, remains strong to this day, 47 years later. He is still my teacher, and I have been so blessed to have him in my life.”
Kilson also served as one of the faculty sponsors of the Harvard-Radcliffe Association of African and Afro-American Students. In that role, he urged his mentees to avoid “tribalism or complete absorption.”
“[T]here is simply a plethora of contexts and circumstances in which each black student at Harvard can end the black isolation that chokes off the full range of benefits that are available at white colleges,” he wrote in a 1978 Crimson editorial. “[E]ach student must act within his or her immediate context, and wait not upon the weight of the herd to propel change.”
Kilson promoted individualism — best illustrated by his eclectic style and distinctive cowboy hat — as well as multiculturalism and a “humanistic boldness” drawn from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
“The things we remember as young children is a house full of all kinds of people from all over the world and all walks of life,” said Hannah L. Kilson, Kilson’s daughter. Hannah Kilson pointed out that her mother, Marion Dusser de Barenne Kilson, is white, and she and her sibling’s spouses come from a variety of backgrounds.
Born in 1931, Kilson grew up in the small mill town of Ambler, Pa. The town was considerably desegregated for its time; Kilson went to an integrated school and played on baseball teams with white children. None of his family members were college-educated: his mother had wanted to be a school teacher but could not continue her education because she had to care for her parents who contracted influenza.
“My father took a lot of pride in his academic achievements, given that his mother wasn’t able to pursue her own,” Hannah Kilson said.
But Kilson’s distinction as Harvard’s first African American professor “wasn’t something he boasted about or thought created extra value in him as a person,” according to Hannah Kilson. She and her siblings were not even aware of this achievement until they were young adults.
Kilson was also involved in a number of national organizations outside of academia. A life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Kilson was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969 and served as a member of the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1971 to 1977.
After retiring from teaching in 1999, Kilson continued to co-author several books and dozens of papers. In 2010 he delivered Harvard’s annual W. E. B. DuBois lecture and his 2014 book, “Transformation of the African American Intelligentsia, 1800-2012” won the 2015 American Book Award.
After he retired, an undergraduate research award was created in his honor, which continues to be awarded to students interested in African or African American studies
Kilson is survived by his wife, his three children — Jennifer K. Page, Peter D. de B. Kilson, and Hannah Kilson — and his six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

As the College searches for a new assistant dean for public service, the Phillips Brooks House will pursue “a different model” of programming, College Dean for Administration Sheila C. Thimba said in an interview Tuesday.
Thimba said Phillips Brooks House will centralize and streamline public service opportunities at the College, apply to become an academic center, and develop programming focused on social entrepreneurship. She added that the College will also form a search committee — which she will chair alongside Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 — to select the new dean.
Thimba — who has led Phillips Brooks House in an interim capacity since former public service dean Gene A. Corbin’s departure last May — said the changes to public service initiatives came out of a review she oversaw to assess the College’s current offerings. A 2017 $12 million dollar gift from Priscilla Chan ’07 and Mark Zuckerberg '06 spurred the review.
“We're also hearing from students who are saying it's really hard to navigate this landscape, there's a lot going on,” Thimba said. “Priscilla Chan remembered that from her experience, and she basically included in her gift some money for us to do some internal assessment to figure out how we can brand better and how we can better map the terrain for students.”
The review prompted the decision to create two positions — one assistant dean and one faculty director — to oversee public service. Thimba said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana recommended that the Phillips Brooks House also apply for recognition as an “academic center,” meaning a faculty member would lead it.
“Think about the Safra Center or the Rockefeller Center — they organize the activities in such a way that they can be branded, right, they can have the kind of leadership and support that the work needs,” she said. “Somebody who's a senior faculty member with appropriate status and who can convene conversations around service at a broader level, who can engage other faculty in this work, who can get donors interested in supporting us, who can give strategic direction to the staff.”
Thimba added that she hopes the updated Phillips Brooks House will incentivize more undergraduates to engage in public service work. In particular, she said the updated programs will be aimed at attracting students who study the natural sciences to the northwest corner of Harvard Yard.
“We do have students who come out of the sciences and engineering, but not that many,” she said. “And so there are students who have not quite found a home here.”
She also said she thinks Phillips Brooks House could work with the Harvard Innovation Lab on fostering startups aimed at social change.
The new assistant dean will hold the title “Assistant Dean for Civic Engagement and Service” and will manage the Center for Public Interest Careers and the Public Service Network. The “faculty director” will directly oversee the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship.
The College launched the dean search last month, nearly a year after Corbin stepped down after 15 years at Harvard. Thimba said the search will continue through the summer, when many students and faculty interested in public service remain on campus.
Gearan declined to comment on the timeline for the search, but wrote in an email he is “confident we will attract a pool of talented individuals who see the critical nature of this work for Harvard, higher education and for our nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson discussed the intersections of the science of climate change, feminism, and climate justice at a Harvard Institute of Politics event Tuesday evening.
Professor of Environmental Science and Policy John P. Holdren moderated the conversation, beginning with a brief synopsis of current scientific perspectives on climate change, arguing that there is a spectrum of options for mitigating its effects.
Holdren asked Robinson — who started a foundation to educate people around the world about climate justice — to explain how she came to understand the “multiple justice dimensions” of climate change.
“I was a very slow learner, if you like,” Robinson said. “I say with all humility that I came late to climate change.”
Recalling her time serving as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights between 1997 and 2002, Robinson said she does not recall “making any significant speech on climate change.” She said her perspective changed, however, after she started doing social and economic justice work in Africa, where she saw and heard firsthand climate change’s impacts on human rights.
“I kept hearing this phrase, it was the same everywhere I went, really: ‘Things are so much worse now,’” Robinson said.
Robinson also discussed how a changing climate will have “intergenerational” impacts. She acknowledged how recent global youth climate strikes and the Extinction Rebellion movement’s demonstrations in London earlier this month made apparent the urgency and magnitude of climate change’s disproportionate impact on future generations.
Robinson also pointed to the ways in which climate change impacts women, especially in developing nations. Women are typically responsible for preparing food and collecting water and firewood, which all can be made more difficult with increased drought and flooding severity.
“Even in disasters, we now know that women have long skirts, they grab their children, they can’t run, they can’t climb trees, and they die in much bigger numbers than men,” Robinson said, reflecting on her work in the field.
At her first UN Climate Change conference in 2009, Robinson said she found a dearth of perspectives of people with lived experiences of the negative effects of climate change.
“It struck me as being incredible when I went to my first climate conference...how male and technical this world was,” Robinson said. “Nothing about human rights. Nothing about gender. Nothing about what I understood to be the problem.”
Robinson identified recent progress as stemming from efforts of African, Asian, and Latin American women, who have made the issue a “top priority.” She said in Europe and the United States, climate change and climate justice pale as issues compared to sexual harassment, wage equality, and education.
Kaveri K. Iychettira, a postdoctoral fellow at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, asked Robinson how academics ought to help further the cause of environmentalism.
Robinson said all people must make climate change prevention part of their daily lives.
“You’ve got to take the issue of climate change very personally, in your life and in your work. It has to somehow penetrate,” says Robinson, citing her personal decision to become a pescatarian.
She also suggested that people should “get angry with those who have more responsibility,” including government officials and big businesses.
“Use your voice, your vote, your marching, your teaching,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As roughly 30 members of the graduate student union marched through Harvard Yard shouting "no contract, no peace," approximately 30 others huddled inside University Hall, echoing back their chants.
Over the course of more than 10 hours, members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union–United Automobile Workers and their supporters protested, calling on the University to include third party grievance procedures, pay raises, and wider ranging health insurance benefits in their contract. At the same time, union organizers staged a five-hour sit-in at University Hall, an administrative building.
The protests marked the first anniversary of the union's official certification by the National Labor Relations Board — which officially fell April 30. It also coincided with International Workers’ Day, celebrated May 1.
Union supporters and organizers started gathering around Massachusetts Hall at 8 a.m., while another group of HGSU organizers entered University Hall for the sit-in.
Inside University Hall, Harvard University Police Department officers stood in front of the entrance to the restroom, blocking students’ access to the bathroom, according to Patricia N. Manos, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who participated in the sit-in.
“It definitely made people uncomfortable,” Saul A. Glist ’22, an organizer for the Student Labor Action Movement who participated in the sit-in, said of the bathroom situation. “And definitely, if we had stayed longer, people would have had to leave for that.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
This is not the first time HUPD has blocked entrances to bathrooms during sit-ins at University Hall. When fossil fuels divestment activists occupied the building in 2015, HUPD took similar measures.
Up to seven HUPD officers monitored the protesters outside throughout the day, but did not otherwise engage with the demonstration.
Once the protesters emerged from the building, Caleb S. Weinreb, a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Biology who participated in the sit-in, told the group outside that they occupied the building because “we can’t wait any longer.”
He said that none of the participants “withheld” their work today, but he said that if the University fails to adequately address the union’s concerns, the union will authorize a strike.
“We will organize for a strike if they don’t take us seriously,” Weinreb said. “We’re here because it’s been too long and time’s up.”
Nearly 500 people participated over the course of the day, according to longtime union organizer Niharika N. Singh. At any given time, there were between 30 and 40 people marching in circles around the Yard and John Harvard statue.
The union’s sit-in was an “unusual tactic” to put pressure on Harvard, according to former Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board William B. Gould IV.
“It's not unheard of. It has happened in recent years as well as during the Great Depression,” Gould said. “But it doesn't usually happen in the course of negotiations.”
Gould added that the sit-in will likely not have legal repercussions for the bargaining process itself, according to Gould.
“The key test would be whether the reaction had the effect of interfering with the bargaining process or blocking the bargaining process,” he said. “That kind of conduct wouldn’t interfere with the bargaining in good faith.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the sit-in.
State Representative Marjorie Decker spoke before the marchers around 11 a.m. Members of campus activist groups including Divest Harvard — an organization pressuring Harvard to divest from its holdings in fossil fuels — also gave short speeches in support of the marchers throughout the day.
The march drew support from other labor groups at Harvard and around the Boston area. Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, Service Employees’ International Union Local 32BJ, and UNITE HERE Local 26 joined the march.
No administrators interacted with the demonstrators inside the building, according to Weinreb. But, some administrators left the building within twenty minutes of the sit-in beginning, said SLAM organizers Ria Modak ’22, who participated in the sit-in.
“We had very little interaction with anyone inside the building,” Modak said.
Modak said HUPD officers did not try to remove the group, and that the officers were generally “very respectful.”
Glist said that once the group was inside, some of them studied, took naps, and even “played catch with a little foam ball.”
Bargaining committee member Cole M. Meisenhelder said that in the wake of the march, the union expects “serious responses” from the University in their next bargaining session Tuesday.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University remains “fully engaged” in negotiations.
“The University feels both sides are bargaining in good faith and remains committed to achieving a contract that is good for HGSU-UAW and the University as a whole,” Swain wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although conceding defeat to Yale, Harvard men’s lacrosse ended its season with a final send-off to an impactul groups of seniors who have helped build the program for four years. The Crimson will look to learn from this season and bring energy and effort into next year.
With the final game of the season, Havard (5-8, 1-5 Ivy League) took on No. 4/5 Yale (11-2, 5-1). The Crimson came into the game on the heels of its toughest stretch of the season both in terms of record and strength of opponent. In April, Harvard faced No. 12/10 Cornell, No. 7/6 Penn, and a strong Princeton team, losing all three games. After this three-game slide, the Crimson had the pleasure of trying to end its streak, facing one of the best teams in the country one year removed from a National Championship.
In contrast, the Bulldogs came into the contest on a four game winning streak, having gone an even more impressive 9-1 in its last ten games. Needless to say, this was always going to be a tough matchup for the Harvard team.
Yale scored its first goal within three minutes and scored the first four goals of the game. However, the Crimson responded, putting up a great fight in the first quarter of the game. When the whistle blew after the first quarter, Harvard was still in the game, only facing a two goal deficit, down 6-4. The second and third quarter saw the Crimson get outscored 14-3, effectively ending the game.
There were a couple of standouts for Harvard. Sophomore attacker Myles Hamm was extremely active against the Bulldogs, scoring a hat trick and dishing out two assists. Hamm came on strong in the second half of the season, finishing with 24 goals and 10 assists, finishing third on the team in total points. Freshman Austin Madronic continued his tear, netting three goals and an assist on the way to second on the team in total points. With a goal in the final frame, Junior Captain Kyle Anderson extended his goal streak to 13 games and his points streak to 25. Finally, sophomore goalie Kyle Mullin did his best against a strong Yale attack, stopping 15 shots, his seventh time reaching that mark this season. These three will all be returning next year and hope to build off this season.
“Our team has a lot of really hard working younger guys,” commented senior captain Jonathan Butler on the state of the program going forward. “They will definitely do great things in the coming years.”
This game represented the last time six seniors would take the field wearing the Harvard lacrosse jersey. The class of 2019 includes attacker Lauren Bidstrup, Butler, defenseman Spencer Daniel, midfielder James Sullivan, and midfielder Eric Wang. Head Coach Chris Wojcik ‘96 praised the group, giving them a proper send-off for all their hard work and dedication to the team over the four years.
“Obviously we are all disappointed with how our season turned out, especially given all the hard work we put in. The program overall has been an awesome experience. It has given me my best friends and has taught me a lot,” commented Butler on the end to the season. “Our senior class is sad to have our careers end, but we feel good about the impact we’ve had on the program overall.”
While the Crimson certainly did not have the season they wanted, the seniors are leaving the team having made a large impact. Their leadership and effort will be a lesson to the next couple of classes of Harvard lacrosse. Nevertheless, the team has its eye toward next year and the promises of an entire offseason to work and get better through.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this past weekend’s CWPA Championships, Harvard found itself in the semifinals facing top-seeded Michigan. Unable to upset the favorites, the Crimson entered the third-place match against Bucknell, concluding its 2019 campaign in fourth place in the CWPA.
Recording its fifth 20-win season in program history, the Crimson has its sights set on the 2020 season, where a majority of the players will be returning to fight for the NCAA tournament bid.
Harvard 9 Bucknell 11
Earning a spot in the third place game, the Crimson was set to face off against Bucknell, a squad who was set to face off against Harvard for the fourth time this season.
The fourth matchup of the season was another contest of back-and-forth action. The Crimson and the Bison exchanged goals throughout the first half, going into the break separated by a single goal with Bucknell taking a 4-3 lead.
A two-goal spurt by Harvard to open the second half of play gave the Crimson the lead and third place in sight. However, continued scoring by both sides brought the two teams even through three, tied at seven apiece.
Back and forth scoring continued into the final frame, but the Bison managed to pull away with back-to-back goals from sisters Paige and Ally Furano, putting the Crimson down by two. The game concluded with hat tricks from sophomore Olivia Price and first-year Grace Thawley and a 10-save game from senior keeper Samantha Acker.
Harvard 7 Michigan 14
Top-seeded Michigan earned a day off after their perfect regular-season run, having extra rest ahead of their first game of the weekend against Harvard. Last year’s conference champions, the Wolverines were looking to repeat their previous year’s success with a perfect CWPA championship record.
The game started out with early scoring from Michigan, as the Wolverines managed to get ahead of the Crimson at the end of the first quarter, leading five goals to two. The second quarter saw a similar result, as Michigan’s extra rest proved to be vital for their high energy in the first half.
Harvard returned from the halftime break with a sense of urgency, putting on an impressive third quarter of play as it did against Brown. Outscoring the Wolverines 4-1 in the quarter, the Crimson cut the Michigan lead to just four goals, trailing 11-7.
Michigan’s defensive pressure made it difficult for Harvard to continue its offensive run in the fourth, however. The Crimson was held scoreless in the final eight minutes of play as Michigan scored three goals of its own to extend the lead to seven and solidify a CWPA finals spot, where they took down Princeton to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament.
Harvard 11 Brown 9
The Crimson’s first matchup of the CWPA championships was against the host, Brown. Playing another close game against the Bears, Harvard found itself trailing by two goals at the end of the first half.
However, the Crimson’s offensive prowess that was dominant throughout the rest of the season was on display in the third period, as Harvard scored five goals to take an 8-6 lead. Contributions from senior attacker Kristen Hong, junior attacker Grace Thawley, and sophomore Olivia Price, and junior Mathilde Ribordy gave the Crimson new life in the game.
Harvard was able to maintain their lead in the final period of play, holding Brown off 11-9. Hong led the Crimson with four goals, with Thawley contributing two.
Moving on to the semi-finals of the CWPA championship, the Crimson looked to face off against Michigan in a rematch of the final game of the regular season.
“Michigan is who we want to be playing,” said Hong before the start of the tournament, looking forward to the opportunity to avenge the Crimson’s loss against the Wolverines.
Impressive performances throughout the regular season by Thawley and Kristen Hong earned the two nominations to the All-CWPA team, with Hong receiving first-team honors and Thawley receiving second-team recognition. The two combined for 106 goals on the season, helping the Crimson tremendously to their 21-8 season record. The first-team honor is Hong’s first, and Thawley looks to continue her success for the Crimson in years to come.
The two also earned first-team and second-team respective recognition following the tournament for their impressive performances during the weekend of play in Providence. Mathilde Ribordy joined Thawley in second-team tournament recognition for her outstanding play against the weekend’s opponents.
The squad also celebrated their season following the weekend with their annual banquet, where several members of the team were honored with awards. Senior Haley Bowe was awarded the Peter Hursh ‘74 Memorial Award for her spirit and tenacity as a member of the program.
“Haley Bowe, to come back after taking one year off and finishing her three years of eligibility: the leadership she brings to the pool everyday, her work ethic, and her amazing attitude has been great,” said head coach Ted Minnis reflecting on Bowe’s importance to the identity of the team.
Thawley received rookie of the year honors for her excellent first season, junior Angie Varona received the Coach’s Award, and Ribordy received Most Improved Recognition.
Looking ahead, the team will be returning 12 of its 15 current members with the departures of Hong, Haley Bowe, and Samantha Acker. The freshman class that was so-heavily relied on in certain points of the season will look to build on its first-year experience and push for a deeper run into the postseason.

There’s nothing more fun than consolidating everything you have learned this semester into at least ten pages (all of which are currently blank). When you have papers to write during reading period even though you also have finals to study for, the outlook can seem bleak. This reading period, we present the five, Flyby-approved stages of writing papers.
Stage 1: Denial
It’s the last week of classes and your life is slowly being sucked out of you (except for the fact that you lost your soul after the first midterm of the semester). There are psets to complete, last-minute midterms to prepare for, performances to attend, and formals to rock. How can you possibly have work beyond this week? Everything until reading period is meaningless, because you are numb from the length of your to-do list and sleep deprivation.
Stage 2: Anger
It’s Wednesday evening and you’re cheering! You made it through classes alive and the end of the semester is in sight. And then you wake up on Thursday morning to boiling rage. How could papers possibly be due when you just got time to breathe? Since suppressing emotions is unhealthy, you release your anger by mistreating your laptop keyboard and glowering at the person who stole your favorite study spot. This stage does not technically end until Primal Scream.
Stage 3: Bargaining
Since pain seems to be a mainstay of our lives for the foreseeable future, you do your best to alleviate it, certainly not by starting to write, but by spamming your teaching fellows. Can I somehow just drop this paper? Could I please have an extension? When they reply with a terse negative, you decide to compromise: you muster all of your strength and write exactly one word on the last page. Consider that page count reached.
Stage 4: Depression
Your feelings have finally moved into the present. This stage usually starts at 6 p.m. on the day of your midnight deadline. You despair at your open, half-finished document, and it seems impossible to meet the page count. Unfortunately, the vending machine in Lamont Cafe is empty by now, so stress eating is not an option. Resignedly, you begin to type.
Stage 5: Acceptance
This stage can begin anytime from when you are halfway through your paper to when you hit submit at 11:59 p.m. It doesn’t mean you feel okay about the franctic past few hours, but you learn to live with the reality of your impending finals.
No matter where you are in the five stages of writing papers, stay strong. Somehow, you will make it through reading period, and somehow this paper will eventually be over. Until then, good luck.
