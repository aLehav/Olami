After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The New York Times reports that the phrase “War on Terror” is being quietly dropped by the new administration.  It had served a purpose to facilitate the politics of fear during the Bush years, but it was becoming a serious burden for US approaches to the Muslim world. It became obvious to many cool headed observers that, while the likes of al-Qaeda and other extremists were still dangerous, they were in fact small hard-line groups. The vast Muslim world was ready for a more respectful and sympathetic approach from a saner US government.   How else can one interpret the joyous scenes that followed the election of Barack Obama in most Islamic countries.  It was astonishing to hear of young students running around the campus of the University of Indonesia, shouting “We have won!” 

This unusual, timely and beautiful film, Journey to Mecca, presents a more sympathetic interpretation of Islam both to the West and to the East.  It shows the profoundly devotional aspect of a religion that has been thoroughly demonized since the cataclysmic events of 9/11.  The rituals of the pilgrimage that bring together literally millions of worshippers every year to Mecca, presume and proclaim “Peace” in the world.  Peace is of the essence since the worshippers themselves come from entirely different backgrounds, from all colors, and all climates.

The film makers, among them Taran Davies ’93, were awarded the unusual permission by the authorities in Saudi Arabia, the “protectors of Mecca and Medina”, to shoot the scenes of the Hajj.  They do not disappoint.  There are spectacular scenes all presented in the vast screen panorama of IMAX.  Some are very striking taken from air, showing the immense multitude that has congregated in their white garb – a reference to their attire on the Day of Judgment – circumambulating the sacred Ka’aba, the black cube, the House of Abraham and Ishmael.  It all harks back to the foundation of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

The producers do not give us an ordinary documentary.  The film is presented as though the pilgrimage is undertaken by a famous traveler of the 14th century. Hence, the sub-title of the movie, “In the footsteps of Ibn Battuta”. 

Ibn Batuta was certainly a most amazing person.  The full account of his travels across an immense geography from Tangier to the Crimea, from Byzantium to Delhi and Calicut and the Maldives, perhaps to China, but also to East and West Africa, fill many engrossing volumes.  He has provided an account of peoples and societies with the eye of a learned and interested observer at a moment in history that would be the envy of any travel writer to-day.  If the film does nothing but intrigue the viewers to become more acquainted with this astonishing story, it will have served to soften the supposed “clash of civilizations”.  It will also have earned the sponsorship of the National Geographic.  Indeed, given all the attention lavished on the magnificent photography, the deserts, the ancient cities, the caravans,  (and even bandits) it is a weakness of the film that the remarkable story of Ibn Battuta is not more developed. 

Perhaps as a 45 minute IMAX movie about the Hajj, this was all that was possible to communicate about the greatest traveler of the old world. However, in contrast to the highly critical opinion of the Crimson’s film critic, ‘Journey to Mecca’ does succeed in imparting the meaning of the Hajj and its rituals in a uniquely dramatic manner. It certainly presents some of the spiritual aspects of the Islamic heritage in an entertaining, yet responsible way rarely, if ever, presented in the cinema in the West. The producers are to be commended for a positive contribution to the “dialogue of civilizations” at a sensitive moment in world history.

Taran Davies who evidently initiated the production, along with his partner Dominic Cunningham-Reid of Cosmic Picture, is an intrepid film-maker.  His first film Around the Sacred Sea tells the story of a five month expedition on horseback around Lake Baikal in Siberia with a group of his Harvard friends taken soon after graduation.  Since then he has become an expert on Central Asia and Islam.
The documentation that comes with the film is first rate.  It will be very helpful for educational purposes.  It may even strengthen the hand of peacemakers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Dean for Administration Georgene B. Herschbach and Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere will both be leaving their posts by the end of this year.Herschbach is accepting the voluntary early retirement package and will leave in the fall after almost three decades at Harvard, while Rinere will become Dean of Advising and Associate Dean of Student Affairs at Columbia.Their departures come in the wake of another senior College official’s departure, as Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd confirmed late last month that she will also be accepting the retirement package, which allows staff over 55 years of age to voluntarily retire if they have worked at Harvard for at least 10 years.Herschbach is a longtime administrator who became the College’s dean for administration last year.She said she will assist in finding her successor, but noted that the responsibilities of her replacement would probably differ from her own, stressing the new relevance of finance in administrative duties.  “The whole portfolio has to be reshaped around that very prominent element,” Herschbach said.Herschbach began working at Harvard in 1981 as the Master of Currier House. Since then, she has served as Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and assistant dean and director of special programs, associate dean for administration and finance, and associate dean for academic programs at the College.Recently, Herschbach said she has been involved with creating the Program for Research in Science and Engineering, improving the freshman seminars program, and designing integrated introductory science classes, including Life Sciences 1a and Physical Sciences 1.She noted that as a dean, she cannot claim any of these programs as her own, “but someone like me, a dean, can make the connection between faculty and understanding the student population and how best to serve students.”Herschbach also said that her time as Master of Currier House was “probably the most satisfying to me,” noting Currier’s ethnic diversity at the time, which the College has only now been able to match.Rinere joined Harvard in February 2006 as head of the College’s newly-created Advising Programs Office.Under Rinere’s leadership as the first associate dean of advising programs, the office revamped the College’s advising system and created the Peer Advising Fellows program, Advising Fortnight, the sophomore advising program, and the online advising network portal.“I think she’s been an amazing force in bringing the many advising resources that we had at the College together to provide much improved advising to our students,” said APO Assistant Dean Inge-Lise Ameer.Rinere said she did not know how the College might replace her or how the office might be restructured in her absence.“We’re going to try to maintain the same high quality with fewer resources,” she said. “The students will be an integral part of the decision-making going forward and that’s what will enable the office to do what it does with less,” Rinere added.—Staff writer Danielle J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lights dim and the music blares, as Sonia S. Dara ’12 struts out onto the catwalk in a flashing black and gold outfit, opening Eleganza 2009 with a bang. She is one of the many models, professional and amateur, that make up Harvard’s fast-growing fashion scene. 
High fashion modeling has become an increasingly popular activity on Harvard’s campus in the last few years, with several new shows on the fashion calendar, including Haute, Identities, and Project East. These new performances, as well as more established fashion shows such as Eleganza, have attracted to the runways professional models like Dara and Erinn V. Westbrook ’10.
Harvard is known for producing intellectuals and political activists, but few models. Fashionistas on campus strut a careful catwalk by balancing their books and their bookings.
HIGH FASHION, HIGH INTELLECT
Westbrook is the tenth in her family to attend Harvard, but first to pursue a modeling career. After being approached by a booking editor from Seventeen magazine to attend an modeling open call, she began shooting spreads for Seventeen Magazine the summer after her senior year in high school.
Westbrook says that photo shoots at Seventeen are a world apart from the nightly study sessions of Harvard.
“You get spoiled to death. They have catered meals for you. The last shoot I did, the person who did my hair did the hair of the cast of Gossip Girl,” she said. “They were talking to me like [actress on Gossip Girl] Blake Lively is a friend of theirs.” 
Her parents, however, had always stressed academics and leadership, she said. Both Harvard Law School graduates, her mother is a practicing lawyer in St. Louis who also does public interest work, and her father is a CEO at a company he started. 
“It’s actually really funny. In high school, my parents were constantly approached by agencies to get me into teen modeling or child modeling,” she said. “My parents said that modeling was something I could explore once I got into college.” 
Likewise, Dara, who is represented by Elite Model Management in New York City, balances a blossoming modeling career with the demands of school. According to her mother, Poornima Dara, good grades were a prerequisite for her daughter to model in high school. 
“We’re the first set of South Asian parents to encourage their child to do modeling,” Poornima Dara said. “We encouraged her because she showed us that she can multitask, model and get a 4.0 GPA. If she weren’t able to multitask, we wouldn’t have encouraged her.” 
Dara said her parents have always been supportive of her aspirations, and her mother moved with her to New York City the summer before her senior year in high school to support her aspirations. 
“The biggest kicker is that it’s kind of an unorthodox career for an Indian,” Dara said, adding that many of her acquaintances back home wondered if she went into modeling because she was doing poorly in school. 
In actuality, Dara says excelled at school, studying for her Advanced Placement tests while modeling with Elite. “They’d call me ‘the AP kid’ because I was the only one taking AP’s and a lot of the other girls got their GED’s,” she said of her time in New York. 
Zavier J. Catoe ’12, a Harvard cheerleader who began modeling professionally last fall, said his experience has been all about fighting misconceptions.
“It’s interesting because I’m kind of doing some of the sterotypical dumb things, [so] my roommates like to joke about it a lot,” he said. “Cheerleaders are dumb. Models aren’t that smart at all. It’s kind of like breaking stereotype.”
Catoe pointed out that in addition to his other activities, he is spending a lot of time learning Italian and Spanish as well as exploring an interest in philosophy.
CRAMMING ON THE CATWALK
Hailing from a family of such academically-focused high achievers, Westbrook had no illusions about the rigorous academic requirements of Harvard. 
“I think Harvard is an academic haven. It’s a nest of intellectuals. Here you have to be an academic person.” she said. 
At the same time, Westbrook is a current top 10 finalist for the next season of the show ‘America’s Next Top Model’ in New York City. 
To balance her Seventeen photo shoots and ANTM auditions with school work, Westbrook says that she has developed an incentive system for herself.
“As long as I’m not missing something huge, like a midterm or a huge deadline, I’m okay with it. If there is a case where I’ll miss a paper, I’ll get it done beforehand and then I’ll reward myself,” she said. 
Dara, too, realized that coming to Harvard as a model would not be an easy path.
 She said that the demanding academics and busy extracurricular life usually put professional modeling careers to a halt. 
“I was set up for a really promising career in modeling,” she said. At age 15, Dara was discovered by Elite Model Management in Atlanta while participating in the Actors, Models & Talent Competition. Through Elite in Atlanta, Dara was connected to Elite in New York. 
Her modeling bookings began taking off the summer before senior year, when she was slotted for a photoshoot for V magazine alongside some of the top models at Elite New York, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Coco Rocha. 
Catoe’s arrival at Harvard gave him his start in modeling. Though he had always been interested in modeling back home in Virginia, “there weren’t many opportunities where I was from,” he said. 
Catoe began modeling by chance in October 2008 when he was discovered in Copley by an agent who invited him to do a test shoot. 
However, for him, modeling is “definitely like another extracurricular” which he balances alongside cheerleading and dorm crew. 
Sometimes, his schedule can be hectic attempting to balance cheering at games and his modeling career. 
“I remember one Saturday at the end of the first semester, I had to leave for New York City at five in the morning, shoot at 11, and take the three o’clock bus back,” he said.

BEYOND THE RUNWAY
At Harvard, Dara has had to put her modeling career on hold to focus on freshman life. 
She is actively involved in the Undergraduate Council, the South Asian Association, Project East, Eleganza, Cultural Rhythms, and Ghungroo. She has also been recently elected the secretary of the Hasty Pudding Club.
“My roommates joke that the only time I go back to my room is to sleep. Otherwise, I’m either at Lamont or at my extracurriculars,” she said.
Dara has chosen to pursue a career in medicine, concentrating in Human Evolution Biology, while keeping her modeling options open.
“A lot of people say I’d be great in the marketing industry, because that’s essentially what modeling is—marketing yourself,” she said. “But the changes in the economy made me re-evaluate some things, and unless something remarkable happens, I think I’ll go into orthodontistry.” 
Dara said that she had always been interested in Operation Smile, a children’s charity treating dedicated to treating facial deformities. 
Westbrook, who is an English and American Literature and Languages concentrator, says she is considering both fashion and law after college. 
“I like fashion journalism. I think it’s currently a major interest of mine. But I’m also studying for the LSATs. [Going into law] is something I could see myself doing,” she said. 
Academics, both Dara and Westbrook agreed, is their primary focus. 
“I would call modeling a secondary interest,” Westbrook said. 
But Westbrook is also quick to defend modeling as not just an empty pursuit, but a challenging vocation.
“I think a lot of times people think it’s a vacant-headed career choice where you’re just this empty-minded robot who stands in front of a camera,” she said. “I’d like to see all these people get in front of the camera and come up with 100 different poses.”

The position of assistant to the Allston Burr Resident Dean may face significant “restructuring” as House Masters grapple with the administration’s mandate to trim next year’s House budgets by 25 percent. According to House administrators, who spoke to The Crimson on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, the College administration is currently considering two proposals, both of which would scale back the position. One option is to consolidate the responsibilities of the 12 resident dean assistants, requiring one assistant to manage two or three Houses. The other alternative would be to cut the position back by two months of the calendar year, making it a 10-month job. Though resident deans said College administrators have been considering these proposed changes since February, strong opposition from students and House administrators to amending the position mounted this week, amid Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s announcement on Monday of sweeping cost-cutting measures across the College.House Masters met with College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and University President Drew G. Faust last week to discuss specific budget cuts in the Houses, according to Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67.Palfrey said a final decision about reshaping the resident dean’s assistant position would come next week, after a student-Faculty subcommittee—called the College Working Group—reviews budget proposals. Some House administrators, who wished to remain unnamed, added that “voices were raised” at last week’s meeting.The assistant to the resident dean is responsible for a wide array of administrative tasks, including the maintenance of an average of 400 files for current undergraduates as well as seven years’ worth of alumni files—which amounts to more than 500 files total in some Houses. The assistant also sends out recommendation letters for students applying to graduate or pre-professional schools. Additionally, he or she is often the sole “point of access” in Houses, providing students with impromptu counseling and advising, and fielding questions about academic policies, according to a memorandum presented to the College Working Group by assistants to the resident deans of all 12 Houses. “I can’t imagine the House functioning without us. House life would effectively fall apart,” said Otto F. Coontz, assistant to the Adams House resident dean, adding that yesterday alone, he consoled two students dealing with stress related to finals—a task he said he fulfilled willingly, but not one that is specified in his job description. “The thought of cutting [resident deans’ assistants] is ridiculous when there are a number of administrators at the College level that no one goes to,” Sean J. Hilgendorf ’10 said. “These are the people we go to—our point people.”In an interview with The Crimson last month, Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck said that an additional 230 administrative staffers across FAS have been added to the payroll in the last 10 years. In contrast, Palfrey said, the Houses haven’t increased their staff size for the last 10 years.“To propose cutting back on something which is so tightly run as it is, and to target individuals in a House who are both critical to administrators and students, provided a jolt,” he said. Students echoed that sentiment. “This cut, as opposed to the rest, will make students’ lives inconvenient, and hurt them academically,” said Kavita Kannan ’09, a Quincy resident. “And it will put a lot more pressure on the staff.” ­—Staff writer Bita M.

The average number of students per section will increase next year, as the Faculty of Arts and Science aims to save $2 million by cutting eight to 10 percent of the college’s section leaders for next year, according to Assistant Dean of the College Logan S. McCarty ’96. 
The savings are part of the budget cuts announced Monday by Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith designed to close the Faculty of Arts and Science’s projected $220 million budget deficit. 
In cutting the number of section leaders, administrators are instituting a more rigorous application of a long-standing target of 18 students per section. 
“Right now there are many instances of courses that have sections that are on average smaller than our target,” said McCarty, who is also a chemistry and chemical biology lecturer.
Including tutorials and smaller language and lab classes, sections currently average 13 students, according to McCarty, who said that some classes will be able to retain their small sections, 
But given the financial climate, college officials said next year they will be more stringent about meeting the general target. In meeting this threshold, McCarty said they hope to be able to cut the total number of sections by 10 percent. In the ’08-’09 academic year, the college had roughly 4,500 sections. 
With the average section increasing in size, there will be fewer sections overall, which will translate into fewer teaching positions.
Many graduate students’ primary source of income is their salary from leading sections, McCarty said. Graduate students earn roughly $5,000 per course they teach. Many graduate students teach two courses a semester, earning them about $20,000 per year. 
In making the budget cuts, “we went in with two priorities,” McCarty said. “One was to preserve the quality of undergraduate instruction, and the other was to ensure that graduate students who rely on teaching as a means of support had that means of support.” 
McCarty said that the administration will avoid reducing graduate students’ positions by limiting offers to non-Harvard graduate students, known as “teaching assistants,” rather than “teaching fellows.”
“We have not changed our commitment to having enough teaching for graduate students who need to support themselves, so this is having a larger impact on section leaders who are not graduate students in GSAS,” McCarty said.
This past year, undergraduates were taught by 380 TAs and 1340 TFs.  
But section leaders will not hear about job availability until the summer, and some will not know whether they are teaching until the end of shopping period. 
Departments hire most section leaders in July and August, based on estimations of class enrollments determined cooperatively by the University and individual departments, allowing section leaders time to prepare for the courses and communicate with course professors. 
“Without something called pre-registration, we don’t know how many people will be taking classes until after shopping period,” said Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. “It’s a pretty inefficient system.”
In the past, administrators did not enforce the section enrollment target. As a result, departments hired more section leaders, rather than redistributing them to classes where enrollment was higher.
But McCarty said he hopes with additional oversight from University Hall, departments will reallocate section leaders more efficiently.
“I don’t think that many students will notice the change in section size,” McCarty said, who said he foresaw only a small increase in the average enrollment. “It is really about bringing our section sizes in line with our policy goals.”
For those courses which have already hired their TFs for next semester—like Social Analysis 10: “Principles of Economics,” which has already hired 33 section leaders, according to Assistant Professor of Economics Silvia Ardagna—grad students who have been promised jobs will be employed next fall, either in the class they were hired for or for an equivalent course.

Harvard University Health Services will discontinue anonymous HIV/AIDS testing for students, effective August 1.Plans to eliminate this type of screening have been in the works since the beginning of this academic year, according to UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59, who cited underusage—rather than fiscal considerations—as the primary motivation behind the decision. “Anonymous testing has been great, but every year, fewer and fewer people get the testing,” Rosenthal said, adding that Harvard is one of the last Ivy League schools to continue both testing standards. Next academic year, the hospital will shift from offering both confidential and anonymous testing to exclusively providing confidential screenings. Students who receive confidential testing have documentation of their HIV/AIDS test incorporated in their medical records, while those who receive anonymous testing do not. Rosenthal added that UHS outsources counseling services, making available non-Harvard individuals to speak with students who request anonymous testing. He said that, though UHS technically charges $10 for an anonymous screening, the hospital waives the fee. Confidential tests are always free of charge and do not include counseling for students, he noted.In response to the policy change, Linda Ellison—who teaches in the department of Women and Gender Studies—is encouraging undergraduates to support anonymous testing at a “test-in” next Wednesday. In an e-mail that was forwarded to various campus lists last night, Ellison wrote that when Rosenthal was asked by one of her students “what kind of person” should get HIV/AIDS testing, the UHS director responded, “promiscuous” people.“The students said they felt judged,” Ellison said. “They felt [Rosenthal] was condescending,”Rosenthal denied making the comment, saying Ellison “misinterpreted” him in what he assumed to be a “private” conversation between her and two students.He noted to The Crimson that HIV/AIDS is “becoming less of a stigma, so there’s really less and less of a reason for being tested anonymously.”And though it may not be anonymous, “HIV testing is going to become standard for every single human being,” Rosenthal added.—Staff writer Ahmed N.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Information Technology division plans to cut the jobs of up to 25 students currently employed as User Assistants, FAS IT Senior Client Technology Advisor Noah S. Selsby ’95 confirmed to The Crimson yesterday.Selsby denied that the cuts were budget-related and wrote that the cuts are aimed at “refocusing the way the services are provided in order to increase efficiency.”“While the timing of these changes coincides with cuts in other areas of the university, this particular change will not constitute a savings for FAS IT,” Selsby wrote.At a mandatory meeting for all UAs held yesterday, FAS IT administrators told students that the changes make it so students serve students and full-time FAS IT employees work with faculty and staff.Two UAs—who asked that their names not be printed because they were told by FAS IT not to speak to the press and did not want to damage their chances for potential future employment—said that multiple students at the meeting said they would have better understood the reductions had they been part of fiscal cutbacks. “I came away thinking that it was budgetary but that someone higher up had told them that they needed to say it wasn’t budgetary,” one UA said.FAS IT—which currently employs 50 UAs—currently plans to offer 15 to 17 students jobs for next year. Eventually, they plan hire up to 8 more students for the year, Selsby wrote in the e-mail.According to one UA, students were told at the meeting that factors relating to their job attendance and performance would be taken into account when making employment cut decisions. Selsby added that FAS IT will be hiring additional students to assist on special projects throughout the year.In addition to cutting back on student employees, FAS IT has eliminated the position of student supervisor—responsible for helping UAs address difficult concerns—transferring their responsibilities to full-time FAS IT employees and grad students who are trained in the same skills as full-time staff.Both students said that most UAs did not support this change because full-time employees are less accessible and said they found it easier to approach a student for help rather than a full-time employee.UAs will continue to work at the FAS IT Help Desk—which will now close at 8 p.m. rather than 10 p.m.—and the Science Center’s basement computer clinic but will no longer answer phone concerns or work at the branch in William James Hall.On Tuesday, current UAs being offered jobs for the fall were sent an e-mail by FAS IT Supervisor of Student Computing Support Jamesley Dasse and Manager of Student Computing Support Lisa Duhaime asking to meet with them within the next two days. Students who were under consideration to fill the other spots were also sent e-mails by Dasse and Duhaime asking to meet with them over the next week. Those who did not receive either of the two e-mails learned at the meeting yesterday that their jobs had been cut.Last month, when FAS IT cut the Science Center’s computer clinic’s weekend hours, Selsby told The Crimson that the cuts in weekend hours did not result from FAS’s economic woes. He said that the UA program remained high among FAS IT’s priorities as the department considered the program a cost-saving measure in itself and that FAS IT might actually see a trend of increased student employment as a result of the economic crisis.—Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After enduring months of community criticism over its “land-banking” practices in Allston, Harvard announced Wednesday that it would be placing a one-year moratorium on new real estate purchases in the neighborhood—but not before it had already signed an agreement to lease and purchase another piece of property near its Science Complex construction site. According to University spokeswoman Lauren M. Marshall, Harvard will be master leasing the property at 65-79 Seattle St. in Brighton for 10 years, after which Harvard will purchase the parcel unless the owner elects to sell it to the University sooner. She declined to comment on the costs of the lease agreement and said that she did not have figures on hand for the precise total square footage of the lot, but emphasized that no deeds had been conferred at this time.Supply New England, the plumbing and heating company that currently occupies the site, will remain on site as tenants under the terms of the agreement, which was reached on Dec. 22 and finalized on April 17. In a letter sent on Wednesday to Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino announcing the moratorium, University President Drew G. Faust stated that Harvard’s continued near-term focus will be on “leasing and improvements to properties we currently own and continued dialogue with our Allston neighbors around community engagement and community-wide planning.” Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Harvard’s director of community relations for Boston, relayed Faust’s message to neighborhood residents at a North Allston-Brighton Community-Wide Planning Meeting Wednesday evening, where the news was welcomed by City officials and community members. Michael F. Glavin, deputy director of institutional development for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which oversees planning and development projects in the City, said that Faust’s letter represented a “good start to a continuing effort by Harvard to acknowledge the concerns of the neighborhood and to provide us with responses that we feel are appropriate.” In late December, Harvard stoked community concerns when it acquired another real estate parcel adjacent to the planned site of its relocated Charlesview apartments—although there too the tenant remained on-site. While the University has historically invested in real-estate contiguous to its existing holdings to allow for long-term growth, local residents called on Harvard to improve and lease its existing vacant property holdings in the neighborhood before making further purchases. Tensions further escalated in February when the University announced that it would slow construction of its much-heralded Allston Science Complex, prompting the Mayor to scribe a sharply-worded letter to Faust listing a set of community concerns that he expected would be addressed in the near future. Among his requests were an inventory of the University’s existing property holdings and their interim uses and a memorandum detailing conditions under which the University could purchase more real estate in the future. Harry Mattison and Ray Mellone, local residents and members of the Harvard Allston Task Force, said they were not concerned about the recent property acquisition and welcomed the moratorium on real estate acquisition.“Harvard’s out of money—of course they’re not buying any more property. We’re more concerned with properties right in the core of our community,” Mattison said. “[The recent acquisition] is more of a backwater location, but it does show that Harvard is still thinking way ahead.” ‘SHIFTING GEARS’While BRA officials had intended to focus largely on street grid and park design in Allston’s Holton Street Corridor at Wednesday night’s Community-Wide Planning meeting, discussions instead turned towards considerations of mixed-income and affordable housing in the future neighborhood, as well as the density and connectivity of the planned residential communities. Bob Kroin, the BRA’s chief architect, opened the meeting with a PowerPoint presentation detailing a vision of a transformed neighborhood with highlighted green avenues and parks that would connect residential sectors to the Charles River. He said that the “industrial history of North Allston has left it with major gaps in infrastructure that might otherwise have consolidated connected residential communities,” but that because the Holton Street Corridor is heavily Harvard-owned, it provides an opportunity to conduct “comprehensive planning” for the area west of Barry’s Corner and south of Western Avenue. Barry’s Corner, at the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard St., has long been envisioned as a future commercial hub in Allston similar to Harvard Square in Cambridge.While Kroin focused on various land use scenarios for the Corridor—he considered including a quiet urban park, an athletic field and playground, or both a quiet and active park—residents seemed more concerned in their break-out group discussions about housing ownership patterns in Allston and the plans to relocate the Charlesview apartments to the Corridor. “People like the idea of streets connecting and more green space, but when we got down to the subtle differences, the conversation went to, ‘What type of housing are we looking for?’” said local resident David McNair, summarizing the discussions that had taken place in his break-out group. “We should first set some guidelines in terms of, ‘Here’s what we expect in terms of housing.’ Then, maybe we’ll know where the park goes,” Mattison, the task force member and local resident, said he too felt that the discussion of parks had been “way out of sequence,” but that residents had managed to use the meeting to shift the focus of the BRA’s planning “to human beings from grass and asphalt.” Other neighborhood residents voiced concerns about the density and height of the envisioned commercial development in the area—some suggested that the entire area south of Western Ave. should be made residential—and others questioned whether the neighborhood had a need for more parks, given the existing open spaces in the area and the older age demographics of Allston-Brighton.Glavin, the BRA’s institutional development director, said he was pleased that Harvard representatives were “taking the time to listen and provide feedback in discussions,” noting that their presence would be “critical to a successful planning effort.” While the University has been criticized in the past by residents for insufficiently engaging in the CWP process, Galvin said he thought that Harvard is now “hearing concerns and responding in a way more specific than in the past.” —Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council moved Wednesday to eliminate five standing faculty committees, some of which were dormant—part of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s larger initiative to reexamine all standing faculty committees.The Science Center Executive Committee and the FAS Standing Committee on Benefits, which were dissolved, have not met for years.Former FAS Dean Jeremy R. Knowles originally founded the FAS Standing Committee in 1995 in response to the University administration’s intended one-percent reduction in its contribution to faculty pension funds, which had not been discussed with faculty members beforehand. The aim of the committee was to provide an avenue for communications about staff and faculty benefits.But after a University-wide committee was founded a year later, the FAS committee grew irrelevant and soon stopped meeting, according to science professor Gary J. Feldman, a founding member of both the FAS and University-wide committees.At Wednesday’s meeting, the Standing Committee on Faculty Research Support, the Standing Committee on Privacy, Accessibility, and Security of Records, and the Standing Committee on the Administration of the Bowdoin Prizes—which will be reconstituted as a prize committee—were all eliminated.FAS spokesman Robert P. Mitchell said that Smith is reexamining whether all these faculty committees need to exist not only as a clean-up operation, but also because they can be time-consuming for professors. Smith could not be reached for comment yesterday.There are currently 63 FAS committees listed on the Secretary of the Faculty’s Web site—but most of those eliminated Wednesday are not even listed on the site.The Faculty Council also moved for one class to count for SAT/UNSAT for the General Education curriculum. This policy will still need to pass a Faculty vote to be implemented, and it will go before the full Faculty next Tuesday.The Council passed a significantly revised Handbook for Students, which includes the minimum SAT Subject Test score of 700 to fulfill the foreign language requirement. There is also an entirely new section on the Gen Ed curriculum, which will be fully implemented this fall and required of all incoming members of the class of 2013.As of Wednesday, 51 Gen Ed classes have been approved to be offered next year, with 168 total classes next year counting toward the new curriculum.—Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School graduates Victor H.J. Jih and Tamara “Tammy” T.J. Jih crossed the finish line first on Sunday’s season 14 finale of The Amazing Race to claim the victory and the $1 million prize.  Victor and Tammy, siblings who graduated from HLS ten years apart (1996 and 2006 respectively) and are both litigators, traveled 40,000 miles and completed tasks in nine countries over the course of the race, which ended in Maui, Hawaii. They braved eight rounds of elimination, as well as stiff competition from the two other teams in the “final three,” one of which included the Amazing Race’s first deaf competitor.  Over the course of the race, the show emphasized the duo’s older brother-younger sister dynamic. A task in the hills of Romania brought the team’s “communication issues” to the fore, according to Victor, when he led his sister along an incorrect path despite her conviction that they were going the wrong way. For him, simply “getting along” with Tammy for 24 hours a day proved to be the most challenging aspect of the experience.“The race is designed to test—to stress—normal relationships, and see how they weather under extreme conditions,” he said. Over 14 episodes, Tammy and Victor completed numerous tasks, including boarding a party taxi in Thailand and singing karaoke with “Mai Tai trannies,” Tammy said. For her, one of the most valuable experiences was learning to travel without money or credit cards to serve as a safety net.“Victor and I, in the grand scheme of things, have lived fairly privileged lives,” she said, noting that the rules of The Amazing Race put them on an equal playing field with everybody else.While both Victor and Tammy thought they had a shot at claiming the prize, Tammy said, “I never let myself truly believe that we would win until the very end.”She said that she plans to use her winnings to repay her law school loans. Victor said he hopes to continue with his passion—supporting high school debate.—Staff writer Molly M. Strauss can be reached at mstrauss@fas.harvard.edu

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate student leaders met Friday to discuss a joint reaction to the sweeping budget cuts announced Monday by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The group agreed on a three-phase protest dubbed "We Are Harvard: Students, Staff, and Faculty for Transparency and Inclusion in Budget Cuts," which will take place before, during, and after the monthly Faculty meeting this Tuesday.
The administration is "still not being transparent," said Andrea R. Flores ’10, Undergraduate Council president, at the meeting.
Other than Flores, Institute of Politics President Mary K.B. Cox ’10, Harvard College Democrats Presidents Eva Z. Lam ’10, several UC members, and numerous House Committee chairs were in attendance.
The protest will begin with student group leaders—and possibly faculty or staff—handing out materials before the meeting starts. Then students who serve on student-faculty committees, and are thus allowed to attend the meeting, will pose questions to the faculty about budget cuts, according to the plan. Currently, the cuts are not on the Faculty meeting agenda.
At 5:15 p.m. the group plans to hold a larger rally outside University Hall, where the Faculty meeting will be in progress.
During the meeting, several students discussed methods to increase press coverage of the event to put more pressure on administrators.
"There are mainstream media outlets that care about this," said UC representative Eric N. Hysen ’11, "Now I think that’s something we can leverage.""The best thing we can do is bring together students, staff, faculty, and alumni. If we can bring together all those forces, they will listen," he said.
Several students in attendance seemed optimistic that members of the Faculty would take their side in the struggle to give student voice more sway in College budget decisions.
A draft of an e-mail authored by several of the students in attendance and sent by Hysen, who is also an active Crimson IT editor, to the We—Are—Harvard Google group reads in part, "The recent cuts announced by Dean Smith reflect the top-down process by which these decisions were made. Broad community input would have alerted the administration to the serious issues that have been raised with many of these cuts. Decisions to reduce shuttle service, close the Quad library, cut hot breakfast, increase section sizes, and slash House budgets were made without real input from the communities affected by these cuts. Going forward, we are concerned that this pattern will continue as future cuts are announced over the summer and into the fall, when student input will be even more limited than during these first round of cuts."
A Facebook event initially hosted by Flores and now hosted by "Harvard
Students, Faculty, and Staff" has been created for the rally.
HoCo chairs said they also plan to ask their House Masters to take
part.
Flores, who said she had initially expected "primarily administrative cuts" to be announced last Monday, said before the meeting that the strong student reaction to the budget cuts is being met with little response from administrators.
"[Students] are realizing that no matter how many petitions they’re doing or e-mails they write... they’re not getting any sort of response," she said. "Even though we’re the consumers of the education, we’re not able to give feedback."

Earlier this week , when budget cuts were announced, you were probably thinking of all the past Harvard excesses you’ve witnessed, expenditures that probably seem a lot more superfluous than, say, shuttle service or small section sizes.
Thinking back to the hordes of prefrosh that were just on campus, gorging themselves at countless ice cream socials and pizza parties—all on the College’s tab—you’re probably wondering how Harvard can afford to dish out all those goodies while depriving its actual undergraduate population of arguably the most important meal of the day. And why is it that we can afford to keep the HUDS worker whose job consists of standing by the back door of Annenberg to prevent students from surreptitiously making off with dishware, while we can’t keep the grill worker who makes omelets each morning?
The list of potential cuts that can be made without hurting student life goes on and on. For instance:
-Do away with the Ad Board. Harvard can operate on an honor system!
-Sell the library collections. After all, students don’t actually wander into the depths of Widener except to do unmentionable things.
-Eliminate maintenance services. Judging from the infested and flooded condition of our Houses, they aren't very effective, anyway.
Some creative students resentful of the budget cuts proposed other areas where reductions could be made. Some priceless suggestions from email threads after the jump
Here are some more ways I would help solve the budget issues:
* Sell ALL those paintings of random old white people that are everywhere on campus.
* Close Lamont at 11:00 PM every night (which would require giving less work so Lamont wouldn't need to be open 24 hours) and keep house libraries open longer.
* Close Lamont Cafe because everything sold there can be put in a vending machine
Close Lamont at 11pm??  How dare  you!  FlyBy would lead as many all-night sit-ins as as it took to stop this change.  Some sort of SWAT team would be necessary.  Shots would be fired. People would die.
Other students looked internationally for approaches to cost-cutting.  More command and control, please?
In terms of housing, we can take a page from the Chinese school system, which centralizes showers in a different building, and hot water is available only from 7-9am, 12-3, and 9-12.  Heating in the winter, don't count on it - with SIX students PER ROOM, you'll be more likely than not have your windows open all day.
Another student proposed a solution that would end Harvard’s budget woes altogether:
What if we just set up a counterfeiting operation? Harvard could break the Feds' monopoly on the industry, and all of our problems would go away!
Hmmm...a little financial fraud?  It's not as if Harvard hasn't waded in those waters before.
And on the HUDS blog, an anonymous commenter made an interesting point about the logic behind the hot breakfast cut:
The 30% attendance argument is inane. Heck, probably 30% of students attend lectures, we're not going to do away with classes, are we?
Best idea yet.  Perhaps we could ban all Friday classes?  You wouldn't have to heat that accursed Vanserg, at least, right?

Remember when you considered writing that thesis? Now's the one day a year you can feel bad about taking the easy road to drunken senior spring. Yes, it's the 2009 Hoopes Prizes! The list (here, quick read it so you can congratulate that friend of yours that everybody knew was going to win it!) contains some of the most arcane paper titles we've seen this side of a neuroscience convention. And of course, we've got lots of the standard "Colorful Quote": Boring Description of Paper Title Construction (The thesis we always wanted to write was "From Russia With Love: The Cuban Missile Crisis").
But even if predictable, a few of them struck us as things we'd totally read! So, below, take a look at our top five Hoopes prize winners, based not on scholarly contribution or some such thing, but on ability to capture our fleeting attention.
1) "More Dead Than Dead: Perceived Mind of the Persistent Vegetative State"
We don't know what this means. But it sounds way deep!
2) "Defining Herpes: Pharmaceuticals, Physicians, and Patients in the Post-Antiviral Era"
We, uh, know what this means. We'd define it as socially stigmatizing. It's a long story...
3) "The Great Wall of Bacteria: Discovery of Intrisic Glycan Chain Length Biases in Penicillin Binding Proteins"
This was our winner until we got past the colon. All downhill from there.
4) "The Anatomy of the Iron Fist: Police Violence in Democratic Latin America"
Simply baller. The first part actually sounds like a Jackie Chan movie. And if anyone could have pulled down a Hoopes, it's Jackie Chan.
5) "My Empty Top Hat: A Memoir"
We have a hat fetish. Seriously.
