After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Though his Harvard Book Store reading on Nov. 19 was not the first occasion on which Jesse Eisenberg had been to Harvard, it was, he said, an event fraught with confusion. “I thought you were affiliated with Harvard, and then when I just found out you were independent it was too late to cancel,” he said, to laughter from the audience at a sold-out Brattle Theatre. “I came here for the tangential association and then discovered it didn’t exist.”
Eisenberg was evidently aware of his near-universal recognizability as star of a certain movie about facebook, but in front of his audience he seemed like any other debut fiction author. Despite his acting training and widely praised abilities, he read much more quickly than do many authors—but his almost breathless delivery dovetailed with his humor, as well as with the stories he chose. Eisenberg read three short vignettes in the style of restaurant reviews penned by a child dragged to fancy eateries by his divorcée mother. Each was suffused with one-liners—“First joke, hit” he said in response to the audience’s warm reception, then “Should have stopped after the joke” once he had finished the story. Simultaneously, his vignettes achieved impressive emotional purchase. “And probably most children would be angry at their moms for lying so much,” his narrator writes at one point, “but for some reason it just makes me feel sad for her.”
This idea of juxtaposition, and not simply of humor and profundity, is, according to Eisenberg, key to his work. “I try to match up things that are in conflict, that are funny juxtapositions,” he said, discussing a story in which Alexander Graham Bell acts far more like a teenager with an iPhone than the erudite inventor of a novel form of communication. “If we give it some extra thought, if we’re curious, we would probably discover that people in history had the same kind of deviant, weird curiosities that we have.”
Eisenberg himself is arguably a sort of human juxtaposition: an A-list actor and a young short-story writer contained within a single body. But these identities, for Eisenberg, seem to function symbiotically rather than conflictually. “I don’t see [writing] as so different from the other things that I do,” he said. “I think about a character in a movie, and I’m thinking about him from an emotional perspective. And then you write this [set of vignettes], and you’re thinking about this boy from an emotional perspective...what this boy is going through, what his emotional life must be, what his mother’s emotional life must be.”
Similarly, he sees far more commonality than contrast between the comic and grave aspects of his stories. “As an actor, you’re trained to do comedies in some ways more emotionally honest[ly] than a drama, because it’s not going to be funny if characters aren’t experiencing it in a real way,” he said. As comedy, for Eisenberg, begets drama, so too does drama beget comedy. When his microphone stand began to malfunction, he asked that it not be fixed. “I prefer a joke and a ruined night [to] no joke and everything go[ing] off without a hitch,” he said.
Given this attitude, it is perhaps unsurprising that Eisenberg has had such a triumphant career despite his documented struggles with anxiety. When asked how he finds success through his anxiety, he attributed a degree of his success to that difficulty. “Whatever is fueling that anxiety will be a lot more interesting than the guy who’s writing from a place of confidence,” he said. “It [will] be more interesting, ’cause you’re going to be revealing something that’s deeper than somebody who’s not necessarily exploring discomfort…. Having anxiety is okay. It’s where you channel it that is the important question.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 8, 2015, at 11:32 p.m.
Former president of Princeton University Shirley M. Tilghman will serve as the newest member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board.
Tilghman, who was elected Sunday, will join in January the elite 13-member group, which is the oldest corporation in the western hemisphere. During her tenure as president of Princeton from 2001 to 2013, Tilghman expanded the school’s financial aid program, overhauled the undergraduate residential system, and created academic programs in the arts.
“Her broad experience in leading one of the country’s great universities will bring fresh perspectives and beneficial knowledge to our consideration of Harvard’s opportunities and challenges at a pivotal moment for universities,” wrote University President Drew G. Faust and William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation, in a press release Monday.
Tilghman will be the only Harvard Corporation member besides Faust and Nannerl O. Keohane who did not attend Harvard as an undergraduate or as a graduate student. Still, Tilghman has ties to the University—she recently oversaw a comprehensive review of Harvard life sciences. Tilghman also received an honorary Harvard doctorate in 2004.
“At this moment when there are so many challenging issues facing universities and colleges, I am very much looking forward to working with President Drew Faust and colleagues on the Corporation to help guide Harvard’s future course,” Tilghman said in the press release.
Originally from Canada, Tilghman has been a longtime champion for university research. She is chair of the board of the Association of American Universities and also serves on the board of the Broad Institute at Harvard and MIT. In 2000, Tilghman also served on a committee to advise Faust— who at the time was dean of Radcliffe College— during its transition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Lee said in an interview that he thinks Tilghman’s experience at Princeton will be “invaluable” to Harvard.
“As we address issues of race and diversity, which are critically important across the University, her experience in leading Princeton will be a great help to us,” Lee said.
“Having someone with her background and her expertise join the Corporation, as we try to do our best to ensure that the collective Harvard community is doing the most it can in the life sciences, is critical,” Lee added.
Tilghman replaces James F. Rothenberg ’68, a longtime Harvard adviser who died suddenly in July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team took home two school records and a plethora of wins in both swimming and diving this weekend, as the team faced off against competitors across the nation.
The Crimson split the squad up to compete at the Texas Invitational, Hawkeye Invitational, and Georgia Fall Invitational over the weekend.
“[This weekend] has been a huge success in all locations,” Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 said. “I’m incredibly proud of the team.”
TEXAS INVITATIONAL
The Crimson’s most impressive performances this weekend occurred at the Texas Invitational in Austin, where sophomore Geordie Enoch and freshman Sonia Wang both set school records.
No Harvard swimmer had ever gone below two minutes in the 200 IM before this weekend, when two swimmers accomplished the feat. Wang was the first to do so on Friday, when she went 1:58.51 in her 200 IM prelims. Later that day, Wang’s time of 1:59.22 in the finals was good for fifth place—just ahead of Enoch, who landed a ninth-place finish with a personal best of 1:59.45.
“[Enoch and Wang] have been working very hard in practice, and it’s just nice to see that it all came together this weekend,” junior Danielle Lee said. “I don’t think they were shocked that it happened, but it was a nice little surprise.”
The next day, Enoch again set a personal best by breaking the Crimson record in the 200 breaststroke. Her time of 2:13.65 just bested Olympian Jackie Pangilinan’s best time of 2:13.98, set a decade ago in 2005.
“[Breaking the record] was exciting,” Enoch said. “I didn’t really have that many expectations going into the race since I think of myself as more of an IM-er than a breaststroker, but timing felt good and I just wanted to see what I could do. I actually didn’t know I’d broken the record until coach told me.”
In addition to Enoch and Wang’s times in the 200 IM, Harvard scored a multitude of other NCAA ‘B’ cut times. Lee, senior Kendall Crawford, and freshman Brittany Usinger all scored ‘B’ cut times in a variety of events, capping off a successful meet for the Crimson squad.
GEORGIA FALL INVITATIONAL
While the swimmers split up into two groups, the diving team headed off as a unit to Athens, Georgia, on Friday to participate in the Georgia Fall Invitational.
Their performance was highlighted by a strong showing from sophomore NCAA qualifier Jing Leung, who placed third in the three-meter diving competition with a score of 316.55 and first in the platform contest with a score of 268.55. In the platform, Leung started off slowly—ranking 12th out of 13 competitors after the first dive—but landed the highest score among all the women in each of her next five dives to secure the gold medal.
HAWKEYE INVITATIONAL
On Friday, sixteen Crimson swimmers headed to Iowa City to compete at the Hawkeye Invitational hosted by the University of Iowa. There, the Crimson again performed well, taking home a slew of top-eight finishes across multiple disciplines.
Harvard’s strongest showing occurred in the 200 free, where it managed to land three swimmers in the top eight. Junior Daniela Johnson’s time of 1:49.44 was good for second, ahead of Crimson freshman Claire Pinson and junior Victoria Chan, who finished seventh and eighth respectively.
Elsewhere, junior Marissa Cominelli put up competitive showings in the backstroke events, placing second in the 100 back and third in the 200 back. In the 100 back, her time of 54.69 was good for a NCAA ‘B’ cut tune.
Johnson, Pinson, and Chan, along with junior Margaret Chory, teamed up in the 800 free relay to end the meet on a good note by landing a third place finish with a time of 7:25.33.
“[This weekend] was a midway mark of where we are with our training, and I’m incredibly pleased,” Morawski said. “[The team] has put a lot of hard work and dedication into the sport all fall, and they were rewarded with some fast swimming.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Select members of the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams opened up their season this weekend as the Crimson made the short journey to crosstown rival Boston University to participate in the BU Season Opener.
Six athletes combined to take home seven events, led by senior Autumne Franklin’s pair of triumphs. The Owings Mills, Md., native clocked in at a Harvard-record 38.72 seconds in the 300 meter dash, while junior Jade Miller was close behind her at 38.84, the second-best time in the school record books.
Franklin also took home the 60 meter hurdles title with a time of 8.72 seconds.
Rookie Gabrielle Thomas started off her collegiate career with a bang, winning the 60 meter dash with a time of 7.56 seconds, with classmate Ngozi Musa behind her at 7.70 seconds. The two freshmen times were good enough to place them in the top-10 in the Crimson record books.
On the men’s side, junior Thomas Negron claimed the 1000 meter title, clocking in with a time of 2:31.93. Senior Robert Hogg, meanwhile, claimed the one mile run, finishing with a time of 4:25.94, just under five seconds faster than the second place finisher.
Outside the track, sophomore Marlee Sabatino set an indoor personal best and Harvard all-time fourth-best mark in the pole vault, clearing a height of 12 feet and 3.75 inches to take home the title.
On the men’s side of the field, senior Spencer Lemons’ mark of six feet and six inches claimed him the goal in the high jump, two inches higher than the second place mark shared by three different competitors.
With its first meet of the season under its belt, the Crimson now take a month off of competing before retuning to compete at Cornell on January 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team took on the odds at Las Vegas’s Cliff Keen Invitational this weekend, with three members of the squad—co-captain Todd Preston, junior Nick Gajdzik, and senior Devon Gobbo—cashing out their chips for top-10 finishes.
“I think we’re all really proud of how we did this weekend,” Gobbo said. “We saw some things that needed to be fixed, and once we make those adjustments, we’ll be in an even better position going into our next competitions.”
For captain Todd Preston, this was the second consecutive tournament in which he ended the competition with a second place finish.
“Anytime you have a guy get to the finals it’s a good overall thing for the team,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “We hadn’t had someone get to the championship bout in this tournament for several years, so it was a step in the right direction.”
Preston managed to hang on to a potential title run through the semifinal round, where he took on ninth-ranked Tommy Thorn. For most of the bout, the two wrestlers were at a deadlock. But down by one with eight seconds to go, Preston took a shot and registered the takedown with one second left on the clock, earning a spot in the final.
“The three guys that placed all did an impressive job,” Weiss said. “It was great to get Todd in the finals, [and] we haven’t had a guy get there in a couple years. They wrestled in some really gutsy matches to get there, so obviously those guys stand out.”
Gajdzik was another standout for the Crimson, registering a sixth-place finish in the heavyweight position. After falling in his third match, the senior battled through his next two matchups in the consolation bracket to regain his footing.  He finished the weekend with two losses to the No. 8 and No. 18-ranked heavyweights.
“Nick really held his own this weekend,” Gobbo said. “He proved he can wrestle with anyone in the country.”
Gobbo was the final top finisher for the Crimson. Gobbo fell in a tightly contested consolation round matchup to Oklahoma’s ninth-ranked Clark Glass, 6-5, in the last second of regulation. The loss came after four consecutive victories from Gobbo in the consolation bracket.
“Losing one at the buzzer is always difficult,” Weiss said. “The match was a little difficult, there was a lot of confusion from the score table, but you still want to wrestle into overtime, and he dropped that in those last seconds, which was tough.”
Gobbo finished sixth at 165, dropping the next match to the eleventh-ranked wrestler in his division.
The Crimson also saw freshmen Nolan Hellickson and LJ Butler move forward in the tournament, with Hellickson recording two wins and Butler notching a victory as well.
“Nolan had been out with some injuries, so he’s really just starting to get into his groove,” Weiss said. “He did some really nice work this weekend, and he’s only going to get better.”
The Crimson finished tied for 19th place this weekend, jumping up 15 spots from last year’s 31st-place finish.
“This is a tough tournament, so there’s a lot of top guys in those weight classes,” Weiss said. “I definitely think there some weight classes we need to get better in. But we still made a lot of progress, so I have some very good overall feelings and then some good things to work on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the men’s and women’s fencing teams went undefeated over the weekend at the annual Traditional Tournament to carry momentum from last season’s strong NCAA Tournament finishes.
On the men’s side, which went an undefeated 5-0 for the first time since 2010, co-captain Duncan O’Brien led the way with a near-perfect 14-1 bout record, and his saber group did not lose a single round all afternoon to Vassar, Penn State, Sacred Heart, NJIT, and NYU.
The same could be said about the men’s foil group which, despite the absence of injured co-captain Michael Woo, dominated its opponents throughout the afternoon en route to a 34-11 total bout record in the five rounds.
As a team, the group handily defeated the Nittany Lions by a 17-10 score a season after dropping a round against the same squad in 2014 at the Tradition Tournament. The Crimson took all three weapons from its Penn State foes, with the epee and saber groups winning by 5-4 scores as well.
The dynamic Harvard saber duo of junior co-captain Adrienne Jarocki and senior Aliya Itzkowitz carried the Crimson women to a pristine 5-0 record as well on different strips, with neither 2014 NCAA Tournament finalist dropping a single bout over the course of the day.
The closest Harvard would come to sniffing defeat was against Temple in round 4, in which the epee trio lost six bouts. However, six bout wins from the foil group and eight more from the saber squad lifted the Crimson to another win, this time by a 17-10 score, which was also the same score as last season’s match with the Owls.
The tournament win marked the third-straight for the Harvard women.
