Ariel Lawhon’s novel “I Was Anastasia” opens with an epigraph, a bold assertion from the iconic novelist Rudyard Kipling: “If history were taught in the form of stories, it would never be forgotten.” It’s a powerful sentiment, compelling yet undoubtedly grandiose. The epigraph is an omen of what is to come: a novel with an interesting story and refreshing structure that falls slightly short. In the end, “I Was Anastasia”’s promising concept sets expectations high, which makes the novel’s less-than-perfect execution slightly disappointing.
The novel tells two stories simultaneously, that of the young Grand Duchess Anastasia Romanov during the Russian Revolution as her family is dethroned and shipped off to exile, and the other of a mysterious woman called Anna, who claims to be Anastasia and to have escaped the firing squad that destroyed the rest of her family. The novel switches between chapters entitled “Anna,” (which begin 1970 and then move backwards through time) and ones entitled “Anastasia," (which begin in 1917 and move forward). The novel ends as the stories collide in 1918. As the two stories unfold at the same time, Lawhon introduces parallels between the lives and characters of the two women, but does not answer definitively whether they are one and the same, leaving that up for speculation.
The Russian Revolution isn’t immediately evocative of Sherlock Holmes, but Lawhon seems to have this iconic detective in mind as she constructs her novel. The first part opens with an epigraph from Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, which Anastasia’s father reads to her from the Sherlock Holmes stories, as “he puts a bit of straw into the fire and uses it to light his pipe.” Much like a mystery novel, “I Was Anastasia” is designed to force the reader into the role of detective. In a typical murder mystery, information is revealed as the detective discovers it, so that to read the novel is to become a partner in the detective’s work. “I Was Anastasia” employs this principle and applies it to a different kind of mystery, a historical one, solved not by analyzing people but by analyzing their stories—records, correspondence, things they might have left behind. Instead of an eccentric private investigator, the detective is Ariel Lawhon herself. In the author’s note, Lawhon writes, “I read all of Anna Anderson’s biographies backward, from last chapter to first,” in order to learn Anna’s story in the same chronology as in the book.
The book is clearly well-researched and the historical elements are woven seamlessly into Lawhon’s fictional construction. Character’s like Gleb Botkin (son of the Romanov’s physician and Anna’s most faithful supporter) and Pierre Gilliard (the Romanov tutor who is convinced Anna is a fraud) are woven into the fabrics of both stories. Their stories are intermingled with the fictional narratives that Lawhon creates for them. In one surprisingly compelling scene, Anna meets with Hitler. His readiness to believe her story disgusts her, along with the “hypnotic tone to his voice.” Lawhon writes that “the air almost crackles with his zeal, and she fears any movement on her part will bring a static charge.” History is balanced perfectly with fictional narrative, enough to ground the novel without overpowering the story.
But if the concept is innovative and the adaptation of history expert, the writing itself leaves something to be desired. The first section of the novel is entitled “Fair Warning.” Less than a page long, it is a jarring second-person address from a first-person narrator. The section ends and introduces the first narrative part of the novel with two lines: “Are you ready? Good. Let us begin.” Like the Rudyard Kipling epigraph, this introduction suggests a story that takes itself too seriously. The narrator seems to haughtily say, “Brace yourself. This story is great.” The need to announce that the novel is about to start does not bode well.
The novel is written in present tense, and the result is slightly awkward, especially given the novel’s non-chronological structure. While the history is incorporated well, the German sprinkled throughout the novel is heavy-handed, often followed immediately by translation: “She decides then that the man is an utter Arschloch. Asshole.” There are moments of tenderness, poetry and poignancy and humor—in one scene, in the aftermath of a sexual assault, Lawhon writes that “the night’s terrors are replaced by an eeriness that settles heavily in the air” and then powerfully asserts that “there is nothing artistic about rape.” But these moments are few and far  between.
In the author’s note, which is of considerable importance to the book, Lawhon explains that she is “drawn” to both Anna and Anastasia. Whether or not they are one and the same, they are both “worthy of our attention” and sympathy. Lawhon seems to suggest in her note that she has written the book with the aim of eliciting similar feelings from her audience. But these characters, and in particular Anna, are a bit irksome. In Anastasia’s sections, Lawhon takes time to depict the positive qualities of her character. But in Anna’s case, it seems often like any exploration of her personality is sacrificed to make room for further discussion of her misery, making sympathy more difficult.
Lawhon also makes an interesting style choice that does not pay off by having Anastasia’s sections told in first person, and Anna’s in third person. While this does make it easier to differentiate between the two parts, there remains some confusion as a result of the first person introduction and conclusion that frame the novel. Why not keep the entire book in the first person? Moreover, in writing Anna’s story in the third person, Lawhon passes up a prime opportunity to explore an unreliable narrator, in a way that would perfectly complement the novel’s overall structure.
The novel’s structure and its historical grounding make its concept compelling, but some off-putting style choices and gaps in character development ultimately detract from its execution.

Leigh Chen Sanders’ vision is not an allegory. “This isn’t like some William Faulkner stream-of-consciousness metaphorical crap,” she says, matter-of-factly. “My mother. Is literally. A bird.”
Leigh’s candor, balanced with often surprising tenderness, sets the tone for “The Astonishing Color of After.” The poignant debut novel by Emily X.R. Pan tells the story of Leigh, a half-Taiwanese, half-Irish girl whose first kiss with her longtime best friend Axel shockingly coincides with her mother’s suicide. In the aftermath of this trauma, Leigh’s mother appears to her in the form of a red bird, delivering a strange gift that prompts Leigh to visit her maternal grandparents in Taiwan and delve into her family’s mysterious and troubled past. In a smartly crafted and heartbreaking story, Pan weaves the evocative tale of a girl whose journey to understand her mother bends time and space.
Though booksellers and librarians will inevitably shelve “The Astonishing Color of After” among other young adult novels, the scope of its themes—suicide, cultural identity, sexuality—evokes the gravitas of novels intended for much older demographics. Pan’s character casting is representation par excellence: The protagonist is a half-Taiwanese, half-Irish girl, joined by her half-Filipino, half-Puerto Rican best friend, and another friend who identifies as lesbian. Many young adult novels’ efforts to account for representation veer into polemics, each character becoming a caricature of their demographic, but representation in “The Astonishing Color of After” feels intentional, yet careful; accurate, yet not overly forceful. Much of the novel is set in Taiwan, which Pan paints lovingly with meticulous detail—the pungent smells of its night markets, its big yolk moons and salty comfort foods.
The trappings of Pan’s literary toolbox, too, evoke more established authors. The novel’s oscillation between past and present, noted in chapters titled “Smoke and Memories,” feels evocative of the temporal fragmentation in Zadie Smith’s “Swing Time,” a daring authorial decision that colors in missing context. It’s true that, at certain moments, Pan’s prose is heavy-handed, the last sentences of certain chapters failing to quite stick the landing (“I’m too pissed to say anything back. Nobody even says goodbye,” Leigh ends chapter 15 moodily). But what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up in emotional potency. The novel’s cutting portrayal of grief and mourning recalls the early chapters of “The Goldfinch,” Donna Tartt’s 2014 Pulitzer winner: “The mother-shaped hole became a cutout of the blackest black,” Pan writes. “I had to fight that emptiness, that absence of color.” In another scene, Leigh recalls watching her mother play piano at a choir concert. “[Music] was in her every breath, her every movement,” she remembers. “She was the color of home.”
For the burgeoning artist protagonist, color is the lingua franca, and the same can be said of Pan herself, whose painterly prose often evinces synesthesia. Indeed, ordinary language feels inadequate for a plot that quickly reveals itself to exhibit magical realism. The titular conceit allows Pan to enrich her prose with inventive metaphors. A front door slamming sounds “puke green.” When Leigh is nervous, her voice “comes out ash blue”; when she feels guilt, it “cuts through [her] chromium-oxide green.” Leigh and Axel communicate emotion through color—in lieu of “how are you?” or “how do you feel?” they ask each other, “What color?” expecting to understand the other’s emotion through color. “We’ve been best friends… long enough that that’s all we need,” Leigh explains the habit. “One color to describe a mood, a success, a failure, a wish.” It’s an apt portrayal of adolescent friendship (and romance), and fitting, too, that Pan pairs friendship with artistry. Both are kinds of the same intricate, intimate world that can only be understood from the inside.
Axel and Leigh’s relationship is touching, but the strongest moments of “The Astonishing Color of After” deal with Leigh and her quest to retroactively understand her mother, the exacting combing of her memory for signs and omens. Most impressive is Pan’s sensitive yet thorough attention to depression, and its irrevocable consequences for Leigh’s mother, a victim of—and Pan makes this very clear—a relentless illness, not a set of causes or circumstances. Leigh’s descriptions are haunting in their vicarious pain: “My mother’s expression didn’t change. Her eyes were sunken, haunted, like she hadn’t slept or seen the sun in days. Like someone had wrung the color out of her complexion.” And later: “Long before I lost my mother… Long before doctors put a label on her condition…Long before everything: She was already hurting.”  Understanding that mental illness is rarely discussed and that therapy is rarely sought among Asian American populations, Pan’s elucidation of a mental illness, rather than a physical one, takes a special bravery. There’s little precedent for this story, which is all the more reason for its particular urgency. A reader won’t just see herself in this story—the novel is a mirror, but it is also a magnifying glass for everything that can’t be seen with the naked eye.
“The Astonishing Color of After” is a thoughtful exploration of defining and discovering identity—cultural, artistic, familial, and personal. It is a heart-rending story about what it means to recover from loss. But most of all, it is a clarion call to pay attention to the ones we love—to look for their true colors, and hope they can read ours, too.

In 272 pages and 11 short stories (some shorter than others), Brock Clarke plunges into the depths of the absurd. His tales, spun from a thread dipped in what witty allegories are made of, reach deep to express powerful emotions, and are consistent in their efforts to explore the complexities of human nature. Clarke’s strength is his cognizance of the surreal, lurking in plain sight yet hidden from the public eye. Clarke’s prowess for the process of defamiliarization stems from this alertness. He wields this tool masterfully, bringing the strangeness of mankind to the forefront in a bid to expose the ridiculous nature of our society and the things we value. By the end of this collection, Clarke has dedicated his eccentric combination of absurd comedy and gut-wrenching tragedy to a range of contemporary themes, from race to the fragility of love and life.
“The Price of the Haircut,” Clarke’s title story, follows a group of men with devastatingly poor haircuts, living in a city rocked by race riots in response to a policeman’s killing of an unarmed black teenage boy. Over the course of a page, the mayor of this unnamed city reveals that the source of this racial tension is “a barber named Gene who charged eight dollars for a haircut and…said something racist.” This eventually leads to the riots. The men are bewildered: eight dollars for a haircut! As the plot unfolds, they engage a pressing moral dilemma: All their lives, they had paid at least 15 dollars for their terrible haircuts. Now, they could pay half that, which would dilute the pain of their catastrophic hair. But, are they prepared to patronize a racist barber—to sacrifice their commitment to the fight against racism? Clarke’s story devolves into the bizarre, yet grave, ethical considerations that leave the reader laughing, and with much to consider.
Clarke loves commas. In fact, Clarke is so in love with commas that his sentences stretch on for pages at a time. His prose is long and winding, but carefully tailored to his stories: They reflect the uncanny content of Clarke’s fiction, allowing his wit to percolate deeper than the plot and into the syntax he employs. This author has no regard for economy of words, yet by some stroke of genius, he is still able to ensure concision in his writing. In that fashion, Clarke’s stories resemble rollercoasters: He writes a tantalizing, never-ending build-up to the top of the ride, and then loosens the reins to let his readers free-fall, hurtling toward emotional clarity. In “Concerning Lizzie Borden, Her Axe, My Wife,” a man learns about his wife’s forthcoming death, growing larger on the horizon, like the hole in her heart. Upon hearing this, he says he immediately thinks “of the corresponding hole in [his] own heart, about it getting bigger and bigger and never closing, and how [he] will eventually want to die from it but can’t and won’t.” This startling moment of pain comes amid a ridiculous story of the couple taking a tour of an axe-murderer’s childhood home, and it is this spectrum of emotion that Clarke plays with so masterfully.
Across the board, Clarke’s commitment to the absurd is noteworthy. In a story entitled, “The Book of Bad Ideas,” he says “absurdity is often the best way to fully appreciate how very bad our very bad ideas really are.” This sentiment shines through his every word in “The Price of the Haircut” with a freshness sorely lacking in other contemporary novels. Clarke grabs what is taken for granted and turns it on its head, restructuring it to convey the sheer absurdity of our accepted and unquestioned conventions. And often, that is what it takes to spark a more profound understanding of humanity.

On Mar. 5 in Sever 113, there was a buzz in the air not unlike the first day of a new class, except the room was filled with more senior citizens than college seniors. Nearly every seat was full, and people were standing against the back wall, chatting with friends about novelist Jenny Erpenbeck, who came all the way from Germany to make a “rare American appearance” in conversation with Claire Messud, a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at Harvard. The classroom setting, the presence of a Harvard professor at the front of the room, and the absence of a signing table or any novels for sale lent an academic gravity to the discussion of Erpenbeck’s latest novel “Go, Went, Gone” and the broader issue of refugees it addresses.
The event opened with a brief introduction of Erpenbeck by Messud, followed by a short reading from “Go, Went, Gone” and a discussion between the two writers. The entire event was fairly intimate, in spite of the setting and the format, largely because of Erpenbeck herself. She joked with the audience about her cough and her inability to get her microphone to face the right direction. But she also made people go silent with her speech—a sort of respect appropriate for a discussion of the refugee crisis and humanity itself.
Erpenbeck is, as Messud describes her, “a writer who wastes no words,” and indeed, the novel is said by critics to be beautifully but carefully written, with an intense philosophy tempered by Erpenbeck’s sense of humor and humanity—each word serving a distinct purpose. Set in Berlin, the novel tells the story of Richard, a retired Classics professor. It follows his discovery of the African refugees in Berlin and his subsequent relationships with them, forged over the course of interviews he conducts.
Raised in East Germany in the shadow of the Holocaust, Erpenbeck was brought up on stories about survival, an experience that left her with a deep, unique sense of empathy. This empathy sparked the creation of the novel when an article in a German newspaper made it clear to Erpenbeck the public’s belief in the value of European lives over those of refugees. Her response: “I must write a novel.”
Throughout the conversation, Erpenbeck explored her experience trying to bring together the European and the refugee groups that exist so close geographically. In doing this, she, like Richard, interviewed and got to know several refugees—who she called “my refugees”—trying to understand who they were as people.
“Listening is not enough…learning only is done by experience,” Erpenbeck concluded. “If the thing you are learning is not connected to your emotion it will not stay with you.” At the event as in her work, Erpenbeck emphasized the necessity of understanding other human beings—on investigating one’s own society and using the empathy found to improve the world.
Toward the end of the event, following both Erpenbeck’s reading from “Go, Went, Gone” and her discussion with Messud, Messud opened up the floor to questions from the audience. Here especially, Erpenbeck addressed the parallels between the time of her childhood and the present refugee crisis in Europe, a major point of interest for many audience members. “I thought it was interesting that she was bringing the Eastern German perspective,” Anna M. Agathangelou, an attendee of the event, said. “It was brilliant that she was working with time and trying to understand this concept of transition.”
“Claire Messud was a professor of mine last semester,” Mitchell P. Johns ’19 said. “As somebody interested in fiction and development of characters, it was interesting to hear…how Jenny Erpenbeck can use fiction to humanize a largely statistical current issue. I think [this] is a great use of fiction.”

Is there anything scarier than being truly alone in the world? Forget blood and guts, the undead and the living dead. How terrified would you be if your life fell apart, and there wasn’t a single person for you to talk to or embrace? Writer and director Deborah Haywood’s feature-length debut, “Pin Cushion,” rethinks the horror genre with the trauma and suspense of loneliness, rather than gore or supernatural activity. Iona (Lily Newmark) and her mother Lyn (Joanna Scanlan) move to a new town with the naive excitement of a tropey horror movie couple moving into a house that’s clearly haunted. The highly stylized film displays a deceivingly cutesy exterior, stuffed with baby animals and pink everything, but adeptly invites an intimate glance into the most horrifying chambers of human consciousness.
Haywood makes no effort to soften the trauma of teenage girlhood, imbuing her film with an exhilarating realism most high school movies lack. Like last year’s “Lady Bird,” Deborah Haywood’s debut depicts a sometimes tender, sometimes caustic mother-daughter relationship. Unlike in “Lady Bird,” the injuries that these women inflict on each other can’t be healed with a hot pink cast or a phone call. “Pin Cushion” takes what we thought was a comfortingly permanent bond and irreparably tears it apart, like someone in a slasher film might tear a limb off a body.
Critics have also compared “Pin Cushion” to the 1988 classic, “Heathers,” because they’re both dark high school movies about likeably uncool girls who infiltrate the villainous realm of popularity. Blissfully detached from reality with too-clever dialogue and too-cute boys, “Heathers” isn’t too upsetting, while the ugliest parts of “Pin Cushion” are hauntingly familiar, prompting painful introspection. Where “Heathers” elicits a flustered scoff in response to the film’s bizarre premise, “Pin Cushion” elicits searing pain in response to the unbearable sadness of the human condition.
“Pin Cushion” could feel indulgent in its own trauma if it weren’t so faithfully grounded in reality. On the surface, the film twinkles with otherworldly horror and fantasy. Upon closer inspection, Haywood simply depicts the strange magic of real life—her life, specifically. Though “Pin Cushion” feels like it came from the depths of Haywood’s twisted imagination, it’s actually an intensely personal film.
Though world-building often suffuses films with fantasy, Haywood demonstrates meticulous attention to detail by building Lyn’s world to show, in a way that’s hauntingly true to life, how Lyn yearns for escapism from the gritty truth of the real world. Scanlan portrays Lyn dissociatiating from adult life as she decorates their home with mounds of pink stuffed animals and rows of porcelain figurines. The kitsch even pervades the dining room with breakfast fritters shaped like smiley faces, hard-boiled eggs with Sharpie eyelashes, and looped Krazy straws for maximum tea-drinking enjoyment. Lyn constructs this cushy fortress of best friendship to protect against the real world, which rejects and bullies her, and labels her “the village idiot.” Scanlan winces a little with every movement to animate the deep injuries of a woman who’s lived a long life of repeated slaps in the face.
Haywood embellishes the plot of “Pin Cushion” with Iona’s fantasies, stretching the capabilities of the film medium by portraying rich pockets of teenage consciousness often unexplored on the big screen. Newmark gingerly portrays Iona buzzing with delight as she imagines herself throwing parties decorated with painstakingly arranged fruits, flowers, and trinkets reminiscent of a glowing Audrey Flack painting, only to drown in silent horror when she discovers that teenager parties consist of vomit, regrets, and crusty boys. Brought to life with subtly gorgeous acting, visual ornaments communicate what the camera can’t on its own. CGI glitter emanates from Iona’s face after she gets her first makeover, and a blurry kaleidoscope lens multiplies her image while she experiences her first orgasm, via electric toothbrush.
Ghosts in “Pin Cushion” take the form of fluffy white cats, violently yanking on heartstrings with comforting purrs to soften the sorrow of a mean world. Haywood’s masterpiece gleams with a potent blend of cuteness and wretchedness true to teenage girlhood, establishing legitimate artistic value of what could have been an easily dismissed high school movie.

In her novel  “The Gunners,” released Mar. 20, Rebecca Kauffman explores the relationships between childhood friends whose group name inspire the title. After many years without making contact, 30-year-old Mikey Callahan reunites with his fellow Gunners—Alice, Lynn, Jimmy, and Sam—after the final Gunner, Sally, commits suicide. As they mourn for Sally, the remaining five Gunners learn about themselves, each other, and Sally. Kauffman successfully explores the emotional repercussions of relationships, despite its banal plot.
Kauffman’s prose provides a strong skeleton for the work as a whole. She effortlessly weaves the story together with a sparse writing style. Even within the chapters themselves, the prose is simple, yet elegant, conveying Kauffman’s ideas without excessive complication. The story flows and fits together in a satisfying fashion. Furthermore, Kauffman frequently uses sentence fragments in place of complete sentences, peppering them throughout the work: “Or perhaps the love had drained from him over the years, a slow leak.” In half a sentence, Kauffman packs in more imagery and information than many writers achieve in full sentences. She densely organizes her thoughts so that each clause plays its own significant role in keeping boredom at bay within a fairly familiar plotline.
The plot itself is not particularly unique. Though Kauffman finds nuances within the text, the actual story is not groundbreaking. Instead, it is rather cliché: The plot follows a group of friends bonding after a traumatic experience. Regardless of the number of twists that Kauffman throws in, the basic concept behind the novel is a standard one. The group members learn about themselves and each other as they mourn their lost friend. The lack of novelty within the story is apparent even within Kauffman’s elegant prose.
However, Kauffman’s details and the characters’ emotional journeys overcome the commonplace plot. The theme of the story is brought to life when Kauffman expands upone her ideas. How Kauffman explores the characters’ growth more than compensates for the well-trodden premise. She dives deeply into each character’s mind, exposing each one as flawed and human. In one flashback, she explores Lynn’s first experience with romantic feelings. Lynn does not face rejection gracefully. “Lynn threw her hands to her cheeks and began to cry immediately, mangled by shame.” She succeeds in creating real, imperfect human beings within the text, bringing unparalleled life to the story.
Kauffman unabashedly brings attraction, relationships, sex, love, and hatred to the fore­front. Her story is heart-warming, yet not sugar-coated by perfect heroes or villains. Kauffman successfully makes her novel real and compelling by including characters that don’t fit a specific mold, but rather emulate the human capacity for good and evil in equal measures. In “The Gunners,” Rebecca Kauffman takes a new spin on a basic storyline by using her talent in realism to create characters that easily resonate, providing an enjoyable read.

Despite its over-a-year-long hiatus due to creator Donald Glover’s scheduling conflicts, “Atlanta: Robbin’ Season” picks up right where the show left off: with unexplained, yet insightful and subversive takes on the real world. Earn (Donald Glover) continues to (mis)navigate the world Al (Brian Tyree Henry) puts him in, while Darius remains calm, unironic, and unbelievably perceptive in his understanding of society. The show, which set a high bar for itself after the critical and commercial success of its premiere (Glover was the first black man to win an Emmy for Best Director of a Comedy), does not disappoint in its sophomore season premiere, a crucial and often disappointing continuation to the first installment of any show. Despite juggling his music career as Childish Gambino, starring in the “Lion King” remake, and having a second child, Glover’s writing drives the beginning of the second season to success in its premiere, “Alligator Man.”
Unlike Glover, the character he plays is not thriving. “Robbin’ season. Christmas approaches, and everybody got to eat,” contemplates Darius. “Or be eaten,” Earn adds in a conversation that foreshadows the drama of the new season—or perhaps even reflects on that very episode itself. Earn may have (somewhat) proven himself as Paper Boi’s manager, but he is still barely keeping from being devoured whole: He is on probation, remains homeless, and has just been kicked out of the storage unit he had been staying in. He tries to use Al and Darius as resources to rectify his situation, though the two are fighting for some unknown reason. Unfortunately, Earn’s utter failure to solidify a strong enough hold in Al’s life leaves him excluded from the rapper’s true inner circle.
Unsurprisingly, Darius is there to save the day, and with Darius comes his shockingly shrewd observations. In the highlight of the episode, Darius fails to understand that all the “Florida Men” constantly featured in national headlines are not, in fact, one person: “Florida Man shoots unarmed black teenager... Florida Man bursts into ex's delivery room and fights new boyfriend as she's giving birth… Florida Man steals a car, goes to Checkers...Florida Man beats a flamingo to death… Florida Man found eating another man's face,” he lists. The joke brilliantly encapsulates the show’s absurdity, proving that although its title may have changed for the season, the show has retained its subversive edge. In one sweeping montage, Glover alludes to Trayvon Martin’s murder, an incident of drug-induced cannibalism, and flamingo assault—all of which happened in Florida. And yet, the joke does not feel reductive or disrespectful; it is instead putting together the puzzle pieces we have been storing in our subconscious to comment on the occurrences that range from strange to tragic and have, for some reason, happened most often in Florida.
“Atlanta” is back in all its glorious strangeness, and seems to have been worth the wait. Don’t believe me? Just wait until “Alligator Man,” the episode’s titular character (Katt Williams), proves you wrong.

As usual, Glover’s creative genius takes form in his absurdly authentic take on life in Black Atlanta. After musing about the apparently ridiculous notion that a colleague can succeed as a rapper, two teenagers rob a fast food place. What they don’t know is that the cashier himself is also armed—with an assault rifle. When the cashier tries to shoot the thieves down as they drive away in their car, a young woman jumps out and starts screaming, covered in blood. Do we empathize with the woman? Do we respect or denounce the cashier, who was trying to protect himself and his workplace with a weapon so controversially accessible? Do we ponder the teenagers’ lives and the circumstances that might have led them to perform an armed robbery? The show presents this evidence but does not tell us what to think. Instead, it forces us to draw our own conclusions.
One such question arises in Episode Two, “Sportin’ Waves:” How does one cope with the reality that fame brings to both friends who take advantage of that fame and to social climbers who pretend to be friends? For instance, Paper Boi’s longtime friend and drug dealer robs him at gunpoint: ”I appreciate you, man,” he says as he drives away with Paper Boi’s money, leaving the betrayed victim to walk home alone at night. Forced to find a new source of marijuana, Paper Boi encounters two dealers whose interest in starting a relationship rests solely on the rapper’s growing popularity. His decision to throw away his phone and, by extension rid himself of the leeches who want to ride on the coattails of his fame, is not in and of itself a novel concept, but its originality arises in the details: in Paper Boi’s buzzing phone as it lies abandoned on the ground, receiving messages that will never be read, and in Darius’ flinch and groan as it falls to the ground; in Paper Boi and Darius’ glare at the first dealer they encounter; in the exceptionally strong weed Paper Boi smokes in his second dealer’s home. Together, they inform the innovation of Glover’s show.
Nevertheless, even “Atlanta” is not immune to the pitfalls of a second season: It rehashes old material by reframing it in slightly different contexts. When Earn and Al meet with a startup that spreads awareness of upcoming artists, the ideas behind the scene—from the awkwardness and fascination of (usually white) people working with a black man like Al to the competition to be the cool new black rapper—were originally introduced in the episodes “B.A.N.” and “Nobody Beats the Biebs” in Season One. But in this rehashed version, these moments lose their subtlety in the blatantly emphasized cuts to the Al and Earn’s reactions. Earn, too, falls victim to the same trickery he should have learned from last season in “The Streisand Effect.” Having written a majority of the episodes in Season One, Stephen Glover may have the experience but seems to have lost the inventiveness.
“Atlanta” seems to be riding on the success of previous bits to sustain its second season. The show cannot rely on what was once fresh and new in the last season, but has now become expected of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know you’re famous when a white woman starts crying over the lyrics of your rap song, apparently. In another one of the show’s references to the real world, “Money Bag Shawty” opens with a recorded video of a mother complaining about the profane and sexist lyrics of Paper Boi’s latest hit. “‘Baby, slide on the dick / You can do it all night / You can be my baby mama / You can't ever be my wife,’” the woman painstakingly recites, before bursting into tears. Al, Darius, and Earn take it all in stride. “Yo, that white woman crying, that was the best thing that could've happened to us, man. Their tears are powerful,” Darius chuckles. After all, any press is good press, right?
This episode sees Paper Boi’s star rising even higher, with all its baggage to boot. Al’s fellow rising rapper’s recording session pulls back the curtains on the way music is produced in the rap industry. The rapper—who does not drink or do drugs, but proceeds to rap about Hennessy and marijuana—seems already to have lost his ability to respect his employees. When the music engineer’s computer crashes, the rapper’s veiled threats reveal the intimidation faced by those behind the music. The scene, perhaps alluding to Donald Glover’s experiences as Childish Gambino, criticizes both artists’ abuse of power in an industry whose artists decry their own abuse and the hypocrisy of artists whose lyrics barely reflect their actual lives. It forces us to think about the music we listen to and what to make of the artists whose personae we buy into—personae that belie who might actually be not-so-great people. Again, Paper Boi’s facial expressions say it all. Is this what things are really like behind the scenes?
“Money Bag Shawty” also sees Earn grapple with racism from both white and black business owners. And unlike in other episodes, where the show leaves its audience to ponder the implications of its content, there is a clear message here. When Earn goes to the movie theater with Van (Zazie Beetz) and tries to pay with a 100 dollar bill, the white employee asks for a debit card instead—in addition to ID, both of which she needs to check to comply with the theater’s “new policy.” When the next customer—white, male, and armed with a gun—tries to pay with a 100 dollar bill, there is no mention of the policy. The trend follows Earn to a club where the black owner accuses Earn of having used a fake bill to pay the entrance fee. Fed up, the couple leaves to go to a strip club (fun date night, huh?), where Al teaches Earn a lesson about money. “You told me the only thing I needed to run this city was money,” Earn whines. Al corrects him: “Money is an idea, man. Look, there's a reason that a white dude dressed just like you can walk into a bank and get a loan, and you can't even spend a $100 bill, man. I mean, you need to start acting like you're better than other niggas, and then they'll start treating you better than other niggas.” It’s an obvious lesson, one that Earn should have already learned and that undermines his character development. It’s been a season and some change, and though Earn has a few hundred dollar bills in his wallet, he’s barely learned anything.
It seems “Atlanta” is turning away from the subtle toward the explicit. For a show that previously relied heavily on one’s ability to read between the lines, it’s a surprising turn that makes the show easier to follow, but that also detracts from the spirit it established in its first season.
1000-Penny Thoughts:
- So. Are we not supposed to give credence to the white woman’s complaints?
- It  looks like Earn will perpetually be disrespected. I only wish he’d actually learn from it instead of being mistreated over and over again.
- It’s good to see Van again. As the only returning female actress on the show, her presence—and her consistently flawless natural hair—was sorely missed. But… where is her and Earn’s child??
     - If you, too, were wondering whether the phrase “caught red-handed” was actually racist, rest easy because it turns out it’s not. The more you know.
- Did it take anyone else a while to figure out who Michael Vick is? No? Just me?

“Fresh” is not likely to be the first word that comes to mind when describing 16th-century England, with its economic and gendered divisions and its looming Tower of London prison. Yet the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ current staging of “The Yeomen of the Guard; or The Merryman and His Maid,” indeed set in Tudor England, feels—in a word—fresh. Honeyed, airy vocal performances challenge the Tower’s assumed doom and gloom, and modern, cross-gendered casting takes place without diegetic fanfare. Elaborate costumes, thoughtful lighting, and a beautiful set knit the show together elegantly. Running from March 23 to April 1 in the Agassiz Theater, the production delights, despite some lagging Act II moments that typify librettist W.S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan’s long denouements.
In knotty, plot-heavy G&S fashion, “Yeomen” tracks multiple storylines. Against the Tower of London backdrop, the young Phoebe Meryll (Arianna N. Paz ’19) sets her sight on Colonel Fairfax (typically a male role, but played here by Janiah Lockett ’20), a reportedly plucky soldier who has been wrongfully convicted for sorcery and is set to die within one hour of the show’s opening curtain. Phoebe and her father, Sergeant Meryll (Mike Shirek ’20), hatch a plan to disguise Fairfax as Phoebe’s brother, Leonard (also typically a male role, but played here by Sunny Levine ’20), and sneak Fairfax away before the executioner arrives. Fairfax, with the help of the easily swayed Tower Lieutenant (Benjamin D. Grimm ’18), plots to marry any willing woman, so that his soon-to-be-distributed estate will not fall into the hands of his nefarious cousin, who imprisoned Fairfax in the first place. Meanwhile, traveling entertainers Elsie Maynard (Julianne Freeman) and Jacklyn Point (typically the male role “Jack Point,” but played here by Rebecca Thau ’19) arrive at the Tower, and Elsie becomes Fairfax’s untimely bride. Escape, a faked murder, a marriage, and irreparable heartbreak ensue. “It never seems to go right for them, and for one character especially,” stage director Nermin Hasanovic ’20 summarizes in his program note.
The cast’s stellar singing carries the production. Having dazzled in shows including HRG&SP’s “Pirates of Penzance” last semester and “Into the Woods” at the OBERON last year, Paz once again flaunts her vocal chops, this time bringing a softness and flirtatiousness to Phoebe’s mezzo voice part. Pining for Fairfax, she paces across the stage, grazing her hand against the Tower’s flagstones and briefly drawing it to her forehead in calculated maidenly anguish. “An idle breath — / Yet life and death / May hang upon a maid's ‘Heigh-ho!’” she sings, eyes downcast and slightly come-hither, as she twiddles the coarse wool and spinning needle in her hands. Lockett, as the fated Fairfax, tackles the role with such clear diction and an incredibly lush take on the songs that the character’s traditional male gender becomes irrelevant to the performance. In particular, her voice shines in Fairfax’s entrance number, “Is Life a Boon?”; she delivers each lyric deeply, crisply, and compellingly. Freeman’s soprano rounds out the strong, articulated vocal performances.
Musical moments that feature several characters likewise invigorate the show. An a capella number in Act II (“Strange Adventure”)—which is soft and contemplative but manages to buoy the waning act—exemplifies this production’s blend of thematic gravitas, vocal harmony, and intricate staging. Singing about Elsie’s untimely marriage to Fairfax, Tower of London overseer Dame Carruthers (Rachel Share-Sapolsky ’21), her niece Kate (Bo Choi ’17), Sergeant Meryll, and Fairfax himself proceed in a square formation. They trace a path that evokes the moving hands of a clock, also echoed by the song’s ticking, repeated words. The singers’ chilling, virtually unaccompanied harmonizing elevates the song’s commentary on Elsie’s harsh reality, from unexpected wife to unexpected widow, all as a teenager no less: “Modest maiden will not tarry; / Though but sixteen year she carry, / She must marry, she must marry, / Though the altar be a tomb — / Tower — Tower — Tower tomb!” The blocking of this number not only emphasizes the operetta’s weightier themes, but also is fresh and smart.
When Elsie and Jacklyn perform for the villagers (“I have a song to sing, O!”), they too breathe new life into the music. The “O”s that frame their duet flow fluidly between Elsie and Jacklyn, establishing their own patter of communication. Each “O” is joyous and lovingly delivered between the performance partners, a lyrical choice that makes the reprise of this number, which cements the break in their relationship, all the more poignant.
All of this nuanced singing and staging takes place with the actors cloaked in striking costumes and performing on an impressive flagstone set, featuring two Tower buildings and a cracked pink mosaic heart. During “I have a song to sing, O!,” Elsie wears a flower crown and an off-white dress with dark pink overlays and immaculate lace detailing. Jacklyn’s understated (and not overtly jester-ly) costumes—two dresses with light-colored patchworking and billowy sleeves—match well with the style and color scheme of Elsie’s costume, visually unifying the pair’s performance. Notably, the eponymous Yeomen ensemble members wear striking scarlet tunics, trimmed with gold and embroidered with the Tudor crown and H.R. monogram (“Henry Rex,” or King Henry). Kudos to the production’s creative team for their attention to detail, which keeps the eye engaged and entertained throughout a lengthy show. Yeoman’s service, indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a career filmography including “Black Swan,” HBO’s “True Blood,” and “Grimm,” Kristina Anapau is an actress, dancer, and producer. Born in Hawaii, Anapau came into acting almost accidentally after being told to audition as an extra for Strathford Hamilton’s 1997 film, “Escape from Atlantis.” After securing a main role in the production, filmed on location in Hawaii, Kristina Anapau found roles throughout television and film, all while dreaming of becoming a ballerina. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Kristina to understand her career and her thoughts on acting today.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you talk a little bit about how you combine acting and dancing, especially in the context of your work on “Black Swan?”
Kristina Anapau: I think there was a big part of me that was remorseful for not continuing with ballet when I was younger. About a year after I did my first movie, I was still dancing a lot, and I was torn between living in LA or New York and pursuing dance more seriously. I chose acting as I thought it was the career that had more longevity, and I was having so much luck with it.
But there was definitely part of me that wondered what would’ve happened if I’d pursued ballet. So, when I got the audition for Black Swan… it took about a month before I found out if I got the role, so within that month I decided I would go to ballet class every single day… That was an interesting process, because I really got back into ballet stronger than… when I was training to be a ballerina. There was a moment right before I found out I got the role, when there was a visiting guest instructor from the London Royal Ballet. She was going around the class, criticizing everyone. People were in tears. She was really hard on everybody. You didn’t want her to stop in front of you. So, she was going around and all of a sudden, she stops in front of me, and I’m thinking, “Oh no, I’m too fragile right now, I can’t take this.” And she’s stopped in front of me and says, “My dear, I’ve been searching for something wrong with you, but your technique is impeccable, and I simply can’t find anything wrong.”
I couldn’t believe it, and after that class I went out to my car, and started crying, saying, “I should’ve been a ballerina, what’ve I done with my life?” And I looked up to the sky all teary-eyed and thought, if I book “Black Swan,” maybe I can still be a ballerina and live out that dream. Literally 20 minutes later, my agent called me and told me I got the role.
THC: Where would you say your passion lies right now?
KA: I think my passion has definitely shifted more towards writing and producing and developing projects. I love acting, and as an actress I’m probably better than I’ve ever been right now, but I’m also more focused on other things than I’ve ever been as well. Writing and producing is really where my daily thoughts are and where most of my attention goes.
THC: A lot of the roles and projects you’ve taken on have dark and often paranormal subject matter, including “The Glades,” “True Blood,” “Black Swan,” and “Grimm.” Is there something that draws you towards that genre or is it just how the cookie has crumbled?
KA: I think when you’re out there auditioning and pursuing acting roles, as long as it’s a reputable show and a cool character, it’s never a bad idea. In a lot of ways, it has been how the cookie has crumbled. But that being said, I feel like [I] project out that sort of energy to a certain degree. There must be something that’s sort of paranormal or metaphysical about me.
THC: What is next for you?
KA: I co-created and have been producing this kids’ show all of last year. We’ve shot about 36 episodes. Those are all in the can, and we’re doing deals now with some big platforms. The show has been airing this whole time, but now it’ll be available on some of the streaming platforms we all know and love.
And I’ve got a feature film project as well. The idea was created by myself and my co-star when we were on location in Maui. We’ve been working on this film for the last year on and off, and we have a draft that’s ready to shop and develop.
THC: As we wrap up, is there anything you’d like to share with our readers?
KA: “Kuleana,” the movie I’m promoting right now, comes out March 30. It’ll be in theaters all over. We filmed it in Hawaii. It’s a beautiful movie that takes places in the ’70s with some flashbacks to the ’50s, so super cool time periods in Hawaii with a very meaningful, beautiful story. It’s a mystery-drama, and I encourage everyone to check it out. It’s super artsy and beautifully shot, and really moving.

UPDATED: March 30, 2018 at 4:00 p.m.
Set in the fairytale land of Khamit, BlackC.A.S.T.’s “Vanity Lane” opened with ElectrKPrincess sitting in front of a mirror, inspecting herself critically. A pale blue-purple light cast her shadow across Farkas Hall as audience members witnessed a vulnerable expression of personal insecurity through dance. La’Toya Princess Jackson’s “Vanity Lane,” which showed from March 22 to March 25, tells the tale of ElectrKPrincess (Jackson) and her search for self-acceptance. The ballet featured 15 dancers representing this journey through various styles of dance.
The ballet began with a royal masquerade ball set to funky disco music. While some characters, such as the royal family, had matching costumes, for the most part, each character’s ball attire was jarringly different from the other’s. ElectrKPrincess wore a flashy, twinkling dress reminiscent of a disco ball, representative of the show’s overall tendency towards dazzling costumes. The prince’s evil twin donned a blinding, light-up hoodie, which further emphasized the intricate costuming, as did the attire much later when the majority of the cast changed into large flashing tutus.
To a certain extent, these excessive and flashy details were too distracting. The lights in the costumes, the brightly colored stage lighting, the light-up gloves that cast members sported, the large projected images, and a twinkling disco ball all overwhelmed the ballet and detracted from the show’s message. The stage lighting itself was too often exaggerated and blinding. As scenes shifted, there was often a feeling of discontinuity, such that a viewer without access to a playbill would have a hard time following without context.
In terms of characterization, different actors were given their own signature dance styles. The quality of dancing varied from scene to scene. The dances seemed to be most cohesive in the first act’s large groups scenes. In some of the smaller, partner routines, however, they were noticeably less synchronized. In routines where dancers were on pointe, it was quite apparent that some dancers were not capable of going over the block. At times, the music did more to advance the plot than the actual dancing. The orchestra tackled its pieces adeptly, and the percussionists particularly shined, keeping a steady beat which drove the rest of the orchestra forward.
Robin Thompson, playing a member of the Sacred Circle, gave a truly notable performance in Act II. Thompson’s passion for movement was palpable as she capably graced the stage. Additionally, Jackson’s solo piece was incredibly empowering, during which her character basks in her feminine energy. This routine worked to bolster the overarching message of the show: discovering one’s inner beauty. This concept is important and conveyed effectively, but at times the show’s approach felt topical. Women feeling pressured to conform to societal beauty standards is an issue fraught with many complexities, and “Vanity Lane” only addressed the most accessible of these. The appearance of the Harvard Deepam, one of Harvard’s classical Indian dance groups, was not unappreciated as the group performed a solid routine—but it was highly confusing and seemingly irrelevant to the plot of the entire show.
During the performance's open dress rehearsal, sound issues like microphone feedback troubled the show, but the dancers and orchestra maintained composure during times of technical difficulties. Accidentally blinking lights and wardrobe malfunctions also occurred. Technical issues put the show off to an unsteady start, but the orchestra’s persistence and skill served as a reliable force throughout the ballet and added an element of balance to the show.
Having said this, “Vanity Lane” remains an indisputably unique ballet in concept and choreography. An overtly feminist performance was somewhat undercut because ElectrKPrincess’ quest towards accepting beauty was initially inspired by her drive to attract the prince’s male gaze, but the quest nonetheless raised pertinent issues in a nontraditional way.
EDITOR'S NOTE: March 30, 2018
This article has been revised to reflect the fact the reviewer attended an open dress rehearsal for the performance.

A middle-aged man with a beer belly and grocery bags walks into a two-story apartment in Chinatown, New York. He stands perfectly still in the corridor outside, lost in thought and oblivious to the shuffling feet within the apartment’s thin walls. The door swings open, and for the next hour and thirty-five minutes, silence is a rarity as the Blake family’s Thanksgiving unravels. Playwright Stephen Karam’s “The Humans,” directed by Joe Mantello, showed at the Boch Center’s Shubert Theatre from Mar. 13 to 25. With its insightful exploration of mankind and its foibles, this play enters the arena of American classics, unfolding at the confluence of tradition and modernity—all over a warm turkey.
“The Humans” focuses on Erik (Richard Thomas) and Deirdre Blake (Pamela Reed), Irish-Americans who have driven down from Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Erik’s mother Fiona (Lauren Klein), who suffers from dementia, to join their daughters Aimee (Therese Plaehn), a lawyer in Philly, and Brigid (Daisy Eagan), an unemployed musician, for Thanksgiving dinner at Brigid’s new home where she lives with her boyfriend, Richard (Luis Vega).
As Richard prepares dinner downstair, Fiona lectures her daughter Brigid. Brigid’s tolerance for Deidre’s religious zeal—the kind that is endearing to strangers, but tiresome over the course of Brigid’s lifetime—wavers. Deirdre argues that a boyfriend does not entail the same commitment that a husband does, and to keep this warning fresh presents her daughter with a statue of the Virgin Mary to remind her of the sanctity of marriage. Karam’s writing produces well-developed characters, demarcating the generational differences between parents and children with elegance. From conversations on religion to depression, the Blakes’ chit-chat represents the hasty catching-up that families so eagerly engage in during gatherings.
The set is also exceptionally creative. As family members mill about the house, they often find themselves on different floors, simultaneously holding different conversations and revealing a thicker plot to the audience. While Richard describes his strange dreams to Erik downstairs, the audience learns that Aimee, talking with her sister upstairs, is struggling with a break up and a devastating case of ulcerative colitis. The set design perfectly creates a dingy New York apartment, barely furnished and complete with damp, off-white walls and roaches. The light works hand-in-hand with the setting. As the play progresses and the family’s conversations take darker turns, bulbs in the home begin to fuse, engulfing the set in an encroaching darkness.
At times, tension seems to stem from an innate incompatibility between the personalities of the family members. Erik is a no-nonsense man, for whom every problem has its answers in perseverance and hard work—and perhaps a beer. Deirdre is warm and affectionate, yet lovingly sarcastic and devout, all the while maintaining a self-awareness that perceives her daughters’ condescension. Brigid, often irate but immediately apologetic, is trying her best to be an adult. Instead she suffers, often to her own expectations, failing to attain what she thinks she deserves. Aimee, on the other hand, is hilarious, wielding her humor as a shield to push away her deep-rooted insecurities about love, and the fear she feels regarding her deteriorating health. Richard, an outsider to the history of this family, is steeped in affectionate confusion at Brigid’s tense relationship with her mother, and struggles to toe the line between loyalty to his girlfriend and his de facto mother-in-law.
Like most families, they are divided by several rifts and past disagreements left unresolved, but the strength of obligated love and compassion keeps them together. The Blakes remain close despite their incompatibility. For this reason, the tension within the play stems largely from wealth or the lack thereof. “Don’t you think it should cost less to be alive?” Richard says, displaying a sparkling combination of tragedy and wit. A veil of secrecy lingers throughout the majority of the play, behind which hides uncomfortable conversations about an eroding family, a lack of resources to live life better, and an unwillingness to compromise on ideologies. “The Humans” most notably, does not fall victim to the lure of excess: Pain and suffering are dealt with restraint, and a full emotional range is expressed, from uproarious comedy to throbbing rage. Together, this cast brings the chaotic, often dark reality of families to the stage, and delivers it with poignant precision.

Bedlam Theater Company’s “Saint Joan,” which ran at the Cutler Majestic Theatre at ArtsEmerson until March 24, is clear as a bell—even if its audience cannot hear the divine “voices” that Joan hears in the sounding of the churchbells, prompting her to drive out the English from France in the name of God and country. The genius of this production is at once its flaw: its inventive, vivid, and straight-forward emphasis on the text, when staged today, rings with a note of menace that this production does not confront.
The production, performed in conjunction with Bedlam’s “Hamlet,” by the same repertory cast, was one of Bedlam’s first, and both shows received immediate critical acclaim following their inaugural runs at the Access Theater in New York in 2012. They owe their singularity to their small cast size: All roles in the two plays (24 in “Saint Joan”) are played by four actors. This constraint becomes one of the biggest assets of both shows, which utilize the near constant character-switching to the max. Under the remarkable instruction of director Eric Tucker, who also served as a player in the original instantiation of the show, the problem of too-few actors provides a steady influx of humor, makes full use of the versatility of the performers, and, in the case of “Saint Joan,” highlights the similarities between adversarial parties and the shared logics underlying the opposing arguments in this dialogue-heavy play.
The minimalist design displays a similar resourcefulness: A table in one scene is propped on its side to become the ledge of a window in another, transitions are created by an actor walking across the stage with a handheld speaker, and a journey from France to England is signalled by the introduction of a brown tweed suit and two teacups.
Audience configuration changes for each act. Whereas at first audience members are seated in the orchestra and on risers facing each other on the left and right sides of the stage, in the intermission before the second act an enormous white cloth is pulled back to reveal a third set of risers at the back of the stage, and those seated in the orchestra are prompted to move on stage.  This reconfiguration mid-play turns the audience into presiding members of the Church, whom Sam Massaro refers to in his best characterization as the French theologian Peter Cauchon. Audience members seated on stage are able to notice three stained glass windows fortuitously located high up at the back of the theater, which transform the whole building into a cathedral. During the trial in the third act, the stage curtain is closed and the performers address each other, the audience, and Joan—who sits alone on stage on a “scaffold” comprised of a chair on top of a white table in front of the red stage curtain—from the aisles leading to and in front of the stage, and even from the balcony, incorporating the entire theater and audience into the setting of the trial.
The performances are, on the whole, very strong: Aundria Brown as Joan is best when she is at her most vehement—her girlish excitement in the first act and in the epilogue seem incongruous with her portrayal of Joan as a warrior. Sam Massaro and Kahlil Garcia cycle through their many roles with humor and grace. Aubie Merrylees shines in each of his parts, from the bumbling French squire Robert de Baudricourt to the coolly self-interested Earl of Warwick, to the Inquisitor, one of the strongest performances of the show. Thanks to Merrylees’ extraordinary delivery, the reasoning which would justify the burning alive of a young woman in the name of “mercy” comes through with terrifying clarity.
Indeed, the primary strength of the production is its simplicity and clarity of delivery, which makes each perspective in the conflict entirely understandable. As Shaw wrote in his preface to the play, “[T]here are no villains in the piece . . . It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.” Indeed, in the speeches of the representatives of each institution in question—the British and the French aristocracy, the Church, the monarchy, the petty nobility—we find an entirely believable logic of self-interest.
Yet Joan’s argument, which favors blind faith in God, country, and a popular demagogue, make this production strongly unsettling in 2018. Notably absent are the voices of the people who follow Joan, and who, we are told, will turn against her as soon as she is out of favor. The play positions her as a populist leader who challenges the powers that be—but we are asked, finally, to side with Joan not out of any interest in the unseen people of France, but because she says she hears voices in the ringing of church bells. This faith in an individual who claims access to a “truth” that they alone perceive is unavoidably familiar to any current audience member. Finally Bedlam, in its own good faith, puts forward a staging loyal to a great work of theater, but in doing so ignores the unavoidable changes in its resonance between its first staging in 2012 and today.

Armed with a brand-new bag of chips in every episode, Zoë Robertson and Sophia LePage travel the world together from the comfort of their closet where they record their zany talk show. In January 2017, they started sharing their adventures with the world via a podcast, “Just Chips Dot Com,” for your education and listening pleasure.
As it turns out, chips come in infinite varieties. They may be pizza-flavored, Eggs Benedict-flavored, or even Chesapeake Shrimp-flavored. And chips turn out to be a surprisingly amazing jumping point for conversation—Robertson and LePage talk about pop culture topics like memes, dogecoin, ASMR, and Keanu Reeves. One time they asked each other whether they would ever date a pirate. They also invite celebrities on their show over the phone or through FaceTime. Past guests have included an erotica writer, a marine biologist, a ghost expert, famous Canadian musicians, and the creator of the quirky Canadian dramedy “Dim the Fluorescents.” With their giggling, calls at strange hours, and occasional white lies about what the podcast is actually about (one guest believed that Robertson and LePage were extreme sports enthusiasts), listening almost feels like participating in a prank call. It’s obvious that the two have been best friends forever, and their chemistry is what makes the show. They’re bubbly and fun and they chime off of each other effortlessly.
A lot of the fun comes from just listening to the wonderfully satisfying sound of the crunching. Similarly to “mukbang” (the Korean phenomenon of watching people eat incredible amounts of junk food on YouTube), there’s a wonderful voyeuristic sort of pleasure that comes with listening to people eat. Each show opens with the popping opening sound of a soda can, a theme song of sound bites of a person munching on a snack, a voice that says “chips, chips, chip-chip-chip chips,” and a voice dropped ten octaves on GarageBand announcing “Just Chips Dot Com—the podcast, not the website.”
The meandering quality of the show is both its main charm and annoyance. Chips can take you anywhere, and “Just Chips Dot Com” is really a variety show disguised as a review of chips. The show wanders out into fields as diverse as the discussion of various species of rodents, the philosophy behind the origin of the word “breakfast,” and the history of Ruffles potato chips. But sometimes the tangents feel too random and drawn-out, and it is often tempting to just skip to the actual chip-eating. It also feels as if Robertson and LePage are enjoying their own conversation among themselves rather than trying to draw in the listener.
Robertson and LePage’s friends and family regularly chime in as guests giving "Just Chips" a charming homegrown feel, as if two friends decided to spend a rainy day making a podcast in their closet. When I was listening to this on speaker, my sister said she thought that I was on the phone with two really loud friends. I think that about sums up the experience of listening to “Just Chips Dot Com.” It’s very fun and quirky and utterly random. It’s a good show to turn on in the background during a long laundry session.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, former Associate Justice John Paul Stevens published an op-ed in The New York Times calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. This is a notable first. Currently, there are no elected officials who have taken this position, and historically, it has proven taboo for Democrats, with candidates and elected officials around the country using any number of euphemisms to steer clear of directly calling for “gun control.”
This tide seems to be turning.
At last week’s protests, signs decrying the NRA’s support of looser gun regulations and calling for gun control embody how new voices are challenging the traditional gun-rights activist fervor in the debate over the Second Amendment. These protests have swept in a wave of vocal support for a shift to the left in the Democratic Party on this issue, and increasingly, activists’ calls insisting that their elected officials take a harder line on guns are becoming louder and more visible.
But this harder line could come at a big cost to Democrats.
According to a recent poll, just 16 percent of Independents and 8 percent of Republicans agree with Justice Stevens about repealing the Second Amendment, and despite the recent public support for greater gun control, it comes only at the end of a 20-year popular trend in favor of gun rights. In fact, it hasn’t even been ten years since the landmark Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller protected individual gun rights.
If we are indeed at a turning point as these protests now suggest, we are still at a very early stage of the turn and a miscalculation now could table the debate for years to come.
Democrats are currently on track to make huge gains in the 2018 midterm elections. Of the special elections that have taken place so far, the trend of preference moving into the double digits in favor of Democrats candidates across the country has fueled Democratic enthusiasm and hope for the upcoming election year. It is this enthusiasm that has encouraged a new era of freshmen candidates to contest staunchly conservative national, state, and local districts. Already in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and even Alabama, Democrats have won.
But a shift to the left on gun rights amongst Democrats will alienate moderate voters, a vast majority of whom still favor the Second Amendment, in these states and others.
While national polls suggest a country whose attitudes are becoming slightly more favorable toward gun control, these changes are more prominent in the already heavily-Democratic regions of the West and the Northeast than in the Midwest and South, where support for gun control reforms remains below the national average and where Democrats are hoping to challenge Republican incumbents. If Democrats aim to win back control of the House, these more moderate districts are must-wins.
Democrats must now tread carefully or risk pushing too hard and losing the wind at their backs. It is easy to forget that despite this weekend’s protests, the United States is still a country with a very vocal minority who “cling to [their] guns,” as President Obama said in 2008. It is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the third of Americans who own guns continue to lead the conversation on gun rights, but it is a fact of American politics that cannot be ignored.
The national narrative might be turning, but that ship is turning a lot faster in more liberal urban areas than in more conservative rural and suburban ones. And it is the latter that Democrats have the greatest opportunity to flip.
Gun violence, and specifically mass shootings, have become far too egregious yet commonplace to ignore, but it has become evident that Republicans are unwilling to make substantial attempts at gun reforms. Come November, losing track of the nation’s pulse and following suit with Justice Steven’s op-ed could cost the Democrats control of the House and lead Republicans to claim a false mandate on the issue of gun rights. For this reason, Democrats should be wary of rallying behind repealing the Second Amendment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 27, a University-wide task force on Inclusion and Belonging announced its recommendations, calling on all of Harvard’s schools to step up efforts to better include those marginalized along racial, ethnic, religious, sexual, and ideological lines. Among the recommendations released were a series of concrete administrative changes, such as designated inclusive spaces in the Smith Campus Center that seek to facilitate a more vibrant dialogue within the Harvard community by bringing all perspectives—old and new—into conversation with each other.
This change, as well as the others mentioned in the report, should be applauded. The administration is using its power to advance an admirable goal, and one that is essential to Harvard’s mission: the facilitation of a diverse and nuanced dialogue. The willingness to take steps on an administrative level to better the community is a significant first step towards solving those structural problems, given the prominent role that administrative rules play in shaping our interactions and our culture.
However, that role is not absolute.
Those who are siloed into their own spaces, whether they be religious, ideological, racial, or along any other lines, cannot simply be induced to interact and engage in substantive dialogue with the inorganic creation of formal administrative spaces. If the community is to be transformed into one that reflects our highest ideals of diversity, inclusion, and open inquiry, it must be treated as an organic entity, where the culture is set not just in formal meetings but in classrooms, dining halls, and dorms. That cannot be done by the administration, but it can be done by the students.
To be sure, the administration has a role to play. There cannot be ideologically diverse classes without ideologically diverse faculty. There cannot be dialogue between students of different ethnicities, races, genders, and sexual orientations unless the administration admits students who are diverse across each of those categories.
But just simply hiring faculty of color cannot guarantee that white students will take their classes, and hiring conservative faculty cannot guarantee that liberal students will take their classes. Similarly, the creation of a formal multicultural space cannot guarantee that all parties, those who are currently included and those who are marginalized, will come to the table. The administration can set up the necessary space and context for change, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the students to bring that change about.
Thus, we believe that the administration, in addition to using its rule-making power, should also use its public authority to encourage the rest of the community to collaborate in improving our culture as well. Those of us not empowered with the ability to make administrative decisions should work to buttress the committee's recommendations as well as make their ideas a reality, and the administration should say so.
Without an up-front, frank acknowledgement of the limits of administrative power to shape culture and a call for students to join in the effort, the administration risks engendering complacency within the student body. The fact that such a comprehensive, carefully thought out report has been issued might lead some to focus less on the problem now, content in the knowledge that the administration has taken action.
If the vision laid out in these administrative changes is to be realized, students must instead react with more energy and determination, not less. The administration must call on students to see this not as a time to rest on our laurels but instead to seize the opportunity to implement the roadmap laid out by the task force and drive Harvard into an inclusive and diverse future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students love the islands. The islands, of course, are those little specks in the wide, warm, blue ocean—the amorphous, multiethnic set of nations we call the Caribbean. Harvard students love galavanting around the islands, lying in warm sand, and dipping their toes in turquoise blue water.
One Harvard student wrote that, “Spring Break '97 was—as Spring Break '98, '99 and the rest of Spring Breaks from here to eternity will be—a home for the id to run wild; the Bahamas and Cancun are places where you can't get caught and thus ’anything goes.’" In 2006, a Fifteen Minutes Magazine writer claimed that, “every d-bag and their mother comes back to school with a sick tan from the Caribbean.”
During spring break in 2011, 118 students—a mix of “final club bros, sorority sisters, and various other members of the party-hopping species”—went to a beach resort in the Dominican Republic. Their “mass exodus from Cambridge to the Caribbean” was sparked by familiar allures—warmth, the possibility of a tan (or a sunburn), and relatively affordable prices. The “hottest Harvard party” that week was happening in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.
The thought of the most reprehensible aspects of Harvard social life being exported abroad is deeply unsettling. Even so, I became yet another Harvard student this temporarily fleeing to the islands for some sort of escape.
I felt a deep hesitation traveling to San Juan, Puerto Rico for spring break, and the remnants of this feeling still linger. The menace of college-aged spring breakers sat in the back of my head—beaches littered with beer cans, drunken law-breaking, disrespect for local communities. Though intending to avoid these transgressions, I was still stuck with fear that I’d contribute to the disruptive hoard that comes to the island every year.
All of this was compounded by the disgraceful way the United States government has abandoned Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. More than six months later, there are still Puerto Ricans living without power. Walking through San Juan, mere blocks away from the governor’s mansion, I saw a building with signs on its balcony that read, in Spanish, “Building Without Power.” From a ledge that overlooks La Perla, a Puerto Rican flag waved above the splintered wood of a caved-in roof. All the while, it was impossible to forget that Puerto Rico has no voting representatives in Congress or the Electoral College.
In the face of a humanitarian crisis, loud, disruptive, obnoxiously American college students can feel like a slap in the face. Though I avoided being blatantly offensive, there is still injustice in the fact that I was able to tan and drink while people just a few miles away had no water and no electricity. This injustice, though, reminded me of the need for mindfulness when traveling through Puerto Rico.
The threat careless American travelers pose abroad, and the ease with which they do so, is not specific to Puerto Rico. Americans are able to vacation abroad precisely because of the way the United States had flexed its political power abroad. Some of the hottest spring break spots, including the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, have been previously occupied by the United States military. Residents of the United States enjoy goods produced by exploited laborer in countries they’d love to visit—bananas from Guatemala, sugar from Cuba, coffee from El Salvador, pineapples from Costa Rica.
Vacations, though seemingly harmless, carry the weight of these histories. Traveling to certain countries is “cheap” precisely because the United States has made it so. Local economies are chained to the American dollars that support the tourism infrastructure on which their residents rely. When we justify our presence abroad simply because we’re spending money there, we have to remember that economic aid of this sort is only possible because of the colonial histories that have structured life as such.
Of course, countries are not defined simply by the way the United States intervention has shaped their histories. They’re as much defined by the people who live there and the way they’ve resisted infringements on their autonomy. While travelers are navigating the complicated dynamics inherent to international travel, we should expect them to be thoughtful and non-disruptive.
Advocate for the communities you visit, whether it be by pushing for better relief efforts or statehood. Respect that the bars you frequent exist alongside neighborhoods where people have set up their lives.
Don’t exotify people who live in lands that are foreign only to you. Make an effort to learn, through more than a Wikipedia search, about the history and culture of the place you are living. Blend in when possible. Make yourself small. Allow people to build and rebuild without becoming an obstruction.
Harvard students will continue going to the islands for spring break, so it’s critical that we become more conscientious travelers. As we travel abroad, we have to be aware that our nation is responsible for many of factors that make other nations—including the islands—accessible and easy to travel to. Simply, we must acknowledge the colonial structures that make our trips possible, in order to avoid reproducing them as much as possible.
Hurricane Maria uprooted a tree in San Juan that remained on the sidewalk, clumps of dirt in plain site. Someone had painted the Puerto Rican flag on the tree’s roots as a reminder that the island would rebuild itself, a reminder that—as the spray paint on a van in Santurce said—“PR SE LEVANTA.”
I can only hope that my trip didn't get in the way.

A bronze, male statue stands on the fourth floor of the Peabody Museum, meticulously crafted for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. Elevated on a pedestal, he gazes into the distance, his muscular arm tucked behind his back. Though the statue has received great attention, few are aware of the sources of data used to sculpt it: thousands of Harvard men, carefully measured—nude, for the sake of precision—and photographed.
The pink and beige data forms are in the Harvard Archives, available to any researcher. So are the thousands of naked photos, divided between 31 tightly-packed boxes.
The photos feature each man from behind, head-on, and in profile. In profile, the subject’s hand holds a vertical measuring stick outstretched. The three images are arranged side-by-side on a thick white note card, each of which is tucked into an envelope. Hundreds of envelopes line each box. The men gaze into the camera seriously, chins tilted up—for the most part, seemingly unconcerned with the prospect of a 19-year-old girl peering back at them 120 years later.
Paired with each photo is a notecard filled on the front and back with detailed measurements, handwritten in curly script. One side of the card lists sixty-five categories of measurement, including “strength of lungs” and “girth of ninth rib.” The other side offers basic information like the man’s father’s occupation and family medical history—one refers to death by train derailment, many more to death by consumption—along with the student’s name and his Harvard class year.
Taken between the 1880s and the 1910s, the trove of photos reflect one man’s fascination with precise measurement and data collection in pursuit of the perfect human form—Dudley Allen Sargent. Sargent, a physical fitness pioneer, served as director of Harvard’s Hemenway gymnasium from 1879 to 1919.
As a child, Sargent was drawn to gymnastics and worked in a circus. Sargent directed the gymnasium at Bowdoin College and went on to attend Yale Medical School, where he crafted a system of physical education guidelines, measurements, and apparatuses that quickly became well-known in schools across New England. But Sargent’s proposal to enact formalized physical education at universities—in which students could receive academic credit for regular attendance—were met with resistance. At Yale, President Noah T. Porter asserted he considered teaching physical education unworthy of a college-educated man. Sargent took matters into his own hands and opened his own independent gymnasium in New York.
In 1879, after Sargent shut down his New York gymnasium, he was recruited by President Charles W. Eliot to lead Harvard’s Department of Physical Training and Development at the newly renovated Hemenway Gymnasium. Sargent became director of the gymnasium and assistant professor of physical training, fulfilling his desire that physical education be taken seriously.
Sargent hoped to expand the reach of physical fitness beyond athletes to the general student body, tapping into what he called “the creative and constructive effects of athletics in augmenting power and in moulding character and conduct.” Sargent viewed physical fitness as a crucial tenet in overall strength of character, presaging Teddy Roosevelt’s later promotion of the “strenuous life.” Sargent recommended specific exercises based on deficiencies in individual students’ measurements in order to gradually approach human perfection.
At Harvard, using the examination techniques and data collection pioneered in his New York gymnasium, Sargent measured thousands of students.
He used special tools, including a steel “girth measure,” to measure and chart students’ bodies. Based on the measurements, Sargent would tell each student which muscles needed to be bulked up and would provide individualized exercise programs along with suggestions regarding diet, sleep, and clothing. Sargent believed precision was possible only when measuring students nude; the photographs likely served as an element of this extensive data collection, though he rarely referenced the pictures in his own writing.
Despite the growing crowds of students attending Sargent’s examinations, he remained unpopular with the Board of Overseers as well as with his colleagues on the faculty.
In 1885, Sargent served on the committee that banned football at Harvard for a season, citing safety concerns. Deaths on the football field were common at the time. Football was unregulated, unpadded, and unruly, and—in Sargent’s view—damaging to the power of human character. His personalized approach to health and beauty provided the superior alternative, he thought. But the move to ban football was extremely unpopular.
When his appointment came up for renewal in 1889, the Overseers stripped Sargent of his professor title, but let him remain as director of Hemenway Gymnasium.
Perhaps because of his troubles with Harvard’s faculty, Sargent held greater sway outside campus. Sargent led a public campaign to spread his gospel beyond Hemenway Gymnasium. A media craze ensued: in 1890, Sargent held a competition for the most perfectly symmetrical body, based on detailed measurement categories he designed. Sargent viewed the physical ideal not just as symmetry of one’s features but as proportional symmetry. For instance, Sargent commented that the female winner in his 1890 competition was in both the 82.5th percentile for height and 82.5 percentile for weight. Sargent was both a master of self-promotion and a man with a singular mission—spreading the gospel of physical education.
Sargent also wrote prolifically and gave interviews to newspapers across the country. He commissioned the two Peabody statues (one of which is female) using the average measurements gleaned from his research and from data sent in by researchers at other schools. Sargent believed the statues would serve as a clear benchmark for the progress of humankind over the years, and onlookers at the time compared themselves to the mean-measurement of the “Typical American” as displayed in the figures.
Yale, Wellesley, Vassar, and other schools required students to be photographed nude in the 20th century. At a time when subjects of those photos were still alive, the universities in many cases destroyed the photos or donated them to the Smithsonian. The surviving photos are closed to all researchers until 2050. Harvard, by contrast, makes its nude photos of students available for any researcher to view, though researchers are required to “disassociate the names of the subjects” when writing about the photographs.
Sargent expanded his reach beyond Harvard, founding the Sargent School of Physical Training—now the Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at Boston University. Upon his death in 1924, the New York Times referred to him as “America’s pre-eminent leader in the field of physical education.”
Few experts deny Sargent’s impact on physical culture. Fewer are aware of the thousands of nude Harvard men it took to get there.

The first floor of Pandemonium Books and Games is mostly a bookstore, full of titles ranging from Angus Watson’s “You Die When You Die” to “Star Wars” Mad Libs. The register is guarded by several plaster statues of mounted dragon heads, and the glass counter is full of individually tagged and packaged Magic cards, some of which cost more than I get paid in a month. A sign next to the stairs to the basement reads, “Please refrain from using strong language. Offenders may be exiled to Mordor.”
Every Friday night, Pandemonium hosts four different events where gamers gather to play Magic: The Gathering. To call Magic a card game doesn’t do it justice: Over the years, it has come to encompass novels, comics, tournaments, and a literal stock market. It’s here that I—what one of the gamers here might call “a complete noob”—find myself immersed in a culture that has been going strong since Magic was released in 1993.
“It’s just addictive, it’s fun, it’s relatable,” Abdul S. Ibrahim says. “There’s just a huge culture around it and we’ve all been playing it since we were kids.” He has been involved with Magic on and off for over 20 years—since he was five.
Ibrahim plays seriously. He goes to different Magic venues several times a week. Eric C. Bartolotti, on the other hand, plays only once or twice a month, but he’s still immersed in the culture. Bartolotti has been playing since he was in elementary school.
“My friends were all playing Magic, and it was the mature alternative to Pokemon at the time, so that made us feel all grown up,” he says. “Everyone around us was playing Pokemon and we were like, ‘No, no, Magic is the big boys’ thing.’”
This year marks the 25th anniversary of Magic: The Gathering, and the game has grown up along with many of its players. “There’s a lot more organization now,” Ibrahim says. “One nice thing is that there’s a lot more diversity now, which I appreciate. Even just the Magic: The Gathering plot—there are queer characters now, there are nonbinary characters now. They’ve taken huge strides.”
Downstairs is where the Magic happens. Over 100 players cram into the basement between shelves of role-playing games, art supplies and booster packs. It costs $5 to enter, and a few lucky winners get prizes in store credit, which they often use to buy more Magic cards. Magic is a self-perpetuating economy.
While some players don’t dedicate much time to the game, many invest money: Even casual players can rack up thousands of dollars worth of cards. “I spend more than I should for how little I play,” says Lia M. Thelen, who started playing Magic in college with her partner Zak G. Terry. “We have a box that’s supposed to be for 2,500 cards. I haven’t put the cards in the box yet, but I think it would at least be half full.”
Cards vary in price depending on supply and demand, according to Ibrahim. He and Bartolotti are flipping through card binders and point out some of the more expensive cards in the glass cases below us, ranging from a $2 Urza’s Mine to a $360 Sorcery.
Ibrahim names the Black Lotus as one of the most expensive cards. “Even people that don’t play Magic will be able to name off a Black Lotus,” he says. “A pack-fresh Black Lotus would probably be about $30,000.”
There’s even a Magic stock market. At mtgstocks.com, players can monitor card prices based on availability and popularity. Most people aim to buy rather than sell, but selling the right thing at the right time could help you get ahead on your rent for the month. “I know all those things in the ’90s that you could invest in, like Beanie Babies, Tickle Me Elmos, Pogs,” Bartolotti says. “If you could get your hands on the first couple sets they released—anyone who held onto that made a lot of money.”
These high stakes are part of the game’s appeal. “There’s this game in Magic that’s kind of notorious called Rip It or Flip It, where you’ll buy a booster pack and take the card on top and either flip the card or rip the card in half,” Ibrahim says. “You can’t look at any of the cards. I wound up playing the game with a friend and ripping a card in half that was worth $300, an Expedition Scalding Tarn. My hands were literally shaking afterwards.” (The cards’ value is always fluctuating: According to mtgstocks, the Scalding Tarn is now only worth $76.)
Even though players are willing to invest money, they might not always be in it to win. “A lot of times I’ll build a deck not so much to win a game but to be funny, or to do something interesting,” Terry says. His favorite is a deck built around a card called Worldslayer, which destroys everything in its path, paired with an indestructible creature—yielding “this really weak but indestructible dude hitting you with a sword every time and blowing up everything. It didn’t always work but it was really funny to play.”
Magic is unique in how complicated it is, and in how far its story spreads. There are over 20 billion cards in existence, and with thousands of creatures and planeswalkers to keep track of, things can get a little muddled. “Sometimes [the creators] accidentally break the game,” Ibrahim says. “They’ll make a card that’s way too powerful and release it, and then everyone plays it and it just completely warps the game.”
I explain that I watched about 20 YouTube videos in preparation for this trip, and still have no idea how to play. Terry laughs. “It can be a little intimidating to start playing because a lot of the rules in Magic are very complicated and sort of implicit,” Terry says. “When it first came out, a lot of the ideas weren’t super well defined, and as [the creators] went through they really well-defined the rules so now the rules are super complicated. They understood it in their heads, and then they had to figure out how to write it down.”
Starting out as a new player can be overwhelming, but according to Thelen, anyone can get into it with the right resources and a little self-confidence. “Be patient with yourself,” he says. “You see other people playing and it looks like it’s easy and they’re getting it, but it does take a little while. If you’re going to play against someone, have someone who knows the game show you what to do. That would be the best way to start.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is officially launching a search for the next dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow announced in a Thursday email to Harvard affiliates.
Smith revealed earlier this month he would step down as dean of FAS at the end of the academic year. In his role at the helm of the University’s largest faculty, which he assumed in 2007, Smith weathered the 2008 financial crisis and saw the University through its record-breaking capital campaign.
Bacow thanked Smith for his tenure in the Thursday email.
“Mike has served with great distinction and dedication since 2007. I join Drew and many others in gratitude for his leadership and service—and for his willingness to carry forward in University Hall until the search concludes and his successor is in place,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow wrote he sees the search as “an opportunity to learn more about the FAS” as he prepares to take the reins of the University this summer.
“The FAS is at the center of Harvard’s academic enterprise, the home to a community of faculty, students, and staff whose creativity, energy, breadth, and contributions to scholarship and education are second to none,” he wrote.
Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber '76 attended the biweekly meeting of the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—last week to solicit input on the dean search. Bacow wrote, though, that he wants to expand input across “wider set of conversations with various groups of faculty, students, staff, and alumni in the weeks and months ahead.”
In the email, Bacow wrote he would be soliciting input—through a designated email address or through mail from the FAS community—on multiple aspects of the search.
“I know that such communications will contribute a great deal to my own understanding of the FAS and to thinking about its future leadership,” he wrote. "It would help to have your views on the major opportunities and challenges facing the FAS in the years ahead, on the qualities and experience you would most value in the next dean, and—of course—on any individuals you believe should be considered as possible candidates.”
The president-elect also formed an advisory body for the search, comprising a group of faculty who will work closely with Bacow and Garber.
“Consistent with the University’s practice in dean searches, I have asked a group of faculty to work closely with Provost Alan Garber and me as an advisory committee for the search,” he wrote. “They will together bring a range of diverse perspectives and experiences to this important task, and I greatly appreciate their willingness to serve.”
The advisory committee’s full composition is as follows: University Professor Ann M. Blair ’84; African and African American Studies Chair Lawrence D. Bobo; Economics professor John Y. Campbell; Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Scott V. Edwards ’86; Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering Professor Evelyn Hu; Biologically Inspired Engineering professor Jennifer A. Lewis; University Professor Douglas A. Melton; former Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow; Computer Science professor David C. Parkes; Religion professor Parimal G. Patil; Humanities professor Jennifer L. Roberts; Romance Languages and Literatures professor Diana Sorensen; and Chemistry Professor Xiaowei Zhuang.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith detailed various ways FAS is working to promote diversity in an emailed message to FAS affiliates Thursday, following the Tuesday release of the final report of a University-wide task force on diversity and inclusion.
The report, which is the final product of the 55-member Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, discusses and recommends initiatives to promote “many dimensions of diversity” across the University, such as enhanced mental health resources, retention of faculty, and pipeline programs for staff.
In his email, Smith praised the work of the task force.
“The Task Force did thoughtful and thorough consultation, engaging each of Harvard’s Schools to learn from all their many programs and approaches, structures and committees, challenges and successes,” he wrote. “Their report speaks eloquently to what we have long known to be true: that academic excellence requires diversity—of perspectives, methods, and experiences.”
Smith also called the report and the University’s diversity initiatives “a long-term project, one that stretches into our past and that must continue in every generation.”
“I am enormously proud of those who have helped to shape the Harvard of today and are impatient for us to be the Harvard of tomorrow," he wrote. "Those efforts bring about the reinvention that is essential for an institution to remain vibrant, even after hundreds of years in service to our mission."
Smith included several examples of ongoing FAS initiatives intended to promote inclusion and belonging, such as improving diversity in the faculty recruiting process.
“Persistent attention to diversity, at every stage of each faculty search, is a constant theme in our search policies and procedures, and in conversations between the deans and departments, and within departments and search committees,” Smith wrote.
The initiatives listed in Smith’s email span the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the College, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Division of Continuing Education.
These initiatives include the hiring of two Diversity and Inclusion Fellows by the GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs earlier this year, a new pre-orientation program for first generation students at the College, and an upcoming SEAS-wide “BRIDGE Week” that will “celebrate diversity in STEM.”
Smith also wrote that FAS human resources facilitated workshops for coaches and other athletic department affiliates between January and March, following a 2017 “culture review” of the department.
Smith wrote the initiatives in his email comprise “just a small sample of the efforts happening across the FAS.”
“Overall, we will continue efforts to reflect the issues and priorities highlighted by the Task Force in our strategic planning and assessment activities,” he wrote. “You will hear more over time from the Schools and units of the FAS in the course of their work.”
Earlier this month, Smith announced he would step down as FAS dean at the end of the academic year, as he wraps up his 11th year in the position. In an email to Harvard affiliates Thursday afternoon, President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow announced an FAS Dean Search Advisory Committee and called for the input of Harvard affiliates on the search.

Alán Aspuru-Guzik—a chemistry professor whose research explores the intersection of theoretical chemistry, machine learning, and quantum computing—will depart Harvard to join the faculty of the University of Toronto after this academic year.
The University of Toronto announced Thursday that Aspuru-Guzik will work in its chemistry and computer science departments as part of the Canada 150 Research Chairs Program. The program, which debuted in 2017 and is worth 117.6 million Canadian dollars, aims to “enhance Canada's reputation as a global centre for science, research and innovation excellence, in celebration of Canada’s 150th anniversary,” according to its website.
Aspuru-Guzik, along with several members of his research group at Harvard, will move to Canada in July to start a new lab, the Matter Lab. The lab will seek to use computer algorithms to both characterize and simulate chemical phenomena.
Aspuru-Guzik, who came to Harvard in 2006 and earned a position as a tenured professor in 2013, said he is grateful to Harvard for its ongoing support of his endeavors.
“Harvard has treated me extremely nicely. It has been an extremely great home for me and my research,” he said. “I’m extremely grateful to my colleagues in the department of chemistry, my colleagues in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and my colleagues in engineering.”
Aspuru-Guzik said he is leaving the United States primarily due to his concern over the nation’s political climate, especially fallout from the tumultuous 2016 presidential election.
“Right now, it’s free-for-all. It’s kind of like warfare between the different parties, and this has been happening for a while,” he said. “When Trump won, I started to look abroad and started to think about different places, like Australia, Europe, Canada.”
He said Canada—and the University of Toronto in particular—emerged as a particularly appealing choice.
Aspuru-Guzik said he thinks Toronto is the “most diverse city in the world.” He added he believes Canadian legislation related to human rights, the environment, and immigration mean Toronto and other Canadian cities embody society in its ideal form.
“So, being there at one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world and leading a leading research group makes me feel very lucky,” Aspuru-Guzik said.
Aspuru-Guzik visited Canada Thursday morning to meet with the Canadian Minister of Science Kirsty E. Duncan, along with 23 other academics enrolled in the Canadian 150 program.
Matthias Degroote, a postdoctoral fellow in the chemistry and chemical biology department, said Aspuru-Guzik notified him of the planned move to Canada in Nov. 2017. Degroote will travel with Aspuru-Guzik to the University of Toronto this summer to continue his research.
“I’m excited to see what Canada has to offer,” Degroote said. “I hear Toronto is a great place, so I’m pretty excited as well. I was excited to come here, because Harvard is a great institution and Boston is a great place to live, but I don’t mind moving to Toronto.”
Aspuru-Guzik currently teaches two relatively new courses: PHYSCI 50: “Computing for Science Studio” and an online HarvardX course called The Quantum World, which he believes is the first edX course to be taught in two languages, English and Spanish. Aspuru-Guzik said he plans to bring both of these classes to the University of Toronto.
In his new capacity, Aspuru-Guzik will continue to be involved in the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, where he currently serves as senior fellow. He will also remain part of the Mission Innovation, which, according to its website, comprises a “global initiative of 22 countries and the European Union to dramatically accelerate global clean energy innovation.”
He will also serve as a faculty member of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which focuses on the advancement of artificial intelligence technology in Canada.
Despite his move to Canada, Aspuru-Guzik said he will still visit the Boston area frequently to monitor the launching of his two startup companies, Zapata Computing and Kebotix.
Aspuru-Guzik is the second Harvard professor to leave the University as part of the Canada 150 program. Computer science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 announced in Dec. 2017 she will join the University of British Columbia as part of the initiative next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nina Elkadi, a senior at Iowa City West High School in Iowa City, Iowa, was taking a break from producing her school’s newspaper when she checked online for her Harvard admissions notification. While she submitted applications to a number of Ivy League schools, she said she “really wasn’t expecting anything.”
When she went to check the online admissions portal, though, what she found surprised her.
“I was like, ‘Oh my God,’” Elkadi said. “I screamed very loudly.”
Elkadi was one of 998 students to receive an offer of admission to Harvard College on Wednesday evening.
“It was a very good moment and very surprising and just really incredible. It’s pretty surreal still,” she said. “I don’t think it’s actually sunk in.”
A record-low 4.59 percent of the 42,749 applicants to Harvard College’s Class of 2022 received offers of admission this year. Of those who applied in the regular decision cycle and those who were deferred from the early action cycle, 2.43 percent received offers of admission.
Cathy K. Sun, a high school senior from Irvine, California, was part of that group.
While waiting to check the online portal where admissions decisions were posted at 7 p.m. EST, Sun tried to distract herself by watching a few YouTube videos and unsuccessfully attempting to take a nap.
“I just talked to my friends and we tried to calm each other down, but we were all just shaking,” Sun said, describing the anxiety-filled minutes before decisions were released.
Sun was awaiting decisions from a number of Ivy League schools on Wednesday afternoon, and she saved checking the Harvard decision for  last. When she saw the word “congratulations” appear on the computer screen, she and her mother began jumping and screaming together for about five minutes, she said.
“I couldn't believe my eyes and I refreshed that page about 50 times to make sure they didn't send that update to the wrong person,” Sun said. “I texted about everyone I knew, especially the people who helped me out during the whole application process.”
James Garavito, a high school senior from Dover, N.J., learned about his offer of admission several weeks ago after receiving a “likely letter” in February that signified he was a highly likely candidate for admission. The phone call he received from an admissions representative confirming his acceptance was still a welcome surprise and brought tears to his and his parents’ eyes.
“It’s something that I’ve been working towards basically since I was little because I never thought that I’d be able to accomplish something like this,” Garavito said. “I come from Dover, N.J. which is a town that doesn’t really send students to Ivy League schools. Just to have this happen to me, I’m extremely grateful.”
Despite yesterday’s excitement, many students are still deciding on which school they want to attend in the fall. Students have until May 1 to respond to offers of admission. Last year’s matriculation rate reached a record high of 84 percent.
“I haven’t made a definite decision yet, but obviously Harvard is number one right now.” Patrick Monreal, an admitted student from Fresno, Calif., said. “It’s hard to choose other than Harvard.”
Accepted students will have the opportunity to attend Visitas—the College’s weekend of programming for admitted students—which runs from April 21 to April 23.

UPDATED: March 30, 2018 at 3:50 p.m.
Graduate students debated the merits of unionization ahead of an upcoming election to determine whether eligible students will form a union to collectively bargain with the University at a forum hosted by The Crimson Thursday evening,
The election, set to take place on April 18 and 19, comes after a previous vote in Nov. 2016. The results of the 2016 unionization election were the subject of over a year of legal back-and-forth between the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers and the University over the required lists of eligible voters provided by Harvard.
In December and January, the National Labor Relations Board determined that a second election was warranted due to inadequacies in the voter list. For example, some students from the Graduate School of Design were not included on the initial list.
At the forum, representatives from student groups HGSU-UAW and Against HGSU-UAW discussed several contentious aspects of the proposed unionization plan, including the union’s ability to raise wages and effectively combat sexual harassment.
One such point of contention was the possibility of a strike. Panelist Momchil Tomov, an Against HGSU-UAW representative, noted that many graduate students in the sciences might be reluctant to strike if missing work would imperil their research or their relationship with their supervisors.
“A lot of people doing research in, let’s say, wet labs, they work—you know, for their experiments, they just have to come in there,” Tomov said. “Especially if they work with animals, they have to come in there every day at a given time, and they can’t just decide for a week, ‘Oh, I’m not going to come in today.’”
HGSU-UAW organizer Justin Bloesch countered that a strike would be a “last resort in a negotiation process,” used only to protect essential benefits.
“If you don’t want to go on strike, no one’s going to make you go on strike,” HGSU-UAW organizer Sejal Singh said.
Another topic of debate was the dues pulled from students’ salaries, which members of the bargaining unit would be required to pay if HGSU-UAW prevails. The UAW’s base rate for members is set at a minimum of 1.44 percent of monthly wages.
Singh, noted that, per UAW policy, a “large part” of the dues collected from students will stay with HGSU-UAW. The remaining portion will go to the international UAW, for expenses such as the strike and defense fund.
Jae Hyeon Lee, a representative for Against HGSU-UAW, said the inconvenience of a union would likely outweigh any potential gains in graduate students’ salaries or benefits.
“Why would we go through all this trouble for just an incremental gain?” he said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 30, 2018
A previous version of this article identified Jae Hyeon Lee as an organizer for Against HGSU-UAW. To clarify, he is a representative for that organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s varsity golf team’s week-long training trip to southern California over spring break ended on a sour note when their team van was broken into and bags were stolen from the trunk, leaving several team members working to recover their belongings or seek compensation.
Three out of seven members of the team, as well as one coach, had suitcases containing clothes and personal belongings stolen from the team’s van on Mar. 17. Two golf bags that were in the back of the van were overturned but nothing was taken from them. While no equipment was stolen, the three team members will need new uniforms.
Assistant Coach Naree Song said the break-in came at the very end of the trip, when the team parked their van in a parking structure and left for a few hours to sightsee before their flight back to the east coast.
“It was our last day of the Spring Break trip and we had parked there and gone out for sightseeing and lunch,” Song said. “When we came back in the evening before we were going to go to the airport to catch the flight we just discovered that the van had been broken into.”
Song, who was among the four individuals whose bags were stolen, said at first there was no evidence of a break-in. However, the team soon discovered a hole drilled through the car’s lock that had been used to unlock the car.
“We kind of surveyed the vehicle to see, you know, what happened,” Song said. “It looked like on the front passenger door there was a hole that was drilled through the keyhole.”
When asked if she had been reimbursed for the belongings lost in her suitcase, Song said the team was “working through that process” with the Athletics Department. University spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in a statement that the University is aware of the incident.
“During the recent break, the women’s golf team van was broken into while in Santa Monica, California, resulting in the loss of four pieces of luggage,” Goldman wrote. “The team promptly reported the incident to local authorities. It is our understanding that this loss is not covered under insurance.”
Song filed a report with the Santa Monica Police Department after the team arrived back on campus but is still waiting for any developments in the investigation. The break-in of the women’s golf team van was one of two reported thefts on Mar. 17 in Parking Structure 6 and the second in a three day span.
Multiple members of the women’s golf team declined or did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School affiliates raised a number of diversity-related concerns Wednesday at the first meeting of the school’s diversity committee this semester, with some attendees questioning the school’s commitment to change.
The Kennedy School Diversity Committee, commonly known  as DivCo, is a student-run organization that offers students, faculty, and staff at the school the opportunity to raise and address issues of diversity and inclusion.  HKS Dean of Students Debra E. Isaacson called the meeting last Friday, according to an email sent by her executive assistant Erin O’Connell Friday.
O'Connell's email came the same day The Crimson published the findings of a Kennedy School task force on diversity and inclusion; those findings highlighted the school’s struggle to recruit minority students. Since 2005, the admissions rate for African-American and Latinx students has remained stagnant, and the yield rate for African-American students has declined.
Some students said they found it concerning that Isaacson called the first meeting of the committee so late in the semester.
“I am a bit disappointed that this is the first meeting of the semester, considering we’re a month away from the end of the school year,” Shaniqua L. McClendon, a second-year Master in Public Policy student and president of the Black Student Union, wrote in an email Thursday. “Considering the great deal of interest in diversity at the Kennedy School these meetings should be held more regularly.”
In recent years, the Kennedy School has grappled with a number of diversity-related issues. HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf convened the task force of students, faculty, and staff in 2016 to research specific areas of the school and recommend initiatives to promote diversity. In May 2017, the group released its draft report, recommending ways to improve the number of U.S.-born minority students and the overall culture of the school.
The group’s main recommendation was to hire an associate dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging to address and implement diversity initiatives within the school. After an eight-month search process, Robbin Chapman, now an associate provost at Wellesley College, will start as the new associate dean for diversity in April.
Students who attended the meeting—which was off-the-record and lasted for more than an hour—said the committee discussed Chapman’s appointment and questioned whether she would have the necessary clout to enforce new policies.
“There was specifically pushback from students about what kind of teeth will her role have,” Justin E. Galle, a second-year MPP student, said. “Is she going to be able to mandate things?”
“There wasn’t a great response to that,” he added.
Galle also said the meeting included remarks from Academic Dean Archon Fung, who led the meeting along with Isaacson, as well as student questions.
“The way Dean Fung runs these meetings isn’t always conducive to productivity or students feeling welcome to share opinions,” Galles said. “Someone specifically said towards the end of the meeting: ‘You kind of put up a wall when you should be acting like a sponge.’”
In a statement provided by Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel, Fung wrote he works to listen and find common ground among students and other attendees of these meetings.
“We constantly strive to reach common understanding between students, staff, and faculty, and we hope that our practice of shared governance between administrators and students on the Diversity Committee advances that understanding,” Fung wrote.
Several students expressed concern about the timing of the meeting. Administrators held the session at 10:30 a.m.–a time when many Kennedy School students have classes, students said. Nonetheless, McClendon and Galles both said around 30 people attended  the event.
“It’s just a middle-of-the-day kind of time when people have things going on,” Amy J. Zhou, a second year student in the MPP program who was not able to attend the meeting, said.
In a statement Thursday, Isaacson wrote she made every effort to schedule these committee meetings at times that are convenient and cognizant of competing time constraints.
“My office worked with the three student co-chairs to find a time suitable for them, while also being mindful of faculty and staff committee members and their availability,” Isaacson wrote. We do our best to stagger the days and times of these meetings throughout the semester, to ensure that everyone in our community has some opportunity to participate in our committee discussions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Classroom to Table program, a popular initiative that allows students and faculty to dine at local restaurants on Harvard’s dime, has implemented new restrictions on student participation this semester—but is nonetheless facing financial uncertainty after using up all its allotted College funding.
In the fall 2017 iteration of the program, student participants could eat a maximum of four meals through Classroom to Table—meaning students could likely eat a meal with every one of their professors, given Harvard students typically take four classes a semester. Under the new guidelines, though, students are limited to two meals per semester.
The online sign-up form for the program is also now only available during administrative office hours, meaning students can sign up between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Previously, the application to join Classroom to Table was available to undergraduates 24/7.
These changes come in light of increasing interest from the student body; the number of student requests to participate in the program rose between fall 2016 and fall 2017. Last semester, 2,880 students and 528 faculty members dined together in 894 Classroom to Table-funded meals, according to data provided by Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane.
But the changes also come as Classroom to Table faces financial difficulties. Dane wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that the program has run out of budgeted College funding and that administrators are working to raise more money for Classroom to Table.
“The program has exceeded our projections and the amount we had allocated for the program this year, and so the College will continue its efforts to raise funds to support this popular program moving forward,” Dane wrote.
This is not the first time Classroom to Table has struggled financially. Administrators halted the program in April of last year after the initiative exhausted its budgeted funds following higher-than-projected student and faculty interest.
The College implemented the four-meal restriction the semester after these financial difficulties. Prior to the 2017-2018 school year, there was no limit on the number of meals students and professors could enjoy on the College’s dime.
Classroom to Table is funded in part by Senior Gift, an initiative that encourages graduates of every Harvard class to donate to financial aid as well as to an unrestricted fund managed by the College.
The program was first piloted by the Office of Undergraduate Education in Sept. 2015. Under Classroom to Table rules, meals typically consist of one to two professors and three to five undergraduates. Both faculty members and College students can organize these gatherings.
Through the initiative, the College pays up to 30 dollars per person—excluding the cost of alcoholic beverages—for a lunch or dinner at one of several Harvard Square dining establishments. Restaurants currently participating in the program include Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, The Hourly Oyster House, and Temple Bar.
Some students lauded the program’s ability to increase facetime with professors—which they said can be a rarity at Harvard.
“Even though Harvard's a pretty big place, we usually don't get much facetime with professors,” Yashvardhan M. Bardoloi ’21 said.
Others said they think Classroom to Table offers high-quality, one-on-one interactions with faculty members. Cedric H. Li ’21 said meals are much more personal than office hours, for example.
“It's automatically very relaxed, [you] don't feel very pressured to ask anything very insightful–you know, it's just about connecting with the faculty,” Li said.
Some professors said they also value the increased student-faculty interaction Classroom to Table facilitates. Daniel T. Gilbert, who teaches the popular Science of Living Systems 20: “Introduction to Psychology,” wrote in an email that he does not always get to make personal connections with undergraduates. Last semester’s SLS 20 class enrolled nearly 450 students.
“I rarely get to know my own students in more than a superficial capacity,” Gilbert wrote. “That’s bad for them and even worse for me.”
Gilbert wrote he thinks Classroom to Table is a “terrific” program and added he has eaten more than 25 meals with undergraduates through the initiative.
Dane wrote Thursday that finding new funding for Classroom to Table forms a top priority for College administrators going forward.
“Harvard College values the Classroom to Table program, which seeks to foster conversation and academic connection among undergraduate students to create additional opportunities for intellectual, personal, and social transformation,” she wrote. “We know that students and faculty alike value this program too (as noted by its high participation rates) and, as such, the College has made it a top priority in our fundraising efforts.”

Fifteen women who accused Professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment sent a letter to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith Thursday arguing Harvard is “ill-equipped” to investigate Dominguez and demanding the University take new steps to ensure a “full and fair” review.
University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild received copies of the letter.
The authors of the letter wrote that, based on their interactions with the Title IX Office, Harvard is incapable of conducting its avowed “full and fair” investigation into the allegations against Dominguez. The women call for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Dominguez’s alleged history of sexual misconduct and lay out seven criteria needed to ensure a full review of the case.
In late February and early March, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of repeated sexual harassment across the past four decades.
Shortly after the publication of these articles, Smith announced FAS would review the allegations against Dominguez and also announced administrators were placing Dominguez on paid “administrative leave.” The following day, Dominguez announced he would retire from his teaching position at the end of the school year and would step down from all administrative positions immediately.
Six women signed the letter with their names, while the remaining nine chose to remain anonymous, though they noted their connection to Harvard. Four of the women were undergraduates in the Government department, and three received Government Ph.D.s from Harvard. Two—Yoshiko M. Herrera and Terry L. Karl—were Government professors. Three women identified only as Harvard staffers also signed the document.
The signatories requested that the University Title IX office reach out “proactively” to women who worked with Dominguez.
University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement earlier this month that FAS has begun outreach to “students and post-docs who have worked closely with Prof. Dominguez.”
Several women, however, said this is not enough.
Herrera, a former associate professor of Government, said in an interview she thinks Harvard needs to expand its outreach to include former junior faculty who may have come into contact with Dominguez. She also said the University needs to look beyond people who “worked closely” with Dominguez.
“By only looking for people he closely worked with, you're not going to get all of the people who he might have harassed because some of those people would have specifically decided not to work closely with him,” Herrera said.
She added the University has not reached out to her in an “institutional or official” manner, meaning no University or FAS administrators have contacted her to date. She said she has, however, been in touch with Hochschild.
Nienke C. Grossman ’99, a former Government concentrator who also signed the letter, said it is important Harvard begin reaching out to people instead of waiting for them to contact the University.
“You can't just rely on people reaching out to you if you want a complete record, or a reasonably complete record,” Grossman said. “By reaching out to people, Harvard is showing the community that it takes this seriously and that it cares.”
Karl, another signatory of the letter and the main subject of the original Chronicle article, wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that she contacted Faust the day the first Chronicle article was published. Karl wrote an email to Faust asserting she possesses documents that are “directly relevant to the choice of appropriate sanctions” for Dominguez.
In an email obtained by The Crimson, an employee in Faust’s office responded to Karl and wrote she had given Karl’s name to the Title IX Office. The employee added Title IX officials would contact Karl if the staffers “need further information from you.”
Karl said she has not received any communication from the Title IX Office about her documents in the weeks since this email exchange.
In the letter Thursday, the women also wrote they submitted a list of 10 questions to the Title IX Office following the Chronicle articles. The women repeatedly noted it took 10 days for the office to respond to these questions.
Suzanna E. Challen, a former government Ph.D. student and one of three women who reached out to the Title IX Office about Dominguez in Nov. 2017, said Title IX officials told the women in Jan. 2018 that the office did not plan to take further action regarding their case.
“In January 2018, the Title IX Officer told us he would take no further action in investigating our reports unless we filed formal complaints due to ‘multiple situations with ongoing harassment,’” the letter reads.
A University spokesperson for Title IX did not comment on specific criticisms of the office.
In the letter, the women wrote they would “like for Harvard University to commit to conducting an investigation that meets the following requirements” before detailing seven criteria.
The seven suggestions include the proposal that Harvard conduct an independent investigation, in addition to an official Title IX investigation, to determine “what conditions gave rise to this situation and what can be done to prevent this from happening again.”
Dominguez was sanctioned for sexual harassment in 1983, after Karl came forward with accusations of harassment, but was not stripped of his position and continued to rise though Harvard’s ranks.
Karl said she thinks Harvard is “experiencing a massive system failure.”
“There are at least 20 women between 1979 and quite recently that have said they have been harassed by this individual,” Karl said. “That means that Harvard has shown it is incapable of investigating these stories, that its procedures and policies do not work, and that it would behoove the institution greatly to hire an outside agency that is experienced in issues of sex discrimination and sexual harassment because if you do not understand these issues, then you cannot investigate them.”
Charna E. Sherman ’80, a former Government concentrator who said she experienced harassment while working with Dominguez in the late ’70s, also said the investigation needs to be independent, given the fact that Dominguez’s behavior persisted over several decades.
“If you want to look at this system, you can't have the system itself doing the looking,” Sherman said. “We need a thorough investigation, it needs to be independent, and there needs to be commitment in advance that it be public."
The letter also asks the University to “not investigate complainants or witnesses for retaliation for sharing information acquired during the Title IX process.”
"There is a clause of confidentiality which would basically make it possible for witnesses or complainants, meaning the women who are participating in the process, to be investigated for retaliation if we speak about any information we learn as part of the Title IX process,” Challen said. “That's not something that we feel comfortable agreeing to.”
The women’s other suggestions include allocating more resources to the Title IX Office and making public the final report of any investigation Harvard undertakes.
Grossman, who has been in contact with the Title IX Office since last November along with Challen, said the office informed them Monday it had prepared a complaint with a list of potential complainants or witnesses. The office told them they could file a complaint themselves or serve as witnesses.
“I very much would like to file a complaint,” Grossman said. “But I want to see first how the University responds because the process needs to be a process that is full and fair, as the University has said it wants to do.”
Challen said she believes the Title IX Office needs support from Harvard at this moment in particular.
"I think it's important for the University to adequately put resources behind its Title IX Office right now,” Challen said. “It's my understanding that there's more complaints as a result of the publicity, combined with the #MeToo movement more generally."
Since the establishment of the central Title IX Office in 2014, the University has seen an increase every year in the number of reports of sexual misconduct across Harvard. As of Dec. 2017, complaints had spiked by 20 percent in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal that sparked the #MeToo movement.
The women wrote that they are addressing Smith specifically because they believe he has the ability to dictate the terms of the investigation.
Smith could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that “the University is committed to a full and fair review of the allegations surrounding Jorge Dominguez in accordance with our Title IX policy and procedures.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actor, composer, and activist Lin-Manuel Miranda, famous for creating the renowned musicals “Hamilton” and “In The Heights,” took to the stage at the Harvard Kennedy School Thursday, at the kickoff event for the second annual “America Adelante” conference.
A crowd of over 100 gathered in the room where it happened, to hear Miranda speak about his career, and how he has gained success in a field historically absent of Latinx individuals.
The two-day conference, featuring 45 Latinx leaders, politicians, and activists, is hosted by the Center for Public Leadership with the goal of connecting Latinx leaders with Harvard Latinx students and “accelerating the influence of Latinos across the U.S.”
“I’m starstruck, but not for the typical reason,” said Amanda R. Matos, a Kennedy School student and fellow at the Center for Public Leadership, who moderated the conversation with Miranda.

“It’s not because of ‘Hamilton’ or ‘In the Heights’ or anything like that. I’m honestly just starstruck because it is rare for me to be in spaces with other uptown New Yoricans.”
The two New Yoricans—a phrase coined to describe Puerto Ricans living in New York—discussed topics ranging from New York baseball teams to growing up in bi-cultural settings, and the difficulties that come with being a first-generation college student.
“Art is the thing that allows us to engage with the other side on not an ideal level, on a human level. I think our stories are more necessary than ever when, when, people are painting us with the same brush,” Miranda said.
Miranda said the music and lyrics he wrote for “In the Heights” were inspired by disappointment in the portrayal of Puerto Ricans as violent gangsters in the musicals “West Side Story” and “The Capeman.”

“I think ‘In the Heights’ began with the death of ‘The Capeman.’ It was a punch in the stomach because my heroes had created something that didn’t work,” Miranda said. “It was like that cool water in the face like, ‘Hey! No one’s making your dream musical. You go make your dream musical!’”
Miranda also spoke on his activism following Hurricane Maria and called on students to take on a cause that matters to them.
“The one that bugs you in the shower, the one that keeps you from sleeping at night—that's the one you have to get to work on the next day, because it will feel meaningful to you and we need it. We need it on all fronts,” Miranda said.
“Whether that is immigration reform, whether that is hurricane relief, whether that is police brutality, whether that is, insert whatever hurts your heart the most, and get to work.”
The late Lisa M. Quiroz ’83, was a driving force behind the creation of this event last year, Erika O. Carlsen, the assistant director for fellowship programs and Latino initiatives at the Center for Public Leadership, said.
In a tweet posted by Miranda, he said Quiroz requested he headline this event before she passed away. Miranda said he doesn’t usually have the time to attend many events, but came to honor his promise to Quiroz.
Several students were thrilled to hear Miranda speak, and drew inspiration from the words he shared.
“To be in a room at Harvard with someone who you can connect to on a very personal level, and then to hear him speak about his experiences, it felt really validating,” Aranza Caballero ’20 said.  “I felt, personally, really inspired and motivated to keep going because regardless of what happens in our nation, there will always be a person who is trying to make things better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball will travel to Chapel Hill, N.C., in the upcoming 2018-2019 season to play the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, according to Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports.
This will be the second time in the past four years that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker will square off against UNC’s Roy Williams. The two teams last met in the Second Round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament, where the Tar Heels narrowly edged out the Crimson 67-65. In that contest, senior guard Wesley Saunders notched 26 points and junior guard Siyani Chambers drained a late-game three to put Harvard ahead by one heading into the final minute of action.
However, then-freshman Justin Jackson of No.4 UNC ended No.13 Harvard’s hopes at an upset, knocking down a jumper and fast-break layup to survive its opening-game scare.
The Crimson is no stranger to playing nationally-ranked programs on its home court, having challenged then-No. 5 Kentucky on Dec. 5 this past season and then-No. 1 Kansas in 2015 at Allen Fieldhouse.
Despite staying competitive in contests against larger-conference opponents this season, Harvard was unable to earn a victory against teams such as Minnesota, Saint Mary’s, and Kentucky this season.
As to the full 2018-2019 season schedule, Crimson supporters will need to wait until the summer to make plans. If abiding by past precedent, August will be earliest the official schedule is confirmed.
Harvard will return its current talented sophomore class, including AP All-American honorable mention winner Seth Towns, as it seeks to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since that 2015 matchup against UNC.
Additionally, the Crimson will welcome a 2018 recruiting class led by ESPN four-star guard Spencer Freedman. Ontario native Noah Kirkwood will also reunite with fellow Canada U19 teammate and current Harvard freshman Danilo Djuricic, joining St. Louis native Kale Catchings and Californian Mason Forbes to round out Amaker’s 2018 recruits.

For those within basketball circles, the last name Fraschilla has become synonymous with coaching.
Fran Fraschilla served over two decades on the sidelines, with head coaching stops at Manhattan, St. John’s, and New Mexico before becoming a well-respected commentator for ESPN.
Fran Fraschilla’s elder son, James, played four years of college basketball at the University of Oklahoma before joining the coaching ranks as a Player Development Coach for the Utah Jazz’s G League team.
It came as no surprise, then, when younger son and former Crimson guard Matt Fraschilla ’17 announced his plans to pursue a coaching career after graduation. His first destination since leaving Cambridge? Villanova, which under Coach Jay Wright has been home to one of the nation’s most dominant men’s basketball programs.
This weekend in San Antonio, the Wildcats will attempt to win their second national championship in the past three seasons. For a first-year graduate assistant coach like Fraschilla, the experience of making the Final Four has been, in his words, simply “unbelievable”.
Fraschilla echoed in many ways the sentiments of Coach Wright, who after Sunday’s Elite Eight victory against Texas Tech used similar language to describe Villanova’s 34-4 season and extended postseason run.
“It is really surreal,” Wright said.  “You try not to think about it so when it hits you, it is almost unbelievable. I think when we get home it will hit us. Right now the joy of playing like that…we are proud of that.”
For “Matty Fresh,” the journey to Villanova first came into view after his junior year at Harvard, when an ACL tear forced him to take on a new role with the Crimson. In becoming a pseudo-assistant coach and maintaining an open line of communication with Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, Fraschilla reinforced that season a true love for coaching.
“The silver lining was being out and having to make an impact in a different way,” Fraschilla said. “I tried to work with the staff as much as I could and try to coach the guys on the sideline. It kind of developed into realizing I had a passion for it.”
Fraschilla also credits Amaker for maintaining an open door policy during his time at Harvard, allowing him the opportunity to reciprocate ideas and talk about the “X’s and O’s” of the game after practice. Moreover, the Dallas native emphasized that his personal relationship with Amaker ultimately convinced him to stay on a college campus instead of seeking opportunities elsewhere.
“A lot of people ask, ‘Why didn’t I want to work in the NBA like my brother?’” Fraschilla said. “I know a lot of it is the impact you can have on a kid. From 18 to 22 is so big, and Coach Amaker had such a big impact on me. I think it is a special bond that a college player has with his coach and I want to have that here.”
Amaker’s impact and the close-knit relationships with former teammates have not escaped the Harvard graduate, who maintains a keen eye on the young Crimson team despite switching to the Navy and White. Impressed by the performance of players like sophomores Christian Juzang, Chris Lewis, and Seth Towns, Fraschilla stated that he has “no doubt those guys are going to compete for the conference championship for years to come”.
Having such strong coaching blood within the family impacted Fraschilla in tremendous ways as well, but there was never any pressure for Matt to follow in his father’s footsteps. It may not have been fait accompli, but certainly, the passion for the game was passed on from father to son.
“[James and Matt] both want to be in the coaching business—I didn’t encourage them.” said Fran Fraschilla in an interview with Awful Announcing. “I think through osmosis, they’ve seen that their dad has had a fulfilling, happy life being around an orange leather ball. And they see that I love my job, whether it was the coaching or the broadcasting.”
Matt Fraschilla may not be calling the shots just yet, but those lessons both on and off the court have certainly benefited in his development as a coach. With Villanova, Fraschilla is primarily responsible for on-court instruction with players, film breakdown, and being the “utility guy” for Wright and his coaching staff. From working with players like Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson to booking team flights, graduate assistants like Fraschilla are exposed to all aspects of the massive operation that is Villanova Basketball.
Of course, being around a nationally-respected coach such as Jay Wright is another perk that Fraschilla has embraced. In his first year with the program, the former Amaker protégé noted the unsurprising similarities between his current boss Jay Wright and former college coach.
“They are very charismatic,” Fraschilla said. “Both have a very easy time talking to people whether it is people outside the program or communicating their instructions to players. Neither of them beat around the bush…. Both have an intense side to them because they both have been at the highest level.”
Wright’s leadership as well as the mentorship of Amaker and his father has given Matt a plethora of resources to draw from as he begins to ascend the coaching ladder. But before thinking about the future or potentially one day returning back to Lavietes Pavilion, Fraschilla’s sole focus will be towards helping ’Nova regain its place at the top of college basketball.
“As Coach Wright puts it, ‘Be here now.’ So I am focused on Villanova Basketball.” Fraschilla said. “I am focused on here, right now, having the chance to compete in the Final Four…. Every coach has to make career decisions at some point, but I am just enjoying this and learning as much as I can.”
This weekend, a small reminder of Harvard Basketball will be present at college basketball’s biggest platform. For once, Crimson fans will have someone to cheer for: ’Nova’s “utility guy.”

Every year, hundreds of snakes—that is, econ-interested Harvard students—hail from near and far to learn from their fearlessssssssssss leader Gregory Mankiw as they undertake Ec10a and b. On Wednesday, March 28th, they gathered at the witching hour of 7:40 p.m. to battle it out and prove themselves on the Ec10b midterm. In an attempt to learn more about the culture of the prospective members of one of Harvard’s most notorious concentrations, Flyby went undercover to the midterm with open ears.
On Mindset
“You ready?”
“Well, I guess now I have to be.”
We suppose there’s something to be said for blatant honesty...at this point there’s not much you can do anyway.
“I’m scared.”
Honestly, aren’t we all?
On Preparation
“Did you study at all?”
“Eh, a little bit. I did the unit reviews, which were actually pretty helpful. I mean, I didn’t actually go to them, but I did them afterward.”
“Well, I actually went to the unit reviews.”
“Wow, you go hard!”
The bar is set pretty low if going to low-commitment, high-reward review sessions is now considered “going hard”, but all the best to you in your future pursuits. You might just be the one ec kid that doesn’t get a freshman summer internship at BCG—bummer.
On Knowledge
“What’s 1 divided by 0.05?”
*pause*
“Well, using fractions is always a good way to start.”
On the course description it says, “We will not use calculus.” But maybe some basic algebra skills would be helpful?
“It’s high low low high.”
“No, it’s low high high low.”
“Wait, no, I think it might be the opposite…”
Sounds a bit like how your mood and stress levels might go as you take the midterm if you’re this unsure this late in the game.
On Strategic Seating
“We should sit here! This is like where we sit for Hebrew Bible!”
Psychology definitely says that you should sit in the same seat for both lectures and tests, but I’m not sure if this recommendation stands across subjects. Although the more you think about it, aren’t Ec and Hebrew Bible both just classes for people trying to find the easiest path towards the most reward in life?
An alternative strategy to choosing a seat:
“It might just be a random seat, but I need it!”
Because by some crazy magic, exam rooms are packed, while during lecture the only person around is Mankiw—except sometimes he isn’t either.
On Grading
“If you’re in my grading group, you’re going to be just fine.”
Ah yes, you’ve always got to find those people in your grading group who make the rest of you look great. AVOID SECTION KID AT ALL COSTS.
“Dude, wreck the curve for me.”
Would it even be a Harvard exam if there wasn’t some discussion of the curve?
Now that the exam is over, all that was left to do was sit and wait and hope that the Ec gods blessed you with a grading group that makes your mediocre score look good. To all the ec-devoted students out there, we hope the curve was in your favor!

What'd you miss? On Thursday, Hamilton and In the Heights creator Lin-Manuel Miranda spoke at the Kennedy School at the America Adelante conference for Latinx individuals. Needless to say, he blew us all away.

Harvard may be home to several yacht owners, but real royalty, like the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is still a sight on campus.

 
This week, Fifteen Minutes magazine caught up with Ben M. Abercrombie '21, whose shock accident in his very first college football game for Harvard left him paralyzed. 

THUD's spring show, aptly named THUDlash, hosted actors Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons of the Oscar-winning movie—you guessed it—Whiplash, among other special guests.


The Classroom to Table program has had to scale back recently, so think twice about taking out that professor you've never paid attention to just for the free food.
