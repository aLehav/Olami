After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We have statues to pee on,” says one of the characters, a Harvard student, while encouraging another to hurry up in “Little to Do with Anything.” Kirkland Drama Society’s newest production—its annual, very loose adaptation of a Shakespeare farce—is a version of “Much Ado About Nothing,” relocated to Cape Cod and set a week before graduation. The somewhat raunchy play features characters whose names and plot lines resemble those found in “Much Ado About Nothing” but whose unifying circumstance is the looming prospect of graduation from Harvard.
One of the authors of the script, William L. Ezekowitz ’17, talked about the inspiration behind the reimagined story. “Harvard students have an expectation of having it all figured out by the time you graduate,” he said. “I always thought, especially when I was a freshman, that as I progressed and got older, I would just learn and everything would make sense by the time I got to graduation.” The play examines the anxieties seniors experience in their last months as college students and jocularly comments on a number of tropes regarding the employment of Harvard graduates, ranging from investment banking to Teach for America. “I think that we tried to make the statement that things never really start to make sense,” Ezekowitz said.
Despite its title, “Little to Do with Anything” retains the spirit of the original play through witty exchanges between characters such as Benedick, renamed Ben in Kirkland Dramatic Society’s production, and Beatrice, who are also a former couple in the adaptation. “You go first, just like when we were in a relationship,” Beatrice says in one such dialogue.
On the other hand, the modernity and specificity of the setting also seems to alter the plot. Although the “nothing” in the original’s title did once rhyme with “noting,” meaning gossip, the intrigue in the adaptation is achieved through the use of fake Tinder profiles. Additionally, the emphasis on coupling up in Shakespeare’s original is removed in favour of the confusion experienced by the characters in their final days of college. Claudio’s and Hero’s careers in investment banking seem incompatible with seeing each other further. “I googled ‘i-banking,’ says Claudio, the handsome not too bright lacrosse player. “Yeah, I won’t have free time,” he realizes.
The outcome of the presidential election affected the play as well. “All of us saw the opportunity to use it as a way to get out some feelings and have some cathartic relief through comedy,” said Stefan Rajkovic ’17, who plays Pedro, Ben’s blockmate. Ben at one point proclaims, “I just wanted something to hold on to… like Michigan.” Audience member and Kirkland House resident Audrey Chen ’18, commented on the play’s treatment of the news on Nov. 8. “It’s a good way to just relax and to treat things in a more casual and light-hearted way,” she said.
The audience for the play’s premiere consisted mostly of Kirkland residents, and the play included many inside jokes referencing things such as the underground list. The script also included some inter-house rivalry. Combining a reference to the election with disparagement of one of Kirkland’s neighbors, one character described Winthrop as “the building equivalent of last Tuesday night.” Rajkovic described Kirkland Dramatic Society as a positive and unique aspect of Kirkand’s house life. “You can get involved and have another community in the house. It’s a lot of fun,” he said. The enthusiastic response of the audience at the end of the play suggested that they found watching the results of Kirkland Dramatic Society’s efforts equally enjoyable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just under 15 minutes to go in the second half, Holy Cross was running away with the game.
Up 44-30, senior co-captain Siyani Chambers looked for an outlet pass that was intercepted by Crusaders’ sophomore guard Patrick Benzan, who takes it away for an uncontested layup. It’s 46-30.
Harvard gets the ball back, but this time it’s junior forward Chris Egi who coughs up the ball. Holy Cross has to work a little bit harder for its next basket following the turnover, passing it once or twice before launching and making an open three.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called a timeout to try and stop the bleeding. His team ended the half within striking distance down eight points, but had cut the lead to five off of a trey from sophomore guard Corey Johnson. With a timeout, he could talk to his younger players, quell the Crusader momentum, and quiet the fans decked out in purple who had reclaimed the Crimson’s home court advantage.
When play resumed, though, things didn’t go as Amaker had written them up in the huddle. Instead, Chambers received the inbound pass. He looked to his left for sophomore guard Tommy McCarthy and dished a quick chest pass. The only problem was McCarthy was no longer standing where Chambers intended the pass, and the ball sailed out of bounds without a Crimson player within a foot of it.
This trio of turnovers followed by baskets was exemplary of the entire night for Harvard (1-2) as it fell to the Crusaders (1-3), 63-52.
“It’s just as simple as we have to communicate,” Chambers said. “Loud, early, making sure we’re listening. Listening is a big part of what broke down on some easy buckets today and that’s something that we have to work on in practice so that in games we can stop guys from getting easy baskets.”
Eventually, the Crimson would calm down and reign in the Holy Cross run. It just took until the under-four media timeout, where Amaker told his players to stop looking at the scoreboard and work on inching their way back. Johnson and freshman guard Seth Towns took this to heart, hitting four threes in the final five minutes to cut the 19 point lead to 11 and end the night as Harvard’s top two scorers.
While Johnson and Towns got hot to end the game, the proportion of scoring that came from the two wings was exemplary of the Crimson’s inability to create an inside game. Though freshman forward Henry Welsh had a quietly consistent night with eight points and nine rebounds, many of Harvard’s turnovers came from an inability to get the ball into the paint, a problem Amaker designated a result of the team’s tentativeness to go after fifty-fifty balls.
“We’re not very confident of getting the ball in there with our guys being able to score and finish,” Amaker said. “Our guy who was supposed to do that was Zena [Edosomwan] and when he was in there, it has it down as one attempt, but it got knocked from him before he could make an attempt. Chris Lewis, he has a tip in he can’t finish, a dunk that he rims it and misses the two free throws. When we get opportunities, we aren’t taking advantage of them. That at times can be very deflating.”
Harvard was also without two of its point guards—freshmen Bryce Aiken and Christian Juzang—who were both out with injuries described as “day-to-day”. Aiken is one of the team’s strongest ball handlers and left a gap in the lineup of strong dribblers who could escape the Crusaders’ zone pressure.
While Holy Cross presented a defense Harvard couldn’t break, they also were able to find open shots with seeming ease. In the first half, it was Crusader forward Malachi Alexander. With the Crimson up 16-13 with just over ten minutes to go in the first half, Towns was tasked with guarding Alexander after entering the game from the bench. On Towns’ very first defensive possession, Alexander cut behind him and had an open lane for a dunk. Just over a minute later, Holy Cross ran almost the same play, resulting in another Alexander open layup.
“[Tonight showed] one, how challenging it’s going to be every night for us no matter who we play. It’s Division I college basketball,” Amaker said. “Two it’s going against Harvard, given what we have been able to achieve and it’s become a pretty big game for everybody that we play…. you can’t wait until game time to realize that’s what it’s going to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 23, 2016, at 3:30 p.m.
BOSTON — Hockey games between Harvard and Boston University never seem to disappoint.
In the neighboring rivals' first meeting since their back-and-forth battle at the Bright which featured 11 lamp-lightings back in January, the two offenses were rocking and rolling early on Tuesday, combining for six goals in the first 25 minutes of play.
But when the dust settled at Agganis Arena, only one team managed to find the back of the net in the game’s final stanza. Riding a pair of third-period tallies, No. 7 Boston University staved off No. 9 Harvard (5-2-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) to pick up its seventh win of the season—a 5-3 victory over the visitors from Cambridge.
Breaking a 3-3 stalemate approaching 20 minutes in length, third-line senior Nick Roberto lifted the Terriers (7-4-1, 2-1-1 Hockey East) to victory upon discovering that the bank was open on Tuesday night. A little more than three minutes into the third, the senior threw a shot off of junior goaltender Merrick Madsen and in from behind the net, giving BU a 4-3 edge that it would not relinquish.
The game-winner almost never happened, however, given that it came on the heels of a Terrier power play that the Crimson had successfully staved off. But after Harvard gained possession of the puck in its own zone, senior Tyler Moy had his pocket picked by Roberto, who later got in position to net the difference-maker.
“When we were in trouble, we didn’t make it easy on ourselves and make a couple clears,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[We] kind of extended some shifts for them… [and] it led to us trapping ourselves in the zone.”
The Crimson struggled to generate enough offense in the final frame—six shots on goal in the first 15 minutes of the period—to come up with an equalizer. Freshman center Patrick Curry sealed the deal with 1:30 remaining in regulation, taking the baton from sophomore Bobo Carpenter following the second-year’s run up the right wing, then beating Madsen with a point-blank wrister.
“That’s a big win for us,” BU coach David Quinn said. “That’s an NCAA implication win. When you win a nonconference game against a team like that... that’s going to mean a lot in March.”
Before the Terriers took control in the final frame, no lead had lasted more than four minutes. And on two separate occasions, neither team could hold an advantage for more than 30 seconds.
With the score even at one in the final minute of the first period, BU had a chance to break the game open with a 5-on-3 lasting for 1:41. Yet, Harvard was the one to make some noise.
Picking the pocket of freshman Kieffer Bellows on the Terrier 5-on-3, co-captain Alexander Kerfoot broke free towards netminder Connor LaCouvee from his own blue line, and beat the junior high glove-side to put the Crimson in front with 41 seconds remaining in the period.
But when play resumed, there was no changing the fact there were two extra Terriers on the ice. Seconds after the first infraction expired, associate captain Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson hit rookie Patrick Harper with a back-door feed that the freshman easily knocked home, 23 seconds removed from Kerfoot’s go-ahead score.
History repeated itself early in the second period—only this time, the hosts were first to serve. Five seconds into BU’s first power play of the frame, freshman Dante Fabbro put the puck in the net for the second time of the night—this time benefitting his own side. Fabbro’s blast from atop the left faceoff circle beat the glove of Madsen, who had 6’5” Jordan Greenway standing right in front of him, to put the Terriers in front, 3-2.
But having read through the script, senior Sean Malone tied things up within 20 seconds. One period after scoring Harvard’s first goal thanks to a bit of luck—his shot from the right dot ricocheted off the left skate of Fabbro and into the BU net—Malone fired a shot past LaCouvee from the right faceoff circle for his second tally of the night, a 3-3 equalizer.
Ultimately, however, as Donato said after the game, the Terriers won both the special teams and goaltending battles. BU, who entered Tuesday ranked 45th out of 60 Division I teams on the power play, finished 2-for-5 on the man-up, not including Roberto’s winner which came moments after the Crimson’s penultimate penalty expired. Meanwhile, Madsen surrendered a season-high five goals on 31 shots in the loss.
While Tuesday certainly wasn’t the Harvard defense’s night, Quinn said after the game that he felt the Crimson’s blue-line was much improved compared to last year. Consequently, Quinn went on to say he feels Harvard has a real chance to become a threat down the stretch.
“They’re a very good team,” Quinn said. “That’s a team that could win a national title. You talk about teams that have a chance to win it, Harvard’s one of them."

GAME NOTES:
—Down a goal, Harvard suffered a self-inflicted wound with 4:56 remaining in regulation when called for a too many men on the ice penalty. The Crimson did generate the only shot on goal over the span of the ensuing BU power play, but ultimately, the infraction left a Harvard team that had been struggling to generate offense late in the game with little time for a breakthrough. Donato was visibly heated with the officials when the call was made but far more collected afterwards.
“It was two lines that kind of ran into each other,” Donato said. “At that time in the game, guys are pretty intense, and I think [our guy] only got 15 feet off the bench, but it was enough. It was right in front of the ref. So that’s a tough one to swallow. Guys are working hard; it was just a mistake.”
—BU captain and Marblehead native Doyle Somerby nearly opened the scoring 5:54 into the game, as his blast from the left circle trickled over the goal line. But the officials ruled no goal, claiming that Madsen was interfered with by BU’s Gabriel Chabot—a fortunate break for the Crimson given a minimal amount of contact.
—Sophomore defenseman Adam Baughman returned to the ice for the first time since Harvard’s season opener against Arizona State on Oct. 28. Sophomore Jacob Olson, who entered the lineup in Baughman’s absence, remained on the second pairing alongside freshman Adam Fox where he’s been for seven games, while Baughman took sophomore Viktor Dombrovskiy’s spot on pairing three.
—The Crimson finished 0-for-3 on the power play against a strong BU kill which ranks sixth in the country (90.7 percent).
—Harvard narrowly edged out the Terriers in the shots on goal department, 32-31; but BU did the same in terms of attempts, winning that battle, 57-56.

With Thanksgiving literally just around the corner, you would think that turkeys across the nation would have taken the hint that now is the time to get out of dodge. But rather than adhere to the popular Thanksgiving tune “the turkey ran away, before Thanksgiving day, for we should make a meal of him if he should stay,” the Harvard turkeys are strutting across campus in a final effort to demonstrate their deserved place as the campus mascot rather than a holiday meal. Gaggles of turkeys, often pecking around in the grass, are common occurrences these days, both in the Square and in the Quad. You can imagine our surprise when we woke up one morning to reports of turkeys in the quad—the poor things had to get out there without the help of the shuttle! Troopers, they are.
Though Currier house residents enjoy the turkeys, the house has given them a stern reminder: a bright orange sign at the entrance reads, underlined, “do not let in the turkey.”
“There’s a little part of me that wants to do it,” confessed Sophie Westbrook ‘19, a Currier House resident who just wants to see the world drown in turkey feathers.
Currier residents are now engaged in the cultured pastime of turkey watching, providing a welcome distraction from midterm cramming and the recent Harvard-Yale loss.
“They’re right next to our reading room, and they’re not that interesting, but they’re more interesting than everyone’s work,” Westbrook said. “People just sit around and watch them.”
Students are taking the art of turkey watching very seriously, carefully observing their movements and tendencies. “Turkeys— they’re big, they stalk around, they’re scaly, they have intelligent, alien eyes,” Zeke Benshirim ‘19 reported. “They’re like small dinosaurs,” added Ana Karla Cepeda Diaz ‘19.
Turkey sightings are also a welcome reprieve from city life, Benshirim said. “I’m from the countryside— I like seeing wildlife.”
The Harvard turkeys really have pulled out all of the stops to get students in the mood for Thanksgiving. There is only one logical way that you can show your gratitude for the thoughtful visits that the turkeys have graced us with over the past few weeks— this Thanksgiving, “eat mor chikin.”
