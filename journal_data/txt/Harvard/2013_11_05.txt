After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After his introduction at the Harvard Book Store on Wednesday night, author Will Self strolled slowly up to the podium and bent his 6’5’’ frame over to fiddle with the height adjuster knob on the microphone stand. Immediately, a worker at the store came to assist him, but Self waved her off, uttering his first words of the night, “No, no, I’ve got it…. There’s always a problem with the height disparity,” in a caustic, bass-baritone drawl. Once the stand had been adjusted, Self paused momentarily before mumbling, “What am I going to say… I don’t really know.” He teased the audience with this initial verbal clumsiness—his extensive vocabulary and flamboyant articulateness are well-known.
Soon enough he began to discuss his 2012 novel “Umbrella,” which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in the U.K. last year. Self opened with a comparison between the surname of his protagonist, Audrey Death, and his own, suggesting that each carried a certain “resonance” and slowly revealing, through the likening, the autobiographical elements of the Edwardian Death family he presents in “Umbrella.” The measured drama and poeticism of Self’s commentary underscored the intricate thought process that led to “Umbrella,” a complex familial quilt of historical wit and wisdom.
The novel, which is set dually in turn-of-the-century London and a mental hospital some 70 years later, traces Audrey’s contraction of encephalitis lethargica, a brain disease that affected thousands of people in the wake of the Spanish Influenza of 1918. Self was inspired by Oliver Sacks’s “Awakenings,” a memoir of the doctor’s usage of a new drug to rouse a victim from a coma brought on by the illness, which, in lesser cases, often made simple gestures take hours before sudden swings of manic physical activity. The disease compelled Self because of its ability to make the human body appear “machine-like,” which, in his opinion, mimicked the mechanization of society that occurred during the years Audrey lay in her coma.
Yet despite all of the historical and scientific allusions in “Umbrella,” Self spent most of his introduction discussing writing form. He was influenced in writing the book, he said, by high modernism, including authors like George Eliot, James Joyce, and William Faulkner. In “Umbrella,” he said he included many go-to elements of the movement, including use of the continuous present and stream-of-consciousness, to tell Audrey’s story. He made clear that he takes the style with a grain of salt, however, offering several novel augmentations and framings of its devices. In a contemporary example, Self laid out his concept of his proximate authorial relationship to Audrey as similar to floating behind the head “of an avatar in some kind of computer game.”
The scene that he read had a simple plot: In 1903, 14-year-old Audrey and her father, the arrogant garage manager Samuel Death, who also appears to be mixed up in some seedy dealings, walk from Charing Cross station to a book shop. Once there, the elder Death discusses a financial agreement with an Arab bookseller and eventually exiles Audrey to a café. After finishing her repast, she returns to stumble upon an odd and ambiguous sexual scene involving her father and a young woman back at the bookseller. Even with the nebulousness of Samuel Death’s encounters, the scene is still remarkably straightforward: the dialogue is sparse, the walk and Audrey’s meal are both brief, and the sexual encounter is only momentarily alluded to. The structure of the scene is filled in with lush and unconventional lines, such as one describing Audrey’s clutching of a nickel: “Metal discs replaced her knuckles.” His writing forms a full sensory experience of London alongside sudden glimpses into Audrey’s mind.
Self read the passage with theatrical verve, dropping into Cockney accent at a moment’s notice, giving each character a fully-formed and entirely differentiated voice, and never once stumbling over a word or breaking the spell of his oration. One of the first questions after the reading concluded was from an awestruck man who said he had “never heard an author read so well” and asked if Self had undergone formal training. Self responded that he had done several of his own audiobooks and questioned the point of public readings if they weren’t theatrically compelling. This question-and-answer portion of the event offered Self a chance to diverse knowledge. He offered insight on “quixotic American and British foreign policy,” the elasticity of time, and the necessity of opera. When asked about his 1990s adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” he asserted that the source was “not well-written,” before backtracking, after a sly pause, and clarifying that, “I’m not suggesting for a minute that I’m a better prose writer than Wilde… I’m asserting it as fact.” Given the richness of Self’s excerpt and the riveting way with which he conveyed his ideas on the spot, his claim may be rooted more in fact than fiction.

Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Little Women”—which will play until Saturday at Farkas Hall—is a frolicking voyage back to the 1860s. A musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel tells the tale of four sisters—Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy March—and their mother as they try to keep their heads above water in a fatherless household during the Civil War. In this production, directed by Alexandra M. Kiley ’15, the actors do an admirable job in bringing out the essence of Alcott’s characters, though at times the staging decisions detract from some of the critical scenes in the play.
Jo (Taylor K. Phillips ’15), the protagonist, has a sharp tongue and is an outspoken feminist at a time when women were meant to be seen but not heard. That mindset doesn’t do her much good during the 19th century. However, had Jo been born within the last hundred years, she would have been flexing her bicep right next to “Rosie the Riveter.” Phillips captures the fiery and pugnacious spirit of Jo as she pours fervor into both voice and movement, even spitting on her hand before a firm handshake with her best friend Laurie (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15). Venook played an exuberant Laurie, whose delightful tap number and his unconditional kindness make a perfect counterbalance to Jo’s tantrums and obstinance.
The other supporting actors portray their characters with equal faithfulness to the original novel; Olivia R. Miller ’16, who plays Beth March, has a sweet smile and the singing voice of a siren. Miller makes her character’s imminent fate sad for more than just the tragedy of her death—the loss of Miller onstage is lamentable in itself, as she is one of the highlights of the show. Meg’s husband John Brooke, played by Geoffrey G. Binney III ’17, is a gentle soul and a romantic. Binney makes his character’s insecurities and timidity credible. The kiss he and Meg share is sincere and adorable, thanks to the onstage chemistry between Binney and Tess V. Davison ’16, who plays Meg.
Even despite her relatively minor role, the crotchety Aunt March, played by Rachel A. Orol ’15 makes a lasting impression. Orol is delightful comic relief and has as much range in her singing voice as she does in her facial expressions. From her quick wit to her fittingly pretentious accent, Orol almost steals the show.
The work of the creative team allowed the characters to come across quite clearly, and their creative choices deserves accolades. The orchestra, directed by Isaac L. Alter ’16, blends in with each song seamlessly, and the costumes are detailed down to every last salt and pepper streak on Aunt March’s head.
However, the script underplays one of the most critical moments of the Alcott’s novel: when Amy burns Jo’s story. In the book, Jo pours her heart and soul into her writing for a very long time, and for Amy to burn Jo’s most prized possession is unthinkable. The text of the script doesn’t do justice to one of the most pivotal moments in the book. Amy merely rips up a couple of sheets of paper—surely not a significant enough prop to reflect Jo’s hard work—and tosses them in the fire with minimal context. Minutes later, seemingly without any prior knowledge of the deed, Jo unnaturally reaches into the fireplace and pulls out the papers. Jo then has to explain indirectly to the audience what she is holding in her hands by yelling at Amy, “I worked on this story day and night!” The emotional weight of the scene is lost in this reductive comment, an unfortunate injustice considering the poignancy of the moment between the two sisters in the book.
The blocking in this scene also diminishes the importance of the event—when Jo forgives Amy for burning her manuscript, her back is turned towards the front of the stage. Jo could have been frowning, smiling, or snarling—it was all the same to the audience because her face was completely obscured. However, this is only a minor quibble among the many good qualities of the play.
Overall, the production did a fantastic job of bringing to life the beloved characters that have been revered for the century and a half. Jo is still the feisty feminist that Alcott depicted, Amy is the spoiled angel, and the charming dynamic of the March family revives Alcott’s central theme of the importance of love and integrity in the face of hardship.

“Man of Tai Chi,” Keanu Reeves’s directorial debut, is not a great movie. It is, however, exactly the sort of movie that one would expect Keanu Reeves to direct and in which to cast himself, and so it attains a sort of perfection of its own. It is difficult to think that, as an artist, Reeves, the rear half of the unforgettably dumb “Bill and Ted” duo, would ever have anything that one could call a “mature style,” but in the future field of Reeves criticism, it is this term that his worshippers will use to describe “Man of Tai Chi.” This work, a martial-arts movie bildungsroman, is the crowning achievement of his career to date, in which the goofy line delivery, self-serious stares, over-the-top action sequences, and incongruously good incidental music is synthesized into a coherent and surprisingly compelling whole. As said, this is not great cinema, but it is the ultimate Keanu experience.
 Chen Lin-hu (Tiger Hu Chen) is a hapless deliveryman during the week, but on the weekends he competes in martial arts tournaments as the youngest in a long line of tai chi masters. Donaka Mark, a security services mogul played by the god Reeves himself, sees greatness in him and coerces him into joining his mysterious underground fighting ring. It is necessary to point out that only Keanu Reeves would have the unpolluted rashness to make a serious, apparently unironic film about what in the West is generally considered an old folks’ exercise routine and then to turn it into a conspiracy thriller. The truly shocking part in all this glorious kitsch is that it makes for a completely absorbing film—because, in a move that belies his utterly, incomprehensibly dopey exterior, Reeves has chosen a genre that plays to his strengths and diminishes his weaknesses.
Martial arts movies are the domain of lines that would be hopelessly ludicrous in other films, lines such as “He has it in him” and “He used a soft style in a hard way”—lines that are perfectly attuned to Reeves’ bizarre intonation and habit of pausing at inappropriate intervals. Martial arts movies work in a formal space where evil stares, angst-filled screams, and perfectly pure maidens are taken as real and serious types, just like the murderous uncles and lyric lamentations in the formal space of Greek tragedy. While there is a conscious acknowledgment of the artificiality of this universe, it is accepted in its premises, and writers and directors do not have to spend time dwelling on it before moving on to the issues that they really want to explore—which is to say, they are given a basic set of tools to work with that the audience will not question. And this universe happily coincides with the one in which Keanu Reeves appears to live and work.
Independent of the formal strengths of the content of “Man of Tai Chi,” it also has some points of excellence as a film. The soundtrack is a remarkably enjoyable mix of house and hard rock bass lines that perfectly complement the action. The cinematography, under director of photography Eliot Davis, never interferes with the film’s efficacy, and some of it is legitimately gorgeous. Particularly notable is an extraordinary sequence that is set in Donaka’s opulent, color-saturated private club and culminates in a brilliantly executed fight scene under a strobe light. The sets, alternating between urban Beijing and secluded mountaintops, are well balanced and rendered with an almost painterly technique.
In short, with “Man of Tai Chi,” Keanu Reeves has come into his own. He has actually created a solid piece of cinema with some inherent artistic merit—not what one would expect from the ignominious Ted—if not quite something that can go toe-to-toe with “8½.” More interestingly, he has with some self-awareness created a work that is perfectly suited to his own qualities. In other words, Keanu Reeves has grown up, and the fruits of his maturation are indeed most excellent.

“I don’t have a pyin,” she says.
“That’s alright—use mine,” he replies. And he hands her a pen from behind his ear.
“No—this is a Visa gift card,” she explains. “I can’t use debit because I don’t have a PIN. How do I do credit?”

 
The cashier’s eyes will light up with clarity. He’s recently arrived here from Arkansas; another one among the ceaseless swarms come Gone To Texas since 1840. He might go on to tell his customer, “Well that’s fascinating; I read recently that one of the most recognizable traits of the Southern dialect is that there’s no phonic distinction between the words ‘pin’ and ‘pen.’” He could say that, but the woman buying acrylic paint and Styrofoam at his register might just wanna gitalong with her day. This kid is from out of state and still trying to find his way among the cowboys. He hasn’t even yet caught on to the right word for “soda.” Why, to call it “pop” is an infallible sign that the speaker has no hold on reality.
 
It’s my turn in line. We look eye-to-eye and make idle talk. He gives me my change and I mosey along, inspecting the pennies out of habit. Lately I’m keen on collecting old coins because they’re one of the few everyday items that advertise their age. A dirty denim dollar does the same thing, but I’m a bit too cheap to hoard those. Pennies are so common that it ain’t nearly no one who will notice them out of circulation, so I’m free to keep and invent little journeys for today’s fine democratic soldier in my palm. This one here is stamped 1976 in Philadelphia. The U.S. Mint estimates that these coins last thirty years—what a warrior this one is! Where are your comrades? Were they pulverized into dust; neglected in a sewer? Swallowed by a child, to perish with the proletariat?
 
This interest began last year at end of term. I stood in a stripped suite making final inventory of the semester. I dumped my cup of coins onto the desk, admiring the bright cupreous noise of the pre-1983 pennies (since then they’re all copper-plated zinc; no sparkle to their spatter). I arranged them chronologically and found our peculiarsome Abe present for every year in the past five decades—except for 1965. Nor is it anywhere to be found in any transaction for the next month. What gives? Is there a conspiracy to eliminate this year from the nation’s history? What happened in 1965?
 
Many things happened. The Gateway Arch was completed in St. Louis. LBJ debuted the Great Society. Saul Bellow won the National Book Award for “Herzog.” I finally meet the elusive coin at a café in Berkeley during the summer—but where else to find the ’60s? President Lincoln smirks in profile, evidently etched into the same gaunt clay that he inhaled as a twenty-something working the land in Kentucky. I dash back across the Bay to a rendezvous in the Lower Haight, not half a mile from the San Francisco Mint. My remaining time living and working for a spell in Northern California seems charmed by that lucky coin.
 
Bellow’s moody philosophical character, Moses Herzog, thinks about the high-minded topics. He calls the soul an amphibian: “it lives in more elements than I will ever know; and I assume that in those remote stars, matter is in the making which will create stranger beings yet.” At home, deep in the heart of Texas, it’s well understood that the stars at night are big and bright. They make me wonder a bit too often if we’re really so different from the earth-substance that goes into those pennies. My heart may or may not be in San Francisco, but my soul is certainly in many places.
 
My soul is partly there at the end of a narrow spiral staircase in the back corner of the House library, aching over a paper on John Donne. In “A Valediction of Weeping” he writes:
 
 Let me pour forth
 My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,
 For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,
 And by this mintage they are something worth
 
Pennies may be worthless on their own, especially in the machine of the economy. Alone they are no more special than something as coarse and quotidian as tears. We give things value by wedding them to our experience: with our words, our sighs, our stories. The French philosopher Alain Badiou explains (recently, in a fun video series!) that money has personal value only in the implied access it gives us to our various desires. He says that the limits of these desires are in turn related to the limits of our language. Among pens and pins and pennies, expanding our world is only about looking in the right places. On the tips of our tongues; in the palms of our hands. Quaerendo invenietis, so look sharp!

Some people are still arguing over whether “indie” constitutes a real genre on its own, but for the sake of clarity, K-indie can be understood as an umbrella term for certain subculture music genres of South Korea—whether hip-hop, R&B, alternative rock, or another genre in nature. K-indie music is produced by artists who work independent of the major producers and entertainment corporations on the scene in Seoul, such as the “Big 3” companies: SM, YG, and JYP Entertainment. Admittedly, some of these artists attain fame or popularity on par with artists from these three major labels, as evidenced by indie rock band Busker Busker and their takeover of the Korean music charts—the Gaon, MelOn, Bugs, and Mnet charts just to name a few—with the release of their sophomore album in September. However, indie groups are often unknown by outside audiences. Here are some underrated K-indie artists worth exploring, especially those who offer a break from the upbeat, flashier K-pop tunes that are constantly churned out.
 
Jazzyfact (Beenzino & Shimmy Twice)
Jazzyfact is the brainchild of two artists, underground rapper Beenzino (임성빈)—of Illest Konfusion and Illionaire Records—and music producer Shimmy Twice, who met in New Zealand during their high school nearly 10 years ago. Though he is not represented by a major record label, Beenzino has garnered a deep following among hip-hop fans as well as the respect of many of Korea’s popular artists, resulting in many features, such as with hip-hop groups Epik High and Dynamic Duo among others. Jazzyfact stay true to Beenzino’s hip-hop roots, but mixed with the creative genius of producer Shimmy Twice, their music is refreshing and incorporates elements of jazz (as the name suggests). Check out the track “Always Awake.”
 
 
Busker Busker (버스커 버스커)
This group took second place on the third season of “Superstar K,” a survivor audition program much like American Idol, hosted by Mnet and CJ E&M each summer. Made up of two native Korean singers and guitarists and an American drummer native to Ohio, the group became unlikely regulars to the music scene after vocally rejecting the K-pop “formula”—refusing to sign infamous 10-year-long contracts, declining training with a major record label, and never accepting cosmetic surgery. Their raw talent shines in their music, which combines a soft rock vibe with husky vocals. Check out the track “벚꽃 엔딩 (Cherry Blossom Ending).”
 
Clazziquai (클래지콰이)
Also known as the Clazziquai Project, this band experiments with multiple genres—electronica, jazz, and house—to achieve its unique sound. Clazziquai unofficially debuted in 2001 through leaking their music online, and with much positive reception, they were able to record their first album in the underground scene three years later. Their music has since been widely used for movie and television series OSTs as well as in commercials, and they have collaborated with Japanese artists as well, such as M-Flo. Their music spans a wide range of sounds, but is often characterized by calm and sweet hooks, which may explain why Clazziquai’s music often features in romantic-comedy television series. Check out the track “Blessed.”
 
Fromm (프롬)
Perhaps the least known on this list but surely not the least talented, female singer-songwriter Fromm recently released her first album “Arrival” last month. The record is described as a portrayal of trivial daily routines through unconventional melodies. She is supported by Mirrorball Music, a channel dedicated to publicizing up-and-coming Korean indie music artists. Her indie rock sound is refreshingly light and soulful. Her arrangements are exquisite and intricate, yet pleasant and easy on the ear. Check out the song “Arrival.”
 
Verbal Jint (버벌 진트)
Another influential rapper who started and helped shape the underground hip-hop/rap scene in South Korea for nearly a decade, Verbal Jint hit mainstream fame even though he did not start his career through a major record label. A member of hip-hop crew SNP, Verbal Jint cites 2Pac as a major influence. His songs “Good Morning” and “충분히 예뻐 (You Deserve Better)” climbed their way up to the Top 10 on Korea’s major music charts in the summer of 2012, which helped solidify his hold on the hip-hop scene, and now he is a DJ for the radio station KBS 2FM.

Have you heard Drake’s “Girls Love Beyonce?” Well, you should. In addition to being an underrated gem, it is also one of the most clever uses of sampling I have ever heard. While you’re at it, you should listen to summer hit “Blurred Lines”…then listen to some Marvin Gaye, the legend whom Robin Thicke and Pharrell allegedly copied. But wait! If you want to be an educated listener, maybe turn on some Afrojack or Tiësto—after all, DJs are just the logical extension of the first examples. Even the musical styles that electronica producers are involved with has expanded dramatically; the trend used to stay away from genres like country, even as it infected hip-hop, pop, and even rock. But now Avicii (along with Aloe Blacc and Mike Einzigger) has broken even that trend with the country-influenced “Wake Me Up,” a song that has rocketed him back to the top of U.S. charts. Though by no means is sampling a new phenomenon—“Ice Ice Baby” samples “Under Pressure,” “All Summer Long” lifts directly from “Sweet Home Alabama,” and Kanye used Ray Charles’s “I Got a Woman” for “Gold Digger” (for some better-known examples)—the practice has recently grown from a tool in an artist’s acoustic workbox to the foundation from which an artist builds.
The direction of influence has changed; instead of Britney Spears’s nameless producer working as only a step in the process of creating an album, David Guetta (a producer) is asking Nicki Minaj to be a guest artist on a song on his album. Even the terminology has changed—the producers of tracks are increasingly known as the “artists.” Though the music community has always respected and valued their skills, DJs are now frequently making the Top 40, giving their names unprecedented recognition under their own brands. One of the main exceptions was long-popular DJ duo Daft Punk, but as the rest of the industry rockets towards a more electronic sound, Daft Punk has gravitated away from sampling in their latest album “Random Access Memories.” Their earlier albums used samples on almost every song, and their new break from that style seems to be a deliberate artistic choice not to ride the wave of the ever popular genre.
Along with the rise in the use of electronic music techniques in popular music, electronic music itself has seen an explosion of growth. Electronic music has been around for decades, but the subgenre electronic dance music has recently errupted with popularity. Though a huge amount of EDM music can be found for free online, part of the reason this music has become so prevalent is because it is nevertheless in the best interest of those who market it—the music business is profiting from it, though not in traditional ways. Touring is extraordinarily lucrative, and remixes mean that the same song can be used over and over. With the rise of festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas and Electric Zoo in New York, in addition to newly popular electric stages at more established festivals like Lollapalooza, the music industry has found a new way to tap into the wallets of young listeners who are no longer buying records or CDs. Ironically enough, the same technologies that are bankrupting record companies are raking in money for other aspects of the business. The last time music festivals (as opposed to tours or performances of individual artists) were so much in demand, it seems, was the era of Woodstock.
But why has EDM become so popular? Only once before have we seen such a rise in the popularity of “producer” music, in the ’70s rise of disco, and today’s rise shares a very important similarity: we have had a drastic change in technology. Disco rose out of a combination of club life and the new technology that allowed for its signature synth sounds. This wave is not dissimilar: there has been a rise in the popularity of rave culture, and today’s quality of production equipment has leapt light-years forward with the introduction of computers and digital recording equipment. EDM has more sticking power, though, because today’s equipment is far more accessible.
Today’s barrier to entry of digital music production is shockingly low. Before home computing, a decent guitar would not have cost much monetarily, but becoming an adept musician required years of practice (and a certain amount of talent). More advanced music production was possible with a normal studio recording session, which would cost thousands of dollars and years of skill. Today, however, a laptop and a few hundred dollars of recording equipment and software lets a 16-year-old create a decent sounding remix overnight. Many of these artists are like you and me: though Skrillex played in a band before producing, 3LAU was studying finance at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.
Easy creation of music is a good thing. It allows a larger portion of the public to understand the process of creating the music they so enjoy, and it may even affect the way that they experience music when they listen to it. This is the generation of mashups and soundcloud, of YouTube and musical memes (see: the Harlem Shake). Though many still look on EDM (and the pop music it has influenced) as “dumb,” they’re missing the point—the music of the new generation is music of which everyone is a part.

Phil Solomon thinks contemporary movies are too clear-cut. In a lecture on the subject of his film, "American Falls," at the Carpenter Center on Thursday, Solomon suggested that filmmakers should strive to incorporate more abstract images in their works. Solomon himself is an expert in this realm; as an experimental filmmaker, he has built a reputation around the use of film emulsions and other chemical processes to add textures and nuances to many of his works. The film is a montage of fictional and non-fictional images representing pivotal moments of American history that have been chemically treated to create a unique visual effect. The images, which were originally an installation in the Corcoran Gallery, have since been turned into a film in which they overlap and fade into one another to create a rhythm and present a survey of history that is also a social commentary on the future of the country.
"American Falls" was commissioned by Paul Roth, senior curator and director of photography and media arts at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., who invited Solomon to tour the Corcoran after seeing one of his works at the New York Film Festival. Upon his initial visit to the gallery, Solomon was especially captivated by two works: Frederic E. Church’s famous painting, "Niagara," and Jennifer Steinkamp’s "Loop," a digital installation in the rotunda of the gallery with a seven-second loop pattern.
"With six projectors overlapping, expertly put in the architecture, Steinkamp’s work really transformed the place, and I became extremely interested in such multi-screen pieces," Solomon said in an interview with The Crimson. The war memorials in D.C. also had a big influence on Solomon. "The Korean War memorial thrilled me because of its photographic nature. It looked like my films—it had this kind of grainy texture from the rock," Solomon says. Solomon’s inspirational trip to the nation’s capital helped him craft a vision for "American Falls," a triptych installation.
As Solomon made clear in his presentation, the finished product is more than a simple patriotic survey of American history. Indeed, the chemical processing techniques that Solomon employs immediately offer a conflicted and sometimes criticizing reflection of our nation’s past and present. "Because it was a public work, I wanted to work with iconography. I tried to be as least ambiguous as I could in terms of picking the images," Solomon says. "However, I wanted to replenish, or redeem, or criticize the iconography in fresh ways. The chemical treatments serve this purpose. This film is not a neat montage. I want to say very direct things, but I also want to make it ambiguous and offer different readings," Solomon says.
Equally interesting in Solomon’s work is the choice of musical scores. His complex, chemically treated images are supplemented with conflicting sounds that are simultaneously soothing and threatening. Solomon attributes this inspiration for this complexity to the legendary Charles Ives, an American composer of the 20th century.
"Charles Ives was a significant influence in my work. He quotes popular tunes in his compositions, yet he transforms them in a way that reveals their underlying darkness. My work is very much the same," Solomon says. "On the surface, many may misread my piece as glorifying and patriotic, much like the initial impression some may have of Ives’s works. However, underneath the patriotism, there is this underlying dissonance."
Audience members were very receptive to Solomon’s work. Attendee Sophie Jacobs says, "I especially appreciated [Solomon’s] chemical treatments to enhance the images." Citing a series of images of the founding fathers, Jacobs says, "The chemical treatments made it look as if the founding fathers were on fire, almost invoking the wrath and fury of the Founding Fathers if they could see the state of our country today."
With the completion of "American Falls," Solomon hopes to produce a work on the subject of Stan Brakhage, a world-renowned experimental filmmaker. Brakhage was also a long-time colleague and friend of Solomon. "I collected over 150 hours of footage of our master classes, and it was a great privilege to experience that. Now, 10 years after his death, it weighs on me to do something," Solomon says. Solomon also hopes to do more work with video games including the Grand Theft Auto series. He remains unsure if chemical treatments will continue to be a big part of his future works. However, regardless of his future endeavors, it is clear that chemical tampering represents an integral component of the identity of his work, used in many of his pieces. Solomon says, "The chemistry allows for things to be not just the denotative—it allows for images to be connotative. This is expression."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
From acting in the play “The Aliens” at the Boston Center for the Arts, playwriting “Best Seller,” interning for “Porgy and Bess” at the American Repertory Theatre to directing “The Thing About Air Travel” earlier this year, to handling a full course load, Jacob A. Brandt ’14 has a packed schedule. A special concentrator studying “Drama: Theory and Practice” living in Quincy House, Brandt is a professional actor who has also been involved with all aspects of theater. He is currently cast as the title role in “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” a rock musical being performed at OBERON, the second stage of the American Repertory Theater. The show will debut Dec. 5.
The Harvard Crimson: It seems like you’ve been involved with all aspects of drama, from playwriting, interning, acting to directing. Is there a reason why you decided to experiment from all aspects, as opposed to narrowing into one?
Jacob A. Brandt: I usually consider myself an actor first, but I think that not only is it really helpful as an actor to try to experiment with many different facets of theater, it’s something that I enjoy doing so I figured, “why wouldn’t I not do something that I enjoy?”
THC: How do you think being involved in so many aspects of theater has helped you be a better actor?
JAB: I think that spending time in and around the theater is the best way to learn about theater. It is a very hands-on thing. You can read millions of essays and books about the theory of theater, but until you really get in there and start working on things, it’s really difficult to understand what the process of being a director, playwright, [or] actor entails. I think that each time I’ve entered a theater, whether it’s been as an intern, a director, an actor, I constantly find myself learning something new.
 
THC: What has your experience been like, being a full time student at Harvard but at the same time being a professional actor?
 
JAB: It’s been really great because I’ve been actually been able to study the things I’ve wanted to study.... Before I came to Harvard, I actually met with the Special Concentration Office to make sure that I would be able to study theater here. I wanted to come here, but I definitely wanted to study theater. The special concentrations [program] has been amazing. They’re very supportive in allowing people to study what they want, and that [theater] is definitely what I’ve wanted to study. It’s been awesome. My concentration mainly focuses on acting and playwriting, but I’ve also been able to do some directing. Being here but doing a special concentration has been able to open my horizons, and [it has] been able to let me do a ton of stuff.
 
THC: Is there a reason why you decided to come to Harvard as opposed to a conservatory?
JAB:  I almost went to a conservatory, but I wasn’t ready to give up academics. One of the most important things about making art is being well-rounded person, and being able to learn and take liberal arts classes is important to your art. I’m very happy that I’m here because I haven’t had to give up my academic work but it’s also helped my artistic endeavors.
THC: What are your plans after graduating?
JAB: I think I’m going to move to New York and see what happens. A lot of my friends who have been involved in theater who have wanted to pursue that are SAT tutors, so I’m going to try my hand at that while I figure out my career. But I know I want to be in New York next year and be working in theater.
THC: What would you recommend other students who want to pursue theater at a professional level at Harvard?
JAB: I would just say there’s no better way to learn about theater other than doing it. If you’re thinking about doing it, don’t think about it and just do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It takes 10-20 hours of work to produce 2-3 seconds of animation. For most people, that is an inconceivable amount of time for so small a product. In order to devote themselves fully to their art, many students who wish to create animation professionally choose to enroll in art schools. At Harvard, however, there is a small group of students who pursue animation via a track in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department, balancing their massively time-consuming craft with a liberal arts education.
Though the VES animation teaching staff is small and rotates regularly, VES Professor Ruth S. Lingford has been at Harvard since 2006 as the only permanent faculty member specializing in animation. “The idea of appointing me was to give the discipline of animation more stability, more long-term thinking,” she says.
According to Lingford, most students at Harvard come to animation as beginners and combine the practice with their other courses of study. However, she noted that there are a few students every year who are involved in animation seriously—this year, there are four animation-related theses, the highest number ever.
Before coming to Harvard, Lingford primarily worked with graduate students whose studies were focused on animation. She said that she is constantly impressed by her students’ ability to produce engaging finished work in a very short time, especially considering the typical Harvard student’s heavy courseload.
“The most exciting thing is when [students] realize the potential of animation to do other things, to connect with their passions,” Lingford says.
MOVING PICTURES
When he was 11, Zachary L. Wong ’16 started doing stop-motion animation with Legos. Since then, he has tried a variety of styles, combining both live-action and animation. One of his animations is about a homeless man who dreams of being an airplane pilot. 
“More of my recent stuff is very character-based,” Wong says. “I’m very interested in trying to portray things as realistically as possible. I don’t bring in too [many] fantastical elements.”
Creating even short pieces like Wong’s four-to-five minute clip about a homeless man, however, is so labor-intensive that it can be difficult to balance with school work. “Animation is such a tedious and time-consuming process,” Wong says. “During the school year, I usually write and set out the storyboard.” Wong then creates the actual animations during winter and summer break.
While some animators work off an already existing script, Wong fashions his own, generally thinking up the title first. “[The title] serves as the premise, and as soon as I have that, I start animating, and I kind of flesh out the story as I go along,” Wong says, “[It’s] very mercurial…very organic.”
The process of creating an animation also requires an understanding of the many different elements that go into a short clip. Much of Wong’s knowledge is informed by his childhood experimentation. Through stop-motion, Wong learned how to convey mass and gravity. Through painting and drawing, Wong learned how to become a good draftsman. All of these lessons, mixed with an understanding of movement and motion, gave Wong the tools he needs to create his works.
“Animators are the best filmmakers that are out there because on a day-to-day basis, they deal with movement,” Wong says. “If you reduce film to its basic elements, it’s just about capturing movements.”
STYLE AND SUBSTANCE
Pixar and and its parent company Disney are two of the most prominent studios in the field of animation. But while these companies typically produce three-dimensional, hand-drawn, and CGI animation, there are many forms of animation beyond the ones showcased by these studios.
Although she had never done animation before coming to Harvard, Stella Fiorenzoli ’15 always had an interest in art and drawing. After arriving on campus, she decided to enroll in Lingford’s freshman seminar “Animation—Getting Your Hands on Time” and loved both the class and the art of animation.
For one of her class projects, Fiorenzoli filmed herself walking around Harvard, then rendered herself as a cartoon. As she went along, everything she touched turned into a cartoon as well. The final product was a five-minute video of 15 frames per second. To make a video like this, Fiorenzoli used a technique called rotoscoping.
“[Rotoscoping is] where you take a live film and you trace things in the scene, then remove the image and all you’re left with is the drawing,” Fiorenzoli explains. “You can capture live movement with a drawing to make your animation realistic. I really loved it because it was magical. You just draw it and it comes to life.”
Another popular form of animation is claymation, a type of stop-motion animation. Artists sculpt their characters and convey movement by making slight changes in the position of the figure, taking pictures at each step. The images are then compiled into a video to make it look as though the character was actually moving.
According to Fiorenzoli, the technique is time-consuming, as the movements from frame to frame can be minute. “The difference has to be small enough for the motion to be fluid.”
TOOLS OF THE TRADE
Fred C. Hua ’14, one of the four students doing a thesis in animation this year, originally intended to concentrate in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology. After taking an animation course with Lingford the spring semester of his sophomore year, however, his passion for art swayed him to concentrate in VES and study animation. "I went in thinking, ‘Oh, I care about science’…[But] I'd rather have creative freedom," Hua says.
Hua describes the animation and filmmaking classes at the College as mainly theory-based. “It’s hard to improve on technical skill, but [the classes do] sensitize you to art, which is helpful and something I feel not everyone gets,” Hua says.
Over the summer, Hua worked at a company that required him to do 3D animation. Coming back to Harvard, however, he found that there weren’t many 3D animation resources available.
“[The department] currently has one dedicated 3D software, and that’s Autodesk Maya,” Hua says. “As for asking the department for software, it’s hard because there’s no one around to teach it. It’s kind of useless when you don’t have the interest or the push because many students are intimidated by 3D.”
However, students do feel that the VES Department does provide many useful resources. “We didn’t pay for anything, [the] studio was available 24/7, and [we were] given high-quality cameras to use on campus and rent out for the weekend,” Fiorenzoli says.
Oliver Luo ’13, who is currently in Prague learning puppet animation from Czech animators, agrees. In an email, Luo wrote, “[There are a] tremendous amount of resources,” referring to the funding from the department, the studio facilities housed in Sever, and the staff and faculty. “I think I was definitely spoiled with support from basically everyone.”
FROM HARVARD TO DISNEY
Hua’s perception of a disconnect between the animation classes Harvard offers and the skills needed in the real world is echoed by Susan L. Bin ’16, for who animation is much more than a hobby. Bin, who plans to concentrate in VES and study filmmaking, has been animating for years. Her experiences with art school have shaped her opinion about how Harvard’s approach the creative process, including animation, differs from that of traditional technical schools.
“Someone here comes at it with this very liberal arts point of view, like ‘Where does this fit into the way I educate myself?’” Bin says. “Whereas at the traditional technical schools, they’re like, ‘I can’t breathe without animation.’ Harvard kids tend to be less affected in that way, less emotionally involved.”
Bin, who hopes to one day work in a large commercial animation studio, has considered the difficulties of breaking into the industry from Harvard. “When it comes to the arts disciplines, having anything that says you’re from Harvard doesn’t impress anyone,” she says. “Harvard likes more fine arts and conceptual work, which is not at all what these companies look for.”
Although Bin has found the arts atmosphere frustrating at times, she notes that the differences between Harvard and the traditional art school are understandable because of Harvard’s liberal arts focus. “I kind of see Harvard as this weird break period for me, four years to do all this incredible stuff. And then I’ll return to what I really want to do.”
TIME FRAME
Animation itself is a taxing process. Added on top of schoolwork, it’s even harder. According to Luo, one of the greatest challenges of animating is time and timing. “You would want to have solid chunks of hours to set something up and just get all the way through with the shoot,” Luo wrote. “That becomes somewhat difficult when, you know, we are being college students at the same time.”
Luo identified an additional challenge in the fact that many studio VES classes are significantly longer than the usual one-and-a-half-hour or two-hour classes. Some VES studio classes can stretch to five hours per class.
“Once you’re lucky enough to have found an animation class that fits into your schedule, you’ll have to find whole afternoons or evenings where you can work without interruption,” Luo wrote.
Although it wasn’t easy to balance out animation and schoolwork, Luo was able to figure it out. “It’s sort of universally true that Harvard kids get themselves into way too many classes and extracurriculars,” Luo wrote. “So you just have to figure it all out either ahead of time or as you move along.”
DRAWING TOGETHER
Many of the students interviewed agreed that animation at Harvard is rather small and not necessarily well known. “It’s not particularly popular or hip, as it seems to me that people didn’t even know or expect that there’s animation at Harvard,” Luo wrote. “Aside from my classmates in my animation classes and the fellow thesis friends who have done animation, there wasn’t much of a community, mainly because there just weren’t that many of us.”
However, Luo feels that the few people in the animation scene were able to bond really well and that the small size translated into close bonds with professors and TFs. “In that sense, the community is really closely knit.”
However, some of Harvard’s animators feel estranged from the Harvard animation community. “There are a lot of people interested in film and some people that are curious about animation, [but] I haven’t met any animators, actually,” Wong says. “I wish there was a little bit more cohesive community of animators.”
Collaboration is particularly important to animation given the tedious, painstaking nature of creating the films. “Opportunities to collaborate [are] a huge thing,” Wong says. “That’s something that I think would be really nice.”
“SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING”
Though animation is time-consuming, tedious, and sometimes frustrating, it is the boundless sense of possibility that draws students in. “You could have a love story between a salt and pepper shaker…[You can] make everyday objects have a story,” Fiorenzoli says.
For Hua, much of the charm lies in the inevitable imperfections that accumulate. “In such a medium, you have to churn out frame by frame quickly. You end up making a lot of mistakes, and you’ll see that [in your animations], and it’s really beautiful,” Hua says. “Art is defined by its mistakes.”
Bin says she enjoys the storytelling element of animation. “You’re literally creating something out of nothing and then making it live. [Animation is] a business, but it’s a business out of making magic, which is what I find incredible.”
Luo agrees. “Animation has the power to really reach down into common human experiences and touch everyone, children and adult alike,” he wrote. “It is frankly pretty fantastic to imbue life into inanimate things the way animation can do. You labor for hours, and then at the end, magic happens.”

Black and white shots of storefronts and sidewalks played across the screen of the Carpenter Center’s viewing rooms as an older British man’s voice rang out, judgmentally branding Berlin as a new Sodom. “I would get to Berlin just as soon as I ever could and...I would stay there a long, long time,” said the younger protagonist. The interchange, from pioneering gay author Christopher Isherwood’s 1962 novel “Down There On a Visit,” set the stage for the short film, one of eight screening last Thursday. The production was, according to co-director Mercedes N. Flowers ’16, an examination of the state of affairs in the Nollendorfplatz,  a vibrant center of gay life in Berlin that was one of the earliest thriving LGBT centers in the modern Western world. Flowers and her fellow director J. Timberlake Shepherd, a student at New College of Florida, were part of a Harvard Summer School program that gave 15 students a hands-on intensive class on basic documentary theory and Berlin’s film history, then let them out into the city to find subjects worthy of their final project, a 10-minute documentary.
Eric Rentschler, the Arthur Kingsley Porter professor of Germanic languages and literatures at Harvard, partnered with Berlin-centered documentarian Stefan Majakowski to lead the course. The class centered on a film appreciation seminar, which featured films made in Berlin and made about Berlin. “Over the course of the semester the students watched about 25 feature films about Berlin spanning from 1895 to the present and came out with a sense of how Berlin had appeared and had been employed…they could see how the city was mapped,” Rentschler says.  Armed with their cultural knowledge, the students next received instruction from Majakowski about how to effectively film short subjects. According to Flowers, much of Majakowski’s teaching centered around avoiding cliché tropes of popular documentaries. “He was very outspoken about certain styles of documentary that he absolutely hated...like ‘ego docs,’ where one would say, ‘look at me, I’m in Nollendorfplatz! Look at me! Look at me!’,” Flowers says. She also commented on his disdain for documentaries minimally concerned with artistic flair, in which the viewer was simply informed about the location.
Rentschler, who lives in Berlin part-time and has spent much of his career studying the city (Flowers dubbed him the “King of Berlin”), helped students solidify their conceptual sketches for their planned films, using his web of knowledge and connections to direct the students to places where they were likely to find contacts. Rentschler oriented Flowers and Shepherd to the Nollendorplatz and got them in touch with the curator of the Schwules Museum, the world’s first gay museum. Afraid that they would end up making a boring film that amounted to little more than a walk-through of the collection, the duo searched the streets and haunts of the neighborhood for a more human perspective on Berlin’s gay culture.
“Initially there was an element of despair,” Flowers says. “We had to find a subject or individual who could adequately convey the culture and history of the city in a 10 minute film.” In search of a muse for their project, Flowers and Shepherd tracked down Martin, a DJ in the neighborhood who volunteered to administer testing and lead youth groups at a local community center. He gave an impressive tour of the area, coupling his commentary on the fun clubs and clothing stores with a deeper discourse on the often contradictory pressures of gay men to be muscled yet feminine and be sexually prolific but get good marks at university.
Shepherd and Flowers were not alone in their choice to profile an individual or small group as a means of showcasing larger cultural realities.  Renee E. Zhan '16 and Max R. McGillivray '16 examined the shift in German values over the last 30 years by interviewing a husband and wife artistic team who gained fame in the 1980s for creating brash artistic installations on the Berlin Wall. Sam S. Richman '15 and Emmet W. Stackelberg '14 created a polemic on urbanization—they  traced  the reactions of a small garden community in Neukölln to the news that their houses would be demolished to make way for a large highway. Other groups interviewed eccentric expatriates and seedy clubbers, using split screen, music, subtitles, montage, and historical footage to enhance their examinations.
When asked about the general themes of  the films, Rentschler commented on the tendency for character study. “Many of the films focus on certain exemplary personalities…. The students developed relationships with eccentric, interesting, and often deeply enigmatic people in [Berlin] and tried to give a sense of how these people live, think, and feel in the city,” he says. Rentschler seemed especially impressed by the progression from relative awkwardness and distance to candor and honesty between the filmmakers and their subjects, and he was pleased with the final results. “There’s not one weak film in the bunch. They are all strong in their own ways.”

“Last Vegas,” the comedy starring fading dramatic heavyweights Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline is, at least judging by the trailer, a baby boomer’s version of “The Hangover.” On that level, here’s how we think the various scenes in “The Hangover” would unfold if the 30-something whippersnappers were replaced with seasoned old-timers:

The DruggingKline, the Zach Galifianakis of the group, convinces the men to try a new prostate medication on their final night in Vegas before De Niro’s voluntary admittance into a retirement community.The directions for use, however prove too small for the entire party to read and they end up blacking out after taking three times the recommended dosage.
 
The TigerStill deeply faded from their Flomax miscue, the giggling men find their way to Muhammad Ali’s home and steal his therapy animal, a small tabby cat, from its crate at the foot of Ali’s bed. Although no chase ensues, the men still manage to lose the cat when Douglas forgets where he put the beast in a senior moment.
 
Mr. ChowFreeman, a Korean War vet, opens the trunk of his Buick to find a naked octogenarian and former North Korean soldier there. Unaware of how the soldier ended up in his trunk, Freeman eventually pieces together an ideological bickering match that occurred the night before in which they sparred about the relative merits of communism versus capitalism. The spat escalated quickly, but the North Korean man collapsed before any blows could be exchanged and, convinced he had killed the man, Freeman stuffed him in the trunk.
 
The StripperDe Niro receives a phone call from a stripper telling him of their impulsive marriage the night before. Initially ecstatic about her youth and enthusiasm, De Niro is horrified when he realizes, upon conducting some background research, that the woman is one of his non-biological grandnieces. In a poignant moment, he attempts to explain the difficulty for men of his age to keep track of all of their descendents.
 
Card CountingIn an attempt to win back debts incurred over their night of debauchery, Kline goes to a high rollers bingo game. A master ball counter, he manages to game the system and win twelve consecutive rounds, making the necessary cash to pay off the debts in the process.
 
The DecisionAfter all the fun and wildness of the weekend, De Niro can no longer stomach the thought of settling down into retired life, and instead throws a rager back in L.A. The celebration even includes a parody performance of Nat King Cole’s “L-O-V-E.” How droll!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressman Mike J. Rogers, at a hearing last week over the latest National Security Agency scandals, non-ironically disseminated this beautiful piece of sophistry: “You can’t have your privacy violated if you don’t know your privacy is violated.
If the NSA snoops on everyone, and no one knows enough to complain, does it still make a stink?
It’s unsettling to note that Congressman Rogers is a former FBI agent—but not unsurprising. It’s a little worse to note that Rogers is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee—one whose response to reports that the NSA had monitored 70 million French calls was that that French citizens should actually be “applauding and popping Champagne corks.”
But bewildering understandings of privacy are all too common in Congress. In a hearing over the disastrous roll-out of the federal health care exchange website, Representative Joe L. Barton wondered, “How in the world can this be HIPAA compliant?”
His colleague, Representative Frank J. Pallone, noted astutely that the patient privacy component of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act “only applies when there’s health information being provided. No health information is required in the application process. And why is that? Because pre-existing conditions don’t matter!”
When Barton pushed back, Pallone called the hearing a “monkey court.”
If I may offer a modest proposal to calm the partisan clamor: It appears that the great problem of our times is that some parts of the government are too technically advanced and others are decidedly less so.
So why not put the NSA in charge of healthcare.gov?
Think about it. Instead of a shoddy registration system so inept that only six people were able to sign up fully on the first day, nothing of the sort would happen with the pros at the NSA running things. You could just plop in front of the computer and the NSA would have all your information already inputted for you (which means more time for aimless browsing)!
The NSA already contracts its intelligence work through the startup firm Palantir, named after the seeing stones in Lord of the Rings that Sauron and Saruman use to coordinate their malevolent plans to massacre basically everyone in Middle Earth.
And the spy agency, amply funded with $10.8 billion, already appears to have time on its hands, allegedly spying on the papal conclave, obscure Venezuelan economic officials, and climate change conferences.
Instead of infuriating European leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose cellphone we had been lovingly looking after since 2002 when she was just the chair of the Christian Democratic Union, we could offer them entry to our exceptional healthcare system instead.
Giving the gift of healthcare to world leaders we want to keep eyes on (what could be more useful to intelligence than a real-time plot of Francois Hollande’s heart rate?) would be a boon for otherwise strained diplomatic relations with Europe. It would certainly beat Russia’s idea of gift giving: The country recently distributed memory sticks and mobile chargers in gift bags to world leaders, spyware included free of charge.
It could also be a smart political move for President Obama, whose aloofness on both the NSA’s excesses and his signature achievement have not done much to ease the “What did the president know and when did he know it?” attitude of Republicans on every scandal, real or fictional (Benghazi-gate still hasn’t quite fizzled out).
Instead of reinforcing his image as automaton-in-chief, the president could appease his liberal supporters by making sure Obamacare actually improves the sorry state of healthcare for too many Americans. Conservative support would be ensured since the NSA is a security institution and to oppose any act or operation related to security would be unthinkably unpatriotic.
Maybe then we can move on from the temporary website problems and onto the larger aim of providing less costly healthcare for more Americans—a goal that remains attainable even after Republicans’ 40-something repeal votes and government shutdown intended to suffocate it. Put the NSA to work for the good of the country.
Also, I hear that there’s a very talented programmer who was recently put out of work. You may just redeem yourself yet, Edward Snowden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the launch of healthcare.gov, commentators have given us plenty of reasons to be concerned about Obamacare. Most of the legitimate complaints have seemed to be permissible side effects of a generally good law, but one issue had me genuinely worried. The possibility that the health insurance market would fall into a so-called “death spiral” has been presented effectively and I could find no satisfactory response to quell my fears. In fact, I set out to write this op-ed with the thesis that a disastrous Obamacare death spiral was quite likely.
As I started putting in the legwork, though, it became clear that my case didn’t quite add up.
An insurance death spiral is unquestionably a real and dangerous phenomenon. The process is best exemplified by my home state of New York, in its failed 1993 attempt at health care reform. Concerned that the old and sick were being denied coverage or offered unaffordable insurance, the state legislature passed two requirements. First, every individual must be offered insurance. Second, every individual must be given the same price for insurance.
The young and healthy saw premiums rise to the level of the old and sick, and all premiums rose to pay for those with pre-existing conditions. The healthiest no longer saw insurance as a good deal and dropped their plans, which further raised the average cost for the insurers. To cover costs, insurers raised premiums again, so the next-healthiest individuals dropped out. Premiums rose again, the next healthiest dropped out; lather, rinse, repeat.
This is a death spiral. By 2008, New York’s average individual-insurance monthly premium was $388, the highest in the country. Between 1994 and 2009, the number of holders of individual insurance dropped by 96 percent.
Fortunately, Obamacare is nothing like New York’s reform. It’s more or less a clone of the successful Massachusetts reform of 2006, despite Romney’s claims to the contrary. In the words of Jonathan Gruber, architect of both Romneycare and Obamacare, “they’re the same fucking bill.”
Both are carefully crafted with the goal of preventing a death spiral, and Massachusetts has proven the success of this model for seven years. Here are five provisions that ensure the national plan will go the way of Massachusetts and not New York.
First, Obamacare has an individual mandate that discourages the young and healthy from dropping their insurance. Some say the penalty is too low to have an effect, but the initial $219 annual penalty in Massachusetts was paid by only four percent of residents—by far the lowest uninsured rate in the country. The Obamacare penalty is pegged to income and by 2016 will exceed $1250 for the median family.
Second, Obamacare provides subsidies for those who can’t afford premiums, giving assistance to young policyholders who might otherwise drop out. While New York offered no subsidies and Massachusetts covered a percentage of premiums on a sliding income scale, Obamacare is even more cautious, covering the entire cost of a Silver plan except for a fixed percentage of income. That is, if premiums rise, the 86 percent of individuals eligible for subsidies will see zero change in costs. The “sticker shock” stories represent the experience of 0.7 percent of Americans (14 percent of the five percent with individual insurance).
Third, Obamacare allows premiums to vary with age and tobacco use. The variance is limited to 3:1 for age and 1.5:1 for tobacco use, but this is nothing like the one-price requirement that set off the New York death spiral. Under Obamacare, a young non-smoker can pay $200 while an old smoker pays $900—far more conservative than Massachusetts, which limits premium variance at 2:1.
Fourth, Obamacare’s minimal coverage requirements and limits on deductibles make insurance more attractive to individuals, despite the fact they raise premiums. Since New York’s reform had no such requirements, all insurers began offering leaner insurance packages—raising the lowest deductibles to $5,000 and denying assistance with diabetes and AIDS—in the hopes that the sick would choose competitors’ more comprehensive plans. Consequently, the sick were stuck with this bare-bones coverage while the healthy opted not to pay for minimal insurance and dropped out.
Fifth, Obamacare includes temporary “reinsurance” and “risk corridors” programs that ensure price stability in the first three years of the program. The former is insurance for the insurers, providing federal assistance for costs incurred above $60,000 for a single person to ease the burden of having to cover those with pre-existing conditions. The latter incentivizes accurate pricing, funneling a percentage of profits from insurers who overpriced premiums to those who underpriced premiums, relative to how much they ended up spending.
The list goes on, but I won’t bore you with further technical details.
The Affordable Care Act is 906 pages long and commentators shouldn’t be expected to read the whole thing. But with some digging around, it’s not hard to find plenty of information from non-partisan sources to influence your position. It now seems immensely unlikely to me that Obamacare will fall into a death spiral—but I strongly encourage you to develop and present an opposing case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Revel Casino-Hotel opened in Atlantic City, NJ, last May, I couldn’t conceal my excitement. For good reason, too: As far back as I can remember, the casinos of my native Atlantic County have played a big part in my life. My parents met at a card dealing school, and for the first fifteen years of my life, they both worked in Atlantic City as dealers. Add on to that both of my grandfathers and a handful of my friends’ parents, and it isn’t difficult to see what role the casino played in shaping my childhood.
Even now, I fondly remember accompanying my parents on the car ride to and from the casino as if it were an adventure—definitely one that beat out my Hot Wheels set, though barely edging out the appeal of my Nintendo 64 (I won’t comment on my Beanie Babies). And despite my parents’ admonitions, I couldn’t help but stare out of the car window and marvel at the garish beauty of the billboards and casino lights. I loved the city I hadn’t ever stepped foot in.
Of course, it wasn’t long before I learned about the uglier side of “America’s Playground,” but I couldn’t shake my fond childhood memories. And that’s where Revel came in. Revel was supposed to revitalize the ailing casino town. It was supposed to be New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s “catalyst” for a city hit particularly hard by the so-called Great Recession, and at a price tag of $2.4 billion (in part subsidized by the state government), it seemed at least promising. Important for the six-year-old child in me, Revel claimed to offer a more palatable version of the Atlantic City around it; it would be family-friendly—or at least not family-hostile—with an emphasis on its 47-story resort and not on its isolated casino. It would bring tax revenue, jobs, and a more varied economy to the city crippled by the economic crisis. And perhaps most ambitious of all, Revel would not allow smoking anywhere in the casino, in a city where smokers still find refuge in 25 percent of casino floors.
We don’t need to fast forward much to see the outcome: Within a year of opening, Revel filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The ambitious experiment came to a close, and in came the new—or, rather, the old. Over the next two months, Revel restructured and rose from the grave, but the new Revel Casino-Hotel did not look quite the same. It was sleek and clean looking, sure, but it couldn’t shake its resemblance to all those who set up shop in Atlantic City before it. Out with the rhetoric of upscale restaurants and shopping, and in with the gambling deals and slot machine rebates. Out with the family-oriented resort, and in with the casino. And the least surprising of all but the most difficult to swallow: out with the smoking ban, in with the 30,000 square foot contiguous smoking area. And like that, the Revel experiment caved in under the pressure of Atlantic City’s casino machine.
Not that Revel’s experiment was wholly novel. Atlantic City tried once to ban smoking on casino floors before. But in response to pressure from casinos—which had already endured significant losses since 2006—the city backed off of its smoking ban just 12 days after it went into effect. I can’t say whether it was naïveté or ignorance that made me think Revel would pan out differently, but in retrospect, the 12-day ban of 2008 presaged the 12-month lifespan of Revel (now Revel Casino Hotel).
It’s no wonder, of course, why the Revel Resort failed in a city that draws in about $3 billion in casino revenue per year. But it’s shocking—and disheartening—that Atlantic City continues to stymie any improvement of its working conditions against the trend of cities across the country. While the unprofitable and recalcitrant casinos are buoyed by the city’s appeasement, casino workers subjected to secondhand smoke suffer heightened risk of heart attack and sudden cardiac death compared to workers in smoke-free workplaces. And a whole seven years after former Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona declared the evidence of secondhand smoke’s harms “indisputable,” it seems preposterous that Atlantic City should allow casinos to continue to subject thousands of casino employees—many of whom are unrepresented by union contracts—to patently unsafe working conditions.
Whether Revel was doomed to fail from its pre-financial crisis conception is unclear, but its experience in Atlantic City has highlighted the fragility of an industry whose survival is predicated in part on Victorian working conditions. Of course, Atlantic City is not alone; Las Vegas casinos, for their part, are marred by the same secondhand smoke conditions. And just this week, The Boston Globe showed that even in Massachusetts, which has a Smoke-Free Workplace Law, blue collar employees face markedly higher exposure to secondhand smoke than do professional workers.
That these are exceptions is itself reassuring, because it means that the trend is moving toward, not away from, safe workplaces for millions. So despite the failure of Revel to bring a healthier—economically and physically—casino to Atlantic City, there’s hope for the future. But for now, I will make sure to heed my parents’ rebukes and, when gazing out the window, not be so entranced by the superficial ostentation of the city that is “Always Turned On.”

Last year, students approved a handful of referenda on the Undergraduate Council ballot. One urged the College to establish a social choice endowment fund, another pushed an overhaul of sexual assault policies, and the last demanded the Harvard divest from fossil fuels. Activism makes a return to the UC ballot this month in the form of a referendum asking the College to universalize gender-neutral housing options. We will be voting yes.
Gender neutral housing options are currently available to transgender students or those with a gender-based need, with requests evaluated by House Administrators. College policy dictates mixed-gender suites have private bedrooms and locks on doors. These rules have been relaxed in Adams, Kirkland, Dudley, Pforzheimer, Cabot, and Quincy Houses, as part of a pilot program to remove constraints on gender-neutral housing stemming from suite configuration. While those who need gender-neutral housing may ask to be lotteried only into houses on the pilot program, we see no reason why such archaisms should persist anywhere on campus.
The universalization of gender-neutral housing options would most directly benefit transgender students, who would no longer have to submit to an involved review process in order  to win appropriate accommodations. This, as it stands, can be frustrating and may give some the perception that a stigma exists against them. House life must be accessible to those of all gender identities.
Change, however, means big things for cisgender students as well, for whom the College refuses to guarantee gender-neutral housing options. There are many who have blocked with people of different genders, and some have had to jump through hoops to obtain desired living arrangements. The passage of the referendum would open new choices to them and cut a great deal of red tape.
Some may raise hackles about gender-neutral housing. They should be paid no mind. These options have been universalized without incident at several of Harvard’s peer institutions—Brown, Dartmouth, and Penn, to name three. We expect the same outcome here, and so do the 720 students who signed the petition to put the question on the UC ballot.
In 1879, the Harvard Annex (later to become Radcliffe College) was established to educate women in a university setting. During World War II, “‘Cliffe Girls” and Harvard men began to attend lectures together. Starting in 1969, freshman dormitories and upperclassman houses went coed. At Harvard—and in America at large—we have, in stages, realized that gender difference should dictate policy as infrequently as possible in order to allow for equality of opportunity. May this be another year of progress.

Residents of Cambridge will head to the polls Tuesday for the city’s biennial municipal elections, which will place nine delegates on Cambridge’s City Council and six delegates on the School Committee. Residents of Boston will also be voting in their own elections for mayor and city council.
 
This year’s election will feature a greater array of candidates than in previous seasons—25 candidates will vie for spots on the City Council compared to 18 in 2011 and 15 in 2009. Of these candidates, seven are incumbents, four are repeat candidates, and 14 are running for the first time. Nine candidates are also running for positions on the Cambridge School Committee. Henrietta Davis, Cambridge’s current mayor, and Marjorie C. Decker, a city councillor, are not seeking reelection.
 
Harvard sophomore Logan E. Leslie ’16 also lists amongst the candidates for City Council. Over the last couple of months, his campaign has been working to rally students on campus and register them to vote. Harvard students’ voter turnout in a municipal election hasn’t spiked since MIT alumnus, Matthew DeBergalis, ran for Cambridge City Council in 2003.
 
This election season has focused around a series of issues including university relations, crime and safety, the environment, the issue of affordable housing, and Square business.
 
Many members of the Cambridge community, including Harvard students, have yet to decide which delegates will be receiving their votes.
 
One major concern in the community is the growing divide between the University and local residents of Cambridge.
 
“There is a trend with recent city councils...of moving away from thinking of Cambridge as a city that accommodates people of all socioeconomic backgrounds to one that focuses on middle and high income residents. I think it's really important that as much as possible, this new city council maintains Cambridge's fantastic inclusionary ethos,” Sam G. Greenberg ’14, a Harvard student and Cambridge resident, said.
 
Despite this divide, some candidates have staked out positions with Harvard voters in mind.
 
 “Candidates have been making appeals to Harvard centric issues, such as campus security, in order to attract Harvard votes,” said Simon Thompson ’14.
 
Voting will take place in 30 locations across Cambridge and will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. The four polling stations in the University’s precinct include Graham and Parks Schools (44 Linnaean Street); Friends Center (5 Longfellow Park); Quincy House; and Gund Hall (48 Quincy Street). In Cambridge’s system of proportional representation, voters will be able to  rank their preferences for as many candidates as they wish.

“Many people have told us the first thing Harvard Square businesses and churches do every morning is clean feces off their doorstep,” said Zachary L. Kerzee, a student at Harvard Divinity School. Kerzee is the co-web designer for Advocates for a Common Toilet, a new coalition comprised of area churches and businesses united to mobilize support for a public restroom in Harvard Square.
 
There has long been interest in building a public restroom to supplement the lone toilet inside the Harvard Square T stop, but the issue didn’t fully rise to prominence until last spring with the formation of ACT. Harvard Kennedy School professor Richard Parker spearheaded the effort to raise awareness and present a plan of action to the Cambridge City Council.
 
“All of us deserve access to a public restroom.  Homeless especially,” said Parker.
 
According to ACT, given the more than 8 million tourists that pass through Harvard Square every year and the more than 350 homeless people in the Square,  the need for a public restroom is apparent.  With the planned four million dollar renovation of Cambridge Common, ACT is petitioning the city to incorporate a public restroom into the renovation. Parker quoted two separate estimates of around $90,000 and $50,000 for the cost of installing a public toilet.
 
Over the last few months, ACT has been gathering support and lobbying the Cambridge City Council for the installation of such a facility. A written petition created by Parker and his team has collected roughly 3,000 signatures to date. According to Parker, the Cambridge City Manager has pledged to allocate funding for the toilet in the budget for FY15. 
 
“I really think it’s strange that Cambridge doesn’t have a public restroom.  It’s a world class city and world class cities have toilets.” Kerzee noted.
 
Additionally, he spoke about public restrooms as a basic right. “It’s the responsibility of the civic government to provide basic needs for people who live in the community,” he added.
 
Although some have expressed concern that the current city-wide elections will shift momentum away from the public toilet efforts, ACT does not expect the new toilet plans to be flushed down the drain. Three incumbent councilors have publicly supported the public restroom project, and no candidate has come out against the initiative. Kerzee noted that the most pressing focus for ACT is to ensure that the city keeps its promise.
 
“In the end it comes down to hospitality. If someone came to my home and asked to use the restroom, I wouldn’t send them to Starbucks,” said Kerzee.

While the American health care system may seem to be beyond repair, there may be a way to fix it, Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Donald M. Berwick ’68 told an audience in Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall on Monday.
 
Berwick, who is a graduate of Harvard Medical School and was a lecturer there until declaring his candidacy for governor of Massachusetts, addressed the current state of health care in America. He said that while recent advancements in medicine are laudable, disproportionate investment in new technologies has sometimes resulted in inadequate treatment of chronic illness and an ignorance on the part of health professionals of the social, economic, and environmental causes of health problems.
 
“We have 2.7 trillion dollars of the American economy going into health care, but that’s only going into a corner of the pursuit of health,” he said.
 
The system would be optimized, he continued, by re-focusing it on three objectives: higher quality and efficiency of medical care, better attention to public health concerns, and lower health-care cost per capita. Achieving these directives, Berwick said, requires reforms at a scope that extends beyond hospitals and clinics. 
 
“You have to build a new system which is much more team-based, primary-care based, home-based, [and] prevention-oriented,” he said, painting a picture of a health care model centered around the community. “We could build it. This country is capable of building massive things—we did build the highway system.”
 
President Obama appointed Berwick as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010, and the Newton pediatrician and health care policy expert held the position for nearly 17 months before resigning, citing Republican opposition to his appointment as one of his reasons. He said on Monday that his political service illuminated immense economic and political barriers to health care reform, such as funding shortfalls and stalled decision-making due to partisanship. But Berwick also expressed confidence that the necessary change is possible.
 
“We can fix it,” he said. “It’s not all that hard to have health care delivery that is oriented to the social need—and at lower cost.” 
 
Berwick, a strong proponent of aggressive health care reform who has pledged to use his expertise in health care policy to improve all aspects of the Massachusetts health care system, was hosted for the lunch talk by the Harvard Law School Chapter of the American Constitution Society.

Making it big in the food industry does not always follow a standard path, but according to four Massachusetts restaurant owners, a consistent given is a willingness to start anywhere—even Burger King.
 
At a panel event in Fong Auditorium Monday night hosted by the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, owners of four local restaurants in Massachusetts shared their stories of working from the bottom up and entering the food industry from unrelated fields.
 
For Ayr Muir, an MIT and Harvard Business School graduate, this meant leaving a career at McKinsey and Company to “toast frozen burgers at Burger King.”
 
“The only reason it was Burger King is because I had six McDonald’s turn me down,” said Muir.
 
Working at Burger King, however, was just a way for Muir to get experience in food service. He went on to establish Clover Food Lab, one of the first food trucks in the country. It has since expanded into restaurants throughout the state.
 
Jason Bond, who founded Bondir, a restaurant located in Cambridge, agreed that working one’s way up the ladder helps restaurateurs perfect their craft.
 
“As you go through career steps and change jobs, every job was geared towards learning a new skill,” said Bond, who worked in a variety of positions at many restaurants before starting his own.
 
Panelists added that starting their own restaurants required not only business acumen but also a unique vision. Muir, for example, founded Clover because he felt that not enough was being done to combat the fact that the livestock industry contributes more carbon dioxide to the environment than the entire transportation industry. The panelists unanimously agreed, however, that fulfilling a vision also demands leadership and a strong team.
 
“You need a psychology degree, you need to be a mother, you need to be hard as well, but it’s very difficult,” said Vicki Lee Boyajian, who founded Vicki Lee’s Bakeshop in Belmont, Mass., of the many traits that a leader must assume to manage different kinds of employees and situations.
 
The event was followed by a reception with samples from Vicki Lee’s Bakeshop, Clover, and Farmstead Table, a restaurant in Newton, Mass.
 
“I was just impressed that we had this event,” said attendee Rose Wang ’14. “It’s a niche interest ...and the fact that the Leadership Institute was willing to explore that interest is very cool.”
 
Alessandra M. Moscoso ’14, the main event coordinator and a committee member of LIHC, said that Harvard panel speakers are rarely from the restaurant industry.
 
“[Harvard students] don’t see [restaurant owners] as leaders immediately, even though they are leaders in their field,” Moscoso said.

Joanne B. Chang ’91, the founder of Flour Bakery, lectured on the science of sweets to an overflowing hall in the Science Center Monday night.
 
Chang taught the audience members how to make bread, pie crust, cream puffs, and cake, while providing commentary on the chemical interactions that make these pastries delicious as part of the Science and Cooking lecture series.
 
Chang also used the time to field audience questions—for instance, she answered a question about the process by which bread rises, explaining the chemistry behind yeast and fermentation.
 
“These are living, one-celled organisms” said Chang. “They start eating all of this food when warmed…and then they start to expel gas,” causing bread to rise. Chang told audience members to think about and understand these interactions to improve their pastries.
 
Chang, who is well known for her appearance on the television show “Throwdown with Bobby Flay,” laughed about how she was tricked into thinking she was filming a new show for the Food Network called “The Science of Sweets” which played on her background as a former applied mathematics and economics concentrator at Harvard.
 
“She was definitely able to teach a lot about the science of the baking itself, but then also provided a lot of ideas…of how to make something delicious,” said Carlyn R. Mann, who works as a research analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health.
 
“I love coming to these when I get a chance,” said Helen C. Clark ’15, who said she hopes next year to take Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking” the class behind the lecture series.
 
Because of the lecture series’ popularity, many would-be attendees missed out on the event—at least 50 people were turned away at the door after the lecture hall reached capacity.
 
“Over the course of the semester, I have had to turn people away on more nights than I haven’t,” said Joseph J. McDermott, a postdoctoral fellow in applied physics at Harvard who was managing the line. “It varies week to week. Last week, we had the Red Sox game and it was sort of an off-day.”
 
Many attendees at the back of the line said they were surprised that they were turned away.
 
“There’s no overflow room!?” one attendee shouted in disbelief.
 
Christina M. Andujar, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences administrator responsible for producing the lecture series, explained that SEAS could not afford an overflow room this year due to budgetary constraints. According to Andujar, the lecture series had sponsors in previous years to provide extra funding, but professors and SEAS administrators decided not to recruit any this season.
 
Andujar touted the fact that the event was open to the public rather than just Harvard students.
 “I think it’s Harvard’s responsibility to reach out to the surrounding communities,” said Andujar. “We have huge property here. It is our responsibility to integrate and get the public into Harvard [so it can] see what we’re doing.”

Harvard presented a new package of community benefits totaling $43 million to the Harvard-Allston Task Force on Monday evening. The community benefits package is linked to the University’s ten-year Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston. Documents for the Chao Center, an executive education facility at the Business School that will be the first project in the IMP, will be filed Tuesday.
 
In response to demands from task force members for community benefits related to housing, the new proposal adds $5 million to support new housing and homeownership in the neighborhood. The package also pledges $500,000 to the Gardner Pilot Academy for general improvements. The final modification is the reallocation of $1.7 million from Harvard’s planned ‘transformative project,’ to a flexible fund that could be used for projects that emerge later in the IMP process.
 
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that this proposal, which offers more money than any past package associated with the IMP, may be the maximum the University is willing to offer in terms of community benefits.
 
“This is the third time that I’ve come to you since July, and each time we have added millions of dollars to the package,” Casey said. “The well is dry in terms of what we believe is commensurate with the physical development in the master plan.”
 
Despite Harvard’s proposed additions to the community benefits package, some task force members said they remained unsatisfied.
 
Task force member Cathy Snedeker called for a greater emphasis on workforce and employment development.
 
“It’s just not enough,” Snedecker said. “I see nothing that’s linking us to…how we’re going to be able to protect existing businesses and what [new businesses] we’re going to bring in here.”
 
Christina L. Marin, another task force member and a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School, highlighted the absence of a $500,000 public safety budget for cameras and other equipment that had been requested by members of the Boston Police Department and endorsed by the task force.
 
Kairos Shen, chief city planner for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said that he and other members of the BRA are satisfied with the amount Harvard is proposing for the community benefits package. He said that this package raises the bar for developments by other large institutions in the area, noting that Harvard’s newest package provides more money per square foot than any other university’s.
 
Task force members agreed to reassess the budgets for individual projects within the package as well as the total funding amount at a task force meeting next week.

On the eve of Tuesday’s Cambridge City Council election, several current Councillors expressed concern that a recent complaint lodged by Cambridge resident Charles D. Teague ’74 regarding governmental transparency will damage their reputations. 
In the complaint, filed on Oct. 17, Teague alleges that Mayor Henrietta J. Davis and Councillors David P. Maher and Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 violated the state Open Meeting Law during an April 8 Council meeting in which Councillors approved a rezoning petition by MIT. The Open Meeting Law requires governmental bodies to hold most meetings in a public setting, thought it makes some exceptions to ensure that public officials are not “unduly hampered” by the mandate.
Teague demands in the complaint that the Council’s 7-1-1 vote in favor of MIT’s petition be reversed, that Maher and Reeves be banned from chairing committees in their next two-year term if they are reelected, and that the Council be forced to formally acknowledge that it has intentionally violated the Open Meeting Law. Maher and Reeves are running for reelection in Tuesday’s contest, while Davis is not.
Teague’s concern stems from Davis’s vote reversal on the MIT petition’s “Net Zero Emissions Amendment.” After the Council initially approved the amendment by a vote of 5-4, Maher temporarily left the meeting to talk to MIT developers. During this time, Teague claims, Reeves stalled the Council’s discussion of the petition. When Maher returned to the meeting, he approached all the Councillors, including Davis, and quietly talked to them. Davis then publicly announced her change of vote, killing the amendment, later explaining that she was concerned the amendment’s passage could potentially sink the entire project.
At Monday night’s meeting, the Council voted 8-1 to approve the draft of a letter in defense of its actions that will be sent to the Massachusetts Attorney General. 
Responding to Teague’s complaint in discussion, Reeves said he thinks the complaint is nothing more than a personal, unsubstantiated attack on his integrity. 
“This is a complaint about a violation of the Open Meeting Law that includes my name but is based on some conjecture on what my thinking might have been by someone I don’t really know,” he said. “So it needs to be plain to the public that any citizen in standing could come in and claim anything.” 
Reeves said that he hopes the letter will clear him of any wrongdoing.
“I am glad this is going to the [Massachusetts] Attorney General, and I hope it goes to the U.S. Attorney General, and the president of the world to clear my name because I care about what is being said about me,” he shouted.
During public comments, however, Council candidate Nadeem Mazen said he thinks the dispute raises troubling questions. 
“For politicians, there is a higher bar and the appearance of impropriety is impropriety. I don’t know what happened, I don’t know why votes were reversed, but it looks bad,” Mazen said. “The trust we have and the feeling of inclusion that we have as residents suffers as a result.”
Also during the meeting, Teague criticized the way the Council has responded to his complaint. 
“Trust can only come from admission and not argument, and the government’s response of argument does nothing to reestablish trust,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 6, 2013, at 1:46 a.m
State Representative Martin J. Walsh, a Dorchester Democrat, won a hotly contested race to replace outgoing Mayor Thomas M. Menino Tuesday night, edging out fellow progressive Democrat and Boston City Councillor at-large John R. Connolly ’95.
Down in the polls by about 3.5 percentage points at the time, Connolly conceded the race to Walsh shortly after 9:20 p.m. on Tuesday. Walsh won with 52 percent of the vote, to Connolly’s 48 percent.
Speaking at a gathering of supporters in a ballroom at the Park Plaza Hotel in Back Bay, Walsh reaffirmed his commitment to a unified city, emphasizing that the city should be, “One Boston, no matter where you live or who you are.” He also emphasized a commitment to public safety, better schools, and closing achievement gaps.
“You made Boston a place where dreams come true,” Walsh told supporters. “Together we are going to make Boston a place where dreams come true for every child, for every person, in every corner of this city.”
In his victory speech, Walsh said that with the election over his attention will now turn to ensuring a smooth transition. “In the coming days, I will [reveal] a transition plan and work with Mayor Menino and staff to ensure the smoothest possible handover from his administration to mine,” he said.
Although Harvard’s main campus is located across the river in Cambridge, the election has implications for the University. During the campaign, Walsh vowed to abolish the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the body that regulates Harvard’s construction projects in Allston, and replace it with an economic development agency less closely tied to the Office of the Mayor. Walsh has also voiced support for extended hours of operation for the MBTA.
Connolly, a former schoolteacher, campaigned on a platform revolving primarily around stronger schools and safer streets. He advanced proposals to close the achievement gap and create a better system for assigning students to specific public schools.
“I know that the city of Boston wants to close the achievement gap, and I know that the city of Boston wants to end violence, and I know that the city of Boston wants economic opportunity to reach every corner of the city,” Connolly said during a speech to supporters on Tuesday night.
Once considered the clear frontrunner in the race, Connolly faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from Walsh, who drew ahead during recent weeks buoyed by manpower and funds from organized labor groups.
The race had been hotly contested since the spring, when Menino announced that he would not seek a sixth term. Twelve candidates eventually obtained the signatures necessary to compete in a preliminary election, held on Sept. 24, in which voters narrowed the field to Walsh and Connolly, with Walsh winning by about 1,500 votes.
In  recent weeks, the race grew increasingly personal as Walsh supporters tried to highlight his opponent’s Harvard degree and portray him as a child of privilege.
“Harvard is funny for any candidate running for office,” said Connolly pollster Chris Anderson after his candidate conceded. “It’s a double-edged sword.”
Connolly supporter John Hanna implied that Walsh had used the Harvard connection to unfairly portray Connolly as out-of-touch. “It was taken and manipulated to make it look like it is unacceptable to work hard,” Hanna said. “To utilize someone’s achievement to their detriment, for lack of a better phrase, it’s sour grapes.”
Connolly—who previously had refrained from lashing out at labor unions—tried to respond by hammering Walsh for accepting a massive influx of last minute cash from organized labor. He has argued that the donations would leave Walsh beholden to labor unions while mayor.
Yet overwhelming support from labor unions ultimately pushed Walsh to a solid victory. Early returns showed Walsh with a close lead from the start that only widened throughout the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Norm J. Jones, who was named Harvard’s first associate chief diversity officer last week, began his appointment on Tuesday at the Office of the Assistant to the President for Institutional Diversity and Equity.
 First established in 1971, the office’s primary mission has been to “lead a sustained University-wide effort and to develop, coordinate, and advance inclusive excellence, diversity, and equal opportunity (EO) initiatives, programs and policies at Harvard University,” according to the group's website. 
 As associate chief diversity officer, Jones will manage and assist the development of diversity initiatives and outreach programs at Harvard, according to a job listing posted on the website Higher Ed Jobs. He will also work closely with the human resources department as a consultant, collect and analyze relevant data on diversity, deliver presentations and conduct workshops, and publish an annual diversity report for the University. 
Jones graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta with a bachelor of arts degree in English and Linguistics, and went on to earn a master’s degree in Public Administration from Penn State University and a post-doctorate degree in Workforce Education and Development. 
Jones has spent most of his career in professional roles working on diversity, affirmative action, and equal opportunity issues, 
Jones has been involved with several community organizations and boards, like the Carlisle Area Health and Wellness Foundation, the United Way of Carlisle and Cumberland County, the Holistic Hands Community Development Corporation, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, and the Art Association of Harrisburg, according to the Harvard Gazette.  
Chief Diversity Officer and Assistant to the President Lisa M. Coleman praised Jones in a press release.
 “His expertise on all areas pertinent to diversity and inclusion, as well as his skills in leadership development, strategic planning, program management, and community outreach will enable him to partner and collaborate with colleagues from across the university,” she said.
Before joining Harvard’s Diversity and Equity team, Jones served as the associate vice president of student development and dean of institutional diversity at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, where he began working in 2001. Jones also oversaw the college’s Women’s Center, LGBTQ Services offices, Student Conduct center, and education programs dealing with Title IX compliance, according to the Gazette. 
“At Dickinson, he has provided strong strategic leadership and direction in advancing the college's diversity and inclusion efforts. He will be a valuable asset to the Harvard community,” Coleman said.
Jones and Coleman could not be reached for comment through a spokesperson on Tuesday.

When Harvard undergraduates vote for new Undergraduate Council leadership later this month, they will also have the chance to vote on four referenda expressing requests of the University ranging from gender neutral housing available to all students to public endorsement of comprehensive immigration reform.
Students will also have the opportunity to vote on a program through which the University would provide MBTA passes to undergraduates and a proposal to ban the sale of water bottles and expand tap water options on campus.
The students behind each referendum had to first petition to have their proposals placed on the ballot by obtaining signatures from 10 percent of the student body.
Tania C. Amarillas ’15, legislative director of Act on a Dream at Harvard College, said that her group was surprised by the amount of support that the immigration reform petition received. “It was actually overwhelming, the amount of people that not only wanted to see the question on the referendum, but also the broader campaign at Harvard,” she added.
According to Amarillas, Act on a Dream petitioned to have its proposal on the ballot in the hopes that a University endorsement of immigration reform would pressure Congress to act on stalled legislation.
Ultimately, Amarillas said she hopes that University President Drew G. Faust will write a letter in support of immigration reform, as she has done in the past for the DREAM Act. The law, which would have allowed immigrants who had lived in the United States as children and graduated from U.S. high schools to obtain permanent residency, failed to pass in both chambers of Congress.
Students for a Just and Stable Future, which organized last year’s referendum question on divestment, sponsored the MBTA referendum question. The question asks Harvard to purchase MBTA passes for all of its students at half the regular cost.
Through a similar program at MIT, students and employees there currently receive a 50 percent subsidy on MBTA monthly passes.
Harvard Environmental Action Committee Chair Katrina D. Malakhoff ’14 said that the water bottle proposal by the EAC is one component of a two-fold approach to get students to utilize more tap water resources and reduce plastic water bottle waste.
“Switching our campus over to being bottle-free or mostly bottle-free is a small behavioral change that can have a big environmental impact,” Malakhoff said. “Right here in Cambridge, we have some of the cleanest tap water in the country.”
Last year, the UC ballot featured three referenda—one for the University to divest from fossil fuels, another for Harvard to establish a social choice fund, and the last one calling on the College to reconsider its sexual assault policies. Though students voted overwhelmingly in favor of each proposal, only one referendum, the creation of a the social choice fund, has led to administrative action.
Each referendum question on this year’s ballot will be reviewed by the Institute of Politics’ Harvard Public Opinion Project in the coming days to ensure neutrality in its wording. Students both in favor of and against each question will also be allowed to submit pro and con statements, which may appear on the ballot, to the Rules Committee of the UC.
Voting will begin on Nov. 18 and conclude on Nov. 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just before Saturday’s postgame press conference, an extra chair was added to the front of the room. Then the Harvard players walked in, including co-captain Josh Boyd and fellow fifth-year senior Nnamdi Obukwelu, who account for over 500 lbs. combined. But wedged in between them, occupying the extra seat, was walk-on kicker Andrew Flesher, the blonde and bespectacled  6’3”, 190 lb. junior.
Flesher did not even plan on playing football when he first got to campus. He thought he was going to play golf, but decided to walk on after talking with Crimson coaches. Saturday, that decision paid off, as his 23-yard chip shot from left of the fairway lifted Harvard past Dartmouth, 24-21.
At the beginning of the season, Flesher was simply trying to crack the lineup as a kickoff specialist. His biggest claim to fame might have been owning a name similar to sophomore wide receiver Andrew Fischer. My, how things have changed.
Last week against Princeton, Flesher’s potential game-winner in the final seconds of regulation sailed just wide from 50 yards out, though he rebounded to keep the Crimson in the game with two overtime field goals.
Saturday, senior David Mothander’s replacement missed another potential go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter, this time a 30-yarder. But then the Harvard defense forced a three-and-out and the Crimson offense gave Flesher another opportunity. He nailed it.
After the game, reporters asked Flesher when his last game-winner was (four years ago, back at Episcopal Collegiate in Arkansas) and what he remembered about the snap and the hold on his final kick (not much).
Boyd and Obukwelu had helped keep Harvard in the game with stingy defense, but they weren’t the ones getting a majority of the questions. Flesher was. That felt right.
This year’s Harvard football team is different. While it has veterans and stars, they aren’t the ones in the spotlight. I could come up with a comparison to describe the shape of the Crimson’s roster right now, but Murphy already did.
“We are a little bit on offense like the team of misfit toys,” he said after the game.
Almost half of Harvard’s offensive starters Saturday were former second-teamers thrust into the ring after injuries to starters at running back, wide receiver, tight end, left tackle, right tackle, and center.
Sometimes, that works out. Sophomore running back, Paul Stanton, for instance, had another impressive outing, accruing 146 yards. But sometimes it does not. When Stanton needed a breather, freshman Bo Ellis was thrown into the game. He only managed one yard on two carries and fumbled a swing pass that turned into a defensive score.
Generally, it felt like Murphy had more hits than misses with his replacements. Junior Obum Obukwelu led the team in tackles in place of senior Jack Dittmer, and sophomore Bryce Walker had two strong kick returns while filling in for sophomore Andrew Fischer.
At the same time, the preponderance of backups in the ballgame has changed the team’s mindset.
From 2010 through 2012, the Crimson won just one game by single digits, going 1-4 in contests decided by fewer than 10 points. With Saturday’s win, Harvard has already doubled that win total in addition to beating Cornell by 10. The banged-up Crimson also hung around with Princeton before falling in triple-overtime.
As currently composed, Harvard might not have as much talent as it had in years past, but it has stayed near the top of the league’s standings by making up for its deficiencies with grit.
Against Dartmouth, junior quarterback Conner Hempel had just 135 passing yards and did not complete a pass beyond 20 yards. Hempel had thrown a touchdown in each of his previous starts this season and Stanton had scored in every game as well, but both of those streaks came to an end Saturday.
Still, the Crimson was able to dig deep on its final drive, moving 56 yards over 13 plays to set up Flesher’s game-winner.
With big games against Penn and Yale left on the schedule, Harvard will likely be involved in at least one more fourth-quarter dogfight.
If they win, who knows who might take the podium afterwards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in Manhattan Beach, Calif., freshman Corinne Bain didn’t exactly target Harvard as a place to play in college, at least not until high school. With Pac-12 options available, Bain assumed her career would take her a bit inland, but not to the opposite coast.
“I come from an area that breeds a bunch of talented volleyball players, because a lot of parents played in the Olympics,” said the 5’11” setter, who currently starts for the Crimson women’s volleyball team. “We’re around the beach all the time, so we’re always playing volleyball.”
However, after a visit to Cambridge as a high school sophomore, Bain began to consider the possibility of playing in the Ivy League.
“I had my heart set on Berkeley since eighth grade,” Bain said. “But then I realized that I wanted to use these four years for more than just volleyball, and wanted the experience of living across the country for college.”
On her East Coast trip, Bain also visited some other Ancient Eight schools, but remembers Harvard as the standout program.
“I’ve seen a lot of people go through top-notch programs in California,” Bain said. “I realized there is so much more opportunity for a career, and more advanced career paths coming out of an Ivy League school. The coaches’ mentalities are different, the interests of the girls on the team, everything was convincing. I know there is more to life than a sport, and I wanted to make sure I could have the best of both worlds in college.”
Since arriving at Harvard in August, Bain has left her mark on the court, recording her fourth triple-double of the year, the highest in Harvard’s history, on Saturday night to help the Crimson defeat Yale, 3-2. Entering the match, Yale held a 23-match Ivy League win streak, and hadn’t lost to the Crimson since 2004.
“We established that we had nothing to lose going into the game,” Bain said. “It wouldn’t make or break our season, but it was something that everyone wanted more than anything because they hadn’t been beaten for so long. We knew we were the Ivy League team that could do it. After we won the first game, we felt like we were in control. We weren’t lucky. We were running our system, it was working, and we were shutting Yale down.”
And as a rookie, Bain wasn’t worried about Yale’s legacy going into the game like some of her teammates.
“I wasn’t here the last two years, so I had no control over what they did then,” Bain said. “I think I was naive in the sense that I hadn’t seen this history of Yale, so I went out aggressively and unafraid and that definitely worked to my advantage.”
Bain was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week twice this season, and Player of the Week once. She holds the Harvard record for single-season service aces already, and is first in the Ivy league in service aces per set and second in service aces overall. She also ranks sixth among Ivy League players in assists.
Bain has also proven a well-rounded threat on the court. Besides her performance as a setter, Bain has contributed from the backcourt, especially recently against Dartmouth and Yale when she averaged 14 digs per game. Her career-high kills tally came at Brown, with 15 to her name, as she showed herself to be an offensive power, as well.
Head coach Jennifer Weiss is not surprised at the early success of her recruit, whom she noticed during Bain’s sophomore year of high school.
“[Bain] has not only been a great volleyball player, but a great person on and off the court,” Weiss said. “She had opportunities to [be successful] other places, but she wanted to be at Harvard. I knew her background in playing and her competitive nature. I thought it would be what it was, but I’m overly full of joy for her in terms of it fitting and everything working so well. ”
Bain’s teammates have noticed her accomplishments as well, recognizing the responsibility that falls to the team’s setter, regardless of her age.
“She has honestly contributed so much,” said sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “She is a very competitive player and always holds us accountable for our actions. On the court, she is a big leader because she makes the decisions that affect our offense.”
Although only a freshman, Bain has lofty expectations for herself and for the Crimson.
“I really want to win Ivy League at least one year and go to the NCAA tournament,” Bain said. “I think it would be amazing to upset a huge opponent. Anything can happen any night. I want to beat them and show that Harvard Athletics pride.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team had a disappointing weekend, as the squad was unable to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Tournament at the 73rd Professor Schell Trophy hosted by MIT.
The women’s team also failed to qualify at the 48th Victorian Coffee Urn, which the Crimson itself hosted. However, as the one bright side of the weekend, the freshman team turned in a solid performance to earn third at the Nickerson Trophy at Tufts.
73rd ANNUAL PROFESSOR SCHELL TROPHY
Harvard went into the weekend ranked seventh nationally and fully expected to finish within the top seven amongst the New England teams at the regatta, and thereby qualify for the upcoming Atlantic Coast Tournament at Connecticut College.
However, the weather conditions were awful throughout the competition. On Saturday, there was only enough wind for one race in each division.
On Sunday, the wind picked up enough to hold the competition, but the environment was still extremely tough for the athletes.
“The wind was...blowing from Cambridge,” junior Michael Drumm said. “When the wind comes over land and through the buildings, it becomes very unstable. The wind comes down very quickly and in many different directions, so you have to really position yourself well on the race course to take advantage of all these changes. [If] you do that well, you get ahead very easily, but if you don’t, then you’ll do very poorly.”
The Crimson sailors were not able to perform as they would have hoped under the circumstances, and ended up finishing in a disappointing twelfth place.
“We had problems with our decision-making,” Drumm said. “The wind was very shifty, and in order to do well in races you had to not only see where all the wind was and the shifts, but you also had to make the correct decisions of where to go. We might have been recognizing where the wind was, but we certainly were not making the right decisions consistently.”
Failing to qualify marks the meaningful end of the fall season for Harvard, though the team will compete at regattas next weekend. Moving forward into the offseason now, the squad will look to turn its potential and promising start to the season into better outcomes come springtime.
“We basically have to learn how to race better,” Drumm said. “We can do a lot of the boat handling and a lot of the general components of racing well, but we have to do a lot better at putting the entire thing together. We have to make fewer mistakes, and we have to recognize what’s important in each race.”
48th VICTORIAN COFFEE URN
The women’s team was also trying to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Tournament. The Crimson hosted the 48th Victorian Coffee Urn regatta on the Charles River.
Poor conditions again plagued the weekend. A total of three races were commenced on Saturday, but not one was completed because of a sheer lack of wind. When the wind picked up on Sunday, the competition proved too tough for Harvard, as the team finished in fifteenth place with 163 points. The U.S. Naval Academy took first place with 78 points, and Rhode Island picked up the final qualifying spot, finishing eighth with 127 points.
NICKERSON TROPHY
While the Crimson’s other teams failed to qualify for the ACT, the freshmen put in a very consistent team performance. Racing at Tufts, the home Jumbos came out on top, followed by Dartmouth. The Crimson followed in third.
“I think we were just generally able to sail more consistently than most of the other teams there,” Mollerus said. “We never sailed any race outside the top six, [we were] one of the only teams to do that all weekend.”
Conditions were tough again with turbulent winds, but while other Harvard squads faltered, the freshmen managed to adapt successfully.
“I think [the conditions] were really tough—probably the toughest we’ve sailed in all year,” Mollerus said. “It was really a challenge to try and pick out what little wind there was, and at the end of the day we were just able to do that a little better than other teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On October 5th, the Harvard men’s soccer team suffered a 2-1 loss to the Yale Bulldogs. Leading 1-0 with four minutes to play, Harvard gave up two goals in the final four minutes. The loss extended a league winless streak that stretched back to 2011. Afterwards sophomore Michael Klain said, “We’ll fight every time we’re on the field, in practice, and in games, because we know our goals are still within reach.
Oh, was he right.
Less than a month later, the Crimson sit alone atop the Ivy League after five games. Its 2-1 victory against Dartmouth on Saturday was its fourth in a row by the same margin. Harvard is now 4-1 in one-goal games since the loss to Yale—with the only loss a 3-2 non-conference decision against Boston College where the Crimson took a 2-0 lead into halftime.
“This team continues to fight, they continue to prepare really well,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “They show up the same way they did in the early part of the season. They work, they work, they work.”
A REBOUNDING OFFENSE
 
The main part of Harvard’s resurgence has been a more productive offense. After scoring only three goals in the first five games, Harvard has ten goals in its last five efforts. Overall, the team is averaging 1.8 goals in Ivy League play. The offense has been a team effort, with no individual scorer ranking in the top 10 in the Ancient Eight in goals, but 12 players have scored at least one goal for the team.
On Saturday, the trend continued. In the 12th minute, sophomore Andrew Chang—who had to that point scored only one goal all year—corralled a pass from senior midfielder Ross Friedman and let loose a shot from 25 yards out. Chang’s shot sailed just over the fingertips of the diving Dartmouth goalkeeper for Harvard’s first goal of the night.
“We pride ourselves on taking advantage of every opportunity that we can,” junior forward Philip Fleischman said. “It was a great strike by Chang and it was great to get an early goal and set the tone for the rest of the game.”
The second goal of the game came from senior forward Pascal Mensah in the 41st minute as Harvard took advantage of an unusual opportunity. After an apparent foul on Harvard senior Kevin Harrington went uncalled, the ball rolled back to Big Green goalkeeper James Hickock. Hickock, like many of the others players on both squads, had stopped play awaiting a call by the official. Seeing the ball lying alone in the middle of the box, Mensah ran in from the right side and, after juking a startled Hickock, dribbled the ball into the back of the net.
“It all comes from the mentality of fighting every single day and fighting every single play,” Fleischman said. “We all embody it, and Pascal embodied it in that play, and it is something that we pride ourselves on.” 
 
LEADING WITH EXPERIENCE
 
After the win, Lehrer pointed to the play of co-captains Kevin Harrington and Friedman as the reason for the team’s continued success since four losses in five games to open the season. Friedman has 10 assists on the season and his eight in Ivy League play lead the league. Harrington’s goal in the second overtime against Cornell jump-started the team’s current four-game conference winning streak.
Harrington and Friedman have started all fourteen games and are one-two on the team in shots and points. They have combined for 44 shots, 16 points, and three goals on the year, pacing the Crimson offense. On Saturday, Friedman set up the first goal with his dish to Chang, and Harrington set up Fleischman with two separate chances in front of the goal that the junior forward could not convert.
“Both of those guys have been unbelievable,” Lehrer said. “Kevin on the field, in the locker room, in meetings, those guys just lead from the first moment to the last moment. Obviously it’s huge since it sets a great standing for the rest of the group and it pulls the group higher to a different level.”

Now that we’ve made it halfway through first semester, the fond hopes of moderate snacking and regular exercise have ceded to the reality of unlimited Funilla Vanilla froyo and hours of immobile p-setting. For the 80% of us non-athletes, the only exercise many of us may be getting is the occasional midnight trudge up four flights of stairs to the Language Resource Center.
 
Everyone knows the benefits of exercise extend from physical health to mental well-being, but few of us have the willpower to hike to the MAC on 37-degree mornings or the coordination to kick a soccer ball without stubbing a toe (maybe that’s just me...). Never fear! Flyby has compiled a list of things you can do to begin a healthy lifestyle this fall.
 
Harvard On The MoveIf the prospect of running for longer than between your bean bag and your bed sounds unpleasant, this is the group for you. Harvard On The Move sponsors weekly runs and walks for people with any level of experience. Running is not nearly as awful—it may be enjoyable in fact—when you have a companion, and these community jogs double as a social experience. So you may very well meet a new friend as you increase your speed from sloth to tortoise.
 
Freshman Bootcamp (kind of)Do you know what the word “plyometrics” means? If not, Freshman Bootcamp is a great place to learn. This month-long program sponsored by Harvard Athletics & Recreation and the FDO promises “plyometrics, agility training, core strengthening, interval training, and more!” Unfortunately, this year's bootcamp is finished, but you can still reap the benefits of your peers’ wisdom by finding a friend who did show up to the program and asking him or her to teach you their ways. Even better, find a group of friends who will agree to wear yoga pants and do crunches in the Yard three times a week while the tourists stare in awe and take pictures.
Get Some MovesIf you felt too awkward to bust out your dance moves at Heaven & Hell last weekend, take this opportunity to refine your party skills and build cardiovascular endurance at the same time. The range of options is vast: take a dance class through the Office for the Arts; join a group like Expressions Dance Company, where you can learn hip hop from your peers; get involved in CityStep, where you can teach dance and theater to children in Cambridge public schools. If your schedule is too squeezed, take twenty minutes to groove out to the new Miley Cyrus album with your roommate.
 
Fitness classesHarvard offers a variety of fitness classes (free to Harvard community members!) at the MAC and Hemenway gyms. Relieve your stress with Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, channel Jennifer Aniston in a pilates class, or work on those moves again with Zumba. Mitigate the embarrassment of showing up alone by dragging along a friend. They will thank you afterward—after all, you are doing something good for both of you.
Tweak your scheduleAdd a seven-minute period of high-intensity interval training to your day by scheduling an 11 a.m. French class in Boylston immediately following your 10 a.m. section in Northwest Labs. Wear breathable clothes, sneakers, and extra deodorant for your own sake and that of others.
Of course, if nothing but a brisk walk seems appealing, you can simply hope to get Quadded.

As everyone should know by now, the Red Sox won the World Series last week. There's been much hype about the players, especially Red Sox closer Koji Uehara. It was hard for Red Sox fans to understand what Uehara was feeling under pressure in the final moments of the World Series, however, since he speaks little English. That is, until Yohei Oka, a senior at Harvard who is originally from Tokyo, translated Uehara’s Japanese blog into English. Thanks to Oka, we at Flyby (along with the rest of Red Sox Nation) were able to get a glimpse of Koji Uehara and what he’s all about.
Flyby asked Oka, via email, a few questions about Uehara’s blog and how he got involved. Here's what he wrote.
Flyby: What made you decide to translate Koji's blog? How did you get the gig?Yohei Oka: I received an email from [Theodore J.] Gilman, [executive] director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies [at Harvard], saying that a writer from the Boston Globe was looking for someone to translate Koji's blog. I'm a big fan of the Red Sox and all Japanese players playing in the major leagues, so I jumped at this opportunity and spent all of last weekend translating his blog posts from the beginning of the post season.
Flyby: What has it been like translating the blog?Y.O.: I've done many translating jobs in my life but this was by far the most interesting. I think that watching a lot of baseball games both in English and Japanese has helped me with all the terminology and accurately translating what he writes in Japanese to English. I think that a professional translator who isn't interested in baseball would have had trouble with all the baseball talk.
Flyby: Why do you think people are interested in reading the translated blog?Y.O.: I think that a lot of people are interested in what Koji has to say because he doesn't speak much English and we don't know what he's thinking. He's had an incredible year and just came out of nowhere. We all think he's a strike throwing machine, but he is also human, and his blog captures that side of him.
Flyby: Do you have any thoughts about the World Series? Were you already interested in baseball and the Red Sox before you helped translate Koji's blog?Y.O.: I'm a big baseball fan. I'm also super happy that the Red Sox won during my final year at Harvard. It wasn't the only reason, but part of why I chose to come here to study. I've been a fan of the Sox since Dice-K and Okajima pitched in '07 and have made several trips to Fenway over the past three years. I used to watch a lot of MLB games even when I was living in Tokyo, and watched a lot this year because so many Japanese players had great seasons (Uehara, Tazawa, Darvish, Kuroda, Iwakuma, etc...).
I feel that ever since the marathon bombings, Boston has shown solidarity and that the Sox have been an embodiment of "Boston Strong." They've been a resilient team as you can see from all the comebacks during the post season, and just super fun to watch.
Flyby: What was your favorite part about translating his blog? Also, any favorite quotes from Koji?YO: I had never seen his blog before (I don't really follow anyone's blog) but it was very fascinating to see what goes on inside his head and I now see him pitch in a totally new way. The way he talks about every pitch and every batter he faces reflects his professionalism and his genuine love for the game. Just from reading his blog, you can tell that he's a super modest guy and just crazy in love with the game. Some favorite quotes from his blog include when he's being carried by Ortiz after closing a game and writes: "Am I that light? Or maybe it's that Papi is too strong. I don't mind being carried like this many more times." He also uses a lot of emoticons in his blog which helps express his enthusiasm. After clinching the ALCS, he wrote: “We did it!!! American League Champions!!!  ＼(^o^)／＼(^o^)／＼(^o^)／ I’m so so happy! And to top it all off, I was selected as MVP (#^.^#)(#^.^#)”

Welcome to The Verdict, Flyby's newest advice column!
 
We know most of you on campus consider yourselves to be “tech savvy,” but the ultimate measure of social media success is arguably Instafame. If you’re confused by what that means, stop reading now. Instagram launched in 2010 and over the years other social media forms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) have had to begrudgingly make room for this photo editing and sharing app. Instasuccess is everything. So, naturally, Harvard—recently voted #1 social media college—had to get in on the game; hence the emergence of the popular #HarvardinAutumn hashtag campaign. Whether you’re an Insta veteran or a newbie, everyone can always use a refresher on how to play the Instafield.
 
 Without further ado, we present to you: Instagram 101.
 
1) Ratio → This is the first thing people notice about your profile—so don’t mess it up. The key here is balance. It is important to maintain a high followers : following ratio, but don’t get too carried away with this. 6.8 million followers and you’re following 9 people—who do you think you are, Taylor Swift? (Yes, that is her ratio—c’mon Taylor). It can be tough to maintain your ratio when you’re following too many style bloggers and celebrities, so you’ve got to decide who is really important to you. @beyonce: yes. @kendalljenner: yes. @kimkardashian: check back once a month (thank God for public profiles). @biddythehedgehog: an absolute no. 
2) Hashtags → A way to give meaning to your photos without actually writing full sentences. That would be way too much work for social media.
 
#selfiesunday — Self-explanatory (you’re a tool).#mancrushmonday — See explanation above.#womancrushwednesday — We’ve heard this is a thing, but we’ve never really seen it.#tbt — Definitely a helpful way to find out what day it is, but opinions differ on the flood of childhood pics/old prom photos/vacay grams everyone’s already seen. Olivia’s take: I generally avoid Instagram on Thursdays. Lauren: I spend my week counting down until Thursday and then wait until late at night to check Inst. Yes—she actually said “Inst.”#flashbackfriday — If you missed #tbt (pathetic) or have a few other throwbacks you’re desperate to gram.#latergram — Missed the moment or maybe your phone died. Either way, the hashtag will explain why you’re posting a party pic on a Monday morning.#harvardinautumn — The hashtag sweeping the nation. When you take a beautiful pic on Harvard’s campus, be sure to #harvardinautumn and @harvardu for some Instapublicity. Don’t miss out before it’s too late! Winter is coming.
3) Privacy Settings → To go private or public? Should you stick to one? This is a personal and important decision. You must decide how much you’re willing to share online—and whether you want to maintain an air of mystique or offer yourself and your amazing photos to the Instacommunity. Or should you switch back and forth between the two? A friend of Olivia’s opts for privacy in general, but makes the jump to a public profile when she’s “on vacation or somewhere cool like Coachella where I can post awesome photos. If I’m public, other people who aren’t following me will see mutual followers liking my photos in their feed and then follow me when they see my fabulous photos.”
 
4) Photo Editing → Crucial. With a filter (or two), a bad photo can be transformed into Instagold. Some favorites: Mayfair, Lo-Fi, X Pro. A filter to avoid: Kelvin. Or some, who are sick of the Insta filters and in search for greater variety and precision, edit on other apps—such as Alt Photo, Big Lens, Afterlight, and VSCOcam. Some of the most strategic users even upload photos on a computer, edit, and then, post on Insta… that’s kind of aggressive. And while Instagrams are usually confined to the square shape, Instagrammers can use Whitagram to attain freedom of photo dimensions.
 
5) Photo Content → Photo content can define an Instauser, duh. Are you a foodstragrammer? Solely gram on vacations? Use Insta as a way to complain about all the schoolwork you have? Or just Picstich* your life into oblivion? A selfie-a-day kind of user (the worst)? Choose a variety of photos to gram so you don’t become an Instagram caricature. Oh, yeah, I know her. She’s the one who Instagrams her sushi five times a week. (Note: raw fish never looks good on the 'gram). No one wants to see the same five girls laughing in a different place with the same effect in 50 percent of your grams. And no one wants to see 85 pictures of a mediocre sunset with different geotags. Let’s keep it to one sunset a month, people.
 
6) Geotag → Location, location, location. You’ve got to include one—whether it’s a real place or just an emoji pumpkin (location: Halloween). Geotags just make photos more appealing and add that little extra (essential) piece of information without being overwhelming. And besides, you definitely want people to know that you’re drinking your cappuccino in the Widener stacks.
 
7) Likes → Any Insta user knows that it’s stressful waiting for your photo to reach “numbers,” aka 11 likes. Whether this happens within 30 seconds (we see you, middle school girls) or never (my dad), it’s something that everyone is thinking about. We know people who delete their photo after 15 minutes if it hasn’t reached “enough” (whatever that may be, in their eyes) likes. “If a photo doesn’t reach 30 likes after 24 hours, it’s gone,” one Insta user explains.
 
8) Instavids → Don’t do it.**
 
 
* The act of splicing two (or more—generally too many) photos together in one Instagram. Don’t do this. 
** Download Vine or make use of Snapchat’s video sending feature instead.
The main essay that is read by all colleges you apply to through the Common Application is your Common App essay, so be sure to make this very strong and broadly applicable. The Common App essay is typically something that talks about your personal experiences, something that has happened in the past that has influenced you, for example. Earlier this year, The Admissions Blog gave some advice about where to start with the new Common App essay.
The college essay, on the other hand, is your chance to personalize your statement of interest to a particular college. The college essay is meant for the college to understand more about you, and specifically how you would fit into their school. The college essay is also a way for the college to ask you a specific question they want to hear about from you. So, although the common app essay is the broader one that everyone reads, it's still important to write a strong college-specific essay.
