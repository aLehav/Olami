Many critics remember their first foray “Into the Woods.”
The musical, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine, has the power to strike a chord with viewers young and old by virtue of its captivating storytelling, music, and a message that adapts to a variety of movie and musical theater versions. Director Jake S. Stepansky ’17 staged his take on the show on Dec. 8 and 9 at the American Repertory Theater’s OBERON stage, delivering a production carried by a triumphant cast, although the venue and blocking left much to be desired.
The cast of “Into the Woods” demonstrated their singing chops from the first bars of the show’s “Prologue,” which introduces several characters—including an earnest Cinderella (Arianna N. Paz ’19); a hungry Little Red Riding Hood (Rachel Kahn ’20); a dopey Jack at this point sans Beanstalk (Eli Troen ’20); an old and screechy witch (Ashley LaLonde ’20); and a pragmatic baker (Derek P. Speedy ’18) and his even-more-pragmatic wife (Eliza B. Mantz ’18) struggling to have a child—who ultimately will become tangled up in one another’s Grimm Brothers-esque stories. Paz’s voice sparkled effortlessly, as Cinderella sat dressed in rags wishing to attend the Prince’s ball, and LaLonde as the Witch also tackled Sondheim’s difficult lyrics with incredible, easy diction. “Rooting through my rutabaga, / Raiding my arugula and /  Ripping up the rampion,” the Witch screeches in a tongue-twister of an introduction, describing how the baker’s father uprooted her precious garden. As a simultaneously fun-loving and sincere Baker’s Wife, Mantz sings her part sweetly, and manages to keep the gang in check and the plot moving forward. The musicians on the small, central platform stage where the bulk of the action takes place supported the singers and followed music director Brian J. Ge ’18 attentively throughout the evening.
While several smart prop choices made good use of the cramped cabaret table-filled space, Oberon, time and time again, proves a tricky space for anything less than a completely seat-less, immersive performance like “The Donkey Show,” a motion-filled, discotheque “Midsummer Night’s Dream” which was created by Diane M. Paulus ’88 and continues to book the venue weekly. The good news, first: When Cinderella sang to her bird-friends for help in plucking lentils from her evil stepmother’s hearth, one of the many black-clad ensemble members blew tasteful bubbles to stand in for what could have been clunky, space-consuming props. In addition, at any given time, one of the ensemble members, maneuvered a papier-mâché cow’s head to represent Jack’s cow, Milky White. And lumpy masks disfigured the Wolf (Jake A. Corvino ’19) and the Witch, aiding the actors’ stunning transformations into these characters.
At the same time, however, Oberon’s nooks and crannies—and Stepansky’s directorial choices to use the entire space—obscured much of the action. From certain seats, for example, people could not see Cinderella grieve at the graveside of her soft-voiced mother (Madison E. Deming ’18). Those hemmed in at the front of the house also missed out on several balcony scenes. And the refreshingly youthful rendition of “Agony” (by Corvino and Richard M. Feder ’18) worked well only if it could be seen, which left those with poor vantage points whipping their heads to try to catch a glimpse.
Before the (proverbial) curtain rose, this version of “Into the Woods” welcomed audience members into a warm and inviting Oberon, making it clear that the show would attempt to unfold using all of the assets that the venue could offer. Guests over 21 could purchase festive themed drinks—how about a Gin Slipper, Rapunzel’s Tower, or Spicy Red, thank you very much?—and mingled against a backdrop of gauzy white curtains, twinkling string lights, and smooth jazz. Despite the neck-crane-inducing blocking, this rendition of “Into the Woods” with its talented cast reaffirmed that children, of whatever age, will listen. And see. And learn.

UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 11:00 p.m.
Octavia Spencer—famous for her Oscar-winning role in “The Help”—defended the Hasty Pudding amid claims of elitism regarding the Theatricals’ all-male cast. “We have to give credit where credit is due,” she said, alluding to her own honor as the 2017 Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Woman of the Year on Jan. 26. Spencer is currently up for another Oscar for her supporting role in “Hidden Figures,” a film about three black women vital to NASA’s launch of an astronaut into orbit.
When The Harvard Crimson asked Spencer about her role in an institution that does not accept women as members of its cast, Spencer pointed to the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ continued efforts to include the opposite sex. “The only way to bring about change is to take that first step. And I think they’ve taken those first steps a while ago,” Spencer said. She referred to the past 66 women crowned Women of the Year by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals as markers of improvement. “That’s a lot of steps, and we have to applaud them for that.”
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals has come under fire for keeping an all-male cast, despite the coed auditions. “[Hasty Pudding’s] history might be that of elitism,” Spencer said. “But hello—they just brought me into the fold. So they can’t be that elitist.” Out of 67 Women of the Year, Spencer is the sixth black to be awarded this honor. As of 2017, however, no Asian American or Latina woman has received the award.
The Oscar-winner had a piece of advice for aspiring actresses of color. “Train. It’s like being a boxer. It’s like being a runner…It’s a long haul. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success.” In 2002, Spencer played a check-in girl in director Sam Raimi’s “Spiderman.” This March, Spencer will play God in “The Shack.” “Know that you have to buy a good pair of sneakers and train. But if you stay in the game long enough you will win. You will win a race. The question is: Will you be persistent at it?” Spencer added.
Spencer has won a Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA, and now a Pudding Pot after her performance at the roast. After the Hasty Pudding president Guan-Yue Chen ’17 and vice president Daniel S. Milaschewski ’17 noted her role as a prostitute in “Bad Santa” and “Bad Santa 2,” a costumed Santa Claus ran on stage, deeming Spencer a member of his “naughty list.” From there, Spencer had to complete a number of tasks in order to earn her Pudding Pot, including throwing a chocolate pie at one of three actors. Spencer ended up pieing an actor playing Kellyanne Conway, yelling her iconic line from “The Help”: “Eat. My. Shit.”
Later, Spencer spoke about some of the more political implications of the pie. “We have a new president, and I’m waiting for him to demonstrate that he will be the president of all of us, of these United States,” Spencer said. “So in that moment of levity, I enjoyed giving [Conway] the pie. But you know, she’s a woman, and she needs to understand why women are speaking out in fear of some of the rights we’ve already litigated now being revisited.”
The roast garnered laughter from the audience as Spencer ran through a giant poster of her face and belted out the lyrics to “I Feel Good” as she fought off a fictional asteroid. Not every audience member was purely amused. “I thought the event was really well put together and highly entertaining, but it also highlighted Harvard's continued infatuation with status and power,” Alexander N. Lee ’17 said.

This article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 1, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that Hasty Pudding Theatricals has only recently allowed women to audition for its cast. In fact, women have been allowed to audition for some time, though women are not members of the cast.

PHOX, an indie-folk band from Wisconsin, is a joy to listen to. Last Friday, they played a sold-out Brighton Music Hall show on their national tour. The Hall’s muted lighting, brick walls, and exposed ceiling supports made for a fitting venue for the band’s classic indie sound. At 9 p.m., opening band Cuddle Magic began the show, playing a set that had flashes of brilliance but was mostly too generic to really shine in the face of the band to come. Cuddle Magic released their latest album “Ashes/Axes” on the day of the show and are currently touring with PHOX.
The crowd appeared to enjoy their performance enough to provide raucous applause at the end of each song and, more impressively, to observe a few minutes of almost complete silence when Cuddle Magic made their way into the center of the room for a “super quiet song.” The band played a soulful rendition of “Expectations” off their 2010 album “Pictures” in the midst of the crowd. After returning to the stage and finishing their set, Cuddle Magic signed off, and PHOX took the stage.
PHOX does not seem to be touring for anything particularly timely. Their debut and latest album released in 2014, though they are currently putting together music for a second album. (Perhaps, as their website says, they are just trying to escape the Wisconsin winter.) So when lead vocalist Monica Martin opened with an oldie but a goodie—a really, really goodie—“Kingfisher,” fans weren’t likely to complain. Over the course of the evening, the band ran through other favorites like “1936,” “Slow Motion,” and “Evil.” In total, they played a 14-song set, one of which Martin dedicated to Planned Parenthood, and a two-song encore.
PHOX’s music is serenely beautiful and often evokes a yearning for simplicity. Each member of the band is individually quite talented—Jason Krunnfusz provided great harmony and solid bass lines, and Martin’s smoky soprano is unmistakably the musical calling card of the ensemble—but the true joy of listening to PHOX is hearing their talents mesh together. The harmonies and countermelodies of their discography create a soundscape unlike anything else in modern music. Each song communicates its own particular emotional message, leading the listener through the story behind each piece. Listening to the studio recordings, one learns that story through lyrics; at this show, where audio issues and inadvisable live mixing decisions pushed the words into almost indistinguishable reverb, the music itself did the job. It was at once less clear and more pure than what one could hear on Spotify or YouTube.
Early in the show, Martin segued to another song with an offhand comment: “Here is a song about something else sad,” referring to the early pieces. Though it is surely somewhat melancholic, PHOX’s work is not sad, per se; songs are about loss, sadness, and “attractive people being indifferent to you,” as Martin explained one new song’s inspiration. But musically, playfulness abounds in their discography, with sweeping highs from the strings, lively bass lines, and often groovy beats from the percussion. So, despite Martin’s warning, PHOX’s concert, like their songs, wasn’t really sad, but rather as complex in meaning as the human experience: sad in subject, but contented in reflection.

Lorenzo Benitez, a filmmaker and student at Cornell University, investigated the controversial topic of voluntourism with his recent feature-length documentary, “Six Months to Salvation.” The film follows seven students on their trip to rural Thailand to teach English to a community of Karen people. The volunteers find their idealism eroding over the course of the film as they face difficulties and moral ambiguity in their work. “Six Months to Salvation” grapples with questions about the colonialist implications of voluntourism and globalization. Last week, Benitez talked to The Crimson about the making of the film.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you first conceive of this film? Did you start out with an angle of criticizing “voluntourism” in mind, or were you pretty optimistic about volunteering in the beginning?
Lorenzo Benitez: Personally I was more just curious.… When I walked in I didn’t know if it would be critical of voluntourism documentary or something that celebrated the good work that people do abroad. Initially I signed up with a bit of optimism. Before I went on the trip I’d been exposed to other people who’d had negative things to say about these voluntourist trips, and that’s what prompted me to make a film about it, because there’s an issue that there [are] two conflicting sides that don’t necessarily have a lot of evidence other than anecdotal hearsay. So I thought: What’s more concrete evidence to enlighten the evidence on either side than if you have a journalistic piece of evidence about voluntourism itself?
THC: What is the significance of the title “Six Months to Salvation”?
LB: It wasn’t me who made up the title, it was one of my co-editors. It was literally six months, and as for the “salvation” part, we originally [thought] it would have more heavy implications about religion in Thailand since we were traveling with a religious organization, and the communities we lived in were Christian in an otherwise incredibly Buddhist country. Even though we lost the religious component, we thought the word salvation was still good enough to keep because the question becomes who are the people we’re trying to find salvation for—mostly the poor people of the Karen hill tribe, or primarily for the voluntourist? Let’s be honest. Are we doing this mostly for ourselves?
THC: It was interesting to hear Fr Vinai Boonlue, the Karen priest and anthropologist, argue that the Western anxiety about cultures being “erased” is like the impulse to put “other” people’s culture in museums, and treat them as static. He also argued that English language and culture are simply becoming integrated into the constantly evolving culture of the Karen people, and that it is better to share new knowledge and open up new options that now exist. How do you feel about this issue?
LB: Well, I hope that it’s the case in the film that my opinion doesn’t necessarily dictate. I was just trying to purely express it without either endorsing or condoning the idea. It’s been actually more than a year and a half since I finished editing this film, so it’s been some time. I’d probably say that now that I think about it, his argument has a lot of merit. I think the interesting thing that he notices about how a lot of other people are critical of the loss of culture like that [is that] it’s almost like condescending or patronizing to say to people “You can’t advance or play games in the capitalistic system in which you will inevitably be exposed to by the forces of globalization. You have to preserve your own little quaint culture.” That argument bothers me, and I think Vinai is correct to identify that that’s the nature of the world. Sadly it’s the case that you no longer go to Japan today [and see] the Japan of the Meiji dynasty. What these other cultures are going through is that they also want to speak English in addition to speaking their original language, if they want to become employable, or if they want to position themselves as competitive players in the services market. And so it’s a Karen person’s right to do that, because you can’t say to them that there’s a culture that they have that has to be preserved.... If they’ve made their own moral choice to do it, then why not? I guess you lose with globalization that authenticity that once existed eons ago, but you gain so much.… Being exposed to multiple cultures in your life is a great thing.

The film starts with murmurs, and ends with the statement “Maybe nothing was said.” In between, we see a young director named Edgar auditioning actors of all age groups, from all social classes, for an ambitious—eventually failed—film project about love. But the project is not exactly just about love. “Do you understand it's not a story about Eglantine,” he asks his actress, “but a story about a moment in history, about history moving through Eglantine?”
And this is what troubles Edgar: his insistence on historicizing love. He claims that the film has to include people of three age groups, youngsters, adults, and the elderly, to capture how love evolves and erodes with the passage of time and the accumulation of memories. “Or else the project’s dead,” he says to his producer. “It becomes a Julia Roberts film…. Hollywood, not history.” To his dismay, the kind of filmmaking that he despises is taking over. In the second part of the film, he visits an old couple who are veterans from French Resistance. They have just decided to sell their life stories to Steven Spielberg, to be adapted into a blockbuster in which “all the young girls will get undressed.” The old couple’s granddaughter, who wants to to prevent this transaction together with Edgar, asks him, “When did the gaze collapse?”
Edgar doesn’t know. He is disappointed about the state of cinema, but he is equally frustrated about his own inability to make the kind of film he wants. He doesn’t know how to present the complexities of love—or any other emotions—and their connections with history and memory. After all, how can one possibly historicize love? At museums, one sees ancient artifacts with descriptions such as “It was a cooking utensil,” or “It was given from the king to the queen to embody her status,” but one rarely sees descriptions such as “It was kept by its owner because it reminded him of the smell of what his mother would cook for him on a cold winter morning,” or “It was given from the king to the queen because he was madly in love with her.” It would be unfair to blame archeologists for such exclusions, since emotions are by their nature amorphous and elusive, less easily reconstructed than material objects. Nevertheless, one should not forget that emotions are in fact events that happen in history, and when she loses their trace she is losing a whole dimension of truth that is integral to any historical artifact. “It’s strange, in fact, how things take on meaning when the story ends,” Edgar says to the veteran’s granddaughter as he recalls a breakup with an old lover. “It’s because History is coming in, with a big H,” she says.
The whole point of Edgar’s project is to preserve emotions as a dimension of history, but he too loses trace of them as they dissolve in time. However, as the film unfolds, it nevertheless takes the shape of a history of love: that of Edgar’s own. We realize that he is in love with the veterans’ granddaughter and that he wants her to play the protagonist in his project. We also get a clearer grasp of the narrative: The first part of “In Praise of Love,” in which Edgar is auditioning actors, takes place in the present time, and the second part, in which Edgar meets the veterans’ granddaughter, happened two years ago and is recalled by Edgar as he struggles with his project. In a twist typical of the film’s director Jean-Luc Godard, the present is shot in velvety black-and-white film, and the past in almost Fauvist color video, which could have been a counterintuitive decision for most other filmmakers. The visual experimentations blend the boundary between past, present, memory, and imagination—the blown-out video footage reminds the audience of the decay of memories, while shooting the present in black and white seems to suggest that every present moment will eventually become a point in history and memory (Can one really distinguish the two?). The second part of the film helps the audience understand Edgar’s motivation in the first, and eventually we realize that this is not a history of love as it actually is, but a history of love as it is remembered, recalled, and reconstructed by Edgar. This is why he can never make his film: As soon as emotions are recorded in an external, objective, medium, they lose the subjective qualities that define them. They can only exist in the boundary of one’s body.
This is Godard’s answer to Edgar’s question of historicizing love, one that is grim but not completely devoid of hope. Even if emotions can not be preserved by external media and have to eventually fade away, we as human beings are vessels of our own memories. As we keep on living, we carry with us a portion of human memories that cannot be replicated, and our personal histories—constructed by emotions—connect to the present by impacting who we are and how we perceive the world. Towards the end of the film, Edgar makes an observation that he repeats in the opening, “You can only think about something if you think of something else. For instance, I see a landscape that is new to me, but it’s new to me because I compare it in my mind to another landscape, an older one, one that I knew.”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s recent email regarding the establishment of a faculty committee to possibly revise or replace the College’s sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social organizations represents the latest chapter in the policy’s history since its unveiling last spring. Given the breadth of this policy across all unrecognized single-gender social organizations and its intrusion into student life, it is unfortunate but understandable that the sanctions have been at best a controversial move and at worst a public relations disaster.
Originally drawn up by administrators behind closed doors, the sanctions were announced as a way to combat sexual assault on campus, accusations that primarily implicated male final clubs. Despite this, the policy, which also affects female final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, has drawn debate and outcry from not only students, but also faculty. Most recently, professors debated and questioned the lack of faculty input on the shape of the sanctions at a December faculty meeting. However, the meeting adjourned without a vote on a motion against the policy. Harvard must hear student and faculty voices before making significant changes, especially with policies like these sanctions that have serious and far-reaching implications. Such input is critical to crafting improved measures and avoiding future public backlash.
That said, we commend the University for recognizing the limits of its prior approach and rethinking its decision after the faculty outcry. Even as the Implementation Committee continues its work on how best to implement the current policy, the formation of a new faculty committee by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith to study “whether the policy can be improved” will provide additional insight that should be valuable in refining the sanctions. There can only be benefits in incorporating the concerns and perspectives of more faculty members, a view furthered by University President Drew G. Faust’s statements on the coming committee’s work: “If there’s another [policy] that gets us there…if there’s a better idea I welcome it.”
Nevertheless, we recognize that the concurrent processes of planning implementation and considering revision create complications for current and, especially, future students. These uncertainties are unfair to the Class of 2021. Given that the new faculty committee will not present recommendations until the fall, that class will have to choose whether to attend with still-unanswered questions surrounding their possible experience at the College. We hope that Harvard considers this kind of issue with large policy changes in the future.
It is imperative to include all perspectives in the University’s direction and keep in mind all the members of the Harvard community, both present and future.

There's been a concerning trend of white people thinking their feelings matter.
To be more precise: there’s been a concerning trend of white people believing that their emotional reality is a morally relevant catalyst for racial liberation.
This trend is nothing new. It’s been around for as long as black bodies have been fighting for freedom. It looks something like this:
I’m a young black college student, and I’m talking to another college student—they’re white. The conversation meanders into race—the effect of racialized beauty standards on black youth, let’s say. I state my claim: “White supremacy has forced black people to hate the way they look. This must end.”
This white student vehemently disagrees. They say something to the effect of “Nothing like what you describe exists or has such an effect on black people. There is nothing to end.”
We’ve clearly dug ourselves into a standoff due to standpoint. They acknowledge this; they say “I suppose if I were black, I would feel these effects you speak of.” Then they say this: “Here, why don’t you help me truly feel what it’s like to be black and experience these effects! I’ll put myself in your shoes. And then, once I understand what you mean, I’ll do what I can to help!”
This may not seem like a very extraordinary statement. Our modern social justice movement is rooted in this sentiment. “Walk a mile in their shoes”, we’re told. “Understand.” And the unspoken threat, the “or else”: “Or else you cannot help them.”
Anyone who’s studied standpoint theory can tell you that they—standpoints—don’t change that easily. One can’t just wish one’s way to understanding what it means to be black, or femme, or undocumented. A white person can’t just watch “Precious”, cry, and suddenly identify with their black friends.
Try this: Take your white friend to watch “Twelve Years A Slave”. After, sit them down. Look them dead in the eye. Then say, “You are a n***er.” They’ll feel uncomfortable, sure. Maybe even shaken. But now imagine if that same white person walked past you on the street and reminded you: “You are a n***er.”
See, oppression is something that happens to you. One can’t, through sheer force of will, recreate the experience of being black in a white supremacist world. So it doesn’t matter how many times a white person reads "The Fire Next Time” or how many black friends they have. They will never feel the sting of “n***er” etched into their forehead.
But what if they could? What if there was a way to, if not manufacture the direct experience, create an approximation that does the job? In fact, one might point to Jane Elliot, the Iowan schoolteacher who created the famous “blue-eye/brown-eye” experiment. In 1968, after the murder of Dr. King, Elliot decided to teach her students about racism by establishing a mini-hierarchy in the classroom. Students with blue eyes were given special privileges and rights, and those with brown were treated as second-class. The result? The white students gained a “new understanding” of how “awful” racism was, and thus, the assumption goes, became allies and supporters of black liberation.
This sounds like the answer to all our problems. But there’s an even deeper problem, one that the empathy approach fails to address. Elliot tried to help her students understand what it meant to be black by making them suffer as though they were black. In other words, she gave her students ownership of the black struggle. To convince her students that white supremacy was bad, she made them part of the ethical conundrum—not as bystanders or perpetrators, but as victims.
What does this mean? It means that modern-day progressivism is rooted in a egotistical belief that white people should only be expected to care about something when it affects them. Social progress has become the project of the oppressors, not the oppressed. It’s not enough for us to express our suffering. For anyone to give a damn, we have to make our suffering theirs. We have to allow white people to regain their place at the center of the moral universe.
We’ve abandoned any semblance of caring about others. Claims on our universality, claims on our humanness, have become a sly tactic by those in power to reappropriate social struggle. Unless it is about me, white people say, I won’t care. The impetus for liberation is no longer the wretched of the earth crying out for freedom. It is the sluggish, self-satisfied empathy of the privileged.
No, I ain’t your Uncle Tom. I will not scrape and dance and twist narratives so that you can assert yourself in the moral gymnastics our generation struggles through. I will not hand you the reins. I will present reality as it is. And you will step aside and let me have the liberation I, and millions like me, need to survive. If you can’t see why that matters, if you can’t divorce yourself from justice, then you’re part of the problem.

UPDATED: Jan. 31, 2017, at 9:19 p.m. 
On Thursday February 2nd, the Institute of Politics will host “A Conversation with Henry Kissinger.” On its website, the IOP describes the controversial statesman with two titles:
“Henry A. Kissinger
Chairman, Kissinger Associates, Inc.
56th United States Secretary of State”
They neglect a third, more accurate label: War Criminal.
During his brief tenure at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy, Kissinger got a lot done. In his first two years in office, he helped Richard Nixon sabotage Vietnamese peace talks for his own political gain, expanded that war into Laos and Cambodia (the destabilizing effects of which would pave the way for the rise of the Khmer Rouge and the death of up to two million people), and advocated the bombing of, in his own words, “anything that moves.”
In 1971, Kissinger backed Pakistan in its war against Bangladesh despite evidence of massacre and rape. In ‘73, he orchestrated a military coup against the democratically elected Allende regime of Chile, installing in its stead the violently oppressive Pinochet dictatorship. And in ‘75, the then-Secretary of State lent his tacit support to President Suharto of Indonesia―himself a despot already responsible for the mass killings of hundreds of thousands―in the deadly conquest of East Timor. Kissinger himself, in proposing an intervention in Cyprus, summed up his philosophy best: “The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer.”
Appalling though this all may be, Kissinger’s most enduring legacy is subtler in its malignance. The foreign policy of Henry Kissinger is defined, above all, by an utter contempt for human life and absolute pursuit of “American interests.” For every one of Kissinger’s crimes that goes unpunished and for every bit of praise he receives, the belief that the United States can do whatever it wants with the rest of the world is further concretized. Behind every thoughtless, disastrous intervention since then―behind the mujahideen and the Contras, behind the Iraq war and the El Mozote Massacre―is the work of Henry Kissinger.
When the IOP invites Henry Kissinger to the Harvard Kennedy School with no representation of opposition views, they are doing more than “hosting a conversation.” They are providing a platform for the insidious belief that the lives of others, particularly those of poor people of color in the “developing” world, are mere pawns in the pursuit of American ends. Like telling a racist joke, the harm of this “conversation” is not merely in the act itself, but also in the seeds that it sows in our cultural consciousness―the legitimization that it confers.
That this legitimization is specifically for an audience of aspiring public servants, under the guise of a Harvard education, is all the worse. Student opposition to Kissinger, by now a 50 year old tradition, is not about quibbling over minor political differences or attacking the man himself. It is about resistance to a particularly pernicious ideology and our educational institutions’ roles in promoting it.
As virulent nationalism and disdain for foreigners reaches new heights, this resistance is now more important than ever. Decades before the phrase propelled Donald Trump to the presidency, Kissinger was in action, if not in words, a champion of the jingoist “America First!” doctrine. It is of little wonder, then, that Kissinger recently called Trump’s presidency “an extraordinary opportunity,” and believes Trump “has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president.”
Boston Magazine’s recent takedown of the Kennedy School admonished its “reverence for power.” HKS, it claims, and I have seen from within, is more interested in bringing in VIP speakers and churning out high-powered alum than in nurturing good public servants. What better example of this adulation of power, of the Kennedy School’s fetishization of “success,” than this.
In some ways, the deed is done for now. The IOP has already created the event, and it will, in all likelihood, be packed to the gills. So boycott if you’d like, or attend if you must. But whatever the choice, we must choose with an eye to the future.
We must arm ourselves with full knowledge of Kissinger’s legacy, not the sanitized version we will be presented with on Thursday. We must be wary of the discursive influence of the Harvard brand and the Forum’s platform. And above all, we must resist the normalization of his insidious brand of imperialist-infused Machiavellianism.
Henry Kissinger is the embodiment of all that Kennedy School students, aspiring public servants, should strive not to be. And the Kennedy School should not normalize his crimes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 8:47 p.m.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 has withdrawn a motion opposing the College’s penalties for members of single-gender social organizations after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced last week that the sanctions could be “revised or replaced” by a faculty committee.
In a letter addressed to University President Drew G. Faust and Khurana, Lewis, a vocal opponent of the original policy, thanked Faust and Khurana for creating a faculty committee that will review the policy and submit recommendations for potentially revising it by the fall of 2017. In an interview last week, Khurana mentioned Lewis’s motion, filed last May, as a factor in his decision to open the sanctions to revision.

Despite voicing agreement with the spirit of the new committee, Lewis wrote that he would not rule out bringing the motion—which states that Harvard “shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join”—to the floor of the Faculty again.
“If the policy is reaffirmed without adequate revision, however, I expect that the motion, or one similar to it, will be reintroduced,” Lewis wrote.
In May, Khurana announced the historic policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, prohibits members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for fellowships.
Lewis and 11 other professors crafted the motion opposing the sanctions shortly after Khurana’s announcement. In the fall, Lewis’s motion was at the at the center of controversy and debate among faculty members, some of whom charged that administrators did not properly consult professors when initially crafting the policy.
“But with the immediate threat of injury and trespass on faculty rights somewhat tempered, it would not be a good use of Faculty time to debate a matter which may become operationally moot,” Lewis wrote.
In an emailed statement, Khurana welcomed Lewis and other faculty members’ input, writing that “Harvard College is fortunate to have a community where faculty care so deeply about students and their well-being.”
“I believe we all want the same thing for our students—an equitable and inclusive institution,” he added. “While we sometimes differ in figuring out how best to achieve this result, I believe our differing perspectives create an opportunity for dialogue and finding common ground.”
According to motion signatory and classics professor Richard F. Thomas, Lewis had the final call on whether to withdraw the motion, though many signatories discussed its potential withdrawal.
In his letter, Lewis wrote that the faculty committee should specify “exactly what ‘problems’ need to be solved.” Critics of the new policy charged administrators with conflating concerns of gender equity, sexual assault, and social inclusivity in crafting the sanctions.
Despite the withdrawal, some signatories remain wary of administrator’s commitment to potential revision of the policy. Richard M. Losick, a biology professor who signed the motion, said that he was skeptical of Khurana’s announcement because the current policy will remain in effect while the committee reviews the sanctions.
Losick said he would have preferred the administration to scrap the policy altogether and then consult faculty.
“I found it disturbing that they haven’t really changed things,” he said. “ It’s as if they’re trying to paper it over and make it seem more legitimate without having a clean slate.”
Losick and Thomas both said that they would support Lewis in creating another motion if the committee did decided to not alter the sanctions. But Losick said that the committee would, at least, improve the problem of lack of faculty consultation.
“There is a more general widespread trend in which more and more authority is shifted from the faculty to administrators, and that’s very disappointing,” he said.

UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 10:13 p.m.
An unconfirmed bomb threat left Harvard largely unperturbed Monday as Cambridge and Harvard police cleared the area between Jefferson Labs and the Littauer Building in an investigation that lasted roughly 30 minutes.
At around 3:37 p.m., Steven G. Catalano, a Harvard University Police Department spokesperson, sent an email to Harvard affiliates alerting them of the unconfirmed threat, warning people to avoid the area. But by 4:13 p.m., police had cleared the area. No buildings were evacuated and classes in the surrounding area continued despite the investigation.
Police officers and bomb-sniffing dogs inspected the parking lot in search of the alleged bomb, though the overall police presence was minor. Students continued to walk through the scene uninhibited while police were present. At one point, a news helicopter circled overhead.
Jeremy Warnick, Director of Communications and Media Relations for the Cambridge Police Department said that the unfounded threat was solely verbal.
According to students and staff who were in Jefferson Labs during the bomb threat, activities in the building went on largely unaffected during the 30 minute course of the investigation.
Monday’s incident marks the University’s fourth bomb threat in approximately three years. A threat in Nov. 2015 prompted the evacuation of four campus buildings, including classrooms and a freshman dormitory. A threat in May led to the evacuation of one building on the Harvard Business School campus. In Dec. 2013, a College sophomore emailed an unfounded bomb threat, resulting in evacuations and cancelled exams.
Elisabeth Cheries, an executive assistant who works in Jefferson, said she was unfazed by the bomb threat.
“We’re sort of numb to it as this point, unless something actually blows up in front of us,” Cheries said.
One graduate student, Rhine Samajdar, was studying on the first floor of Jefferson when he received the message from HUPD announcing the bomb threat. Samajdar said the threat did not cause panic in the building and  did not disrupt a weekly physics colloquium taking place on the floor above him.
“Nobody really evacuated the building,” Samajdar said. “There was no panic. Like I said, there’s a colloquium tea going on upstairs, and everyone was just busy with cookies and tea.”

UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 10:40 p.m.
ImeIme A. Umana ’14 will be the first black woman to serve as President of the Harvard Law Review, the legal journal announced Monday.
Umana, who hails from Harrisburg, Pa., will be the 131st leader of the organization. As a Harvard undergraduate in Lowell House, she earned a joint concentration in government and African American studies and served as the president of the Institute of Politics.
Michael L. Zuckerman ’10, the outgoing president of the Law Review, wrote in an email that he is excited to see where Umana will take the publication in the coming year.
“ImeIme is one of the most brilliant, thoughtful, and caring people I've ever met, and the Law Review is in phenomenally good hands,” Zuckerman wrote.
Candidates for the Law Review’s top post must answer questions from a forum of editors, write responses to submitted questions, and participate in mock editorial activities, according to Zuckerman. This year’s field of 12 candidates featured eight women and eight people of color, Zuckerman wrote.
“ImeIme's election as the Law Review's first female black president is historic,” Zuckerman wrote. “For a field in which women and people of color have for too much of our past been marginalized or underrepresented, her election is an important and encouraging step toward a richer and more inclusive legal conversation.”
As president, Umana will oversee more the than 90 student editors and permanent staff members who make up the Law Review and communicate with writers, including senior faculty members. “Knowing ImeIme, I can't wait to applaud her in a year's time for the extraordinary work that I am certain she will do,” Zuckerman wrote.
Umana’s election comes as the Law Review aims to accept editors from a wider variety of backgrounds. Last year, the legal journal elected the most diverse class of editors in its history, and in 2013 it expanded its affirmative action policy to include gender as a factor in its admissions process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After about a year in Washington directing the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, former Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray returned to Cambridge this month to resume teaching.
In Washington, Murray oversaw more than $5 billion in federal research funding and spearheaded the rewriting of the scientific integrity policy for the Department of Energy. This term, Murray is teaching Engineering Sciences 26 "Humanities and Its Challenges," which explores “engineering design to solve humanity’s major challenges,” like climate change and overpopulation.
Murray served as the school’s dean from July 1, 2009 to Dec. 31, 2014, when she stepping down to teach. In August 2015, she was nominated by then-President Obama to the directorship position. The United States Senate confirmed her for the post in December of the same year.
In Washington, Murray’s Office of Science—the largest supporter of basic physical science research in the country—oversaw 10 Energy Department national laboratories and provided funding to thousands of researcher.
Murray also led a group within the Department of Energy that worked to rewrite its scientific integrity policy, which was released in the last few weeks of Ernest J. Moniz’s term as Energy Secretary. Murray she said the policy has been well-received, though she said she did not initially expect to work on it..
After President Trump’s election, some scientists and researchers have raised concerns about scientific research funding. Under the Trump administration and the potential leadership of Secretary of Energy nominee Rick Perry, Murray said she expects a decrease in support for applied energy.
“I will say that the Office of Science is the largest funder of physical science research in the country, and it usually has bipartisan support. There is considerable bipartisan support for science,” she said. “What may change under the new administration is support for applied energy. They may have a challenge.”
Murray said she anticipates the confirmation process for her former position will be lengthy. MIT professor Marc A. Kastner was nominated as Director of the Office of Science before Murray, but he never earned Senate approval or received a confirmation vote. Murray’s four month wait was quick by comparison.
Even in the absence of both an Energy Secretary and an Office of Science director, Murray said the office will continue to operate as it normally would.
“The Department of Energy has 22 presidential nominees [who] come in at the very top of each office,” she said. “There are career federal employees who are running the offices, so the department runs whether they have those [nominees] or not,” she said.
Though Murray said she looks forward to teaching again, she said she is readjusting to an academic's lifestyle.
“When I first left the Department of Energy, and I showed up in my house in Cambridge, I felt this incredible withdrawal from the federal government where things happen every day,” Murray said. “And I’m getting over that feeling of withdrawal.”

UPDATED: January 31, 2017 at 1:16 p.m. 
Dozens of Cambridge residents advocated for building more bike lanes around Cambridge at a City Council Monday, criticizing the rate of bike lane construction proposed in a report from City Manager Louis A. DePasquale.
Following a number of cycling accidents and fatalities in Cambridge in past months, citizens said they supported the city’s pilot program that installed “pop-up” bike lanes, but also pressured the council to act more aggressively on bike safety. They called for the city to quickly construct additional bike lanes. DePasquale's report comes after the city installed protected bicycle lanes along two sections of Massachusetts Avenue in front of Harvard Law School and Cambridge’s Lafayette Square. City Councillors and Cambridge residents praised the lanes, which separate cyclists from parked cars and traffic.
Following a lengthy public comment period, City Councillor Craig A. Kelley said he supported moving forward with planning and development of more bike lanes, but spoke of the necessity of communicating clearly with the public about when and where development would be taking place.“We need to clarify expectations,” he said. “It still seems to be going slowly.”
DePasquale responded to criticisms that his report did propose the construction of bike lanes in a timely manner, arguing that the city needs to both move forward with bike lane construction rapidly and ensure that members of the public have a chance to comment on the plans.
“I really think we are moving at a very reasonable pace,” DePasquale said. “Some people say we're moving too fast. There’s a real balance there...we’re trying to be responsive.”
Councillors also said at the meeting they were pleased by city commissioners’ efforts to places pieces of art in Cambridge businesses. The efforts follow previous requests by the Council to develop a better way to allocate grants and fund local artists.“This is exactly what we asked for,” Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said.
Attendees also discussed a proposal considering the installation of 50 to 60 cigarette butt disposal stations around the city. The proposal came just weeks after a 10-alarm fire in East Cambridge, which investigators say was caused by “careless disposal of smoking material.”

A crowd of Harvard affiliates filled Ticknor lounge Monday to hear performances celebrating Middle Eastern people and cultures following President Donald Trump’s executive order that suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
The event, called “WE are what makes America Great,” featured scheduled performances from Harvard affiliates and allowed attendees to access an open mic. The Harvard College Iranian Association, Harvard Islamic Society, Harvard College Pakistan Student Association, Society of Arab Students, and Harvard African Students’ Association organized the event soon after news broke of the executive order.
HCIA board member Layla Kousari ’17 helped organize the event with what she called a goal of creating a place to “have some pride and display our heritage.”
“Recently a lot of identities—even identities beyond what was represented here—have been put under attack by the presidency,” she said. “The idea was that the identities that this President is wanting everyone to fear have a lot to celebrate.”
The event’s performances featured spoken word poetry, musical numbers, and speeches about Middle Eastern culture and identity in America and abroad. Zena Agha, a graduate student at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, read two original poems, one of which described London’s diversity, which she attributed to influences from the city’s many immigrants. Tajrean Rahman ’20 delivered a spoken word performance in which she spoke about feeling excluded in America.
“There isn’t a United States of America,” Rahman read. “There is an ‘us’ and ‘them.’”
Tunisian students Medhi Aourir ’17 and Nobras Jemel ’19 performed songs with an oud, an instrument used frequently in Arabic and North African music. Aourir sang “The Arab Dream,” which some audience members said they found moving.
“I actually teared up during the song ‘The Arab Dream,’ [which] kind of encompasses the Arab dream really, just wanting to unite in the face of struggles,” said Nadia Ali ’17.
Four performers from the Boston Dabke Troupe danced in a final planned performance before the open mic session. The dance troupe invited audience members up to the floor and taught them the steps to the Arab folk dance.
In the open mic portion of the event, several audience members including HIS board member Anwar Omeish ’19 also participated in the event in a personal capacity.
“I participated in a not-affiliated with HIS way, in a personal way because I’m the only Libyan student at the college, and that’s a lot to carry and I’ve been carrying that and stories of my family,” Omeish said.
Audience members said they found the event comforting in the wake of controversial political events during Trump’s 10-day presidency.
“What really stood out was how many people showed up and it shows how deeply this ban has impacted a lot of people. It also shows the strong sense of support that there is here,” said Meyling E. Galvez ‘18.
“This event was a space that allowed for some kind of emotional processing, but it also was just a reflection of how people are feeling. People are scared. People are upset. That’s how it is,” Omeish said.

UPDATED: January 31, 2017 at 12:39 p.m. 
Rent for apartments owned by Harvard University Housing will increase an average of 3 percent in the 2017-2018 school year, the University announced last week, drawing criticism from some graduate students who live in the apartments.

To determine this year’s rent for its properties, HUH analyzed market-rate rent for over 8,000 apartments over the past three years. The University combed through data from multiple sources outside Harvard to generate proposals for increased rent, and a committee of faculty from across the University endorsed the proposed rent increase. Only eligible Harvard affiliates can live in HUH’s 3,000 apartments.
Current residents of HUH apartments who extend their lease for a year will experience, on average, a 2.5 percent increase in rent, while rent for tenants who move into HUH apartments this year will go up by an average of 3 percent, according to the Harvard Gazette.
Some graduate and professional school students who rent their apartments from Harvard criticized the rent increase.
“I would think that, given the amount that students already are paying as far as finances are concerned, I think that increasing the rent might not be the best idea at present, especially considering the financial constraints that most students are under,” Robin A. Ladd, a student at the Law School, said.
Aric Flemming, a Divinity School student, also said she disapproved of the proposed rent increases.
“I think the school should always serve the interest of the students and I don’t think that, if it can be helped, their raising the cost of anything would help students,” he said.
Some students said they were generally satisfied with their Harvard housing, if not this year's rent increase..
“This is my third year living in Harvard housing, and Harvard has been an excellent landlord in many respects,” said Sam Klug, a graduate student in History who lives in Peabody Terrace, housing owned by the University. "My rent increased 4.7% this year, however, which is substantially more than the 3% raise for GSAS students that the administration advertised widely"
University spokespeople Anna Cowenhoven and Ann Hall declined to comment for this story.
HUH’s decision to charge market rent on its apartments is consistent with the group’s policy. Since 1983,  HUH has determined the rent for its apartments by conducting an analysis of market rent after a study conducted by Harvard professors advised that it was fairest for the University to charge rent at market rate for its apartments. This academic year, rents increased for students by an average of 5 percent, according to the Gazette.

Members of the Harvard Graduate Council criticized President Donald Trump's executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States in the body's first meeting of the semester Monday.
At the meeting, members of the Council also debated changing the body's structure, presented proposed changes to the group’s constitution and voted on modifications to the Council’s budget.
Graduate Council President Peter J. Dyrud said it was appropriate for the Council to discuss Trump’s executive order, which has been met with criticism across the University. Though Dryud noted that the Council has historically attempted to be inclusive of all graduate students’ political views by not adopting stances on policy issues, he said the response to Trump’s executive order could be an exception to this precedent.
“HGC normally doesn’t take a stand on political events...but these definitely are not ordinary times,” said Dyrud. “The executive order is having a profound effect on each of our student bodies and our nation.”
“The main goal is that we try to be more unified than divisive, but this executive order is obviously extremely divisive,” Dyrud added.
Members of the Council proposed possible responses to the order, including organizing a rally to protest and possible partnerships among Harvard graduate schools to debate potential policy implications of the immigration order.
Natalie Z. Wang, the body’s Chair of Advocacy and Diversity, urged all members of the Council to consider varied ways to respond to the executive order.
“It’s an intersectional issue and it’s going to affect many of us, whether we realize it or not,” she said.
Wang said some international students who leave the country to conduct research might not be able to return. At least two Harvard affiliates have been unable to enter the United States as a result of the order.
Wang echoed statements from University President Drew G. Faust, highlighting that many of Harvard’s schools are led by immigrants. Wang, a student at the Graduate School of Design, noted that Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi is an Iranian immigrant.
“This could potentially affect all internationals, not just people from the seven countries. It’s already affecting more than just those seven countries,” she said.
Trump’s executive order, issued on Friday, halts people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days and suspends the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely. Federal officials later said that green card holders would be allowed to enter the country.
Though the meeting adjourned without the Council adopting an official response to the immigration order, Dyrud noted that members could consider proposals through electronic voting or at a subsequent meeting.
The Council also discussed changes to its constitution that members have considered since August.  Members hope to restructure the Council’s governance to allow for broader representation across Harvard’s graduate and professional schools.  In one proposed change, only one representative from each of Harvard’s graduate schools would be allowed to serve on the executive board at any given time.
Council members also voted unanimously to approve reallocating unused funds from the previous year’s budget.  In addition, the Graduate Council voted to fund student programs, including two student-run conferences, the European Conference and the Indian Conference. Members also allocated funding to “Crimson Madness,” an event for graduate students to watch Harvard basketball games together.
In keeping with past practice, the Council did not make a statement about an ongoing effort to unionize teaching and research assistants at Harvard.

The state of New York descended on the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday, as Columbia and Cornell arrived for a pair of matches against Harvard wrestling. The competitions marked the start of Ivy League competition for the Crimson, which posted a 1-1 showing last Saturday.
The same result materialized this weekend. Ranked in the top 10 nationally, the Big Red (9-2, 2-0 Ivy) posed a stiffer test and downed Harvard, 33-11. Before that defeat, though, the Crimson edged the Lions (3-8, 1-1) by a tally of 24-14.
CORNELL 33, HARVARD 11
The last time that Harvard (2-5, 1-1) wrestled Cornell, Nick Gajdzik lost more than his match. He lost his season, too.
The date was Jan. 15, 2016. The Big Red led 28-14 when the heavyweight standout stepped onto the mat.
The injury happened in a flash. But one twist of a knee was enough to sideline Gajdzik for the rest of the year.
On Saturday night, supported by a renovated knee, the fifth-year senior got a chance at revenge. At the Malkin Athletic Center, Gajdzik wrestled Jeramy Sweany, the same opponent that he had battled in 2016.
This time, Gajdzik emerged with an intact knee, a 7-4 win by decision, and an ovation from family and friends.
“That’s an injury that very well could have ended my career rather than just a season,” the tri-captain said. “I was really pumped. It was my second chance, and I think I made the most of it.”
However, Gajdzik’s success proved aberrant on a night when No. 9 Cornell defended its reputation with a 33-11 victory.
More emblematic was the cousin-versus-cousin duel between the Crimson’s Kanon Dean and the Big Red’s Gabriel Dean. The senior Gabriel, a back-to-back NCAA champion, topped the junior Dean by fall.
Even the most dependable Harvard wrestlers struggled to gain traction. Tri-captain Josef Johnson entered with a 23-6 record, but he dropped a 14-2 major decision.
Still, the Crimson built an early lead on the strength of wins by freshman Connor Sakmar (by fall), sophomore Samuel Goldman (17-1 by technical fall), and freshman A.J. Jaffe (7-5 by decision).
That advantage evaporated quickly, as Harvard conceded six straight matches. Besides Johnson, two wrestlers lost by major decision—senior Colby Knight and freshman Kyle Bierdumpfel. Meanwhile junior Logan Kirby and Dean exited after falls, and rookie Hunter Ladnier dropped a 12-6 decision.
“In the Cornell match, that’s one of the best teams in the country,” assistant coach Sean Arrington said. “Our guys were responding to the challenge, and they wrestled hard.”
HARVARD 24, COLUMBIA 14
Slowly Columbia had crept back into the match. At one point, the Crimson had held a 14-4 lead, but as Johnson prepared to face Austin Coniker, the score stood at 14-10.
That margin, it turned out, was as close as the visitors would get. Johnson reversed the tide with an 8-0 win by major decision, and Dean and Kirby followed with 8-4 and 12-8 decisions, respectively.
Regarding the final result, the final bout of the day didn’t matter. Even though Gajdzik went down 9-0 by major decision, Harvard still exited with a 24-14 victory—the team’s second win in three contests.
“Our team came out firing in that much,” Gajdzik said. “Holistically we looked fantastic.”
Again, the start of the lineup proved successful, as Jaffe and Goldman won to post the only 2-0 records on the weekend. While Goldman triumphed by forfeit, Jaffe earned a 9-4 decision.
In this contest, Ladnier proved victorious as well, winning 18-3 by technical fall. These early results built a 10-point cushion for Harvard and allowed the team to weather a pair of losses by Knight and Bierdumpfel, both by decision.
Also redeemed as Sakmar, who opened the day with a 10-2 defeat by major decision to Johnson Mai.
“We truly do have a great team this year, not only of wrestlers but of people as well,” Gajdzik said. “That’s something we pride ourselves about at Harvard wrestling.”

Nothing says spring is coming quite like the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Kick-Off Weekend. The tournament, which is played on 15 campus sites and features 60 of the nation’s top teams, saw the Harvard women’s tennis team travel to Columbus, Ohio for its second weekend trip of the spring season. The Crimson fell to Alabama, 4-0, on Saturday before losing to Florida State, 4-1, the next day. Hosts Ohio State topped the Crimson Tide (4-2) in Sunday’s final as the Seminoles (2-1) took third.
Despite only winning one match on the weekend and with its first Ivy League match more than two months away, the extremely young Crimson (0-4) roster built upon its matches against Northwestern and DePaul last weekend to push two of the nation’s traditional tennis powers in Columbus.
“It’s only been two or three weeks and we’ve already seen a lot of improvement with everyone’s game and fitness-wise, also,” co-captain June Lee said. “Even from last weekend to this weekend, people are playing better and doing what they’ve been working on in practice, and it’s starting to show in the matches.”
Freshman Irene Lu was a standout performer for the Crimson, picking up a victory on Sunday to secure the first singles win by a Harvard freshman this spring. In total, five of the nine players who participated in matches over the weekend were freshmen. The Crimson has seven first-years on its 12-person team.
“Irene stands out right now as one of our top performers,” Harvard coach Green said. “[Freshmen] Jenna Friedel and Natasha Gonzalez, [and Lu] all have a lot of power, and right now we’re working on how to hone that power.”
FLORIDA STATE, 4, HARVARD, 1
After being shut out on Saturday, the Crimson did not have to wait long to pick up its first win on Sunday. Lu captured a victory over Seminoles sophomore Ariana Rahmanparast in the day’s first completed singles match. Lu, playing from the No. 5 spot, was efficient in her sweep. The Laurel, Md. native took the first set, 6-1, and won six of the eight sets in the second contest. In the more individual-focused fall season, Lu picked up three singles victories in her first college semester.
Despite the strong play of Lu, Harvard found itself behind the eight ball early on Sunday. The sophomore duo of Erica Oosterhout and Sabrina Xiong fell, 6-1, while the team’s top doubles pair, Lee and junior Annika Ringblom, the two upperclassmen on the squad, lost 6-3 to concede the all-important doubles point to Florida State.
“There were definitely moments in the match where the match could have gone either way,” Lee said. “That shows that we can hang in there with the top teams, so obviously that’s a good sign.”
In a battle of highly recruited freshmen, Seminoles Nandini Das proved to be too much for Harvard’s Jenna Friedel. Das, who lived in Mumbai until she was 11, went to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., the same school that produced Serena Williams (who won the Australian Open the same day as Das beat Friedel), Andre Agassi, and Maria Sharapova. Friedel was one of two five-star recruits in the Crimson’s 23rd-ranked recruiting class.
Oosterhout and Lee each won eight games in losing efforts. Oosterhout, playing from No. 1, fell to junior Gabriella Castaneda while Lee was downed by sophomore Julia Mikulski at the second spot.
ALABAMA, 4, HARVARD, 0
Despite winning three of the four all-time matchups in football, Alabama has never beaten Ohio State on the road. The Crimson Tide women’s tennis team had no problem picking up a victory in Columbus. Coming off a loss against Washington—which Huskies fans can use as a small consolation prize after their football team fell to Alabama in the Peach Bowl—the Crimson Tide made quick work of the Crimson on Saturday afternoon.
Friedel and Lu were unable to hang with Alabama’s Juliana Valero and Smith Hinton, falling 6-2. Oosterhout and freshman Lexi Milunovich experienced the same fate by the same score moments later. With the doubles point in hand, the Crimson Tide proceeded to sweep the next three matches. First singles was the first to finish, as senior Erin Routliffe, the No. 86 player in the nation, got the best of Oosterhout for the second time on the afternoon, this time by a score of 6-2, 6-2.
Alabama sophomore Andie Daniell was too much for Milunovich at No. 2, securing a 6-1, 6-3 win over the New Canaan, Conn. native. In the day’s closest completed singles match, Ringblom, who picked up a key doubles win last weekend in Chicago, fell to Crimson Tide freshman Maddie Pothoff at No. 5.
“Our team played really well this weekend,” Green said. “We played some of the top schools in the nation the last two weekends so we’ve been getting better week by week. Building is our main goal.”
