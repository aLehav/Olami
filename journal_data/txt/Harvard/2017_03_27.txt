After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EDITORS' NOTE: A previous version of this article included an insensitive remark about an individual's name. This remark does not represent The Crimson or its values and has been removed from the article.
From the moment there were younger people to defecate on, humankind has done so with aplomb, as though intergenerational disdain were the strongest laxative. Today, crotchety doomsayers have condemned millennials for their over-reliance on such contrivances as portable telephones, Amazon Now, and PornHub mobile. They fret that this cocktail of information overload and instant gratification has fostered entitlement in millennials and truncated attention spans beyond repair. They obviously have not heard Migos’ “Bad and Boujee,” the sonic equivalent of staring at a beige, textureless wall while seated on a fully mature cactus.
The exceptional success of “Bad and Boujee”—250 million YouTube views and counting, and therefore at least a billion combined minutes of life sacrificed in the name of Migos—proves that humanity has retained the masochistic self-abnegation of Job. Porridge, funneled through a decommissioned sewage pipe into your infected ear, has more charisma than the trap trio responsible for this human rights violation. The porridge makes more sense too: The first two words in this song, purportedly about a bad and boujee woman, are “raindrop” and “drop-top.” Migos sound like they’re trying to verbally approximate an oil spill. A small child combines words more coherently in the middle of a fever dream.
What does it mean to be “bad and boujee,” anyway? Well, “bad” simply means “bad” in the pejorative sense. Thus discontented with his relationship, Offset has resorted to “fuckin’ on your bitch” instead, even though she happens to be “a thot THOT (THOT!)”. The etymology of “boujee,” on the other hand, is a little more complicated: “Boujee” is a clever (?) twist on the word “bougie,” which, as we all know, is French for “candle.” In the parlance of our times, the meaning of “bougie” hinges on the obsolescence of candles, because who in tarnation still uses candles? The answer, as always, is Amish people. And just as the Amish reject the conditions of modernity, the nouveau riche celebrated in “Bad and Boujee” reject many of the trappings of their new lifestyle.
The music video, which offers variations on this theme of old habits surviving newfound wealth, comes courtesy of director Daps. Daps conjures up a bad and boujee world through impressionistic flashes of the high and low juxtaposed. Chanel take-out boxes. Armand de Brignac Gold Brut alongside Cup Noodles and Kentucky Fried Chicken. ATVs. A bad and boujee lady with two iPhones and no clue how to use either. No, seriously: Crouching on a billboard—the sort of location all bad and boujee personages flock to—she takes selfies with the screen facing away from her, apparently unaware of the “flip camera” button. Later on in the video, she finally figures it out in the back of a hotboxed BMW—and proceeds to record a video of her crotch. Anyone aspiring to badness and boujeeness, take note.
Perhaps the best illustration of the video’s thorough (but thematically consistent?) shoddiness is its relationship with Kentucky Fried Chicken. A third of the video is spent inside a KFC, where Offset pours champagne on the floor, Quavo incessantly dabs the iPhone lady’s mouth with a silk handkerchief, and Takeoff, who has spent almost a decade toiling for Migos only to be left off their most iconic song, waves his arms sadly and stiffly in the background, possibly hungry. However, the right reverend Colonel Sanders, himself an outspoken proponent of the bad and the boujee, inexplicably declined to give Migos his blessing. Accordingly, no obvious symbol of KFC appears in the video. You can still tell that they’re eating KFC, though. Because instead of commissioning Chanel fried chicken buckets—which would have been the pinnacle of bad and boujee imagery—Migos just sloppily Sharpied out the Colonel’s face, the word “Kentucky,” and the vertical red stripes on the existing KFC buckets. Yet any viewer whose eyes have not already staged a coup d’etat can clearly see the death mask of the Colonel, his false smile reflected in the glossy black champagne case. Which, of course, means that Migos or whoever decided not to censor the sides of the buckets facing away from the camera. They sustain this sort of laziness throughout “Bad and Boujee,” which probably would have fatally stupefied all of society by now, if not for one thing: Lil Uzi Vert.
Lil Uzi sounds like a pubescent slug who just discovered masturbation. He is therefore a breath of fresh air in this ogre bog of a song. Quite a few listeners insist that they yank their headphones off when Lil Uzi comes on. Don’t listen to them: Their preferred genre of music is probably a Gregorian chant through a yogurt-clogged baby monitor. Sporting a Marilyn Manson t-shirt and whipping his tiny tie-dye dreads back and forth, Lil Uzi slams a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the whole affair. After all, his costars Offset and Quavo both look like they’re dreading post-shoot prostate exams conducted by their respective ex-wives. When Lil Uzi first appears, presaged by his coital squawks, he prolongs a poorly executed dab for so long that it looks like he’s just making out with his elbow. His opening line is “YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH (YEAH),” delivered with an embarrassed smile that refreshingly seems to say, “You actually take me seriously as an artist?” Concluding a thoroughly unmemorable verse—replete with lines like, “And you know we winnin’! Yeah, we is not losin’!”—he looks into the camera and shrugs good-naturedly.
For discerning listeners who want to enjoy “Bad and Boujee” but actually respect themselves, there is an edit of the song which scraps all the verses in favor of Lil Uzi squalling “YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH” for five minutes straight. The rest of us, unfortunately, must follow Lil Uzi’s lead, looking into the camera and shrugging as we consent to the collective lobotomy that is “Bad and Boujee.” Whether we are bored or boring, our elevation of this mediocre song to the level of international phenomenon proves that we deserve to be submerged in the dung of our elders. Therefore blow, asses, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow! Spout till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! We will be the pattern of all patience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First, the good news. The Groton-Dunstable Regional High School Chamber Chorus, a highly regarded Massachusetts high school group, will have the honor of singing at St. Anthony’s Basilica in Padua, Italy on Easter Sunday next month.
The bad news? The chorus almost lost this opportunity due to overzealous First Amendment lawyers who seem to have lost track of their priorities in the age of Trump.
This story begins last fall, when the chorus was slated to perform during an Easter Sunday Mass in the historic Basilica. One school board member found fault with this plan, arguing that having the kids actually participate in the Mass constituted a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. She brought in the big guns: the legal advocacy group Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
Americans United wrote the school district a letter on November 16, demanding that the Easter performance be cancelled. The school district, fearing a legal fight, obliged. After general outcry from parents, the school was able to reach a compromise: The chorus would perform between the Basilica’s Easter services, but not during them. (Full disclosure: My mother was interviewed in her capacity as a constitutional law professor in one of the initial news stories about the cancellation of the performance. I am also a choral singer.)
Two caveats deserve mention before delving into this strange episode. First, the exchange between the school and Americans United does not represent one of the great social justice issues of our time. Groton and Dunstable are affluent communities, and parents of the singers were more than capable of advocating on behalf of their views.
Second, Americans United is usually a reasonable organization that does good work. In 2005, for example, it was part of a lawsuit that successfully challenged the teaching of intelligent design as science in a Pennsylvania school district.
Given the group’s strong record, however, its priorities in the Groton-Dunstable case are puzzling. The technical, legal questions at stake require expert analysis than cannot be provided here, but this incident raises more fundamental issues. First, eight days after the election of Donald J. Trump to the presidency, one would expect a group committed to the separation of church and state to have more pressing concerns than a high school chorus trip.
More broadly, that Americans United even entertained the school board member’s complaint points to problems with how our education system addresses religion and the humanities.
When we approach learning about a cultural tradition, its artistic productions deserve special attention. This idea is fairly uncontroversial. Further, great art—from the Renaissance polyphony the Groton-Dunstable chamber chorus will likely perform in Padua to the mosaics of the Great Mosque of Damascus to the masquerade dances of the Yoruba—has historically been created for specific contexts. Often, that context is explicitly religious, as in the case of many significant works of Western choral music.
Denying these religious origins of much of humanity’s cultural heritage does little educational good. In the case of the Groton-Dunstable chorus, the students were already singing religiously inspired music. Experiencing these works in the context for which they were made—in this instance, a church service—fits comfortably with the educational goal of learning about a cultural and artistic tradition.
When groups like Americans United interpret the First Amendment to prevent students from learning about religion as a cultural and historical phenomenon—as distinct from learning about a specific religion as representing some metaphysical or scientifically provable truth—they risk further decreasing our already-poor understanding of the global world in which we live. Would the Trump campaign’s rhetoric of religious divisiveness have been so successful had learning about different religious traditions and humanist philosophies, and visiting places of worship, been a more formal part of public school curriculums? Given the misconceptions that abound about so many religious traditions, including Christianity and Judaism, limiting the ability of our educational system to address religion fully seems a poor direction for public policy.
Indeed, attending a religious service for the sake of improving understanding of the human experience need not clash with the principles of the Constitution and a secular education. The philosopher of history R.G. Collingwood defined the task of history as “the re-enactment of past thought in the historian’s own mind.” This idea of re-enactment can perhaps be applied beyond history to most humanistic endeavors that call upon us to consider works, including artistic ones, made by historical actors. Collingwood’s concept of “re-enactment” gains particular importance in the context of modern democracy, where considering how our fellow citizens live their traditions is part of developing civic consciousness. Experiencing religion in action helps broaden our understanding of how cultures in our communities have viewed and continue to view life—an essential goal of a humanities education.
The Constitution guarantees that our schools do not impose religious beliefs on students. It ought not prevent them from learning about the great cultural productions of human history to the fullest extent possible. While the facts of specific cases matter, the Groton-Dunstable performance certainly did not rise to the level of a crisis of secular education. Maintaining the wall of separation between church and state remains vital. But when it comes to understanding our history and our present moment, perhaps we could all use a little more education in religion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This month, in an attempt to inform the general public on ways to avoid falling victim to “fake news,” the Harvard Library website published a research guide entitled “Fake News, Misinformation, and Propaganda.” The research guide has drawn criticism from right-wing news outlets for including a link to a guide put together by Merrimack College Assistant Professor Melissa Zimdars. The guide denotes the credibility of a list of news sites, flagging various conservative websites such as Breitbart as “unreliable” and “biased” sources. While the link to Zimdars’s guide may have incited controversy, the Harvard Library’s goals to better inform people on how to avoid misinformation and “fake news” is uncontroversial and should be commended.
Aside from the link to Zimdars’s compilation of news sites, the Harvard Library research guide includes a wealth of other resources that help users navigate around fake news, misinformation, and propaganda. The link is only found at the bottom of the page, after a long list of other sources. The guide also includes an infographic with practical tips, such as double-checking stories across various websites and being cautious of URLs ending in “.com.co”. It additionally includes links to browser plug-ins that can help flag “fake news” in real time. These simple tools hold the potential to improve political discourse today by advancing the mechanisms by which we validate our information.
Furthermore, Zimdars makes it clear that she compiled the list on her own. The document includes a disclaimer that reads, “All of the contents in this document reflect the opinion of the author(s) and are for educational purposes only.” The Harvard Library website clearly attributes the controversial “fake news” list to Zimdar and does not imply that the list was compiled by the University or one of its affiliates.
The informal list gives all readers the autonomy to accept or reject Zimdars’s judgments with context. The guide presents a variety of labels, from “political” to “clickbait,” and goes to great lengths to explain their significance and why they were used. The potentially controversial inclusion of conservative sites on the list should not discredit its overall goals of providing the public with a greater critical media literacy.
As the past election season and misguided comments from our own President demonstrate, there is a need to distinguish between reputable news sources and websites that spew misinformation and conspiracy theories. An informed public is the cornerstone of any democracy.
The truth is critical in these tumultuous political times. The Harvard Library’s research guide seeks to preserve that in a climate that threatens to invalidate it. Attempts to keep students, voters, and citizens informed and aware are threatened if “fake news” pervades daily life. Any attempt to curb misinformation is critical and must be lauded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As someone who has studied abroad, I’ve often gotten pushback from other Harvard students about making that decision. “You only have eight semesters at the best university in the world—why would you spend one of those away?”
It is true that most study abroad programs will not be as academically rigorous as Harvard. Excluding Oxford and Cambridge, even if your classes abroad are rigorous, you won’t have the same wealth of academic resources that you do at Harvard. You won’t have Widener, the Peabody museum artifacts, the world-renowned professors providing feedback on your work. You won’t have the brilliant guest lecturers or the intellectual energy that encompasses Cambridge. (You also won’t be surrounded by other Harvard students, which is both positive and negative).
These academic concerns are valid. But when I asked some students why they chose to study abroad, they spoke about how they felt they were not taking advantage of Harvard’s resources—that they felt stagnant or lost at Harvard.
As a student study abroad adviser, Aubrey Stoddard ’17 asks students concerned about academics: “Are you really getting the most out of your Harvard experience and classes right now?” How many times have you gone to a non-required lecture by an expert, or read a book from the depository for fun? Are you doing all your readings for your classes? “The answer’s always ‘no’,” Stoddard says, “they talk about the great resources and people at the IOP, and I ask ‘How many IOP events have you been to in the past semester?’ And usually they’ll say none, maybe one.”
In general, Harvard students are relatively busy, which you’ll know if you try to plan a meal with someone less than a week in advance. Sometimes it feels as though the measure of how much you’re getting out of Harvard is how many extracurriculars you run; but paradoxically, the more extracurriculars you run, the less you’re able to get out of each. Some of the students I interviewed went abroad to rejuvenate their love for learning, which is easy to lose when the sense that the more you do—the faster you go—the more worthy your life is.
Most of the students I interviewed told me that their semester back from study abroad was their best academically at Harvard, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Stoddard said “[when I came back] I felt centered for the first time ever. I had my best academic and social semester yet; I learned who I was outside of the Harvard bubble. I put everything I can into my papers; I go to office hours… I learned so much more the importance of the people around me.”
Study abroad can undoubtedly be beneficial to those who are rundown by the campus whirlwind. But also, the campus is not a monolith. While everyone at Harvard feels some pressure, some people are thriving—and they, too, might consider study abroad. Before I went abroad, I liked Harvard and did not feel lost or unmotivated; I had simply always wanted to study abroad. I was excited to leave, and I didn’t realize until I left that I, too, was missing something at Harvard: a different type of learning.
Taking time to rest and reflect is a gift, whether it’s summer, winter, or time off. What makes study abroad unique are the real academic benefits that you can’t get at Harvard—even if it is less academically rigorous. Perhaps so few people go abroad—or people go abroad only when they feel pushed—because we have been taught our whole lives to define education narrowly, as something that happens in the mind and computer and classroom, capped with an A.
Abroad, my class pre-screened, with the director, a documentary about Morocco’s tenuous history with its northern region, allowing me to learn firsthand about the history, geography, and intricacies of the region. Itzel Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17 found, in Cuba, the Latinx studies courses that Harvard lacks; outside of the classroom, she was able to travel to a rock cave-museum about the Taino people in a city with strong ties to indigenous cultures. Ellen Jang-Milsten ’18 was able to hear Russian students’ perspectives on Yemen and other issues in a course on war, and take her first oral exam. In Greece, Ileana Riveron ’17 saw and debated firsthand the tensions between tradition and modernity.
Stoddard, during her time in Brazil, saw the tangible benefit, and challenge, of being embedded in a place. “My friends and I had a lot of fun going to this soccer game in this super nice stadium. But the next day, the entire class time was talking about the problems with this specific stadium and how many thousands of people had been displaced to build it; we visited the neighborhoods that had been displaced. You were always aware of your positionality: your experience of the place, versus what was actually happening.”
Renowned professors, unlimited archives, and brilliant peers are things you can only benefit from if you are engaged with and passionate about learning. Study abroad can catalyze a renewed appreciation of Harvard. Additionally, gaining perspective from places different from yours, in many ways more difficult than yours, is vital to learning—especially here, especially now. The students I interviewed found that to truly appreciate what they had, they needed to let it go—more than that, they gained what they did not even know they were missing.

Almost 40,000 students apply to Harvard every year, which is no wonder since it is ranked as a top university by organizations like U.S. News and World and Forbes. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of seats every year and some students never even apply for reasons ranging from location to family situation. If we believe in the importance of education accessibility, however, we should not allow these factors to be barriers for the public to get a taste of what it is like to be in a Harvard class.
Thanks to the explosion of the internet, it is now possible to share content with billions of people. This has also allowed for increased access to high quality education through online platforms. Services like Khan Academy have reached millions of students worldwide and offered them resources for the classroom and traditionally expensive test prep for exams such as the SAT. And the rise of Massive Online Open Courses has given universities platforms for offering free, online versions of their own classes. Harvard has produced many of these, replicating almost 100 courses through the edX platform which it cofounded with MIT.
This is just the beginning of what could be. Currently available topics are rather scattered and there are only a handful of popular classes, such as Computer Science 50, available. Although it takes time to “remaster” (make custom versions of) classes for this platform, Harvard should nevertheless strive to open up as many courses from as many departments as possible. Harvard should be encouraged by the popularity of its current online selection across different channels.The video lecture playlist for Statistics 110 on YouTube, for example, has over 430,000 views.
An alternative to MOOCs is for Harvard to build its own repository of course content online. A great blueprint for such a program is MIT’s OpenCourseWare. The site includes content from MIT classes, including lecture videos, problem sets, and even exams. Many of the introductory level classes have almost all possible content available. This allows the public to get an immersive and complete experience of fundamental concepts across disciplines. For upper-level classes, there is more variability, with classes generally offering fewer videos and more written notes. This is suitable, however, since viewers supposedly have prior experience in the field and thus require less “hand-holding.”
A service like OpenCourseWare would be beneficial not only to the public but also to current students. Certain classes, especially higher-level electives, are not offered every year, and the service would remedy this by allowing students to independently explore topics taught in previous years.
It would not be difficult for Harvard to develop such a system. Many classes already have their video lectures recorded, and class content is organized on Canvas, Harvard's course management software. It would only be a matter of collecting and organizing materials, determining what to make public, and creating an easy interface through which to browse. In addition, the content for individual classes would only have to be updated every few years to reflect major changes in content. In the process, the University could work with faculty members and even students to ensure that the content is being properly presented and organized for a rich educational experience.
Even if it should choose to create its own interface, however, the University should continue to invest in creating MOOCs since they offer a more traditional classroom experience, with weekly deadlines, a large group of peers, and direct contact with course staff. MOOCs also offer a path for obtaining verified certificates for those willing to pay, making the content gained even more applicable.
There is a tremendous opportunity for Harvard to push the digital envelope of education and set an example for other institutions to follow. With the rapid rise of digital content and devices connected to the internet, now is the right time to mobilize technology for global good. Only then can we get a real democratization of knowledge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yityish “Titi” Aynaw, the first black woman to win the Miss Israel beauty pageant, discussed her life and views on perceptions of beauty and race in Israel at a talk on Friday at the Fong Auditorium.
Hasani A. Hayden ’19 and the Jewish National Fund organized Aynaw’s talk, entitled "Hasani and JNF Present: Titi Aynaw, The First Black Miss Israel.”  In her speech, Aynaw, who moved from Ethiopia to Israel at age 12, emphasized the impact of education and growing up in Israel on her ability to succeed.
Aynaw described her experience as the only black woman in the Miss Israel competition as one that stayed with her in later years. In the year after her victory in 2013, more Ethiopian women entered the beauty competition, according to Aynaw, who was a judge in the 2014 Miss Israel pageant.
“There were girls that wanted to try it and didn’t know how to do it,” Aynaw said. “They didn’t think there was a place for the black skin. After me, there was a place for more models.”
Aynaw also discussed the importance of Israel’s education system to her success. It inspired her to begin “Titi’s Project,” an initiative to help underprivileged children in the Netanya area that provides them with educational, after-school activities to further their learning experiences.
“I want this project to be in every city in Israel. This is my big, big, big goal because there are many kids who need this project,” she said in an interview. “They really learn there. They really learn music, computers, and English.”
After Aynaw gave her speech, one student asked in a question and answer session about Aynaw’s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict in light of her positive experiences in Israel. Aynaw responded that although she served mandatory time in the Israel Defense Forces, she does not see herself as a political figure.
“Personally, I don’t think Titi was the best person to challenge on that issue, given the fact that Titi served her required time and it’s just a duty,” Hayden said. “She’s not a politician making policy and she’s not anti-Palestinian...At a personal level, it seems like she has much love for her fellow Israelis.”
He added he thought the event was meant to acknowledge Aynaw’s success, and not to discuss Israeli politics.
“I hope a big thing that is understood from this event not that Israel is a perfect place by any means,” Hayden said. “Just to celebrate Titi Aynaw as an individual—what she had been able to accomplish with her limited resources.”

Months after Harvard’s Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors discontinued regular giveaways of popular Camelbak water bottles, another campus group is bringing them back.
As part of a new publicity campaign, Harvard Recreation, an arm of the Athletics Department which runs many of Harvard’s gyms, handed out the water bottles around campus this semester.
“My soul hurt when I read that DAPA wouldn’t be able to continue with their Camelbak giveaway. But I work for Harvard Recreation now, and I thought that Rec could help save the Camels (a precious species),” Daniel E. Golliher ’14, Harvard Recreation’s College Outreach & Marketing Coordinator, wrote in an email.
Though interested students could fill out an online form requesting a Camelbak, a recent post on Harvard Recreation’s Instagram informed students the water bottles had run out, at least for  now.
“We did a limited run just for our campaign this spring to gauge interest, but we’re not even close to being done with Camelbaks,” wrote Golliher.
Before DAPA discontinued it, students would flock to National Alcohol Screening Day—at which participants could receive a Camelbak in exchange for anonymously completing a survey about their alcohol habits—to receive a free water bottle. In Dec. 2016, DAPA cited cost concerns as a major reason for the cut.
In his email, Golliher showered praise on the water bottles, calling them “great for a lot of things.”
“They promote and facilitate hydration; they’re sturdy and durable, so you don’t have to run through a lot of plastic water bottles in the course of the year; and they're the center of a fun community event on our campus,” Golliher said, adding, “these are all things that Harvard Recreation has an interest in preserving.”
The Camelbak giveaway is part of a broader publicity campaign from Harvard Recreation. Many of their efforts—both on social media and at various campus “a pop-up” events—have centered around the slogan “Recreation is Coming,” a reference to a line in the popular television series “Game of Thrones.” Though Golliher wrote that Harvard Recreation would be enacting some major changes in the near future, he was not forthcoming about any specifics.
“There’s some mystery to our campaign, and that’s on purpose,” he wrote.

Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng will take a sabbatical next academic year, and Emma Dench, a History and Classics professor, will serve as interim GSAS dean.
In an email announcing Meng’s leave, Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith wrote that Meng will use his sabbatical to continue studying data science and statistics. Meng will pursue research on “statistical foundational issues for the rapidly evolving discipline of data science” and will assume leadership roles with two societies in statistics “as they embark on strategic planning for the roles and contributions of statisticians to data science.”
Dench will take the helm of GSAS as it undergoes potential changes. The National Labor Relations Board could decide this month whether or not eligible students at Harvard can form a union. And earlier this semester, Smith said that Harvard would accept 4.4 percent fewer graduate students next year.
Praising Dench for her work mentoring graduate students, Smith wrote Dench’s previous roles at Harvard and contributions to the University have prepared her for her role as interim dean.
“She has a deep and nuanced understanding of graduate curricula, the needs of graduate students, and departmental operations and concerns,” he wrote. “Professor Dench is an outstanding teacher and mentor of undergraduate and graduate students, and a University citizen with an exceptional record of service.”
Smith wrote this experience mentoring graduate students and understanding of graduate curricula will allow Dench to continue Meng’s work as dean.
“Professor Dench’s experience, values, energy, enterprise, and collegiality make her an outstanding choice for this position,” Smith wrote. “She is an extraordinary citizen at the departmental, divisional, GSAS, FAS, and University levels, and I know her work as Interim Dean will complement and enhance the tremendous success Dean Meng has had over the past five years.”

The Undergraduate Council granted itself the authority to recommend creation of new student organizations after it amended the body’s governing documents at Sunday’s general meeting.
The Committee on Student Life approved a policy revision Thursday making the UC responsible for suggesting which student organizations the CSL recognizes. The Office of Student Life is currently not accepting applications for new student groups this semester after the CSL put the process on hold for review.
Alexander R. Miller, the assistant dean of student life and a CSL member, spoke at the UC meeting to advocate for the legislation and said the current system for approval does not adequately seek the input of students.
“The current system is set up philosophically to engage students, but it doesn't happen necessarily in practice,” Miller said. “The student voice is not necessarily woven to the process until it gets, quite frankly, all the way until the end.”
The legislative changes came in two parts. The UC amended its constitution to task the UC’s Rules Committee with the responsibility to “review and recommend” student organizations. Members from each of the other UC committees sit on the Rules Committee, according to UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18.
The body also changed its bylaws to order the Rules Committee to partner with the OSL and determine the criteria to judge applications. Prospective student groups will need two-thirds approval of the Rules Committee and majority approval of the full Council. The Committee on Student Life will then “rubber-stamp” that decision, according to Miller.
Samarth Gupta ’18, a Lowell House UC representative, said he was concerned about the implicit biases of students who will be voting on the fate of clubs.
“I wonder if biases that we might have as students are going to come across in what we approve for student groups,” he said.
Gupta and Neel Mehta ’18, chair of the Council’s Finance Committee, were the only UC members to vote against the bylaws amendment.
Winthrop House representative Vimal S. Konduri '17, an inactive Crimson editor, said any group of people approving student organizations has biases.
“Every group will inherently have certain biases, so I don’t think that will necessarily change by shifting the responsibility to the Rules Committee,” he said. “I think the Rules Committee has a fairly diverse membership, because it pulls from every single committee on the UC, and so I think that actually lessens the biases.”
Gupta subsequently asked Miller if the OSL feels “overburdened” by the number of student organization applications—the College has 442 recognized independent student organizations as of early February. Miller said he hopes to increase student participation in the approval process through this legislation.
“No, absolutely not,” Miller responded. “A lot of administrators and staff are reviewing applications, and there’s not enough students in the process.”
Henry S. Atkins '20, an Elm Yard representative, said the new legislation ultimately strengthens the student voice on campus.
“The fact of the matter is this is a proposal that is going to enhance the representation of the students in deciding this,” he said.

In the spring of 2016, as college administrators met with leaders of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and ultimately crafted a policy penalizing membership in them, their reasoning for doing so seemed straightforward: combating what University President Drew G. Faust months earlier called a “troubling” climate of sexual assault at Harvard.
In March of that year, a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention specifically called for a policy to address the role of final clubs in sexual assault, drawing attention to a correlation between final clubs and sexual violence.
“Effective response to unwelcome sexual conduct on the Harvard campus must include a serious and sustained examination of the contribution of Final Clubs to the problem,” the report read.
Two months later, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana seemingly did just that, announcing a policy that, beginning with the class of 2021, bars members of the social groups from receiving recommendations for certain post-graduate fellowships and holding leadership positions in student organizations.
But early this month, a set of recommendations for implementing Harvard’s historic sanctions on single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations departed from earlier administrative pronouncements about the sanctions. The committee tasked with formulating the recommendations wrote, in no uncertain terms, that sexual assault did not loom large in the policy’s formation.
“While that behavior and the environment that encourages it are wholly unacceptable, they are not the sole nor even the primary reason for the policy,” the report reads.
Particularly, the committee took issue with what they called “press reports and claims by students and members of [final clubs and Greek organizations] that the intent of the policy was to address sexual assault.”
This rhetorical about-face—from sexual assault as the ostensible impetus behind the policy to claims that it did not figure prominently at all—came after staunch opposition from final clubs and certain students and faculty. As preventing sexual assault became a less compelling argument for penalizing members of social groups, administrators have shifted their public focus to gender inclusivity as a rationale for their unprecedented involvement in undergraduate social life.
A Damning Report
The task force on sexual assault prevention devoted three of its 20 total pages to final clubs.
“We… do not see any solution that does not involve addressing the disturbing practical and cultural implications [the clubs] present in undergraduate life,” the report reads.
English professor Louis Menand, an outspoken supporter of the sanctions, said the task force’s report was “ultimately the trigger for the formation of the policy.”
“To that extent, concern about [sexual assault] was in the minds of the people who formulated the policy,” he said.
One of the report’s “key recommendations” was that University President Drew G. Faust have the College formulate a plan to address issues surrounding final clubs and compel them to drop their gender-exclusive practices.
Central to the report’s condemnation of the clubs was their finding that 47 percent of senior women at the College “participating in the Final Clubs” reported experiencing some form of “nonconsensual sexual contact” while in college. According to the report, this represented the highest figure among any student group queried in a University-wide survey.
Almost immediately, that figure in particular and the report’s claims linking sexual assault to final clubs in general were questioned. Most notably, the 226-year old Porcellian Club commissioned a professional statistical analysis of the task force’s report that purported to disprove its claims linking sexual assault to final clubs.
“All of the correlations between membership or participation in these groups and nonconsensual sexual contact are most likely statistically indistinguishable,” wrote Jora B. Stixrud, the economist hired by the club.
“In short,” she added, “There is no statistical evidence to support the singling out of Final Clubs as opposed to other student organizations.”
In the face of criticism, the University has stood by the numbers.
“The recommendations of the Task Force were based not only on the AAU sexual conduct survey, but also on the extensive qualitative data gathered at scores of meetings with Harvard undergraduate,” Chair of the task force for sexual assault prevention and response and former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, who led the task force for sexual assault prevention wrote in an emailed statement responding to Stixrud’s report.
Questioning the Rationale
When Khurana and Faust announced the sanctions in an email to Harvard affiliates in May, they focused primarily on gender equity in explaining the historic penalties. Though Khurana had been meeting with club affiliates before the release of the report, Faust did include some mention of sexual assault as an issue “related” to gender equity.
“We must address deeply rooted gender attitudes, and the related issues of sexual misconduct, points underscored by the work of the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault,” Faust wrote in May.
Early opposition to the policy focused on what detractors called its conflation of sexual assault, gender equity, and social exclusivity.
Three days after the announcement of the policy, hundreds of Harvard women, many of whom were affiliated with sanctioned organizations, flooded Harvard Yard in protest.
Bearing signs that read “Sexual Assault is Not Our Fault,” chief among the women’s concerns were that their groups faced collateral damage from a College effort to prevent sexual assault.
“We’ve arrived at the point that to prevent sexual assault, the number one plan is to prevent sorority sisters from becoming Rhodes scholars,” Fly Club graduate president Richard T. Porteus ’78 said in the wake of the announcement.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of sexual assault prevention organization Our Harvard Can Do Better, speaking in a personal capacity, said the issues were interrelated.
“I think there’s been a refusal or a reluctance at least, to consider the multifaceted interactions between various different forms of discrimination and exclusion and violence on campus,” she said.
A New Focus
In a September 2016 editorial that directly referenced the women's protests in May, Faust focused on her view that single-gender groups perpetuate structural barriers to women in higher education.
“I want Harvard to nurture the belief that you never should settle for second-class citizenship—or for an identity fashioned out of the arbitrary exclusion of others,” Faust wrote.
Following the submission of a Faculty motion that aimed to overturn the sanctions, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences also weighed in on the motivations behind the policy in a series of heated Faculty meetings in the fall and spring of this academic year.
In a contentious December meeting, Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, who co-signed the motion opposing the sanctions, said she found herself “ask[ing] what problem are we solving.”
“The first answer was that this was about sexual assault... But surely those of us in this room and members of the community can come up with a better answer to sexual assault than sanctioning single gender organizations, for a problem that is in nearly all manifestations a co-ed problem,” Seltzer said.
Even Menand, despite his outspoken support for the sanctions, shared skepticism that sexual assault was the best focus for the social policy, calling it a “mistake.”
“It was a mistake, in my opinion, to tie the social group policy to issues the policy cannot address, for example, the problem of sexual assault. Sexual assault is a felony. Do we really want to be suggesting that male final clubs are criminal organizations?” Menand said.
Today, administrators are reticent to acknowledge sexual assault as a major inspiration for the policy. In the 46-page report released this month by a committee tasked with recommending how the college implement the policy, the phrase “sexual assault” appears just three times.
In a March interview, asked specifically whether incorporating the issue of sexual assault into the policy development was a mistake, Khurana insisted gender equity had always been central to the policy’s formation.
“I think that this policy has been and has been since the beginning really rooted in the idea that we need an undergraduate experience that is free from gender discrimination,” Khurana said.
Pressed specifically on the issue of sexual assault, Khurana said “I do believe gender equity across our academic, social environments help contribute to a better student culture, a better Harvard culture, that reduces the likelihood that people’s bodily integrity is violated.”
The administration’s new rationale—one which focuses almost entirely on gender equity, and not sexual assault, as the motivating factor behind the sanctions—is one some faculty feel is more reasonable.
“There is one reason and only one reason to support the policy, and that is to affirm our opposition to discrimination on the basis of gender. That is all we are doing and I think all we have scope to do,” Menand said in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — It’s that time of year once again: March Madness is in the air. But while a quartet of excited basketball squads gets set to head to Phoenix, the Harvard men’s hockey team turns its focus instead to Chicago for a Final Four of its own—the Frozen Four.
With a 3-2 victory over Air Force in the NCAA Tournament’s East Regional finals, the Crimson (28-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) has advanced to its first Frozen Four since 1994. Harvard netted the game’s first three tallies and managed to hang onto the lead it built despite the Falcons’ comeback efforts, punctuated by two strikes 15 seconds apart in the middle frame.
“Air Force kept coming and coming,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We’re happy to move on and very proud of our guys, but I want to give [the Falcons] their due credit because they played great as well.”
The Crimson sees its win streak improve to a program-record 16 consecutive contests after Saturday night’s primetime game at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center, and will now wait almost two weeks before its NCAA Tournament semifinal matchup with Minnesota-Duluth, the winner of the bracket’s West Regional.
At the United Center, home of Chicago’s Blackhawks and Bulls, Harvard will enter a four-way battle for college hockey supremacy. With wins on Thursday and Saturday, the Crimson could seize its second Division I crown in program history—the first since 1989, when Donato earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the Frozen Four.
A SPECIAL KNACK FOR SPECIAL TEAMS
Air Force entered Saturday night’s final boasting the nation’s top penalty kill, successfully thwarting the competition’s man-up efforts on over 90 percent of attempts. The Falcons' diamond set-up on the kill has made it difficult for opposing power-play units to score all season.
Largely responsible for Air Force’s man-down success, sophomore netminder Shane Starrett holds down the last line of defense for the Falcons and ranks among the NCAA’s elite puck stoppers. Starrett’s .925 save percentage and 1.99 goals against average—fifth in the NCAA—are clear indicators of his team’s overall success defensively, and this carries over to the penalty kill.
In Providence, Air Force’s stingy shorthanded play was set for a collision course with one of Division I’s premier power plays. The red-hot Crimson owned the fourth-best man-up unit heading into the tilt, finding twine on 26.5 percent of its chances.
In recent games, Harvard’s power play has been as deadly as ever. The Crimson icemen converted 35 percent of their opportunities during the ECAC playoffs and cashed in once against Providence in the East Regional semifinals on Friday night.
“They have a really good penalty kill, but we have a really good power play as well,” co-captain Alexander Kerfoot said. “We have two different units which makes it hard for teams to kill against us…. Power play and penalty kill are huge down the stretch, especially when it comes to one-and-done situations.”
In Saturday’s bout, the Crimson cracked the Falcons’ code on special teams. The sizzling Harvard power play netted what would become the game-winning goal after senior forward Tyler Moy ripped a one-timer nearside on Starrett.
Moy, who pocketed his third goal of the NCAA Tournament with the score, now sets the pace for the Crimson with nine man-up tallies on the season. Also crucial to Harvard’s upper-echelon power play, freshman blue-liner Adam Fox mans the point. The ECAC Rookie of the Year leads his team with 21 assists and 23 points on the man advantage, nabbing a point on over half of his team’s 41 power-play goals to date.
The Crimson power play’s surplus of high-end talent proved overwhelming for the Falcons, who have allowed a league-low 18 man-up goals all season. Thanks to Air Force’s eight shorthanded strikes on the campaign, good for seventh in the nation, the Falcons have only conceded 10 more goals than they have scored while man-down, also best in the country.
As strong as Air Force has been on the penalty kill, which sits at 89.7 percent effective after Saturday’s loss to Harvard, it has struggled of late on the flipside of special teams. The Falcons’ power play ranks a middling 32nd in the country at 18.1 percent and, until Friday night’s East semifinal win over Western Michigan, was scoreless in 14 attempts over a span of four contests.
In its attempt to chip away at the Crimson’s 3-0 stranglehold of Saturday night’s game, Air Force potted both of its goals while skating with an extra man. The first saw the Falcons find twine with six men in the offensive zone, as Starrett waited on the bench for a delayed tripping call to formally start his team’s power play.
In the NCAA—unlike in the National Hockey League—if a team scores on a delayed penalty, the looming power play still ensues. So, Air Force availed itself of a man-up attempt following its first strike, this time burying a genuine power-play goal mere seconds after its tally with the pulled goalie.
MAKING DAD PROUD
Sophomore forward Ryan Donato, son of Crimson bench boss, Ted, found the scoresheet on Saturday night after his stick skills guided him right to Starrett’s doorstep, where he punched the puck across the goal line.
Donato, this year’s Ivy League Player of the Year, registered his 40th point of the season in a pretty display of talent. The Scituate, Mass., product weaved through a pair of royal blue sweaters before finding the back of the net and reclaiming Harvard’s lead in goals, which he now shares with Moy, at 21.
“Donato’s boy is a wonderful player, and [the Crimson skaters] have some skill and some talent,” said Air Force coach Frank Serratore ahead of the matchup, just after beating Western Michigan on Friday. “They’re a number one seed. We know that they’re a great team.”
With the triumph over the Falcons (27-10-5, 19-6-3 Atlantic Hockey), Harvard improves to a perfect 13-0-0 when Donato notches a goal and 15-0-0 when the Boston Bruins prospect finishes with a plus rating. Donato’s influence on the Crimson’s overall play is clearly more than statistical coincidence.
Earlier this season, the second-year winger potted four goals in a single night, playing a large role in the Crimson’s 6-2 thrashing of Union on Feb. 10. Donato, the only Harvard skater to accomplish such a feat this decade, has three other four-point performances during the current campaign, all of which included at least two assists. The coach’s son has also chipped in three two-goal games and owns his team’s three highest shot counts of the season with 13 and 10 twice.
Despite Donato’s tendency to rack up multi-point games—he has put forth 11 this season—his play also shines with consistency. As of Saturday night, Donato has inked the score sheet in 20 of 35 games this season.
In addition to sharing the team lead in goals, the second team All-ECAC pick paces his team in shorthanded strikes and shots on goal—a category he dominates by a staggering 57 tries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a rollercoaster spring break session on the West Coast, the Harvard men’s tennis team defended its home turf this weekend with a clean 3-0 sweep of Louisiana, Buffalo, and Amherst.
The Crimson (12-8) reaffirmed its doubles dominance this weekend by claiming the doubles point in all three matches. The confidence and momentum from these three wins will be crucial as the team prepares for the start of Ivy play next week.
“I think we’re in great shape,” co-captain Jean Thirouin said. “This weekend was the perfect opportunity to gain some confidence before Ivies, and as long as everyone stays healthy we’re excited to see what we can do.”
HARVARD 4, AMHERST 3
Harvard entered its third match of the week with a strong start, sweeping all three doubles positions against Amherst (11-2) on Saturday. The duo of junior Kenny Tao and rookie Logan Weber made quick work of their Purple & White opponents with a 6-2 win, while sophomore Peters and Thirouin claimed second doubles and sophomore pair Sam Beren and Andy Zhou won at third.
“It was nice to be indoors where I feel most comfortable and where we have been training for the majority of the season,” Tao said.
The Crimson and Amherst split singles play, with Zhou, freshman Galen Lee, and Weber earning points for Harvard at first, third, and fourth singles, respectively. Lee’s match was the only three-set match of the day, and he was able to come back from a 2-6 loss in the second game to clinch the match in the third set.
Junior Grant Solomon, Peters, and junior Xavier Gonzalez gave up points at second, fifth, and sixth singles, respectively, but the early doubles edge was enough to give Harvard the win.
“It was definitely was a great sign that we were able to adjust back to the indoor play quickly and it gives us a lot of confidence heading into the Ivy stretch,” Thirouin said.
HARVARD 4, BUFFALO 3
The Crimson earned an early advantage on Saturday morning against the University of Buffalo (7-5). The duo of Tao and senior Brian Yeung, ranked No. 57, claimed their 13th win of the season with their victory at first doubles. Weber and Morrow also won their 13th match as a doubles pair with a 6-4 win at third doubles.
On the singles side, it came down to Thirouin’s match against the Bulls at second singles. Tao earned a straight-set win at first singles, while Zhou edged out his opponent in a close tiebreaker in the first set and took the second set for a 7-6, 6-2 win at fourth singles. Yeung fell at third singles, while Morrow and Lee both pushed their matches into the third set but failed to clinch the victory at fifth and sixth singles, respectively.
Thirouin took the first set 6-3, but gave up the second set 7-5 to Buffalo junior Vidit Vaghela.
“I felt like I was in control for the majority of the match but he played the big points in the second set better than I did,” Thirouin said. “I tried to change that around in the third set and really take advantage of every opportunity that I got by keeping the pressure on him.”
Thirouin’s work paid off, and he won the third set 6-3, giving Harvard its second victory of the weekend.
HARVARD 7, LOUISIANA 0
The Crimson started the weekend on a strong note with wins at all three doubles positions against Louisiana (11-8) on Friday. Tao and Yeung swept at first doubles, Peters and Thirouin at second doubles, and Morrow and Weber managed to edge out their opponents in a tiebreaker at third doubles.
On the singles side, Harvard continued its dominance across the ladder. Tao made quick work of his opponent in a 6-2, 6-0 victory at first singles.
“I was a little shaky coming into the weekend after not doing as well as I hoped over break, and it was reaffirming and a big confidence boost to sweep this weekend,” Tao said. The California native ended the weekend 2-0 in singles play.
Thiruoin, Yeung, Zhou, and Morrow also claimed straight-set victories at second, third, fourth, and sixth singles, respectively. Solomon managed to edge out his opponent at fifth singles to give Harvard a clean sweep.
With co-captain Sebastian Beltrame still recovering from an injury and others struggling to remain healthy across the roster, the team is hoping for the best as Ivy play approaches.
“A lot of our results will depend if we can stay healthy throughout,” Tao said. “Going into Ivies, I think we have a good shot.”

UPDATED: February 28, 2017 at 11:44pm
Traveling to the Hurricane Collegiate Invitational on Saturday, the Harvard track and field team traded Boston’s gloomy weather for some Florida sunshine, and, along the way, some old personal records for some new ones as well.
The tournament, hosted by the University of Miami, saw the women Crimson sprinters having a successful showing. At the University’s Cobb Stadium, Harvard competed against the likes of Clemson, Florida, Virginia, and several additional Florida schools.
Starting off the bunch was, per usual, sophomore Gabby Thomas, the first team All-American indoor 200-meter sprinter. Thomas, this time, competed in a shorter race, taking gold in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.34. The finish was only .04 seconds off her personal record and is the fastest time in the East region for outdoor track this season. Also running was classmate Ngozi Musa, who claimed the 10th place position with a time of 11.99 seconds.
The women’s team took the top spot in the 400-meter hurdles race. Leading off the trio was senior Jade Miller, who would take the top spot on the podium with a 57.20 second sprint. Freshman Karina Joiner followed her with a 11th place finish at 1:02.71.
“It was exciting,” Miller said. “It is still super early in the season, but it was my best opener in the 400 hurdles, which makes me super excited for the rest of the season. I made a lot of mistakes, which is good, as I know there is a lot of room to improve. It's a great start to my senior outdoor season, and I am excited for this last leg of my journey in Harvard track and field.”
In the hurdle variant of the 100-meter race, the team was less successful. Leading off for the group of racers was freshman Zoe Hughes, a first time racer in the event and a second team All-American in the indoor pentathlon. The freshman took the ninth place spot with a 13.90 race, the fifth best finish in program history. Just behind her was classmate Karina Joiner who, with a 14.08 second 100-meter, finished 13th. Rounding out the group was senior Jade Miller who claimed 15th following her 14.09 second finish.
In the relays, it was again the women’s teams that shined. Starting with the 4x400-meter relay, the team made up of Hughes, Thomas, Miller, and Joiner, finished the race in fourth place, clocking the tenth fastest time in school history.
As for the 4x100-meter relay, the team finished further back, but did better relative to past results. The team, this time consisting of Musa, Thomas, Joiner, and Miller, claimed the sixth place position. However, the time represented the third fastest in school history.
The runners on the men’s side left with a couple of new personal records. In particular, in the 200-meter dash, two personal records were broken by a trio of juniors. Leading his teammates, junior Alexander Moore finished 18th, but ran a PR of 21.89. Following just behind was his teammate junior James Heckendorn. The second of the duo also set a personal best with a time of 21.91 and a 19th place finish. Adding to the mix was classmate Matt Hurst. The sprinter finished the race in 22nd and crossed the finish line in 22.19 seconds.
“For the men’s team, we’re looking to score more points than we did Indoors this season,” Moore said. “We had strong performances from a lot of our guys who competed, and were excited to incorporate a few guys who only compete outdoors with really promising numbers early on.”
In the field, it was a good day for co-captain Julian Nunally. Coming off of three gold medals in two Texas meets last weekend, the senior showed up again. For the Chattanooga, Tenn. native, it was the fourth throw that would be his lucky one. In discus, it was Nunally’s second-to-last throw of 49.20 that placed him fourth. Then competing in shot put, the co-captain tossed the shot 16.94 meters again on his fourth throw to take sixth place.
For the women’s team in the field, it was freshman Simi Fajemisin all by her lonesome. The freshman competed in long jump where she placed sixth with a 5.96-meter jump.
“We have to stay healthy and trust the process,” Moore said. “The better we do, the stronger our recruiting classes tend to be and we end up in a better position to score even more points the following year. I believe this is a critical moment in the development of the program under the current coaching administration.”

Two years removed from a self-described disappointing third-place finish at the 2015 NCAA Championships, sophomore saber fencer Eli Dershwitz returned to the individual final four after a dominant pool play effort. Two direct elimination bouts later, Dershwitz would go on to add NCAA individual champion to his already long list of athletic accomplishments.
Less than a year before, Dershwitz had been facing off against the best fencers in the world at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. This time, however, it was his opponents that would have to do so.
“As the only Olympian in the event, people thought he was favored, but it was still quite an accomplishment,” junior co-captain Eric Zhao said. “For Eli to keep his composure, keep himself poised throughout the entire competition, and win it all is a testament to how skilled he is and how well he can handle any pressure on any given day.”
After tallying six bout wins more than his closest competitor in the initial round to earn the top seed for the final direct elimination bouts, Dershwitz continued to roll, defeating St. John’s Ben Natanzon by a 15-6 cark, and then Wayne State competitor Ziad Elsissy in the championship by a 15-10 mark.
“Eli is one of the hardest workers—he shows up to practice early, he pushes everyone as a great team leader,” freshman foil fencer Matthew Branman said. “He raises the bar for all of us, and that’s really awesome for the team.”
While Dershwitz and 10 other Harvard fencers competed for individual titles, their composite scores also added up to a team tally that was used to determine the NCAA team title. Led by Dershwitz’s victory as well as other strong performances by Crimson team members, Harvard finished fifth out of 27 schools represented, behind victor Notre Dame, Ohio State, Columbia/Barnard, and Princeton.
“Two schools qualified 12, but we were one of three or four schools that qualified 11 [fencers],” Zhao said. “So already right off the bat, it looked like we should have finished top five or six…. I think this is a good finish to the season that we can build upon going into next year.”
“The team is very young overall, and this is a good building point,” Zhao continued.
Missing from the individual title winners was women’s co-captain Adrienne Jarocki, who just missed qualifying for the women’s saber final four despite a 15-8 pool play record and had to settle for sixth-place. A two-time NCAA saber title winner, Jarocki finishes her Crimson fencing career as its first and only two-time title winner and a second team All-American as a senior.
In men’s foil, the freshmen duo of George Haglund and Branman finished their strong first seasons with 15-8 and 10-13 pool play bout records, respectively. Joining Dershwitz in saber was freshman Erwin Cai, whose 13-10 record in pool play was good enough for a 12th-place finish.
Sophomore Albert Chien, competing in the national round of NCAAs for the first time, narrowly missed the final four, tallying a 14-9 record and a plus-12 indicator to finish seventh in the 24 person pool.
On the women’s side, sophomore saber fencer Gabby Tartakovsky finished with a 7-16 record, while junior and senior foil fencers MacKenzie Lawrence and Hali Nelson finished in 21st and 22nd, respectively. In epee, sophomores Shawn Wallace and Sharon Ra finished in 20th and 22nd, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their first four games, Radcliffe Rugby allowed exactly zero points while scoring 112 of their own. Most would consider that domination, and most would expect them to win the tournament.
But on a chilly and wet Saturday, Quinnipiac handed the hosts of the Crimson 7s tournament a 22-10 defeat in the Cup championship game that one would guess felt much like the weather. Harvard, however, came off the field in resolute fashion, snatching the positives from the moist air.
“It was our first tournament so we weren’t really sure what to expect, but I thought that our team played together really well,” senior Claire Collins said. “We played the way we know how and with a lot of good communication, a lot of good passing, a lot of good tries, a lot of nice tackles.”
HARVARD 10, QUINNIPIAC 22
After seeing little resistance from opposition in the team’s first four games, the Crimson came out of the gate putting up little resistance of its own in the tournament final. Quinnipiac brought a level of play befitting of its title as two-time defending Division 1 national champion, outclassing the Harvard squad.
The Bobcats controlled the game from the opening possession and punched in its first try just three minutes into the game. The team failed all its conversions in the first half, but nonetheless controlled the game by notching two more scores, including one try driven in as time expired in the first half. It was apparent that the Crimson’s defense had simply not seen offense reaching Quinnipiac’s quality.
“I think that defense is the type of thing that until you get in the game you do not appreciate how hard it is, and now that we’ve gotten a taste of that I think we are going to work really hard to keep improving our defense,” Collins said.
This theme of adaptation was apparent even as early as the second half. Harvard freshman Robyn Besse knocked in a try to start off the period. On the ensuing kick-off Quinnipiac got pinned deep in its own zone and the Crimson’s improved defensive posture was able to absorb Quinnipiac’s fast ball movement and tight cutting, leading to a turnover. With 15 yards to the end zone, Harvard had the opportunity to jump back in the game with enough time to potentially complete a comeback.
But a fumble shortly after led to a long Quinnipiac march to the end zone and the effective ending of the game—the time lost hurt just as much as the converted try.
The theme of the tournament, however, was looking at the positives. Sophomore Caitlin Weigel created such a moment by punching one in as match time expired, leaving a good taste in Harvard’s mouth.
“To go out and to finish a last minute try like that was really wonderful, and I’m really, really proud of this team,” junior captain Maya Learned said. “I can’t wait to see where it’s going.”
HARVARD 12, WEST CHESTER 0
After punching in a quick converted try, courtesy of Weigel in the first two minutes of the match, Harvard and West Chester found themselves in a war of attrition. Much of the first half was taken up by procedural problems with uneven throw-ins and rucks. Freshman Delia Hellander almost struck with a 60-yard run, but was stopped just short of the end zone. The ball was fumbled out the back to close out the half.
This Cup semifinal game was perhaps the best example of the development that the Crimson went through during the one-day tournament, facing the biggest offensive threat so far. After the break, the Golden Rams had an extended period of possession deep in the Harvard territory. West Chester seemed primed to level the game at seven apiece, but a strong stand by the Crimson allowed the team to gain possession and seal the game with a last-minute score by Collins.
This finishing flourish was orchestrated in large part by one of only two seniors on Harvard’s active roster. It’s no coincidence that Collins was the one to bring her best after emerging from a trying situation.
“Our seniors are super special this year,” Learned said. “They’re the very first ones that went varsity and have been varsity throughout [their tenure at] the program. So they started out the program and they put it on the right course and we’re really proud of them. And this is the last tournament that they got to play at home, which is a really special thing…. Each and every one of them is just a really wonderful person and I’m going to miss them terribly.”
HARVARD 29, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE 0
Although this game was the third straight shutout of the weekend, it was probably the most impressive. Facing the Yellow Jackets, who made the National Semifinals last fall in 15s, the Crimson stifled the western Mass. team defensively while racking up the tries with its speedy players.
This 20-game tournament opened the season for Harvard, allowing them to face a smattering of different skill levels as it prepares for more intense tournaments later in the season. An added bonus was that inherent within a tournament set-up was the opportunity to play tougher competition as the day progresses and the players get their legs planted. The Crimson’s exemplary play came after playing two more developmental games.
“15s to 7s is always a weird transition,” Learned said. “With 7s it’s hard because there’s a lot more pressure on the individual just because there are seven people covering such a large amount of space, but I think that everybody on the team has stepped up and is doing a great job.”
HARVARD 35, SACRED HEART 0
Serving effectively as Senior Night for the Crimson’s seniors, most of the attention was focused on the people who transformed Radcliffe Rugby into a varsity sport. While there are still distinct elements of its club past (Harvard sings songs at the end of games to the opposing team), its varsity status was apparent as well.
With the addition of recruitment into the games, the element of youth is strong. Underclassmen scored all seven tries in this game, putting the team in a comfortable position early in the match.
Melding these cultures of excellence and tradition is an ongoing process, as is binding as a team.
“Every weekend for the next four weekends we’re going to be traveling, playing in tournaments, playing a lot of the same teams which will be good so we can gauge our improvement,” Learned said. “It’s going to be a test for sure, but I think that we are going to do really, really well this season.”
HARVARD 36, NEW HAMPSHIRE 0
This morning game was less about the overpowering performance from the Crimson and more about the significance that surrounded its playing.
This was the first formal 7s rugby game played on Roberto A. Mignone Field since it was inaugurated last fall. The new field was built as the women’s rugby program was formalized. For some, the playing ground is the physical manifestation of the labors inputted into the long transition process.
“This is our field and we’re so honored to have it,” Collins said. “Knowing the amount of work that I’ve put in over four years, then seeing both my friends and family members recognize that, and then also seeing how much our team has improved just means a lot. It means that the work we are putting in is paying off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning from its West Coast road trip, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team dominated both of its games in Pennsylvania over the weekend. On Saturday, the Crimson (10-9, 0-1 CWPA) defeated Mercyhurst 15-4. The next day, Harvard again cruised to victory, winning 17-6 against Gannon.
“I was happy with this weekend. We scored 32 goals this weekend, which is great,” coach Ted Minnis said. “Our offense really woke up, which is what we’re going to need in this stretch coming up here.”
NO. 20 HARVARD 17, GANNON 6
On Sunday, picking up right where it left of the night before, the Crimson defeated Gannon (6-10), again winning by a double-digit difference.
Harvard made a definitive statement in the second quarter, scoring no less than nine times in the period. The Crimson displayed confidence from the opening minutes and opened up the lead after holding just a one-goal advantage out of the first quarter.
Harvard’s defensive powerhouse also shined to complement the offense. The Crimson defense held Gannon scoreless in the third quarter, recorded 17 steals, and senior Eela Nagaraj set a career high with five swipes.
Leading the offensive charge, senior attacker Michelle Martinelli matched her career-high with five goals, and freshman Mathilde Ribordy set a personal best with four goals.
Six other players also contributed goals to the team-effort win. The 17 total goals scored mark the second time Harvard has tallied 17 goals in a single game. The Crimson’s first 17-goal game was on Feb. 12, also a win against Gannon.
“This weekend was really a dress rehearsal for our upcoming conference games,” sophomore Kristen Hong said. “It was a good chance to solidify and work on the improvements that we made to both our offense and defense.”
NO. 20 HARVARD 15, MERCYHURST 4
Playing against Mercyhurst (3-11) on Saturday evening, ten different Harvard players scored to lead the Crimson to a decisive 15-4 win.
From the opening minute, Harvard dominated the game. In the first half, Hong and senior Zoe Osborne led the Crimson with two goals. Their goals were joined by tallies by sophomore Haley Bowe, Nagaraj, junior Sami Strutner, and freshmen Sofia Carrera-Justiz, Lana Gorlinski and Ribordy, to secure Harvard an eight-goal lead at halftime.
In the second half of the game, freshmen Angie Varona, Ribordy, and Julie Harrison each found the back of the net, extending the Crimson’s lead. Late in the game, Osborne scored once more to collect her first hat trick of the season.
Both junior Cleo Harrington and sophomore Sam Acker saw time in goal, which, along with overall strong defense, kept Mercyhurst to four goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a sweep at the hands of South Florida last weekend, the Harvard baseball team rebounded by taking three of four from Army West Point in Cary, N.C. Though the Crimson (10-8) dropped the first game of the series due to a wild walk-off, it proceeded to score 39 runs over the last three games to take the series from the Black Knights (8-15).
The three straight 11-5, 11-4, and 17-9 victories mark the first times Harvard has scored in the double digits since its season-opening wins on March 3.
“Any time that we can get three wins on a weekend is a positive weekend,” said senior shortstop Drew Reid, who went 8-for-18 in the series. “It’s good to get the kinks out now and be able to fire on all cylinders going into Ivy League play.”
The Crimson will look to continue its hot hitting as it matches up against Holy Cross at home on Wednesday before starting Ivy League play next weekend.
HARVARD 17, ARMY 9
Harvard put up seven runs in the first two innings and scored in nothing but three and four-run bursts thereafter, coming out on top of a 31-hit combined slugfest between the two teams. When the dust settled, the Crimson took the victory, 17-9, on Sunday afternoon. Harvard’s 16 hits and 17 runs are both season highs.
Sophomores Patrick McColl and Patrick Robinson led the way, as Robinson hit 3-for-4 out of the cleanup spot as the designated hitter, and McColl went 4-for-4 with three runs scored and three RBI’s. All told, seven different Crimson batters drove in runs for a season-high 13 team RBI’s.
“We were attacking a lot of fastballs,” McColl said. “We’ve been complacent a lot this year, but we were getting after it today and it definitely showed on the scoreboard—guys were lacing balls everywhere.”
Sophomore Kevin Stone was the beneficiary of the outpouring of run support, getting his third win of the season after going five innings and giving up four earned runs. Army starter Sam Messina was knocked around in just 1.2 innings of work, giving up five runs, walking four Harvard batters, throwing a wild pitch, and being hurt by an errant throw to first.
HARVARD 11, ARMY 4
After splitting the first two games, the Crimson routed the Black Knights, 11-4, on Sunday morning to give Harvard the series lead. Though Army punched in two runs in the top of the first, the Crimson went to work in the top of the third: its hot bats led to Harvard scoring in every inning the rest of the game.
“It’s huge coming off of Florida, where we didn’t quite put it all together,” said Reid. “The bats are really clicking—we definitely have a lot of work to do in other facets of the game, but right now we’re hitting pretty well.”
The Crimson’s 14 hits in just seven innings were a precursor to the afternoon game’s 16 hit-outburst; the team didn’t seem to miss a beat in the break between its games Sunday. Reid collected two hits and drove in two runs, while McColl led the team with three hits. Robinson, captain Josh Ellis, and leadoff man Ben Skinner all had multi-hit games as well.
Sophomore righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson went the full seven innings, gave up two earned runs, and struck out six Black Knights for his second win of the season.
HARVARD 11, ARMY 5
Junior Noah Zavolas threw seven innings of three-run ball, the middle of the order produced on a consistent basis, and Harvard once again put up 14 hits in an 11-5 victory over Army on Saturday night.
Freshman right fielder Jake Suddleson had a breakout day at the plate, hitting 3-for-4 with a walk, three runs scored, and three RBI’s. The rookie also stole a base for good measure. Robinson, hitting one spot before him, likewise garnered three hits and three RBI’s.
The Crimson stole three bases on the game, putting pressure on opposing pitchers and continuing the merry-go-round of Harvard runners. Skinner swiped his team-leading fifth bag of the season, while Suddleson got his first.
“A bunch of guys were running around, we did a good job bunting with the ball,” McColl said. “Overall, we did a good job [on the basepaths] this weekend.”
ARMY 8, HARVARD 7 (NINE INNINGS)
After a scoreless first three innings, the Crimson jumped out to a 4-3 lead after four, but subsequently let the lead and victory slip after Army tied it in the seventh and forced extras. A wild ninth inning in which Harvard scored three in the top half but allowed a four-run bottom half capped off an 8-7 defeat for the Crimson, temporarily extending its losing streak to five games.
Army senior Alex Dickerson lifted a walk-off sac fly into center off Harvard freshman righty Grant Stone to bring home the winning run.
Crimson starter junior Ian Miller once more went the distance, throwing seven innings, giving up four earned runs on two Black Knight homers and an RBI single, and striking out seven. On the offensive side, Reid and Ellis combined to go 5-for-6 at the back end of the order.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grit. Determination. Whatever you call it, it’s a value that the Harvard women’s lacrosse team considers essential.
Indeed, head coach Lisa Miller said in an earlier interview that two of the most important things she looks for from her team are “psychological toughness and persistence.”
Those intangible qualities were on full display Saturday, as the Crimson (5-3, 2-0 Ivy League) outlasted Columbia (5-4, 1-2 Ivy) in a scrappy, back and forth contest at Harvard Stadium to win, 10-8. The victory marks the team’s fourth game this season that has been decided by two points or fewer.
“Our kids scrap and hustle,” Miller said. “If shots are not falling we lean on our ride and defense. There are many ways to be successful in this game if your trust each other and play as a team, this we proved on Saturday.”
Although the final result was a successful one for Harvard, it did not come easily.
The Crimson got into repeated foul trouble, committing 34 infractions, its second-highest total for a single game this year. Columbia only posted 25.
Harvard also had its least efficient offensive performance of the season, scoring just 28 percent of its 36 shots. Tellingly, the Crimson failed to convert on any of its three free position chances, while the Lions scored on two of their five opportunities.
However, Columbia only mustered 17 total efforts on frame, and Harvard capitalized early on its shots advantage. Senior attacker Marisa Romeo scored with a rip to the bottom corner less than three minutes into the first half.
The Lions didn’t take long to respond, though. Columbia found the back of the Crimson net just over a minute after Romeo’s opening goal to level the score at 1-1.
Although the Lions didn’t take the lead once, they would make sure that Harvard was never comfortable in its advantage, tying up the contest twice more over the course of the afternoon.
Nonetheless, the Crimson’s persistence paid off in the end, as Harvard overwhelmed Columbia in nearly every statistical category. The Crimson outdid its opponent in turnovers, draw controls, and clear percentage.
The Lions did top Harvard in saves, with Columbia junior goalkeeper Kelsey Gedin registering 14 stops, twice as many as the Crimson, but the barrage of Harvard shots proved too much for the Lions netminder.
It was Romeo in particular who caused trouble for Gedin and the Columbia defense.
The Syracuse, N.Y., native fired off eight shots throughout the game and her proficiency in front of the opposition net, particularly in the second half, proved decisive for the Crimson.
Romeo racked up a game-high four goals and two assists on the day. She also scored all three of Harvard’s goals in the second period to quash the Lions’ comeback attempt.
“Marisa made big plays when we needed her to, which really helped deflate Columbia’s momentum,” tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey said. “We wanted her to have the ball; we trust her when it’s in her stick.”
The Crimson had gotten to halftime in a reasonably secure position, leading 7-5.
After Columbia tied the game at one apiece early on, tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon scored twice, once with an astonishing behind-the-back shot from outside the crease.
Junior midfielder Julia Glynn and junior attacker Eliza Guild each found the back of the Columbia net as well to stretch the Harvard advantage to 5-3, but the Lions scored two quick goals to even the scoreline once more.
Glynn handed the lead back to the Crimson, receiving a pass from Romeo and beating the Columbia keeper with a shot fake, before sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee netted a goal to send Harvard into the break ahead by two.
The second stanza would be defined by the Crimson’s gritty defensive play and Romeo’s attacking ability.
Columbia exploded out of the gates after the restart, as Lions junior attacker Victoria Kalamaras scored twice in less than 10 minutes to drag her team level for a third time.
It was after Kalamaras’ second score that Harvard picked up its game, limiting Columbia to just five shots for the remainder of the closing period and preventing the Lions from registering a single effort on goal in the final 10 minutes of the game.
Meanwhile, Romeo took over. First, the senior beat a Columbia defender with a quick cut and beat Gedin at the top corner, pulling the Crimson back into the lead. She went on to net another just over 30 seconds later, sneaking a low blast into the goal from distance to stretch the score to 9-7.
Romeo’s third goal of the game completed her sixth hat trick of the campaign, but the senior wasn’t finished.
After the Lions pulled the game within one point with another goal, senior defender Marina Burke capitalized on a Columbia turnover and found McMahon in the middle of the field. McMahon picked out Romeo, who slashed home a shot to complete the 10-8 scoreline with just under eight minutes remaining in the contest.
Harvard managed to see out the rest of the game, causing five more Lions turnovers and completing three clear attempts before the final whistle.
“I have to give Columbia credit, they have had close games with good teams and are playing good defense,” Miller said. “Their midfielders were very gritty and all over the field yesterday, [but] we played great defense the whole way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team has collected just about every accolade possible this season.
The Crimson completed an undefeated dual campaign, won the regular season Ancient Eight title, and brought home a 24th Ivy League Championship Meet crown.
This week, Harvard added another accomplishment to its collection, finishing 27th at the NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships, held in Indianapolis, Ind. The team also picked up three All-America honors, its highest total since 2005.
“Winning Ivies and scoring more points at NCAAs then we have in years definitely exceeds my expectations for this season,” senior Max Yakubovich said. “I'm incredibly proud of the team, and I know there's more in store in the coming years.”
The Crimson’s 24 points saw the team conclude the meet as the highest-scoring Ancient Eight competitor by a wide margin. Cornell was the next-closest finisher with 7 points, good for 35th place, with Penn and Yale rounding out the Ivy League field as the meet’s 39th and 42nd-best programs, respectively.
However, the true value of the competition for Harvard was getting the opportunity to test its abilities against opponents it doesn’t normally face. The opposition included the top programs in the nation.
“Whenever we come to NCAAs, we're reminded of the caliber at which some of these teams perform,” Yakubovich said. “It's a great experience to compete against them, and I'm excited to watch the guys as our team becomes more and more of a national presence.”
This year, the Crimson can count one of its own among the ranks of the nation’s top swimmers.
Freshman Dean Farris wrapped up a standout debut season for Harvard by collecting two All-America honors, including first team distinction in the 200 freestyle.
The awards capped a campaign in which the rookie has smashed countless records and won nearly every race he’s entered. In February, Farris earned the Phil Moriarty Award, presented to the highest-scoring swimmer at the Ivy League Championships. As he helped to guide the Crimson to its first Ancient Eight title since 2014, the freshman broke six program records.
One of the previous-best marks to fall to Farris was the 200 freestyle. The first-year smashed the pool, program, and meet records in the event, clocking in at 1:31.56. That mark was the fastest in the country and the sixth-fastest in collegiate history at the time, making Farris the top seed in the event heading into NCAAs.
However, the first-year could not replicate his time from Ivies at the national championships, touching the wall in 1:32.25 in the finals for fourth place. Farris finished behind Texas sophomore Townley Haas and Indiana junior Blake Pieroni and USC junior Dylan Carter, who tied for second in a dead heat.
All three of the athletes who bested Farris competed at the 2016 Olympic Games, and Haas and Pieroni each won a gold medal in Rio in the 800 freestyle relay and 400 freestyle relay, respectively. Haas also won the 200 free at last year’s NCAA championships and holds the NCAA, American, and U.S. Open records in the event, although his winning time of 1:30.65 this year was two-tenths of a second off of his personal best.
Despite the world-class quality of his opposition, Farris kept his composure.
“I was definitely nervous going into the meet and before my races, but once I got into the water it was time to race,” Farris said. “It was an experience racing in that type of atmosphere.”
His fourth-place finish earned him first team All-America status, making him the first Harvard swimmer to receive that distinction since Alex Meyer `10 finished 14th in the 1650 freestyle at NCAAs in 2010.
“Dean had an amazing meet,” senior Aly Abdel Khalik said. “To step up and race the fastest guys in the country is by no means an easy task, especially as a freshman. Coming in fourth behind three Olympians only speaks to the bright future he has in this sport.”
Farris would also collect a second All-America honor, finishing 14th overall in the 200 backstroke to earn the title of honorable mention All-American. The first-year is the first Crimson swimmer to be named All-America in two individual events since Geoff Rathberger `08 in 2008.
Farris’ time of 1:39.99 in the prelims of the 200 back also broke the previous school record in the event.
The freshman would pick up a third All-America honor as well, racing to a 14th-place finish in the 800 freestyle relay along with sophomore Brennan Novak, senior Jack Manchester, and Abdel Khalik. The lineup’s time of 6:17.26 demolished the previous school record by more than two seconds and earned the squad honorable mention All-America distinction.
Novak would also race individually in the 500 and 1650 freestyle events. The sophomore finished 23rd in the 500 free before ending up in 20th place in the 1650 free.
Harvard would crack the top-20 in 200 freestyle relay too. Farris, Yakubovich, and Manchester teamed up with junior Steven Tan to touch the wall in 19th in the event.
The 400 freestyle relay lineup of Tan, Farris, Yakubovich, and junior Ed Kim had a strong showing as well, finishing 23rd overall with a time of 2:52.93.
Despite the team’s success, the Crimson is already thinking about next year.
“Watching the fastest guys in the country break records makes us more excited to see what we can do in the next season,” Abdel Khalik said. “This was a great year for us and we plan to keep the ball rolling in these upcoming seasons.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traveling to New Hampshire, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team got back to its winning ways, doubling up Dartmouth, 14-7.
The win snapped a three-game losing streak after the Crimson (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) started the season 4-0. Harvard led in almost every statistical category at Scully-Fahey Field in Hanover, New Hampshire. The Crimson has now won five of its last six meetings with the Big Green (1-6, 0-1 Ivy), and leads the overall series 48-39-1.“I thought that the team came out with a lot of energy, and we really imposed our will on them right off the opening whistle,” head coach Chris Wojcik said. “I thought that we executed really well—scored goals right out of the gate, and built a lead. Overall I thought we executed in every phase—goalie, defense, clearing, face off. On offense we really moved the ball well, and capitalized on our scoring chances.”
Harvard limited Dartmouth to 11 successful clears on 18 attempts. Dartmouth’s 61 percent success rate on clears was the lowest the Crimson ride has forced in any game this year.
“Probably the biggest positive of the day was our riding,” Wojcik said. “Our players gave great effort. A big part of riding is just effort and hustle. Our attack did a really good job of getting back and taking away the short stick options. In the midfield I thought we were aggressive at the right times to step up and force turnovers. Overall we did a really good job as a riding unit.”
Junior attackman Morgan Cheek had his way with the Big Green’s defense, scoring four goals of his own and assisting on four others. Harvard’s offensive star certainly returned to form Saturday afternoon.
“I thought Morgan made the players around him better,” Wojcik said. “I thought he was very unselfish, and he moved the ball really well. When it was time for him to dodge, or shoot, he did a really good job of being opportunistic…He had a great game making his teammates better.”
Freshman middie Nigel Andrews had his first multi-goal game of his career, scoring two goals on as many shots. His classmate, attackman Ryan Graff set a career-high with four goals.
Harvard’s man-down unit had an outstanding game, holding Dartmouth scoreless on seven extra-man opportunities, while the Crimson surrendered only seven goals Saturday evening, tying a season low.
After a tumultuous stretch of three games, Harvard looks to have regained momentum heading into Wednesday’s matchup against No. 9 Albany. The Crimson defense will have its hands full with the No. 1 scoring offense in college lacrosse—the Great Danes average 16.5 goals per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team finished in sixth place out of 21 teams in this weekend’s tournament held at the Furman University Golf Course. Fresh off last week’s spring break trip to Florida, the Crimson traveled back to the south on Wednesday to meet warm weather and competitive opponents in Greenville, S.C. The 48th-annual Furman Intercollegiate, hosted by the Paladins, ran from Friday morning through Sunday afternoon.
The five members of Harvard’s team that made the trip qualified for their spots in last week’s scrimmage against Lynn University. Representing the Crimson were Greg Royston, Kendrick Vinar, Seiya Liu, Robert Deng, and Aurian Capart.
“Coming off a long winter and only a week of being on grass prior to the tournament, many of us were rusty,” Liu said. “Despite this, we had a good idea of what our strengths and weaknesses were going into the event. That most definitely was a result of the work we put in during spring break and of our resiliency in the face of tough conditions.”
Harvard faced a field of competitive opponents on the links in Greenville. Among the teams participating were nationally-ranked Clemson, USC Aiken, Furman, Presbyterian College, USC Upstate, Western Carolina, Akron, Dartmouth, Gardner-Webb, James Madison, Samford, Virginia Tech, Wichita State, Chattanooga, Francis Marion, Georgia Southern, Marshall, Temple, West Virginia, and Wofford.
The three-day event, 54-hole tournament was held at an on-campus location. The course, which measures at 7,004 yards, played at par-72 for the weekend.
The Crimson completed the first round tied for seventh place with USC Aiken. Harvard finished the first 18 holes 1-under par with a combined score of 287. The Crimson improved to sixth place overall after the second day of play. The team posted a score of 286 on Saturday.
“I’m pleased,” junior Royston said. “For the first tournament of the season, I think we had really good results.”
Harvard completed the final day of the tournament with a score 289 to secure a top 10 position on the leaderboard. The Crimson finished the event at 2-under, one stroke behind Wofford. Tied at third place overall were Chattanooga and Georgia Southern. USC Aiken placed second behind 14th-ranked Clemson. After shooting 12-under par in the second round, the Tigers held on to win at 29-under par.
Clemson senior Carson Young led the Tigers to their fourth consecutive tournament victory. Young tied his career low round on Sunday to medal first. The South Carolina native shot a 70 on the opening day of play, followed by a score of 68 and 67 through the final 36 holes.
Harvard’s efforts were led by an impressive performance by senior Vinar, who shot 9-under par through the first round. The Chapel Hill native tied for ninth place at six-under with Jackson Bishop of Western Carolina. Vinar’s top-10 finish came against 127 other participants from 21 different schools. He is currently ranked fourth in the Ivy League, averaging a score of 71.73.
Also leading the Crimson was senior Deng who tied for the 14th spot on the player leaderboard. The Calif. native finished at two-under with a score of 214. Deng came into the spring season ranked among the top three players in the Ancient Eight conference.
“Kendrick and Rob played really well,” Royston said. “They executed everything, committed to everything, and had good results.”
Sophomores Liu and Capart completed the tournament with identical scores in each round. The two shot a 72 Friday, before shooting a 74 in each of the next two rounds.
Royston, who is currently ranked second in the Ivy League with an average score of 71, finished the tournament at plus-six. The South Africa native shot a 76 on Friday and a 73 in the final two rounds.
“This event has taught us a lot about what we need to practice going forward to prepare for our next events and Ivies,” Liu said.
The Furman Intercollegiate was the first of just three tournaments that Harvard will compete in during their spring season. The team will travel to the Princeton Invitational in two weeks before battling for the Ivy League Championship at the end of April.
“I think that everyone thought that they probably didn’t have quite their best stuff this week, but that’s to be expected,” Royston said. “We’ll keep doing the same thing for the rest of the season and just keep preparing as best we can, and hopefully the results come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first match since returning home from an undefeated trip to California, the Harvard women’s tennis team fell to No. 41 William and Mary on Sunday morning at the Murr Center. The narrow 4-3 defeat was the team’s third consecutive loss to the Tribe (8-9, 2-1 Colonial Athletic Association) and cut short the Crimson’s eight-match win streak.
“It was a super exciting match, a thriller to the the very end,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “I’m really proud of the way our gang fought out there.”
It was a close contest from the very beginning, as the Crimson (12-6) split its first two doubles matches. Captain June Lee and sophomore Erica Oosterhout notched a 6-4 win in the first doubles position, improving to 13-8 on the season. The third doubles pair of sophomore Sabrina Xiong and junior Annika Ringblom was unable to follow the lead of Lee and Oosterhout, falling 6-3 to William and Mary’s junior Cecily Wuenscher and freshman Natalia Perry.
“This was really good preparation for the Ivy League season,” said Green, commenting on the narrow loss and the back-and-forth nature of the day’s matches. “Every match is going to be close, and now we’re going to be ready for that.”
The doubles point then came down to the No. 2 doubles duo of freshmen Natasha Gonzalez and Irene Lu. After tying 6-6, the pair began a long, hard-fought battle in the tiebreak, overcoming a 4-2 deficit to even things up at four. From there, the Crimson traded sets with the Tribe’s Ekaterina Stepanova and Olivia Thaler, with three lead changes before Harvard ultimately fell 10-8 in the tiebreak.
“The whole team fought really hard,” Oosterhout said. “It’s definitely difficult going into singles knowing we’re already down a point and have to win the next four matches, but we knew we could bounce back if we had to.”
The team almost did take four of the six singles matches, but came up one short against a ranked William & Mary team. In the second position, Lee battled back from a 3-0 deficit to win her first set 6-3, and followed it up with a dominant 6-2 second set, adding to her team-leading 18 victories on the season.
Gonzalez also made her presence known with a commanding 6-4, 6-2 win over the Tribe’s Lauren Goodman at the fifth position. The Crimson’s final singles victory came from sophomore Sabrina Xiong, who made quick work of William and Mary junior Maria Groener, completing her sixth win of the season, 6-3, 6-2, at the No. 6 slot.
Despite these promising victories, Harvard dropped its other three singles matches. Ringblom was defeated 6-4, 6-4 in the third singles position, squandering a 4-1 lead in the second set. Lu, who leads the team in winning percentage, was unable to add another tally for her team, falling to the Tribe’s Rosie Cheng 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth doubles position.
The result of the match game down to the first singles, with both teams coming over from the other courts to watch. Oosterhout lost her first set 6-3, but managed to win the second set 7-5 after trailing 2-0. The Tampa native mounted yet another comeback in the tiebreaker, cutting the 5-1 deficit to 5-4, but was unable to hang on in the tenth game, falling 6-4 in a close final set, the last one before Ivy League play kicks off next Saturday.
“We lost 4-3, but there’s no shame in that when everybody works hard,” Oosterhout said. “Our doubles is looking strong, everybody is playing well, and as long as we stay healthy, I think we have a good shot [to win the Ivy League].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (7-10, EIVA 4-4) rebounded Friday night after going 0-3 on a tough road visit to the Golden State two weeks ago. The Crimson dominated the Sacred Heart Pioneers (12-7, EIVA 5-3) at home in three straight sets. The match ended with set scores of 25-23, 25-12, 25-21.
Harvard appeared to find its groove midway through the match, and used its momentum to propel itself to a fourth conference victory. Upperclassman to freshman provided valuable play as strong defense coupled by aggressive offense overwhelmed the visiting Pioneers in the Malkin Center.
“It was a really good match for us all around,” coach Brian Baise said. “I think [the Pioneers] are a really good team. They had beaten us three weeks ago and they have a great defense and some guys that can really hit the ball. So I knew we had to be sharp and we were. Our setters were great, we served confidently and put the pressure on them and I felt really good about that.”
The Crimson flexed its defensive muscles, both literally and figuratively, in the second set as Harvard won by a double digit margin. After going point-for-point, the Crimson’s defense resembled more of a wall as seemingly every Pioneer attempt was blocked. Harvard collected 8.5 blocks in the second set alone.
Junior blocker Riley Moore, who led the team with seven blocks, and freshman setter Matthew Ctvrtlik, who closed the match with five blocks, led the second set defensive effort. Ctvrtlik collected three blocks for three straight points extending the second set margin to seven points. Captain outside hitter Casey White would cap off the set with two kills and three blocks as the Crimson cruised to a second set victory.
Sacred Heart would end the set with a hitting percentage of -.214 and having committed 14 errors.
“I thought we were serving and passing really well,” Moore said. “We looked really clean, especially after losing all three matches in California last week. It was good to come back and get a win in three.”
The challenging road trip to California presented Harvard the opportunity to look in the mirror and evaluate its issues. After nearly coming away with major upsets in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, matches where the Crimson were unable to sustain its leads, Harvard took the tough losses as learning experiences for how to approach future matches.
“We played a great match with Santa Barbara, and we couldn’t close, and we were good against USC and those are two top-15 teams,” coach Baise said. “Even though we didn’t get the wins I felt like we were playing some good volleyball, and I think that helps a lot. Just seeing those serves and those guys, both [teams] have really good size and I think coming back helped a lot.”
The learning experiences paid off for the Crimson, especially in the third and final set, when the Pioneers showed late signs of life. When Sacred Heart minimized errors and earned 12 kills, however, the battle-tested Harvard team responded to the momentum shift and completed the three set sweep with a strong offensive game. A kill and an ace by White for the final two points eliminated any hope for the Pioneers to mount a comeback.
The Crimson not only played with intensity, but with a relaxed demeanor of a strong and cohesive unit.
“I think that we’re really close as a team,” Moore said. “I think that spending a lot of time together off the court, building character as a unit, really helps and really shows on the court. So when we’re making big plays and having fun with each other it just helps us stay loose and focus on the game and not get too tight.”
Harvard, which is ranked fifth in EIVA standings, may make a late season push if it can take this game and build off it in the coming weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a chilly Saturday in Belleville, Mich., the Harvard-Radcliffe heavyweight crew team opened its 2017 spring season with races against No. 2 Ohio State and No. 4 Michigan. Though the Radcliffe first and second varsity eights lost to both rivals, the Black and White's third varsity boat claimed victory over its two opponents.
The weather conditions proved to be adverse with cross-tail winds ranging from eight to 15 miles per hour, but, at the same, were nothing new to the seasoned Charles River veterans. The Black and White heavyweights adapted to the tough conditions and claimed a victory with the third varsity eight boat, clocking in at 7:07.31, over five seconds ahead of the Buckeyes at 7:12.49 and the Wolverines at 7:13.11.
The Radcliffe first and second varsity eights, however, were bested by the Wolverines. Nevertheless, the margins were fairly tight. Michigan secured its victory in the first varsity eight event, clocking in a time 6:36.85 over Radcliffe’s time of 6:42.18. It again won the second eight event with a time of 6:45.53 over the Black and White’s 6:48.81.
“All crews did a great job of being adaptable,” senior captain Abigail Parker said. “The water was not always ideal, but our crews stayed calm and found ways to move the boats despite wakes, winds, and waves. Our 3V in particular had a standout performance in the afternoon, beating Ohio State in a close race.”
The Black and White first and second varsity eight raced again against Ohio State, placing second in both races in two close finishes.
In the first varsity eight race, Radcliffe with a time of 6:37.13 was less than three seconds off the Buckeyes' time of 6:34.24.  Ohio State also won the second varsity eight race less than a four second margin ahead of the Black and White—6:38.79 and 6:41.24, respectively.
“Across the board, our racing demonstrated that our team has built up some good speed this year,” freshman first varsity eight coxswain Katherine Paglione said. “We got off to a fast start for our season, producing some tight margins against some of the fastest crews in the country. A definite highlight was our 3V eight's victory over Ohio State and Michigan. In other boats, we would have liked to see more wins, especially as we led for significant portions of several races.”
Despite not claiming varsity eight boat victories, the Radcliffe heavyweights walked away from the race confident and proud in their abilities and ready for the rest of the season.
“It was great to see our training over the past year start to pay off,” Paglione said, “and I think all our boats brought great energy to the race course. As the racing season goes on, we will work on improving our ability to move through and open up margins on other boats.”
The Black and White continued to adapt to the conditions at Lake Bellevue and took second place in the first and second varsity four races. The Radcliffe Heavyweights came in second behind Michigan State with a time of 7:43.2 for the first varsity four race. The Black and White also took second in the second varsity four race with a time of 8:06.92 behind Michigan’s time of 7:36.87.
After the eights races concluded against Ohio State in the afternoon round, Radcliffe landed in second in the first and second varsity four races. In the first varsity four race, the Black and White pulled through with a time of 7:44.59 against Ohio State’s time of 7:21.18. During the second varsity four race, Radcliffe again came behind the Buckeyes.
“There are technical changes to be made, as well as racing strategies that need to be developed,” Parker said. “But it is clear that the hard work on the ergs this winter has provided us with a great fitness foundation. We are in a great position to challenge the fastest crews in the country, as we proved this weekend.”
