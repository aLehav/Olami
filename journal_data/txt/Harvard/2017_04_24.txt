After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a spring semester all-too-often characterized by wet and cold Massachusetts weather and the various stressors of school, Yardfest, an annual spring concert held in Harvard Yard, offers a welcome respite for the student body. The event is planned by the College Events Board, a student organization that works under the tutelage of the Office of Student Life to “provide college students with large-scale, free, inclusive events.” Yardfest garners considerable anticipation each year, with CEB typically announcing the headliner a few weeks in advance.
Lamentably, for reasons about which we can only speculate, the announcement of a headliner was delayed until the actual week of Yardfest, much to the hand-wringing of the student body. With three days left before last Friday’s concert, CEB announced that Dutch DJ Tiësto would be headlining the event.
For some, the announcement was exciting news; for others, it was an anticlimactic end to what seemed like a never-ending cycle of speculation and delay. Perhaps many students were unfamiliar with Tiësto’s name, even if they had been exposed to his music before. Perhaps also electronic dance music fatigue set in, with 2016’s Yardfest featuring EDM musician Steve Aoki’s cake-flinging performance.
To be fair, Tiësto is a big deal, and Harvard has a hard time measuring against a performance at the Opening Ceremony of 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens (making him the first DJ to ever perform at the Olympics). His videos have garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. Though a broader mix of Yardfest headliners might be better received in the future, we’re glad CEB booked a top-notch artist despite the pressure of an impending deadline and a restive student body.
There is, however, much more to Yardfest than the concert itself. For the past two years, it has been preceded by various upperclassman House “block parties” at each of Harvard’s four neighborhoods. These provide the opportunity for upperclassmen to interact in a more intimate and residential setting before making their way over to the festivities in the Yard.
Unfortunately, the block parties faced a slight monetary snafu this year: the Undergraduate Council expected the Office of Student Life to fully fund the tailgates, but received a request the week before Yardfest to provide partial funding. The UC eventually used $3,000 from the Grant for an Open Harvard College—intended to fund one-time events—to host the block parties.
For subsequent Yardfests, Harvard should look to not only to bolster its performers but also to give support to the student events that complement the concert. Since block parties have been so successful, we urge the Office of Student Life to allocate funds on a yearly basis for these types of events. This will ensure that the UC is not stuck with the burden of providing emergency or discretionary funds.
Yardfest is, at its best, a time for the entire student community to come together in a one-day reprieve before the onset of finals and the end of the semester. It takes place in the Yard—the nexus of Harvard College—and has the potential to promote a social atmosphere where all of the student body can come together. Amid campus-wide discussions about inclusivity in social spaces, we hope that the UC and the administration will invest more in the community around Yardfest so the event can reach its full potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember the first time I was in awe of Harvard. I had just arrived, and I was talking to my roommates as we settled into our dorms. They were and still are much more impressive than I am. One was the son of immigrants from Belgium and Taiwan—a varsity soccer player and a budding comedian. The next was the son of two Russian Ph.D.s—he could think more precisely on his worst day than I could on my best. The third was the son of Chinese immigrants, with a mind that could solve any puzzle and no ego. Meanwhile, my greatest claim to fame was that my brother gave me the middle name “Eric” in honor of Prince Eric in the  “Little Mermaid.”
I think all Harvard students have a moment when they feel “impostor syndrome”—inadequate, intimidated, and a bit lost. For me, I felt like an impostor that first day here, and that feeling has not gone away.
Despite my insecurities, I had aspirations of changing the world just like many Harvard freshmen. Personally, I wanted to revolutionize the study of American history. But I quickly realized in my first History & Literature seminar that many of classmates were simply better at history. I was lost. I did not see myself as a leader at Harvard, let alone outside of it.
Fortunately, I had a moment that gave me a sense of purpose here. My sophomore fall, my roommate encouraged me to shop a course called "The History of American Democracy”. The course changed my life because of its focus on a certain word: “citizen.” The class began an intellectual journey that would define my time at Harvard, from a summer of research for that professor to my senior thesis on citizenship education.
Through this work, I fell in love with the idea of a “citizen”: someone who contributes to a community. Someone who thinks about the needs of others as much as or even more than they think about their own. In my head, I felt was on a noble and selfless quest. But if I'm honest, I explored the idea of citizenship because it gave me meaning. Even if I could never be the leader of a field, or have the highest GPA, or land a job at the most prestigious company, I felt I could still bring value to both Harvard and the world.
Instead of noticing who achieved the most, I began to pay attention to people who contributed in less celebrated ways. I noticed the people who said please and thank you to everyone, always. I noticed the students who weren’t just willing to say, “Hi, how are you?” but those who actually stopped to listen to the answer. I noticed my peers who put their all into their chosen causes because they couldn’t imagine doing anything else. My mindset shifted: If I thought about the way my actions impacted my community, then I mattered. Then we all mattered.
Just last year I discovered the word “citizen” in the Harvard College mission. Indeed, it appears twice: to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” If my degree in History & Literature has prepared me for anything, it is recognizing that when a word appears twice in a sentence, it’s really, really important. Sadly, most of us still concern ourselves with leadership rather than citizenship.
I hope, though, that those of us who ultimately become leaders will remember to be citizens, too. I hope that we will remember those whom we serve and why we serve them. I hope we will remember to lead not for ourselves, but for something greater. Not only will our companies and communities be better for it, but we will be too.
Most importantly, I hope that those of us who do not aspire to run a company, be a senator, or create the next great innovation know how valuable and important we are as citizens. Our thoughtfulness, our curiosity, our commitment to whatever it is that we do has had a tremendous impact on everyone in our lives. As the professor of that life-changing class said, “Democracy is an organism. And engaged, committed citizens are the most important cells in that organism.” The value of that statement, however, extends far beyond democracy. We should all take pride in whatever we contribute because, without a willingness to give, we will struggle to cultivate kindness, respect, and even excellence.
At our highest moments and our lowest, when we feel most impressive and least, when we succeed and when we fail, we need to remember that being a good citizen has value in and of itself. Because without thoughtful, engaged citizens—without thoughtful, engaged people—leadership, no matter how good, is meaningless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
April can often feel like a rerun of key moments from America’s first 90 years. April 9 is the anniversary of Robert E. Lee’s 1865 surrender at Appomattox, which preceded John Wilkes Booth’s assassination of Abraham Lincoln by just five days. Last week, Massachusetts celebrated Patriots’ Day—commemorating the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775—on April 17, which this year fell a day after Washington, D.C.’s Emancipation Day, a remembrance of the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862.
In a fun coincidence for those of us who are New England sports fans, the actual anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, April 19, was also the day on which the Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots visited the White House. Under any other President, this event would have been simply another fun reminder of a miracle comeback. Instead, under current circumstances, it was a moment of cognitive dissonance.
Patriotic symbolism and sports fandom have always had an uneasy relationship in the United States. One need look no further than the vitriolic reaction to the famous black power salute of American 200-meter medalists Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics to see just how inhospitable public opinion can become when legitimate protest interrupts nationalist bombast. (It bears noting that the International Olympic Committee also condemned the athletes). Overwrought reactions to then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protests last year are a clear present-day parallel.
A silver lining to the 1968 story is that the Americans received some support from unexpected quarters. On the podium with Smith and Carlos was Australian silver medalist Peter Norman, who joined the Americans in wearing a badge representing the Olympic Project for Human Rights. And the U.S. men’s rowing team—eight white Harvard students—issued a statement in support of the sprinters.
Such solidarity was also evident in the various reactions to Kaepernick’s protest. At the height of the controversy over the 49ers quarterback, Patriots defensive end Chris Long gave a somewhat convoluted but nonetheless thoughtful defense of Kaepernick’s right to be heard. Other white NFL affiliates also voiced respect for Kaepernick’s right to protest, notably Ravens coach John Harbaugh. As for the Patriots’ White House visit, Long was one of five players—and the only non-African-American—who declared that he would be skipping it for political reasons.
One can debate ad nauseam whether refusing to stand for the national anthem or declining an invitation to the White House is an appropriate mode of protest, or whether failing to take such a stand signals complicity in injustice. What is undeniable is that the injustices prompting these actions are real and that progress against them is stagnating. The Trump administration’s policy positions grow more backward by the day on fundamental issues like police brutality and women’s rights, from Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ hostile review of Justice Department oversight of police departments to Trump’s recent signing of a bill to allow states and localities to defund Planned Parenthood.
Yet, in the face of these attacks, one portion of our body politic prefers to maintain symbolic patriotism in lieu of attending to the ideals that patriotism is meant to celebrate. Ironically, the same constellation of Trump supporters who take the greatest offense at protests like Kaepernick’s also includes people whose own use of symbolism represents a far greater attack on American patriotism than an athlete’s actions during the national anthem.
The special election for South Carolina’s fifth congressional district underscores this disconnect perfectly. All of the Republicans in the GOP primary are attempting to ride Trump’s coattails, but one—Sheri Few, whose slogan is “Make America America Again”—has one-upped them all by running an ad condemning two of her opponents for voting to take the Confederate battle flag off the grounds of the South Carolina State House in 2015. She is only one of many Trump supporters who have interpreted his election as license to fly this symbol of rebellion and hate—and who simultaneously dare to claim the mantle of true patriotism in present-day political debates.
Though a depressing development, the resurgence of the Confederate flag issue in this month of remembrance is fitting because it reminds us how the dynamics of debates over symbolism and memorialization can change with context. Just as knee-jerk appeals to symbolic patriotism can quash necessary dissent, so too can the historically illiterate flaunting of manifestly unpatriotic symbols become a rallying cry for those who would rather pay homage to a mythic past than confront current problems.
In our April commemorations of the American experience, then, we ought to be cognizant of patriotism’s many forms. Indeed, it is often acts of protest—from the stand of the colonists at Lexington to the fight abolitionists waged against slavery long before Union armies marched south—which prevent ideals of liberty and equality from giving way to unthinking complacency towards injustices fatal to the American project.

Amidst a suspenseful lead-up to the headliner announcement, Harvard College students celebrated the annual Yardfest concert Friday. Only three days before the concert, the headlining act was revealed to be Tiësto, a Grammy Award-Winning Dutch DJ. Although some students expressed concern in the days leading up to the concert over having another EDM artist following last year’s headliner Steve Aoki, and although the weather conditions Friday were rainy and colder than years past, Tiësto’s performance drew a large crowd. With original hits such as “Red Lights” and "Wasted" as well as Tiësto’s iconic DJ mixes, students spent the day partying and dancing the night away.
The rain pushed the House Committee-sponsored "Block Parties" inside, such as the one thrown by River East in Leverett Dining Hall. Students enjoyed churros, popcorn, cotton candy, fried dough, and drinks, along with free Tiësto t-shirts, before heading to the concert. 
Three hours until Yardfest begins, personnel finalize setting up the stage. Yardfest took place in Tercentenary Theater, the area of the Yard between Memorial Church and Widener Library. 

Around 6 p.m., the lines for entrance into Yardfest grew fairly long, with only a few entrances available for students. Despite the rain, students weren't allowed to bring in umbrellas but could receive free ponchos. (Photo by Kirstin E. Anderson.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 penned a Washington Post op-ed attacking Harvard’s penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social groups Friday, again calling the policy an “effort to subordinate freedom of association and freedom of speech.”
Lewis’s op-ed took issue with what he called administrators’ justification for the policy, as well as certain aspects of its planned enforcement. He argued that the “current rationale for punishing single-gender groups is that they are discriminatory,” citing a comment Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana made in a Feb. 2017 interview with The Boston Globe.
In his op-ed, Lewis, who has repeatedly criticized the social group policy, disparaged Khurana’s reasoning, referring to the Dean of the College as “a university official.”
“Problems that the policy was initially supposed to address—sexual assault, elitism, drunken parties—have fallen away under scrutiny, leaving gender exclusivity as the clubs’ irreducible sin,” Lewis wrote. “Using ‘nondiscrimination’ as a cudgel against students’ private associations is odiously patronizing.”
The College’s social group policy, set to take effect with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving certain fellowships and holding various leadership positions and athletic team captaincies. When University President Drew G. Faust first announced the penalties in May 2016, administrators framed the policy in part as an attempt to address issues of sexual assault on campus; in recent months, however, Harvard officials have shifted their public stance and now list gender inclusivity as the primary motivation for the sanctions.
Lewis’s op-ed closely mirrors language from a Faculty motion he helped introduce in May 2016, which also critiqued the policy. Lewis withdrew that motion in January after Khurana announced the creation of a faculty committee that could revise or replace the social group penalties.
Lewis also critiqued administrators’ plans to implement the penalties in his op-ed, in particular targeting a recommendation that all-female social groups receive an extended timeline to become co-ed.
“The ‘unwavering’ institutional commitment to nondiscrimination will be implemented in a curiously and perhaps unlawfully discriminatory manner,” Lewis wrote of the recommendation Friday.
In March, a committee tasked with suggesting how to enforce the College’s sanctions proposed that female final clubs and sororities be allowed to operate with a “gender focused mission” for the next three to five years. In an email to undergraduates announcing the committee’s report March 6, Khurana wrote that he planned to accept that proposal.
In its 46-page report, the committee also recommended that students who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships be required to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to “nondiscrimination” and asserting they do not belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization.
Lewis characterized the proposed oath-taking as “McCarthyesque.”
“Could Harvard today require oaths about club memberships but resist if the government required students to swear that they are lawfully on U.S. soil?” Lewis asked in his op-ed.
Lewis has been a constant and vocal opponent of the policy since its inception. He first expressed reservations about the penalties in a May 2016 letter to Khurana, warning the sanctions could have negative consequences for the student body.
Lewis has openly criticized the penalties to students in his Computer Science class, to colleagues in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Faculty Council, and to the general public in a number of posts on his personal blog.
Lewis announced earlier this year that he will retire on July 1, 2020.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overcast clouds and a rainy forecast seemed to clear Friday for some students when the beat dropped during Tiësto's performance at Yardfest.
Before Tiësto took the stage, openers Hello Cleveland and Kyle Ray, both comprised entirely of Harvard students, warmed up the audience at the College’s annual outdoor concert with covers and original compositions. Despite the weather and growing quantities of slippery mud, a dedicated group of concertgoers—several of whom brought signs—chanted their support for the opening acts.
Members of the ultimate frisbee team were at the concert early to support the three of their teammates in Hello Cleveland.
“Hello Cleveland is better than Tiësto,” Adam E. Ehrenberg ’18 said to enthusiastic agreement from the rest of the group, each wearing a light blue “Hello Cleveland” t-shirt.
“Who’s Tiësto?” interjected another fan sporting the t-shirt, to more laughter.
Tiësto, a Dutch dancehall DJ, has a long career in the electronic music industry. Since producing his first tracks in the 1990s, he has since gone on to headline multiple music festivals across the world, such as this past year’s Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Fla. After a delayed announcement from the College Events Board—which hosts Yardfest each year—students voiced mixed reactions about the CEB’s choice of headliner.
But on Friday, it was Tiësto’s set that was the main attraction for most concert-goers. As neon lights washed over the crowd, he yelled, “Are you ready?” before launching into a set of thumping remixes. Abstract graphics, interspersed with “TIЁSTO” in red block letters, flashed behind him as the crowd pulsed in time with the music.
Some students unfamiliar with Tiësto beforehand still screamed every time the bass dropped or a blast of smoke blew across the stage. His most well-known hits, “Red Lights” and “Wasted,” drew loud cheers as students danced along.
“I had not heard of him before, but I looked him up right before,” said Catherine L. Zhang ’19. “He’s the OG. He’s OG EDM.”
Many agreed that this was one of the better Yardfests in recent years.
“In my three years here, this has been the best Yardfest I have ever been a part of,” attendee Robert Rush ’18 said. “I came in looking to have a great amount of fun, and it exceeded my expectations.”
Although the weather had been a concern for some students, most found it did not detract from their experience and even added to the event.
“I love the rain because I think the light reflects so nicely off of it,” Christopher C. Higginson ’18 said.
Grant Besner, a sophomore at Duke University, agreed. “Rain or shine, sleet or hail, we are out here vibing.”
This year, Yardfest brought together undergraduates not just from Harvard but from all over the country. Even the distance and upcoming finals periods weren't enough to dissuade attendees.
Besner, visiting his girlfriend Zhang, said she insisted he join her for Yardfest. Besner said he did not regret his decision.
“Yardfest is not an event,” he said, “It’s a state of mind.”

Holding signs and singing songs, hundreds of Harvard affiliates—including University President Drew G. Faust—joined thousands of people flooding the streets of Cambridge and Boston Saturday to support scientific research in the face of potential cuts to federal research funding.
The demonstrations, which took place both on Harvard’s campus in Cambridge and in front of the Medical School in Longwood, occurred on the same day as the nationwide March for Science, a nonpartisan movement seeking to “champion robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom.”
University President Drew G. Faust gave opening remarks at the Cambridge rally, emphasizing the importance of science as a “foundation for our health, our prosperity, our possibilities.”
“We march today for a future in which the federal government supports the research and teaching essential to national and human progress,” Faust said. “We march because our future depends on the future of science.”
President Donald Trump’s proposals to significantly cut federal funding for scientific research has worried Harvard professors and administrators. In March, a University spokesperson harshly criticized the White House’s proposed budget—which could cut large portions of the Environmental Protection Agency and National Institute of Health’s budgets. Other Harvard affiliates have said they are concerned about Trump’s stance on climate change.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 spoke at the Longwood rally, while renowned Medical School professor George M. Church gave remarks at the city-wide march in Boston Common.
Hundreds, many with homemade signs and young children in tow, joined Daley at the Longwood rally, where Medical School students, patients, researchers and Dean of Students Fidencio Saldana all delivered speeches.
In his speech, Daley criticized the White House’s recently-proposed cuts to scientific research, citing examples of how federally funded research has helped save lives lost to heart disease, cancer, and HIV.
“Make no mistake. Like a slow-growing but ultimately malignant cancer, the metastasizing doubt of science will lead to harmful decisions and reckless policies,” he said.
Daley extolled the impact of scientific research and said that nearly half of new cancer drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the last five years came from research funded by National Institutes of Health.
“What is the next frontier?” said Daley, “If our nation stops investing in science, we will never know. We will never know what would have been possible.”
Amy Coughlin, the mother of an 11-year old daughter who was diagnosed with early-childhood neuroblastoma, described how new stem-cell treatments kept her daughter alive.
“That's research. It's messy and scary and completely necessary to save the people that we love,” said Coughlin. “Research is putting absolute trust and faith in doctors and scientists to cure your daughter.”
The Boston March for Science featured songs, speeches, and a children’s event. Church, recognized for his contributions to CRISPR gene editing, was among the first to speak.
“This is really great,” Church told the cheering crowd of several thousand. “This is really nerd city.”
Church urged to crowd to celebrate science funding and literacy regardless of affiliation.
“Today we show gratitude and concern for science funding and immigrant scientists from all around the world,” Church said. “Science is not optional, and we have big decisions to make and we need everyone engaged in this conversation, not just the elite.”
Welcome Bender, a medical school professor, held up a sign in the Longwood rally that read “Reality has a Truthiness All Its Own” on one side and “Reality is Not On TV” on the other. He said that he participated in the Longwood March simply “for science.”
“I think what’s really disturbing is that a large fraction of our country doesn’t think about evidence and science,” Bender said. “[This] always results in statements that cannot possibly be true.”

The proportion of Harvard’s tenured faculty who are women or people of color jumped from 30.8 percent to 39.2 percent over the past decade, according to the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity’s annual report.
The report, released on Monday, provides demographic statistics for each of Harvard’s schools and the four divisions of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. It shows sizable increases in the proportion of minority men and women among the faculty—though these gains are built on “admittedly smaller bases,” according to the report—as well as “modest to negligible” increases in the number of white female professors since 2008.
In addition to demographic shifts among tenured faculty, the proportion of tenure-track faculty that are women or people of color rose from 52.2 percent to 57.7 percent over the past 10 years.
According to Judith D. Singer, Harvard’s senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity, several policies catalyzed the demographic changes.
In 2005, FAS adopted a “tenure-track” system, a stark departure, Singer said, from the days where the University would mainly recruit “stars from afar”—or from already-established academics at peer institutions. The new system allowed the University to recruit from a younger, more diverse talent pool and provide mentorship to academics during the early stages of their careers.
“Up until 10 years ago, we didn’t do any of this. When I was hired, I was told ‘assume you will not get tenure. If you buy a house, get an adjustable-rate mortgage, because you’re not going to be here over the long haul,’” she said.
Shortly after FAS established the tenure track, the school also began granting “tenure clock” extensions—extra time before faculty must earn tenure or lose tenure-track status—for faculty who have children while working towards tenure. The school also started offering scholarships for child care.
In addition to University-wide data, the report also provides more specific numbers for women and minority faculty for most of Harvard’s 12 schools.
The Graduate School of Education boasts the highest percentage of tenured women at 48 percent, while the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences registered the lowest proportion of tenured women at 14 percent.
Women on the tenure track make up 63 percent of the Arts and Humanities division of FAS and 60 percent of the Law School. SEAS, meanwhile, also trails all other schools among tenure-track women, with 20 percent.
Minority representation across Harvard’s schools varies widely. While 28 percent of tenured Business School faculty are minorities, only 7 percent of tenured faculty at the Medical School are minorities.
Among tenure-track professors, the Divinity School and the Law School have the highest minority representation with 75 percent and 60 percent, respectively. The Arts and Humanities division of FAS trails all other schools and FAS divisions: 23 percent of tenure-track faculty in the Arts and Humanities division are minorities.
Singer attributed the differing rates of representation to problems with larger demographic trends within certain fields.
“I think the biggest source of variation in the schools is due to the pools of people who are going into the fields,” Singer said.
Singer’s office works with the various schools during their searches for new faculty members.
“I review all the tenure-track appointments in the professional schools, so there’s an accountability built in so the deans know that I’m going to be watching and I’m going to give them feedback about their reports: why is this the third white guy, and why does the short list always include one woman and she’s never good enough?” Singer said.
Singer’s office does not collect data on BGLTQ faculty trends, because it is illegal to ask employees about their sexual orientation. However, Singer said she works to support BGLTQ faculty members in the same way that she does women and minorities.
Currently, Harvard’s faculty is not growing: The number of tenure and tenure-track faculty at the University is roughly the same as it was ten years ago—1,470 in 2008 as compared to 1,483 today. Singer said anemic growth can pose an obstacle to greater diversity.
“It’s slow. Would I like to snap my fingers and say ‘let’s go hire!’ But we’re not in that position because we’re in a period of real stability in terms of size of the faculty,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council unanimously passed legislation formally establishing caucuses Sunday, six months after a similar piece of legislation was narrowly defeated last semester after weeks of heated debate.
The new legislation allows any number of UC members to form a caucus, whereas last semester’s proposed legislation did not recognize caucuses with fewer than three members.
Former UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 did not support the previous legislation, arguing creating caucuses would add complex layers to the Council.
Current UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, though, voted in favor of the caucus legislation at the time.
“The goal of this legislation is not to create a new set of powers, but rather to empower,” said Cabot House representative Christopher B. Cruz ’17, a sponsor of the legislation.
Crimson Yard representative Arnav Agrawal ’20 said he worried the legislation would add superfluous “bureaucracy” to the Council.
“What benefit do you think this formalization can do, except just adding more complex bureaucracy?” he asked.
Adams House representative Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said the new legislation allows caucuses to send a strong message to underrepresented campus groups, make weekly updates during general meetings, and apply for grants from a Grant for an Open Harvard—a $30,000 joint fund between the UC and the College.
However, Ivy Yard representative Grace S. Pan ’20 said she wondered if allowing caucuses to speak at general meetings would prolong them.
“Having ten, fifteen weekly caucus updates every week, that would prolong UC general meetings by a lot and I’m worried about that,” she said.
Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 noted that the legislation said caucuses “may request” updates, and did not have to speak at weekly general meetings.
“I hope that UC members on caucuses will be able to restrain themselves a little bit,” he said. “And give updates when they really have something to say.”
Voicing a different concern, Elm Yard representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 said he did not want the legislation to signal to others that the UC is finished recruiting diverse students to its ranks.
“I don't want people to think that it in anyway absolves us of our own obligation to go to these different communities and urge them to get on the Council themselves,” he said.
Whittaker said he agreed, and instead sees the role of causes as helping to add more diverse members.
“I think the end goal of the caucuses is in fact to increase diversity on the Council, not just to provide an increase in policy,” he said.
Sachee later read a statement from an absent Khansarinia, who urged members to vote for the legislation.
“The ability to adequately represent people of diverse backgrounds is a necessary component of any government, even in our student one. We can always be more representative, more open and accessible. This legislation is an important step in that process,” it read.
The UC also passed legislation formally giving them the right to recognize new student groups, after its Rules Committee recommended a set of guidelines to evaluate prospective clubs.

UPDATED: April 24, 2017 at 3:05 p.m.
When University Professor Danielle S. Allen received an invitation to University President Drew G. Faust’s office in November, she remembers thinking: “What had I done?”
But Faust wasn’t summoning Allen to reprimand her: she was honoring her with a University Professorship, the highest accolade a Harvard professor can receive. This position, designed for “individuals whose groundbreaking work crosses the boundaries of multiple disciplines” according to Harvard’s website, puts her in the company of Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, and former University presidents.
Although Allen arrived at Harvard as a professor less than two years ago, the James Bryant Conant University Professorship is just the latest in a string of titles she’s accumulated across the University. She is also the Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, a professor of Government and Education, a member of the Faculty Council, and co-chair of the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging.
Harvard can not seem to get enough of Allen, but the feeling was not always mutual: Allen said she turned down the University’s first offer of a professorship. During an event hosted earlier this month by the Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging—a committee convened by Faust in September to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and recommend improvements—Allen said she sometimes felt uncomfortable during her time as a graduate student in the Government department.
“I think Harvard feels a lot more dynamic now than I experienced it as being,” she said. “I’ve been blown away by the breadth and depth of quality of human capital here and the diversity of kinds of expertise and work that people are doing.”
By now, Allen—who is in her mid-forties—seems fairly at home at Harvard in her spacious Edmond J. Safra Center office. Her meteoric rise at Harvard is the latest step in a distinguished career as a political theorist and classicist. Between her positions on the Faculty Council and as the co-chair of a presidential task force, Allen’s influence at Harvard will continue to grow over course of what could be a decades-long career in Cambridge.
Before her return to Cambridge, Allen was the UPS Foundation Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Much like the University professorship, the institute’s website says its work “crosses disciplinary boundaries.”
“Danielle is a hugely imaginative scholar,” Government professor and Edmond J. Safra Center Director of Graduate Fellowships Eric Beerbohm said. “What’s noteworthy is that even in a field capaciously named democratic theory, that doesn’t do justice to her interests. If you looks at classicists, theorists of equality...they will all talk about her as someone with innate, bold, original contributions.”
Allen began her studies at Princeton, where she graduated in 1993 with a degree in Classics. From there, she went to the University of Cambridge on a Marshall Scholarship, leaving with a Ph.D. in Classics. Her first book, “The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens” was published the same year as the completed another degree, her Harvard Ph.D. in Government.
In addition to Princeton and Harvard, Allen has taught at the University of Chicago, where she was the Dean of the Division of Humanities for three years.
Allen’s other three books similarly span time periods, nations, and topics. “Our Declaration,” a philosophical analysis of the Declaration of Independence, earned Allen the 2015 Francis Parkman Prize.
She is also a teacher both within the Graduate School of Education and the Government department.
This year, she taught Gov 1060: Ancient and Medieval Political Philosophy and Gov 94CZ: From Voice to Influence: Understanding Citizenship in a Digital Age. She co-taught the latter with Government post-doctoral fellow Chaebong Nam.
“I’m really drawn to her work and I’ve really deeply committed myself to her because of her personality,” Nam said. “There are a lot of smart people out there. There are few people who are smart and a genuine person.”
As she’s continued to make advances as a scholar at Harvard, Allen has also stepped into the role of a public intellectual, penning columns and leading administrative committees.
Just last week, Allen and her colleague at the Declaration Resources Project Emily Sneff announced that they had discovered a parchment manuscript of the Declaration of Independence. Allen said it’s only the second known parchment manuscript of the Declaration ever discovered.
“From the point of view of thinking about American history, it’s significant,” Allen said.
The announcement is the second time this month that Allen’s work has been the subject of national media attention.
At the “Afternoon of Engagement” hosted by the Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging, Allen announced a competition to change the final lyric of Harvard’s alma mater “Fair Harvard” from “Til the stock of the Puritans die” to something more “open to everybody.”
While some applauded the decision, it also drew criticism from both opponents of “political correctness” and those who argued the change was not substantive. Allen said this is merely a “baby step” for the committee.
“Our report won’t come out until the spring of 2018 and we wanted to signal to people that we are serious about concrete steps,” she said.
She also affirmed that changing the alma mater served an important symbolic purpose.
“The alma mater doesn’t play a huge part in the day to day experience, but we do use it to start and finish the year and that’s important,” she said “It anchors a set of core values.”
But public controversy is not exactly new to Allen. As a columnist at the Washington Post, she has written repeatedly about the rise of President Donald Trump, prompting backlash from some conservatives. According to an article in The Guardian, Allen once considered herself a conservative, but her views have since shifted.
Beerbohm described both her teaching and leadership styles as “egalitarian.” Allen, the scholar of equality, said there is a way in which her administrative and academic roles inform one another.
“I bundle all of my research projects together under the label the democratic knowledge project,” Allen said. “Everything I do is about how to cultivate the kinds of knowledge resources a democracy needs in order to thrive.”
She added that Harvard, like the United States is a federalist system. If that’s the case, Allen plays a role at both the national and state level.
“This is the dream job,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sporting bright red lanyards and new Harvard attire, hundreds of prospective freshmen took in the sights and sounds of the College as part of this weekend’s Visitas programming.
The weekend, held annually for prospective undergraduates, began with a speech Saturday by University President Drew G. Faust in Sanders Theatre, where she welcomed admitted students and their parents to Harvard.
Later on in the weekend, admitted students—known by those around Harvard as “prefrosh”—watched a collection of musical and artistic performances at “Visitas Palooza” in Sanders Theatre, attended a dessert tasting in Ticknor Lounge, and sang karaoke in Eliot House Grille.
And on Sunday afternoon, hundreds of prefrosh crowded the Student Organization Center at Hilles for an “Activities Fair.” Colorful booths and student representatives from more than 100 student organizations lined the walls, eager to talk to prospective students about their clubs.
Noel Chou, a prospective student from California, said that meeting current students was a highlight of Visitas.
“It’s been encouraging and fun to talk to the various leaders of the different clubs because everyone’s so nice and friendly,” she said.
Jonathan Castillo, a prospective student hailing from Texas, said he enjoyed the College’s efforts to welcome prefrosh to campus.
“Everything’s been very open-arms and very accepting to everything you’ve got, and willing to make you feel at home,” he said. “That’s something I genuinely appreciate.”
Others said they enjoyed getting a taste of Harvard’s myriad of student organizations.
“It’s great that they have a little bit of everything so we can get a taste of what Harvard life is like,” Rachel Ma said, a prospective student from New Jersey.
Castillo also said he enjoyed the flexibility of the programming, which gave prospective students the freedom to choose the events that they wanted to attend throughout the weekend.
“[They’re] like here’s everything you can do, be your own person, be responsible, and they send you out. And I like that, how you can just go wherever you need to go,” he said.
However, some students, like Emily Rios from Texas, said they would have preferred more structured programming that facilitated meeting other prospective students. She said that since she was hosted by a sibling, she didn’t get a chance to meet other prospective students.
“But even when I did meet people, they wanted to do different things, so it was hard to stick with one group,” Rios said.
Menelik Epee-Bounya, an admitted student from Mass., said he thought Visitas can improve was having more social events, such as dodgeball or others games, rather than just “intellectual” events.
“It’s been fun, but not as fun as I hoped for. I found it a bit underwhelming,” he said. “Sometimes I find myself with my friends trying to find something to do and there’s a three-hour gap where we have no plans where we’re kind of just waiting around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard juniors gathered in the Science Center Sunday to reflect on past experiences, their “sense of self,” and plans for the future after three years at the College.
The event, called “Class of 2018 Reflects,” looked to gather juniors together as a class for an event that organizers characterized as one of few opportunities for the Class of 2018 to come together as a whole.
Opening the event, Liv F. Novick ’17 and Osaremen F. Okolo ’17 said they noticed a lack of class-wide programming during their junior year. This spring, Novick, Okolo, and organizers Caie C. Kelley ’18 and Berkeley Brown ’18 worked together to plan the first-ever junior reflection event for Class of 2018.
Twelve juniors—all leaders of undergraduate student organizations—and three recent alumni spoke on Sunday, with remarks on subjects ranging from sense of identity at Harvard, experiences specific to the junior year, and plans for senior year and beyond.
“It seems as if junior year is underappreciated which is surprising because we found that junior year was one of our most transformative years,” Novick said, adding that junior year is typically the only one at Harvard without a class-wide event.
The event’s speakers, who delivered remarks as prospective students toured Harvard for Visitas, all agreed that interacting with classmates has changed them for the better since arriving at the College.
“My sense of self is only at its A-game when I have leaned on other people and they have leaned on me,” said Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18.
Marcus K. Granderson ’18, incoming president of the Kuumba Singers, said he hopes to better look out for others as he enters his senior year.
“Harvard has a way of making us accidental narcissists,” he said. “Let us do as much as we can to make people feel noticed, cared for, valued and loved, and if we do that, we can more easily look back at our senior years and say there were no regrets.”
Students and alumni also emphasized the importance of appreciating the present instead of always planning for the future.
“There’s nothing more important to me than thinking through what am I doing at this present moment to live a good life,” said Phillips Brooks House Association President Leszek R. Krol ’18.
For Black Students Association President Shantell Williams ’18, pressure to think about the future characterized some of her time at Harvard.
“I realized I wasn’t truly living. I was very much focused on what I wanted to do and felt very much like the clock was ticking and I couldn’t fully take part in any one thing,” Williams said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While winning is a fantastic achievement, the ability to win again and again is what separates the good from the great. This weekend, Harvard men’s golf team made an argument for belonging in that upper echelon.
“Oh man, oh man, oh man—not again.” This sentiment, as repeated in Drake’s popular “Back to Back,” must have characterized the mindset of the Crimson’s Ivy League rivals, because for the first time ever, Harvard defended the Ancient Eight title, winning just its second championship in 42 years.
The Crimson made history this weekend. For a 380 year-old institution, this feat is quite special.
After a week of practice and intra-squad qualifiers, Harvard traveled down to The Stanwich Club in Greenwich, Conn., on Wednesday night, leaving the busy campus behind and thinking about the goal ahead—to defend the title. The program got off to a hot start on Friday and never looked back, shooting a team-wide best in the first and last rounds of the tournament
Ultimately, the team ending its season how it started—on top.
The course was in great condition, though the players did have to battle through slower greens on Friday and Saturday given the rain that had accrued earlier in the week. Blue skies and a warm sun greeted the teams on Sunday, and the greens played more favorably than they had earlier in the weekend.
The championship-winning side brought five golfers to the Constitution State: captain Daniel de la Garza, seniors Robert Deng and Kendrick Vinar, junior Greg Royston, and sophomore Aurian Capart. Of the five who won last year’s championship for the Crimson, four travelled to Greenwich in this year’s edition, with the experience of Capart, de la Garza, Royston, and Deng paying dividends.
According to players, though, It was the team’s mentality that proved decisive.
“We were the most prepared team with the right mindset,” Capart said. “The course is a difficult one, but given our strategy, I think we were best setup to succeed by our coaches. We played smart, always setting ourselves up to miss to the right if it came to that. If you miss left in the wrong spots you are dead. We weren’t necessarily playing our ‘A’ game, but given our strategy, we were still able to get the win”.
A few players stood above the rest. De la Garza shot a 72, 72, and 73, which gave him the second-best score of the weekend at one-over-par, three shots behind Cornell’s Mike Graboyes.
“Daniel played unbelievable, staying in there and finish[ing] really strong” Capart said. “As a captain and senior, he led the team so well, and had a great mindset. It has been a pleasure to call him a teammate”.
Royston finished fourth overall with a score of +2 and saved his best for last, raking in a course-wide best two-under on Sunday, the final day of competition. Royston and de la Garza both received all-Ivy honors.
Deng and Vinar achieved top-10 finishes at sixth and tenth, respectively, and Capart, after an uncharacteristic blip in the second round, finished 21st with a strong score of +1 in the final round.
Winning the Ivies means that the Crimson must now prepare for regionals, but not without some time off for celebration. Repeating the feat from last year, with so many of the same players, was a massive achievement for a team that continues to grow.
De La Garza, Vinar and Deng all graduate next month, and the team will miss their leadership and mentorship. But for now, their Harvard golf careers are still alive, just like the fate of this team.
While the senior class still has some more golf to be played, it is already a historic bunch in the history of the program. The three seniors have won two Ivy League championships, have been selected to two All-Ivy teams and one PING All-Northeast Regional team.
“Given our performances throughout this spring season, we knew we had the tools to win the Ivy League,” de la Garza said. “But of course, it all hinged on this tournament, and you never know what will happen. It was great for us come through it all as winners. Repeating with this group of guys has been a truly special experience.”
The victory was the second for six of the eight members of Harvard’s team, but it was also number two for Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads. Winning Ivy championships is nothing new for the fifth-year head coach, but winning them on the men’s side is. Rhoads has coached the Harvard women’s team for the last 13 seasons, leading the squad to seven Ivy championships in the process. While the men’s team played in Greenwich, the women teed off in Orlando, Fla., where they placed second.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though its run through the Ivy League slate hasn’t been the most successful, the Harvard baseball team is still fighting hard and winning games as the season winds down.
The young team is committed to having fun and play relatively loose, and taking three of four games on a trip to Murray Stadium in Providence, R.I. this past weekend certainly helped.
The Crimson split Saturday’s doubleheader with Brown before sweeping Sunday’s two games to improve to 16-20 on the season and 5-11 in conference play. The Bears (12-21, 5-11 Ivy League), meanwhile, have now lost 10 of their last 13 games and are tied with Harvard and Princeton for having the worst conference record.
“It was great to take the series win from Brown,” freshman relief pitcher Kieran Shaw said. “We definitely have to feed off this momentum in the midweek game. It’s also going to be a big weekend against Dartmouth, so we’re looking forward to it all.”
HARVARD 7, BROWN 6 (11 INNINGS)
The Crimson squandered a 6-2 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth, but Shaw stopped the bleeding after Brown tied it at 6-6, and sophomore outfielder Trent Bryan hit a go-ahead solo shot in the eleventh inning to give Harvard the series win.
“Trent really crushed that ball to left-center,” sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl said. “He was struggling a little earlier on in the weekend but then really found it…it was huge to get a big win like that for us.”
A 2-1 game in the Crimson’s favor turned into a higher-scoring affair as McColl hit his own three-run bomb in the eighth to give his team a 5-1 lead. Closing out the game, however, wasn’t so straightforward for the bullpen, as Brown’s managed to score four in the ninth. Sophomore starter Kevin Stone tossed eight innings of two-run ball to keep the Bears in check and left with a no-decision.
“Kevin gave us a great outing—unfortunately, I didn’t have a great first inning out there,” Shaw said. “But after that…I threw well and hit my spots. The last inning, I just got in a groove, and I always have my defense behind me making plays.”
Shaw struck out the first two batters in the bottom of the eleventh and induced a game-ending flyout to secure the win for Harvard.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
Sophomore righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson struck out a career high 11 batters in six innings of work and held Brown to just one earned run in the Crimson’s 4-3 win over the Bears in the Sunday opener. Eight of the first nine outs were strikeouts of Brown batsmen.
“[Simon] was really feeling his stuff early on,” McColl said. “They just couldn’t hit him.”
Senior captain Josh Ellis, sophomore outfielder Patrick Robinson, and sophomore outfielder John MacLean all had multi-hit games to pace Harvard’s offense, which put up 11 hits on the game.
Shaw pitched a scoreless final inning for his second save of the season.
The final frame wasn’t without some oddities, however—with Brown down 4-1, the home team made a bid for a comeback with three straight walks to open the inning. After a sac fly and a double brought home two runs to make it 4-3, an error turned into a double play after the Bears runners were thrown out from right field. The final two outs, despite the error in right field, thus ended the game.
BROWN 7, HARVARD 3
Freshman second baseman Quinn Hoffman went 3-for-4 and Robinson hit his Ivy League-leading eighth homer of the season, but the Crimson offense couldn’t muster up a comeback after Brown put up six runs in the third inning, and the visitors ultimately fell in the Saturday nightcap, 7-3.
Robinson took a 1-1 pitch over the left-center field wall for a two-run blast in the first inning. The Melbourne, Fla. native also upped his RBI count to 32 on the season and still has a batting average over .400.
Junior righty Noah Zavolas and freshman reliever Grant Stone split duties on the mound, each pitching four frames, but two Harvard errors led to Brown’s game-defining crooked number in the third inning. In addition to the charity outs, the Bears got four straight hits off Zavolas at one point, and the big damage came on Brown senior Josh Huntley’s two run homer.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
Junior righty Ian Miller regained his early-season form with a complete-game, seven-strikeout performance over seven innings to lead the Crimson to a 3-2 win over Brown in the series opener. Miller tossed 109 pitches, with 71 of them coming for strikes.
The team did its part to support its starter, pushing across three runs in the second inning to spot Miller an early 3-0 lead. Harvard also committed no errors in the field.
McColl got the offense jumpstarted in the second with a double to right center off Bears starter Christian Taugner, and MacLean followed with an RBI single to right. McColl ultimately went 6-for-14 with three runs scored on the weekend.
Fellow sophomore Ben Skinner and captain Ellis followed with RBI singles to keep the runners moving and extend Harvard’s lead to three. The Crimson offense was also helped by a wild pitch, two passed balls, and a walk in the inning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A number of times this season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team has been on the wrong end of comebacks. The Crimson surrendered a four-goal lead late in its game against Stanford in March and weathered a late push from Dartmouth earlier this month.
On Saturday, it was Harvard’s turn to mount a comeback attempt at the end of a contest. After No. 10 Pennsylvania (12-2, 5-1 Ivy League) held the Crimson (8-6, 4-2 Ivy) scoreless for two-thirds of the second period, Harvard exploded for four goals in eight minutes, including two in the final 30 seconds of the matchup.
The team’s efforts would not be enough, though, as the Crimson’s hopes of stealing a win were derailed by foul trouble and the opposition’s staunch defense. In the end, the Quakers held on for the victory at Harvard Stadium, edging out Harvard, 13-10.
“I thought we hustled really hard today and played with a lot of emotion,” tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon said.
With nine minutes left to play in the game, the Crimson found itself down by five goals to Penn. Harvard had kicked off the second half with a quick goal to take the lead, as sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee found the back of the net less than a minute into the period. Her finish handed the Crimson a 6-5 advantage.
However, the Harvard lead would last less than 30 seconds. Quakers junior midfielder Alex Condon netted the second of her game-high four goals with 28:39 remaining in the second half to level the score at six apiece.
Condon would go on to complete her hat trick just over a minute later, handing Penn the lead that it would not relinquish for the remainder of the game. The junior midfielder’s third goal on the night would kick off a 5-0 run for the Quakers.
By the 10:45 mark in the closing half, Penn had turned a one-goal deficit into an 11-6 advantage, and the game looked to be all but over for the Crimson.
The Quakers’ potent offense, highlighted by Condon’s four goals along with the three scores and two assists for senior attacker Emily Rogers-Healion, played a crucial role in securing Penn’s five-goal lead.
However, the Quakers defensive unit was even more instrumental. Penn entered the contest with the fourth-best scoring defense in the nation and the top goals-against average in the Ancient Eight.
Quakers senior goalie Britt Brown was critical to her team’s defensive success. Although the Crimson fired off the same number of shots as Penn over the course of the game, Brown’s 13 stops helped the Quakers hold on for the win. The senior netminder is ranked second in the country for save percentage (55.8%) and fourth nationwide for goals-against average (7.55).
Despite Penn’s stifling defense, Harvard finally managed to break through with a goal from freshman midfielder Katie Muldoon after the Quakers kept the Crimson off the board for 20 minutes of the second period.
Muldoon’s finish narrowed the margin to four, and although Rogers-Healion picked up two goals before the final whistle, the momentum was with Harvard in the closing minutes of the game.
MacAfee picked up a second goal with three and a half minutes left on the clock, and both she and senior attacker Marisa Romeo would complete their hat tricks in the final 30 seconds of the contest. First, Romeo beat a defender with a roll dodge before slotting a shot into the top of the net for her third score of the game, before MacAfee completed her hat trick on a free position conversion with 22 seconds remaining.
The first half was a different story entirely. Harvard started the game firing on all cylinders, and by the sixth minute of the contest, the Crimson was leading, 4-0.
Muldoon opened the scoring with a close-range finish in the first 30 seconds, and Romeo snuck a low shot past Brown less than a minute later to double the advantage. With Penn on the back of its heels, McMahon picked up two quick goals to stretch Harvard’s lead to four points. The senior stole the spotlight with yet another highlight reel finish on her second goal, slotting home a low, underhanded shot with her back to the net.
After McMahon completed her brace, the Crimson’s struggle with fouls began to cost the team. Harvard would commit 17 infractions in the first half and 39 over the course of the game, and seven of Penn’s goals came from free position chances.
Four of the Quakers’ free position conversions came in the opening half, accounting for nearly all of Penn’s five goals in the half. The Quakers’ first score of the game came after a Crimson foul, and though Romeo got one back two minutes later, Penn would close out the half with a 4-0 run. Three of the unanswered goals came from free position opportunities, as the stifling Quakers defense kept Harvard off the board for the final 15 minutes of the opening frame.
Although Penn ended up capturing the victory, the game was still a special one for the Crimson’s six seniors. The matchup marked the final home contest for Romeo, McMahon, defenders Robyn White, Marina Burke, and tri-captain Emma Ford, and tri-captain midfielder Emma Ford, who were honored in a senior day ceremony.
“I love this senior class,” head coach Lisa Miller said. “They have a great work ethic, care for each other, and genuinely celebrate the successes of others. We are competing with the top teams in the country now [thanks to them].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After rattling off four-consecutive victories to start the season, Harvard’s second-straight postseason bid was firmly in the cards. However, a tumultuous stretch of eight games have since cast doubt on the team’s playoff hopes.
The storm clouds that have loomed over the Men’s Lacrosse team since falling to Penn State on March 11th followed the Crimson to New Jersey, where chilly temperatures and rain provided a gloomy atmosphere for competition.
On Saturday afternoon, No. 17 Princeton (9-4, 4-1 Ivy) officially dashed Harvard’s chances of clinching an Ivy League Tournament berth. The Crimson (5-7, 1-4 Ivy) now sits in sixth place in the Ivy League, ahead of only Dartmouth.
As it’s done many times this season, Harvard drew first blood, as junior attackman Tim Edmonds dodged, somewhat uncharacteristically, from the top of the box, and weaved his way in front of goal to put the Crimson up one. Princeton responded with three goals of its own, including senior Gavin McBride’s first of his career-high seven goals on the day.
The Tigers were never able to pull away, as Harvard kept within striking range throughout. Freshman midfielder Nigel Andrews scored two goals on Saturday, matching his career high. In his past three games, Andrews has scored five times. Junior midfielder, Joe Lang, also scored twice on the afternoon, extending his goal-scoring streak to eight games.
Harvard suffered a characteristic lull in its scoreless second quarter, but conceded only one goal in those fifteen minutes, and the Crimson entered the halftime break trailing 4-2. Harvard’s scoring in the first 30 minutes of play marked its lowest output of the season.
The Tigers opened the second half with a streak of three unanswered goals, creating a cushion it would carry to up until the final horn.
Harvard’s toughness kept the game close, as the Crimson dominated the ground, going 13-21 on faceoffs, and finishing +9 in ground balls against the Tigers.
Princeton managed to hold junior attackman Morgan Cheek to one score on four shots. Cheek, a master distributor of the ball, added two assists, and has tallied at least one helper in every game this season.
So far this season, Harvard has been outscored 133-136. The Crimson has played in tightly contested games in all but one matchup this season, a 13-8 loss at Brown, in which Harvard faced its largest deficit of the year—down six at one point in the third quarter. Harvard has turned the ball over 174 times to opponents’ 186, and holds an even 3-3 record on the road. These statistics tell a partial story, but certainly do not point to a 1-4 campaign in the Ivy League.
On the contrary, a few Harvard’s stats are indicative of a winning percentage below its current .417. Faceoff wins have been few and far between during Harvard’s 2017 season. In its wins, the Crimson has won 45.1 percent of its faceoffs, as opposed to 33.5 percent in losses—a significant drop-off. Coming into Saturday’s game, Harvard’s 36.4 overall win percentage ranked last in the Ivy League, and 67th in the country, ahead of only Hampton and High Point. Untimely woes at the X have plagued the Crimson this season. Harvard has also struggled to protect its home turf, as it has compiled a 2-4 record at home on the season.
Despite being eliminated from postseason play, the Crimson’s season is far from over. Harvard welcomes its rival Yale on Saturday at 2 p.m. at Harvard Stadium. No. 11 Yale (8-4, 50 Ivy) most recently fell at No. 5 Albany in a 13-12 thriller after winning seven straight. The Crimson will look to play spoiler, as the Bulldogs look to complete their first undefeated Ivy League regular season since 1956. Yale boasts a 62-37 record against Harvard, and won both meetings a year ago.
Few opportunities remain to positively spin Harvard’s 2017 campaign, but a win at home against the Bulldogs would send this year’s youth-laden team home on a bright note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All good things must come to an end, and for the women’s golf team it was the five-year reign over the Ivy League that finally concluded on Sunday.
The group, traveling Orlando, Fla., for the Ivy League Championship hosted at the Orange Tree Golf Club, finished the weekend in second behind Princeton. The Tigers outplayed Harvard by 31 strokes and dominated the individual field. Princeton lead in every single round of golf and had only one golfer finish outside of the top seven. All three top individual spots went to Tiger golfers with another finishing in seventh and their fifth player in 31st.
The Crimson, rounding out the tournament with a total of 58 over par, had all but one player in the top 12 spots. In fact, three Harvard golfers tied for 12th.
“The team definitely did our best with the things under our control and following our process as usual,” sophomore Anna Zhou said. “Especially with what has been a challenging spring season with most courses being closed due to a late winter, everyone worked hard and played their best. The course was a lot of fun to play, albeit challenging and narrow.”
While the loss comes at the end of a five-year win streak, the result was previewed at the April 1 Harvard Invitational. The Crimson women’s team came in third out of the eight teams, falling behind both Princeton and Boston University. The Tigers also won gold on that weekend. In that invitational as well as this weekend’s conference championship, Harvard outshot Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Yale, and Brown.
For the team rankings, things stayed pretty consistent throughout. While the Crimson and Princeton maintained their respective second and first rankings though all three rounds, with Yale remaining in last the entire competition as well, only the middle four teams experienced any variation. After the final putt, Columbia and Pennsylvania would rank third and fourth, respectively, and Brown and Dartmouth would tie for fifth.
Through the second round, the matchup was pretty close between the top two finishers, though the Tigers would pull ahead in the third. At the end of one, Harvard trailed Princeton by only six. That deficit would increase to 15 after the second round of play, and more than double in the third.
From an individual perspective, the Crimson struggled most in the second round of play. Sophomore Michelle Xie led the team group initially and was battling for the the first round spot with the Tiger’s Amber Wang. At the end of one, Xie had shot a 72 to Wang’s 70 and was in prime position to grab the lead. However, a second round score of 85 would drop her 11 spots in the individual ranks and subsequently bar her from a top position for the remainder of the tournament.
“The course this weekend was tough, and our team performed just as we normally do,” Xie said. “We came in second this year, after Princeton's incredible performance. As for my own experience, I had many bad breaks and swing problems throughout the second round, but played well the first and last rounds.”
Other than Xie, captain Anne Cheng gave the top spots a run. In the first round, the senior shot a 76 and was ranked at ninth. Cheng then shot a team best, along with classmate Nina Fairbairn, 75 in round two. The play jumped her up three spots to sixth, within contention of the top spot. A third round score of 81, however, dropped the captain six spots to 12th, where she would tie with two other Harvard golfers.
“I'm happy with how the team played,” Fairbairn said. “It was a tough course and we've been suffering from illnesses and injuries. For my rounds, it was making sure the tempo on my swing was good. The first day, because of how tight the course was, I had many penalty strokes, even though I played well. The next two days, I just continued to play well and stick to what I knew.”
Zhou also neared the top mark before failing to make a run in the final round. Starting off the competition with a round of 77, the sophomore was tied for 11th as she took to the course for the second time that day. Like Cheng, Zhou found herself up three spots, in eighth, after shooting a 76 on the par 72 course. In the last opportunity to jump into individual medal contention, Zhou shot a 78 and dropped a spot. In spite of this, the sophomore still picked up the top finish for the Crimson, tied for ninth with a total score 231.
Xie, Cheng, and Fairbairn all tied for 12th with scores of 232. Freshman Ji Hae Lee shot a 243 to finish in 24th overall.
“Ivies is always such a fun tournament to play in, and we can't thank the Orange Tree golf club staff for letting us all play there,” Xie said. “It's the first time the tournament has been outside the Northeast, so having warm weather was a great change. Our season is now officially over and we will miss our seniors Anne and Nina.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading down to Stanford University for the Cardinal Classic, the Harvard track and field team proved no record is safe, nearing Ancient Eight record marks and breaking school records throughout the two-day meet. In addition, several teammates remained in Boston on the weekend, traveling down the street to the Sean Collier Invite at MIT.
With two weeks until the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, the group has only a single weekend to prepare before their make or break divisional championship bout.
CARDINAL CLASSIC
Doing just as well on the west coast as they tend to do on the east, the group of Harvard sprinters had a standout weekend. Leading off for the team was the women’s 4x100-meter relay team, which grabbed the gold in their event. The quartet, finishing in 44.87 seconds and ahead of both Florida State and Colorado, now holds the second fastest time in the history of the conference.
Sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomas racked up yet another gold medal on the weekend, though not running her trademark 200-meter race but the shorter variant, finishing the 100-meter in 11.39 seconds. The first place finish is Thomas’ second in the event this season. The Indoor National Championships qualifier didn’t stop with just that single gold. Thomas achieved a silver in long jump with the furthest jump in program history, marked at 6.27 meters. The winner of the event, Jogaile Petrokaite of Florida State, landed only .03 meters in front of Thomas and fouled on the other five of her jumps. Freshman jumper Simi Fajemisin rounded out the group finishing third with a 6.15-meter leap. Coincidentally, before this weekend, that jump would have also broken the school record.
Another gold-medalist for the women’s team was senior Jade Miller. The veteran finished the 400-meter hurdles in 57.43 seconds, nearly 3 seconds ahead of her closest collegiate competitor, Eriana Henderson of Colorado, who crossed the finish line at 60.13. In the men’s variant of the event, freshman hurdler Jacob McLennan posted a time of 53.19 to just miss a medal, finishing in seventh place.
In the women’s 100-meter hurdles, freshmen Livia Gauntlett and Karina Joiner both achieved personal records. Joiner finished fourth and Gauntlett sixth. The times represent the sixth and ninth best in Harvard history, respectively, and are both in the top-15 times in Ancient Eight history.
“There is an abundance of talent in the team and alongside the great work ethic, we have the ability to perform competitively through until the Ivy League championships in May,” Guantlett said. “We must not become complacent, but this season should be an exciting one.”
For men’s co-captain Julian Nunally, the day was one of all bronze. The senior grabbed third place in both the shot put and discus throw. In the former, Nunally tossed the shot 16.88 meters on his fifth throw of the day. Freshman teammate Gunnar Allison also earned a medal in the event with sixth place finish and a throw of 14.04 meters. In discus, the co-captain grabbed his second bronze medal of the weekend with a toss of 52.46 meters, placing behind two Florida State throwers.
The men’s throwers weren’t the only group of men’s athletes racking up top-three medals for the team, the jumpers contributed their fair share. In triple jump, co-captain Efe Uwaifo mirrored his classmate and took a bronze medal of his own. In his second jump on the day, the senior leaped 15.36 meters to finish less than a meter behind both of the Florida State jumpers that placed ahead of him. Freshman Donagh Mahon broke his own record in a season best jump of 2.08 meters in the high jump. The leap earned him a fourth place finish in the event.
SEAN COLLIER INVITE
Just a couple miles from their dorms, another group of Harvard athletes braved the inclement weather at the Sean Collier Invite, hosted by MIT, to compete on Saturday.
Bagging two silver medals, the group did not leave the meet empty handed. Headlining for the team was junior middle distance runner Jonas Aranda. Taking on the 800-meter dash in a field of 39, Aranda crossed the line in second place with a time of 1:54.30. The finish was only .26 seconds behind the gold medalist, Connor Murphy from Merrimack. Behind Aranda was teammate, freshman Zach Manickas-Hill. The freshman claimed the sixth place position after completing his two laps in 2:01.34.
The second silver came at the hands, or feet rather, of sophomore Garret Rouser. Running in the 400-meter hurdles, Rouser finished his second place race in 57.05 seconds.
From here, the entire track and field team looks towards the Heptagonal Championships. The women’s team will compete for their fourth consecutive outdoor Ivy League championship while the men look to improve on last year’s sixth place finish. At the Indoor Heptagonal Championships
“The main difference from indoor and outdoor for field events is that indoor season is a preparation for the outdoor,” said Nunally, who placed fourth in shot put at the indoors. “Once we get to outdoor season, we change our lifting plan so that we are ready to make big throws.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

They’re too young. They can’t win the doubles point. They can’t stay healthy. In the first month of the season, it was easy to find holes in the play of the Harvard women’s tennis team.
On paper, the 2017 campaign may have seemed like a rebuilding one for the Crimson. Coach Traci Green was welcoming seven freshmen to a team that had won just two Ivy League matches last season. Its most experienced player—captain June Lee—had battled injuries during her first three years in Cambridge.
When the team traveled to Ohio State for ITA Kick-off Weekend in January, Harvard was trotting out a sophomore at its top singles spot and flanking her with three first-years. Highly-touted freshman Lexi Milunovich went down with an injury in late January and would miss two months. In doubles action early on in the season, the Crimson looked inexperienced at some points and straight up outmatched at others.
Harvard topped foes BU and Cornell early in the season but suffered a 4-1 setback to a Brown team that it would face again eight weeks later. The pieces were in place and the talent level was evident early on, but the team did not put it all together as a group until when it mattered the most.
Flash forward to April and No. 49 Harvard (17-8, 5-2 Ivy League) entered the final weekend of conference play with a chance to win its first Ivy League Championship since 2009. Eight weeks after falling to Brown at ECAC Championships, the Crimson topped the Bears in Providence on Apr. 7 to move to 2-0 in league play. Following a 5-2 win against Princeton (13-9, 4-3) on Saturday, Harvard clinched a share of the Cherly and Richard Gouse Trophy.
“It’s been an incredible experience and journey,” Lee said. “Before I even came here, one of my goals was that I wanted our team to win Ivies. It’s just an amazing feeling because I feel like [our] hard work has really paid off. As a senior, I feel like I’ve made somewhat of an impact on the team and the program and my teammates individually.”
With a chance to win the title outright, Harvard fell to Penn, 4-3, on Sunday. The Crimson will share the championship with Cornell and Dartmouth, with the Big Green receiving the conference’s automatic NCAA Tournament bid by virtue of its victory over the Quakers (11-9, 4-3) on Saturday. It will be a waiting game for Harvard until May 2, when the field for the tournament is announced by the NCAA’s selection committee.
PENN, 4, HARVARD, 3
The Crimson entered Sunday afternoon’s match controlling its own destiny. If Harvard beat Penn, it would have the Ivy League crown all to itself and would punch its ticket to the Big Dance. If not, it would have to share the title depending on what happened in the day’s other three matches. The Quakers, who were mathematically eliminated from the championship race, did not look like a team that had nothing to play for.
“It’s so amazing to think that so many of our matches were 4-3 in the Ivies,” Green said. “We’re just so proud to be in a league that’s so strong and getting better every year. We hope to build on what we started this year. We enjoy playing in a tough league, it makes us tougher.”
For the second day in a row, the Crimson took the doubles point, but this time its opponent rallied back. The guests were eliminated from championship contention following their loss to Dartmouth on Saturday but came out firing to rain on the Harvard parade once singles play began. Lee and sophomore Erica Oosterhout claimed a doubles win at the No. 1 position and sophomore Sabrina Xiong and junior Annika Ringblom clinched the doubles point at the third spot.
The day’s first two singles points went to the Quakers as freshmen Jenna Friedel and Irene Lu both suffered straight set defeats. Friedel’s came at No. 4, falling to Penn junior Lina Qostal, 7-5, 6-1. Lu came up short against sophomore Marta Kowalska. With the Quakers leading 2-1, Lee fittingly tied the match at two with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Ria Vaidya at second singles. It was the last home match of Lee’s four-year career with the Crimson.
Harvard’s postseason hopes rested on the day’s final three matches. If the team could salvage two, it would be NCAA Tournament-bound. Unfortunately for the Crimson, Penn had other plans. After dropping a first set that went to a tiebreaker, Milunovich conceded the second to freshman Ashley Zhu. The win put the Quakers up a set with two matches to play. Oosterhout and Ringblom both had their matches go to third sets. Oosterhout dropped her first set to Penn senior Kana Daniel, the nation’s No. 105 player. The Harvard sophomore took a back-and-forth second set as her teammates and the Harvard fans cheered her on. Oosterhout rode the momentum to a 6-4 win in the third set to tie the match at three.
As their matches taking place simultaneously, Ringblom and Oosterhout went in different directions. The Harvard junior overpowered Penn freshman Sarah Dreyfuss in the first set and had a chance to put her away for good in the second. Ringblom held a 6-5 lead in the second set but was unable to hold on, falling 7-6 in a second set tiebreaker. Dreyfuss pulled away in the decisive third, winning six of the nine games and opening the door for the rest of the Ivy League.
“Penn had nothing to lose and we have to give them credit for how tough they were,” Lee said. “Being a point down and coming back all the way, you definitely have to give them credit. They played all-out, with nothing to lose and it came down to one match. They were the tougher team today.”
HARVARD, 5, PRINCETON, 2
Harvard’s most lopsided win of conference play came in what was the team’s most important match to date. Needing a victory to clinch at least a share of the Ivy League crown, the Crimson roared to a sweep in doubles and never looked back. Freshman Natasha Gonzalez and Milunovich took all six games in their match against Princeton’s Gaby Kollner and Sivan Krems while junior Annika Ringblom and sophomore Sabrina Xiong clinched the all-important doubles point with a 6-3 win over Clare McKee and Katrine Steffensen.
“Going into Princeton, everyone was really pumped,” Lee said. “The weekend before was really motivating. Our really close match with Cornell made us work even harder during the week. We knew exactly what we had to do.”
Milunovich and Ringblom were both able to carry their momentum from doubles action into singles. Playing at No. 3, Milunovich topped fellow freshman Tiffany Chen, 7-6, 6-1. It was a bounceback win for Milunovich, who dropped both of her singles matches last weekend in New York. It took Ringblom three sets to dispatch Krems at fourth singles but the New Canaan, Conn., native remained perfect for the day.
Oosterhout and Lee made it a sweep at the top four spots for Harvard with wins at first and second singles, respectively. Oosterhout handed Steffensen her second loss of the afternoon, 7-5, 6-2. Lee followed suit at No. 2, topping fellow senior Caroline Joyce in straight sets. The Crimson’s only hiccups on the afternoon came at fifth and sixth singles. Freshman Irene Lu fell in straight sets to sophomore Nicole Kalhorn while her classmate and former doubles partner suffered a setback in an epic three set affair, ultimately falling 3-6, 7-6, 11-9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2017, at 10:20 p.m.
In sports, long hours of practice come down to fleeting moments upon which the entire season is judged. For Harvard women’s rugby, the team’s conference performance came down to a 14-minute game against rival Dartmouth.
Coming off a pool play loss against the Big Green in Hanover, N.H., the Crimson executed a second half comeback in a low-scoring affair to claim its second consecutive 7s rugby Ivy League championship.
HARVARD 10, DARTMOUTH 5
Facing off in competitive matches against Dartmouth was nothing new. Last fall, the Crimson fell to the Big Green in the 15s Ivy championship.
On Sunday, perhaps the most important thing that helped the Crimson to victory was a belief that the team could win. This belief, combined with the desire for vengeance, fueled Harvard.
Just two weeks ago, the Crimson beat Dartmouth 24-0 in the Brown 7s Tournament, providing confidence that its Ancient Eight foe was beatable. The win especially showed that Dartmouth’s defense was vulnerable and that points could be scored quickly by Harvard, which was looking up at a five point deficit with seven minutes to go in its Ivy league season.
“After Dartmouth scored the first try in the championship game, we all looked at each other and something clicked,” sophomore Caitlin Weigel said. “We realized this isn’t happening. We are not going to lose this game.”
The Crimson capitalized on the positives by converting a team try just minutes into the second half using sustained pressure in the offensive zone.
“We knew that possession would be key, that the team that could hold on to the ball the majority of the game would probably come up with the win,” senior Claire Collins said. “We really focused on getting our support there really quick, making sure that we weren’t taking any risky offloads, that we weren’t running into contact first so we always had teammates with us.”
Punching in the score gave Harvard the lead and a chance for its defense, which the team has emphasized throughout the season, to shine. The iron wall held up and eventually led to a penalty kick, which junior captain Maya Learned converted to cap off the conference championship.
HARVARD 22, PRINCETON 19
Playing against Princeton for the first time in the 7s season, the Crimson exploded out of the gate by scoring three tries to begin the game. Harvard seemingly controlled the entire game, asserting its dominance as a varsity team playing against a club program.
However, the game ended up being a wake-up call to the experienced squad because Princeton came roaring back as the Crimson relaxed.
“In the final minutes against Princeton, we gave them a lot of space and played a little soft on defense and they were able to get through the holes and put good stiff arms on us and find the try line,” Collins said. “That just kind of reminded us how important being aggressive at the point of contact and in the defensive wall would be and I think that we brought that experience into the final.”
DARTMOUTH, 12, HARVARD 0
Despite the reassuring win two weekends ago in Providence R.I., Harvard faced off against a much-improved team this weekend, which gave the program an early pool play scare.
“We saw that they were not there to mess around,” Weigel said. “It definitely got our butts in gear.”
The two teams butted heads early in the game, but Dartmouth broke through first to take half on top. The game was still up in the air for much of the second half, but Dartmouth converted a late try to take the victory.
“Dartmouth came out really, really strong,” Collins said. “They had improved a lot in the last two weeks since we had last seen them. So they kind of took us by surprise and I think that we just gave them too much space on attack and they were able to make us pay.”
But the game turned out to be a wake-up call that allowed the Crimson to find its identity and helped them perform well in the bracket.
“We came out of the game with a really clear idea of what we needed to do to kind of flip the scoreboard in our favor and make really intentional adjustment for Princeton in the semi-final and then again playing Dartmouth in the final,” Collins said.
HARVARD 45, PENN 0
Playing against a lesser opponent, Harvard had its play dominated by underclassmen. Normally influential players, like freshman Delia Hellander, who scored four tries, filled up the score sheet. But the support staff for the normal starters was different.
“We started out the tournament with Columbia and Penn, which were two really good teams to get a lot of our players in who needed experience or were somewhat new and get them playing time to see what the depth of our team could do,” Weigel said.
As a team with both recruited and walk-on athletes, experience in high-level games helps a great deal in development of the entire team. Instead of claiming a blowout win with starters, which would not help development very much, the Crimson challenged its depth players to grow and adapt.
HARVARD 29, COLUMBIA 0
The first faceoff of the tournament proved little resistance for Harvard. This rang true throughout, with several early tries, leading to a 19-0 first half lead. A couple additional tries in the second period put the game out of reach.
The tournament was less about the points scored and more about the level of play in general.
“This weekend we really utilized playing to our strengths and that’s something that as we go into this next week, our last week, we’re going to remember,” Weigel said. “And for Varsities, it won’t matter who we are playing. Our main goal this season was to win Ivys and to be the best Ivy League team. And so with Varsities we have nothing to lose. We can go out there and play our hearts out and leave it all out on the field because there’s nothing after it. So there is no holding back this weekend.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Dartmouth had defeated Harvard two weeks before the 7s championship. That same version misstated that captain Maya Learned is a senior. In fact, she is a junior.
